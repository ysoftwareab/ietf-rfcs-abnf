     Abstract  

        The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to 
        Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS traffic 
        engineered (TE) control plane to a GMPLS control plane. An 
        appropriate migration strategy can be selected based on various 
        factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, 
        customer demand, available network equipment implementation, 
        operational policy, etc.

        In the course of migration, several interworking cases may exist 
        where MPLS and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. During the 
        migration process, standard interworking functions are needed to 
        allow graceful deployment of GMPLS technologies while keeping 
        existing IP/MPLS networks unaffected. 

        Since GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are different from the 
        MPLS control protocols, in order for MPLS and GMPLS to interwork, we 
        need mechanisms to compensate for the differences between MPLS and 
        GMPLS. This document provides a landscape of techniques, practices 
        and an overview of interworking between MPLS and GMPLS in support of 
        IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration, which is also beneficial for graceful 
        deployment of GMPLS technologies into existing IP/MPLS networks. We 
        discuss issues, models, migration scenarios, operation, and 
        requirements.

     1. Introduction 

        MPLS to GMPLS migration is the process of evolving an MPLS-TE-based 
        control plane to a GMPLS-based control plane. 

        There are several motivations for such migration and they focus 
        mainly on the desire to take advantage of new features and functions 
        that have been added to the GMPLS protocols but which are not present 
        in MPLS. 

        Although an appropriate migration strategy can be selected based on 
        various factors including the service provider's network deployment 
        plan, customer demand, available network equipment implementation, 
        operational policy, etc, the smooth transition mechanism should be 
        investigated from the consistent operation of GMPLS networks, while 
        less impacting the operation of existing MPLS networks.  

        In the course of migration, several interworking cases may arise 
        where MPLS and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. Such cases may 
        occur as parts of the network are converted from MPLS protocols to 
        GMPLS protocols, or may arise if a lower layer network is made GMPLS-
        capable (from having no MPLS or GMPLS control plane) in advance of 
        the migration of the higher layer network.  

        This document examines the interworking scenarios that arise during 
        migration, and examines the implications for network deployments and 
        for protocol usage. Since GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are

        different from the MPLS control protocols, interworking between MPLS 
        and GMPLS networks or network elements needs mechanisms to compensate 
        for the differences. This document provides a framework for MPLS and 
        GMPLS interworking in support of migration from IP/MPLS to GMPLS by 
        discussing issues, models, migration scenarios, operation and 
        requirements. Solutions for interworking MPLS and GMPLS will be 
        developed in companion documents. 

        Note that both MPLS and GMPLS protocols can co-exist as "ships in the 
        night" without any interworking issue. This document addresses 
        interworking to allow migration from MPLS to GMPLS. We should also 
        note that, in this document, a MPLS control plane means a MPLS-TE 
        control plane (RSVP-TE [RFC3209], IGP-TE [RFC3630] [RFC3784]), and 
        not a LDP-based control plane [RFC3036]. This document does not 
        address the migration from LDP controlled MPLS networks to G/MPLS 
        RSVP-TE at this moment, but may consider it in the future version. 

     2. Conventions Used in This Document 

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

        In the rest of this document, the term GMPLS includes both packet 
        switch capable (PSC) and non-PSC. Otherwise the term "PSC GMPLS" or 
        "non-PSC GMPLS" is explicitly used. 

        The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology introduced 
        in [RFC3495]. 

     3. Motivations for Migration 

        Motivations for migration will vary for different service providers. 
        This section is only presented to provide background so that the 
        migration discussions may be seen in the context. Sections 4 and 5 
        illustrate the migration models and processes with possible examples. 

        Migration of an MPLS capable LSR to include GMPLS capabilities may be 
        performed for one or more reasons: 

        o  To add all GMPLS capabilities to an existing MPLS PSC network. 

        o  To add a GMPLS network without sacrificing the existing MPLS PSC 
           LSR implementation. 

        o  To pick up specific GMPLS features and operate them within an MPLS 
           PSC network.

     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        o  To allow MPLS capable LSRs to interoperate with new LSRs that only 
           support GMPLS. 

        o  To integrate multiple networks managed by separate administrative 
           organizations, which independently utilize MPLS or GMPLS. 

        o  To build integrated PSC and non-PSC networks where the non-PSC 
           networks can only be controlled by GMPLS since MPLS does not  

        operate in non-PSC networks. 

     4. MPLS to GMPLS migration 

     4.1. Migration models 

        MPLS to GMPLS migration is a process of evolving an MPLS-TE-based 
        control plane to a GMPLS-based control plane. Three migration models 
        are considered as described below. Practically speaking, multiple 
        migration models may be deployed at the same time. 

     4.1.1. Island model 

        In the island model, "islands" of network nodes operating one 
        protocol exist within a "sea" of nodes using the other protocol. 

        The most obvious example is to consider an island of GMPLS-capable 
        nodes which is introduced into a legacy MPLS network. Such an island 
        might be composed of newly added GMPLS network nodes, or might arise 
        from the upgrade of existing nodes that previously operated MPLS 
        protocols. The opposite is also quite possible. That is, there is a 
        possibility that an island happens to be MPLS-capable within a GMPLS 
        sea. Such a situation might arise in the later stages of migration, 
        when all but a few islands of MPLS-capable nodes have been upgraded 
        to GMPLS. 

        It is also possible that a lower-layer, manually-provisioned network 
        (for example, a TDM network) supports an MPLS PSC network. During the 
        process of migrating from both networks to GMPLS, the situation might 
        arise where the lower-layer network has been migrated and operates 
        GMPLS, but the packet network still operates MPLS. This would appear 
        as a GMPLS island within an MPLS sea. 

        Lastly, it is possible to consider individual nodes as islands. That 
        is, it would be possible to upgrade or insert an individual GMPLS-
        capable node within an MPLS network, and to treat that GMPLS node as 
        an island. 

      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006                [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        Over time, collections of MPLS devices are replaced or upgraded to 
        create new GMPLS islands or to extend existing ones, and distinct 
        GMPLS islands may be joined together until the whole network is 
        GMPLS-capable. 

        From a migration/interworking point of view, we need to examine how 
        these islands are positioned and how LSPs run between the islands. 
        Four categories of interworking scenarios are considered: (1) MPLS-
        GMPLS-MPLS, (2) GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS, (3) MPLS-GMPLS and (4) GMPLS-MPLS. 
        In each case, the interworking behavior is examined based on whether 
        the GMPLS islands are PSC or non-PSC. These scenarios are considered 
        further in section 5. 

        Figure 1 shows an example of the island model for MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS 
        interworking. The model consists of a transit GMPLS island in an MPLS 
        sea. The nodes at the boundary of the GMPLS island (G1, G2, G5, and 
        G6) are referred to as "island border nodes". If the GMPLS island was 
        non-PSC, all nodes except the island border nodes in the GMPLS-based 
        transit island (G3 and G4) would be non-PSC devices, i.e., optical 
        equipment (TDM, LSC, and FSC).

     4.1.2. Integrated model 

        The second model involves a more integrated migration strategy. New 
        devices that are capable of operating both MPLS and GMPLS protocols 
        are introduced into the MPLS network. We should note that the GMPLS-
        capable device may not support a full set of MPLS functionalities. 
        For example, a GMPLS-capable device may support protection and 
        restoration mechanisms in [E2E-recovery, SEGMENT-recovery] but may 
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006                [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        not support the fast reroute mechanism defined in [RFC4090]. This 
        fact highlights the difference between the island and the integrated 
        models. That is to say, in the island model, a GMPLS node does not 
        support MPLS features (signaling code points, FRR, etc), while in the 
        integrated model, the new device supports both MPLS and GMPLS 
        features. 

        Further, existing MPLS devices will be upgraded to support both MPLS 
        and GMPLS. The network continues to operate providing MPLS services, 
        but where the service can be provided using only GMPLS functionality, 
        it may be routed accordingly over only such MPLS-GMPLS-capable 
        devices and achieve a higher level of functionality by utilizing 
        GMPLS features. Once all devices in the network are GMPLS-capable, 
        the MPLS specific protocol elements (signaling code points, FRR, etc) 
        may be turned off, and no new devices need to support these elements. 

        In this second model, the questions to be addressed concern the co-
        existence of the two protocol sets within the network. Actual 
        interworking is not a concern. 

        The integrated migration model results in a single network in which 
        both MPLS-capable and MPLS-GMPLS-capable LSRs co-exist. Some LSRs 
        will be capable of only MPLS, and some of both MPLS and GMPLS. The 
        migration strategy here involves introducing MPLS-GMPLS-capable LSRs 
        into an existing MPLS-capable network (i.e. upgrading MPLS LSRS) 
        until all LSRs are MPLS-GMPLS-capable at which time all MPLS 
        functionalities can be disabled, and there are no interworking issues 
        in the data plane. In the control plane, the migration issues concern 
        the separation of MPLS and GMPLS protocols, and the choice of routes 
        that may be signaled with only one protocol. 

     4.1.3. Phased model 

        The phased model introduces GMPLS features and protocol elements into 
        an MPLS network one by one. For example, some object or sub-object 
        (such as the ERO label sub-object, [RFC3473]) might be introduced 
        into the signaling used by LSRs that are otherwise MPLS-capable. This 
        would produce a kind of hybrid LSR.  

        This approach may appear simpler to implement as one is able to 
        quickly and easily pick up key new functions without needing to 
        upgrade the whole protocol implementation.  

        The interoperability concerns (e.g. LABEL REQUEST object [RFC3473] 
        and LABEL object [RFC3209], for RSVP-TE signaling) though are 
        exacerbated by this migration model, unless all LSRs in the network 
        are updated simultaneously.  
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006                [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        Interworking between a hybrid LSR and an unchanged MPLS LSR would put 
        the hybrid in the role of a GMPLS LSR as described in the previous 
        sections, while interworking between a hybrid LSR and a GMPLS LSR 
        puts the hybrid in the role of an MPLS LSR. The potential for 
        different hybrids within the network will complicate matters 
        considerably. Thus, this piecemeal migration from MPLS to GMPLS is 
        NOT RECOMMENDED.  

     4.2. Migration strategies 

        An appropriate migration strategy is selected based on various 
        factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, 
        customer demand, available network equipment, operational policy, etc.  

        For PSC networks, the migration strategy involves the selection 
        between the models described in the previous section. The choice will 
        depend upon the final objective (full GMPLS capability or partial 
        upgrade to include specific GMPLS features or no change of existing 
        IP/MPLS networks), and upon the immediate objectives (full, phased, 
        or staged upgrade). 

        For PSC networks supported by non-PSC networks, two basic migration 
        strategies can be considered. In the first strategy, the non-PSC 
        network is made GMPLS-capable first and then the PSC network is 
        migrated to GMPLS. This might arise when, in order to expand the 
        network capacity, GMPLS-based non-PSC sub-networks are introduced 
        into or underneath the legacy MPLS-based networks. Subsequently, the 
        legacy MPLS-based PSC network is migrated to be GMPLS-capable as 
        described in the previous paragraph. Finally the entire network, 
        including both PSC and non-PSC nodes, may be controlled by GMPLS. 

        The second strategy for PSC and non-PSC networks is to migrate from 
        the PSC network to GMPLS first and then enable GMPLS within the non-
        PSC network. The PSC network is migrated as described before, and 
        when the entire PSC network is completely converted to GMPLS, GMPLS-
        based non-PSC devices and networks may be introduced without any 
        issues of interworking between MPLS and GMPLS. 

        These migration strategies and the migration models described in the 
        previous section are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Mixtures of 
        all strategies and models could be applied. The migration models and 
        strategies selected will give rise to one or more of the interworking 
        cases described in the following section.

     5. Island model interworking cases 

     5.1. MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS Islands 

        The migration of an MPLS-based packet network to become a GMPLS 
        (PSC)-based network may be performed to provide GMPLS-based advanced 
        features in the network, or to facilitate interworking with a GMPLS-
        based optical core network. 

        The migration may give rise to islands of GMPLS support within a sea 
        of MPLS nodes such that an end-to-end LSP begins and ends on MPLS-
        capable LSRs. The GMPLS PSC island may be used to "hide" islands of 
        GMPLS non-PSC functionality that are completely contained within the 
        GMPLS PSC islands. This would protect the MPLS LSRs from having to be 
        aware of non-PSC technologies. 

     5.2.  MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS Islands 

        The introduction of a GMPLS-based controlled optical core network to 
        increase the capacity of a MPLS packet network is an example that may 
        give rise to this scenario. Until the MPLS network is upgraded to be 
        GMPLS-capable, the MPLS and GMPLS networks must interwork. The 
        interworking challenges may be reduced by wrapping the non-PSC GMPLS 
        island entirely within a GMPLS PSC island as described in the 
        previous section. 

     5.3. GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(PSC) Islands 

        This case might arise as the result of installing new GMPLS-capable 
        islands around a legacy MPLS network, or as the result of controlled 
        migration of some islands to become GMPLS-capable. 

     5.4. GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC) Islands 

        This case is out of scope for this document. Since the MPLS island is 
        necessarily packet capable (i.e. PSC), this scenario requires that 
        non-PSC LSPs are carried across a PSC network. Such a situation does 
        not arise through simple control plane migration, although the 
        interworking scenario might occur for other reasons, and be supported, 
        for example, by pseudo wires. 

     5.5. GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS(PSC) Islands 

        These cases are likely to arise where the migration strategy is not 
        based on a core infrastructure, but has edge nodes (ingress or 
        egress) located in islands of different capabilities. 

      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006                [Page 9] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        In this case, an LSP starts or ends in a GMPLS (PSC) island and 
        correspondingly ends or starts in an MPLS island. Some signaling and 
        routing conversion is required on island border LSRs. Figure 2 shows 
        the reference model for this migration scenario. Head-end and tail-
        end LSR are in distinct control plane clouds. 

        Since both islands are PSC there is no data plane conversion at the 
        island boundaries. However, from a control plane point of view this 
        model may prove challenging because the protocols must share or 
        convert information between the islands rather than tunnel it across 
        an island.

        It is also important to underline that this scenario is also impacted 
        by the directionality of the LSP, and the direction in which the LSP 
        is established. Indeed, a unidirectional packet LSP from R1 to G5 is 
        more easily accommodated at G1 than a bidirectional PSC LSP from G5 
        to R1.  

     6. Interworking issues between MPLS and GMPLS 

        As described in the previous sections, interworking between MPLS and 
        GMPLS may form an essential part of a migration and deployment 
        strategy. This section sets out some of the alternatives for 
        achieving interworking between MPLS and GMPLS, and points out some of 
        the issues that need to be addressed if the alternatives are adopted. 
        This document does not describe solutions to these issues. 

        Note that it is possible to consider upgrading the routing and 
        signaling capabilities of LSRs from MPLS to GMPLS separately.

     6.1. Signaling  

        Signaling protocols are used to establish LSPs and are the principal 
        concern for interworking. This section outlines some of the issues 
        that may arise when MPLS and GMPLS signaling interworking is 
        attempted. Solutions to these issues will be described in separate 
        documents, but possibly rely on tunneling techniques (as described 
        above) or message mapping. 

     6.1.1. GMPLS specific RSVP objects and Messages 

        GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling ([RFC3473]) introduces new RSVP-TE objects, 
        and their associated procedures, that are not processed/generated by 
        MPLS LSRs. Clearly an MPLS LSR cannot be expected to originate LSPs 
        that use these objects and will, therefore, not have access to the 
        additional GMPLS functions. However, the new RSVP-TE objects listed 
        below need to be handled in interworking scenarios where the LSP 
        ingress and/or egress is GMPLS-capable, and MPLS LSRs are required to 
        process the signaling messages:  

        o  The (Generalized) Label Request object (new C-Type), used to 
           identify the LSP encoding type, the switching type and the 
           generalized protocol ID (G-PID) associated with the LSP.  

        o  The (Generalized) Label object (new C-Type) 

        o  The IF_ID RSVP_HOP objects, IF_ID ERROR_SPEC objects, and IF_ID 
           ERO/RRO sub objects that handle the Control plane/Data plane 
           separation in GMPLS network.  

        o  The Suggested Label Object, used to reduce LSP setup delays.  

        o  The Label Set Object, used to restrict label allocation to a set 
           of labels, (particularly useful for wavelength conversion 
           incapable nodes)  

        o  The Upstream Label Object, used for bidirectional LSP setup  

        o  The Restart Cap object, used for graceful restart.  

        o  The Admin Status object, used for LSP administration, and 
           particularly for graceful LSP teardown.  

        o  The Recovery Label object used for Graceful Restart  

        o  The Notify Request object used to solicit notification of errors 
           and events. 
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        o  The Protection and Association objects used for LSP recovery 

        Future GMPLS extensions are likely to add further new objects. 

        Some of these objects can be passed transparently by MPLS LSRs to 
        carry them across MPLS islands because their C-Nums are of the form 
        11bbbbbb, but others would cause an MPLS LSR to reject the message 
        that carries them because their C-Nums are of the form 0bbbbbbb. 

        Even when objects are inherited from MPLS by GMPLS they can be 
        expected to cause problems. For example, the Label object in GMPLS 
        uses a new C-Type to indicate 'Generalized Label'. This C-Type is 
        unknown to MPLS LSRs that will reject any message carrying it. 

        GMPLS also introduces new message flags and fields (including new 
        sub-objects and TLVs) that will have no meaning to MPLS LSRs. This 
        data will normally be forwarded untouched by transit MPLS LSRs, but 
        they cannot be expected to act on it. 

        Also GMPLS introduces two new messages, the Notify message, and the 
        Recovery Path message that are not supported by MPLS nodes. 

     6.1.1.1. Direct interworking 

        A possible solution is to allow direct signaling between MPLS and 
        GMPLS LSRs. However, a fundamental issue is that MPLS and GMPLS use 
        incompatible code points (C-Types) to request labels (LABEL_REQUEST 
        and GENERALIZED_LABEL_REQUEST) and to signal labels (LABEL and 
        GENERALIZED LABEL).  

        Note, however, that the Phased Model may offer a solution that 
        resembles signaling interworking. In this approach LSRs are upgraded 
        to support some GMPLS features but continue to use MPLS code points.  

        MPLS LSPs may be established across an island of enhanced signaling 
        capabilities, where some GMPLS features have been added to MPLS LSRs. 
        This may be relatively simple, and indeed may also be compatible with 
        the Integrated Model.  

        On the other hand, enhanced MPLS LSPs (i.e. LSPs signaled using some 
        GMPLS features) may be carried across an MPLS island. Success in this 
        case will depend on the particular GMPLS features in use (some 
        features, such as bi-directionality, cannot be achieved by a native 
        MPLS network without additional assistance) and the code points that 
        are used to signal the features (some objects can be carried 
        transparently across an MPLS network by virtue of their Class Number 

      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 12] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        encoding, but others will be silently dropped or will cause the 
        message to be rejected). 

     6.1.1.2. Mapping 

        An alternative to interworking signaling protocols is to map each 
        other between MPLS and GMPLS. That is, to convert the objects carried 
        in one message to different objects carried in the message that is 
        actually sent. This mapping would be performed in an upgraded LSR at 
        island borders since existing LSRs would not be aware of the required 
        mappings. This mapping is local decision and should be pre-configured 
        or dynamically done at border nodes. 

        It would be relatively simple to map signaling messages for LSPs 
        initiated on MPLS LSRs (MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS) since the 
        LSPs will not need to implement advanced GMPLS features. On the other 
        hand, however, mapping signaling messages for LSPs initiated by a 
        GMPLS LSR (GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS and GMPLS-MPLS) may be considerably 
        harder depending on the GMPLS features demanded by the LSP. For 
        example, if the GMPLS LSP is bidirectional, additional function will 
        be needed at the border LSR that maps the signaling messages in order 
        to create a pair of unidirectional MPLS LSPs to carry the 
        bidirectional service across the MPLS network that does not have 
        native support for bidirectionality. Indeed, in the GMPLS-MPLS case, 
        a bidirectional service would not be possible unless the egress MPLS 
        LSR was also upgraded to provide this function.  

     6.1.1.3. Transfer 

        A migration strategy may also imply moving an MPLS state to a GMPLS 
        state. For instance, a LSR hosting MPLS states is upgraded such that  
        its controller can run both MPLS and GMPLS. In this case, a signaling 
        mechanism is needed to migrate from the MPLS LSP state to the GMPLS 
        state. 

     6.1.2. Bidirectional LSP 

        GMPLS provides bidirectional LSP setup - a single signaling message 
        exchange manages the bidirectional LSP, and forward and reverse data 
        paths follow the same route in the GMPLS network. There is no 
        equivalent in MPLS networks: forward and backward LSPs must be 
        created in different signaling sessions - the route taken by those 
        LSPs may be different from each other, and their sessions are treated 
        separately. Common routes and fate sharing require additional, 
        higher-level coordination in MPLS.  


      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 13] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        If MPLS and GMPLS networks are inter-connected, bidirectional LSPs 
        from the GMPLS network need to be carried in the MPLS network. 

        Note that this issue arises only in the cases where an LSP is 
        originated by GMPLS-capable LSRs. In other words, it applies only to 
        the GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS and GMPLS-MPLS island model. 

        Note that the island border LSRs will bear the responsibility for 
        achieving the bidirectional service across the central MPLS island.  

        In the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS models, the ingress LSR is 
        unaware of the concept of a bidirectional LSP and cannot attempt the 
        service even if it could find some way to request it through the 
        network. In the case of GMPLS-MPLS, a similar issue exists because 
        the egress MPLS-capable LSR is unaware of the concept of 
        bidirectional LSPs. 

     6.1.3. Failure recovery  

        Failure recovery mechanism is provided using different mechanisms in 
        MPLS (see [RFC4090]) and GMPLS (see [E2E-RECOVERY, SEGMENT-RECOVERY]). 
        Local protection of island border nodes may be a particular problem. 

     6.2. Routing  

        Some attention should also be given to the use of routing protocols 
        in interworking scenarios since this may allow routing information 
        from islands to be visible within the surrounding seas. 

        GMPLS extends the TE information advertised by the IGPs to include 
        non-PSC information and extended PSC information. Because the GMPLS 
        information is provided as additional TLVs that are carried along 
        with the MPLS information, MPLS LSRs are able to "see" GMPLS LSRs as 
        though they were PSC LSRs. They will also see other GMPLS information, 
        but will ignore it, passing it transparently across the MPLS network 
        for use by other GMPLS LSRs. 

        This means that MPLS LSRs may use the MPLS information advertised by 
        MPLS LSRs and GMPLS LSRs to compute a traffic-engineered explicit 
        route across a mixed network. However, it is likely that a path 
        computation component in an MPLS network will only be aware of MPLS 
        TE information and will not understand concepts such as switching 
        capability type. This may result in that an incorrect path will be 
        computed for an e2e LSP from one MPLS island to another across a 
        GMPLS island if different switching capabilities exist.

     6.2.1. Interworking of Routing Protocols 

        GMPLS TE advertisements are based on MPLS TE advertisements with the 
        addition of extra sub-TLVs. The processing rules for unknown TLVs 
        mean that they can be ignored by a router, but must be forwarded when 
        the Link State Advertisement (OSPF LSA or IS-IS LSP) is flooded. 

        This means that MPLS and GMPLS LSRs may operate as routing peers, and 
        will redistribute each other's TE information. MPLS LSRs will be 
        granted full TE visibility at an MPLS level into GMPLS islands, while 
        GMPLS LSRs will have limited (i.e. MPLS-level) TE visibility into 
        MPLS islands. 

        This type of routing exchange may be very useful in particular for 
        MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS PSC networks. GMPLS LSRs, however, must either modify 
        their computation algorithms or must generate appropriate defaults 
        for GMPLS TE parameters that are not advertised by MPLS LSRs. 

     6.2.2. Mapping of Routing Protocols 

        The alternatives to interworking routing protocols are to impose 
        protocol boundaries (such as routing area, AS boundaries) or to 
        attempt to map the protocol advertisements as they cross island 
        borders. This latter option is simple for advertisements coming from 
        GMPLS islands since the GMPLS sub-TLVs may be discarded, but is 
        pointless because those sub-TLVs are benign within the MPLS network 
        and are impossible to accurately recreate on re-entry into a GMPLS 
        network. On the other hand, advertisements initiated by MPLS LSRs 
        could have default GMPLS sub-TLVs added when they are flooded into a 
        GMPLS network. These defaults would be similar to those described in 
        the previous section, and would have the advantage that GMPLS LSRs 
        within the network (i.e. not border nodes) would not need to apply 
        the defaults. Care is needed to ensure that the mechanism for 
        applying defaults is identical on all border nodes. 

        Note that any alternative using routing protocol mapping relies on 
        each border LSR knowing which neighbors are MPLS or GMPLS capable. 

     6.3. Layered Networks 

        In addition to the difference between MPLS and GMPLS protocols, 
        control and data plane separation needs to be considered at the 
        boundary of PSC and non-PSC domains.  

        Note that the boundary of PSC and non-PSC domains may or may not be 
        coincident with the boundary of MPLS and GMPLS domains. In the case 
        where the boundaries are not coincident, the boundary between the PSC 
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 15] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        and non-PSC domains must exist in the GMPLS domain because the MPLS 
        domain cannot support a non-PSC data plane. Here we distinguish two 
        cases: interworking between PSC and non-PSC networks, and 
        interworking between MPLS and GMPLS networks.  

        Figure 3 shows the network model, where the ingress PSC domain and 
        the egress PSC domains are interconnected via the transit non-PSC

                  Figure 3 Interworking of PSC and non-PSC domains. 

        In the PSC domain, the control plane traffic (signaling and routing) 
        is carried in-band with data. This means that there is fate sharing 
        between a data link and the control traffic on the link. On the other 
        hand, in the non-PSC domain (TDM, LSC, and FSC domains), where packet 
        delineation is not recognized, and in-band control channels cannot be 
        terminated, dedicated control channels (separated from the data 
        channels) are used. In the non-PSC domain, the control channel can be 
        logically or physically separated (i.e., in-fiber out-of-band or out-
        of-fiber out-of-bound) from the data channel depending on the 
        capabilities of the network devices and the operational requirements.  

        A dedicated control channel must not be used to carry user data 
        traffic. This is particularly important when the control channels are 
        of low capacity and are not designed to carry user traffic.  

        A possible method to protect the control plane channel of a non-PSC 
        domain is that packets coming from PSC domains are not allowed to use 
        the control plane channel. The method, however, causes another 
        problem: lack of signaling and routing adjacencies across the non-PSC 
        domain.  

        This problem is explained using Fig. 3. LSAs in the egress PSC domain 
        are not advertised in the ingress PSC domain unless routing

        adjacencies are established between the PSC domain and non-PSC domain 
        or unless routing adjacencies are established directly between PSC 
        domains. Therefore the ingress LSR in the ingress PSC domain is not 
        able to find the egress LSR in the egress PSC domain unless these 
        adjacencies are formed. The signaling messages are not passed across 
        the non-PSC domain between the ingress and the egress PSC domains 
        unless the signaling adjacencies are established between the PSC 
        domain and the non-PSC domain or directly between PSC domains. 

        Interworking between PSC and non-PSC networks can be regarded as a 
        layered network. Layered networks are described in many places 
        including [RFC3945] and [RFC4206]. [MRN-REQ] gives a good background 
        and discusses some of the requirements for multi-layered networks. 

        Network layering is often used to separate domains of different data 
        plane technology. It can also be used to separate domains of 
        different control plane technology (such as MPLS and GMPLS protocols), 
        and the solutions developed for multiple data plane technologies can 
        be usefully applied to this situation.  

        The GMPLS architecture [RFC3945] identifies three architectural 
        models for supporting multi-layer GMPLS networks, and these models 
        may be applied to the separation of MPLS and GMPLS control plane 
        islands. The applicability of the different migration models to the 
        three architectural models may provide additional input to the choice 
        of an architectural model. 

     6.3.1. Peer Model 

        In the peer model, both MPLS and GMPLS nodes run the same routing 
        instance and routing advertisements, from within islands of one level 
        of protocol support are distributed to the whole network. This is 
        achievable as described in section 6.2 either by direct distribution 
        or by mapping of parameters. 

        If the entire network (MPLS and GMPLS capable LSRs) is PSC, signaling 
        may establish end-to-end LSPs using the techniques described in 
        section 6.1. On the other hand, if the GMPLS network is of some other 
        switching type, or if the protocol islands are managed as separate 
        network layers, the signaling request can give rise to the creation 
        of a hierarchical LSP [RFC4206] or stitching segment [STITCH] that 
        spans an island and is triggered when the LSP request reaches the 
        island border. The end-to-end LSP from the higher layer network (the 
        protocol sea) is carried across the lower layer network (the protocol 
        island) by the tunnel or stitching segment. 


      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 17] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        Note that an MPLS sea is not capable of determining whether the 
        entire network is of the same switching type and will consequently 
        attempt to signal end-to-end LSPs assuming them to be PSC all the way. 
        This requires that the island border take the appropriate action to 
        set up tunnels across islands of different switching capabilities. 

     6.3.2. Overlay Model 

        The overlay model preserves strict separation of routing information 
        between network layers. Thus, in the interworking case, there is no 
        requirement to handle routing interworking. Signaling interworking is 
        still required as described in section 6.1. 

        Note, however, that there is a requirement to create signaling higher 
        layer adjacencies between island border nodes, and that it is highly 
        desirable to create routing adjacencies in the same way. Such 
        adjacencies may use the control plane of the lower layer network and 
        be independent of the existence of data plane connectivity across the 
        lower layer network. Care may be required to prevent the swamping of 
        the lower layer control plane when it has limited capacity. 
        Alternatively, such adjacencies may rely on the existence of data 
        plane connectivity across the lower layer network. 

     6.3.3. Augmented Model 

        The augmented model allows limited routing exchange from the lower 
        layer network to the higher layer network. Generally speaking, this 
        assumes that the border nodes provide some form of filtering, mapping 
        or aggregation of routing information advertised from the lower layer 
        network, and this is compatible with the mechanisms described in 
        section 6.2.2.  

        Note however, that part of this assumption allows the border nodes to 
        have full visibility into both the higher and lower layer networks 
        without further advertising the information from the lower layer 
        network to the higher layer network meaning that no mapping or 
        interworking of routing protocols is required. Particularly, this 
        includes the case where MPLS and GMPLS clouds run distinct routing 
        instances, and the border nodes run both routing instances. 

        Note that the same observations about routing and signaling 
        adjacencies apply as for the overlay model. 

     7. Manageability Considerations 

        Some attention should be given during migration planning to how the 
        network will be managed during and after migration. For example, will 
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        the LSRs of different protocol capabilities be managed separately or 
        as a whole. This is most clear in the Island Model where it is 
        possible to consider managing islands of one capability separately 
        from the surrounding sea. In the case of islands that have different 
        switching capabilities, it is possible that the islands already had 
        different management in place before the migration: the resultant 
        migrated network may seek to merge the management or to preserve it. 

     7.1. Control of Function and Policy 

        The most important control to be applied is at the moment of 
        changeover between different levels of protocol support. Such a 
        change may be made dynamically or during a period of network 
        maintenance. 

        Where island boundaries exist, it must be possible to manage the 
        relationships between protocols and to indicate which interfaces 
        support which protocols on a border LSR. Further, island borders are 
        a natural place to apply policy, and management should allow 
        configuration of such policies. 

     7.2. Information and Data Models 

        No special information or data models are required to support 
        migration, but note that migration in the control plane implies 
        migration from MPLS management tools to GMPLS management tools. 
        During migration, therefore, it may be necessary for LSRs and 
        management applications to support both MPLS and GMPLS variants of 
        management data. 

        The GMPLS MIB modules are designed to allow support of the MPLS 
        protocols and build on the MPLS MIB modules through extensions and 
        augmentations. This may make it possible to migrate management 
        applications ahead of the LSRs that they manage. 

     7.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

        Migration will not imposes additional issues for OAM above those that 
        already exist for inter-domain OAM and for OAM across multiple 
        switching capabilities. 

        Note, however, that if a flat PSC MPLS network is migrated using the 
        island model, and is treated as a layered network using tunnels to 
        connect across GMPLS islands, then requirements for a multi-layer OAM 
        technique may be introduced into what was previously defined in the 
        flat OAM problem-space. The OAM framework of MPLS/GMPLS interworking 
        may be described in more detail in a later version. 
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 19] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

     7.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

        The concerns for verifying correct operation (and in particular 
        correct connectivity) are the same as for liveness detection and 
        monitoring. Principally, the process of migration may introduce 
        tunneling or stitching into what was previously a flat network. 

     7.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

        No particular requirements are introduced on other protocols. As it 
        has been observed, the management components may need to migrate in 
        step with the control plane components, but this does not impact the 
        management protocols, just the data that they carry. 

        It should also be observed that providing signaling and routing 
        connectivity across a migration island in support of a layered 
        architecture may require the use of protocol tunnels (such as GRE) 
        between island border nodes. Such tunnels may impose additional 
        configuration requirements at the border nodes. 

     7.6. Impact on Network Operation 

        The process of migration is likely to have significant impact on 
        network operation while migration is in progress. The main objective 
        of migration planning should be to reduce the impact on network 
        operation and on the services perceived by the network users.  

        To this end, planners should consider reducing the number of 
        migration steps that they perform, and minimizing the number of 
        migration islands that are created. 

        A network manager may prefer the island model especially when 
        migration will extend over a significant operational period because 
        it allows the different network islands to be administered as 
        separate management domains. This is particularly the case in the 
        overlay and augmented network models where the details of the 
        protocol islands remain hidden from the surrounding LSRs. 

     7.7. Other Considerations 

        No other management considerations arise. 

     8. Security Considerations 

        Security and confidentiality is often applied (and attacked) at 
        administrative boundaries. Some of the models described in this 
        document introduce such boundaries, for example between MPLS and 
      
      
     Shiomoto               Expires October 19, 2006               [Page 20] 
         
     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00 April 2006 
         

        GMPLS islands. These boundaries offer the possibility of applying or 
        modifying the security as one might when crossing an IGP area or AS 
        boundary, even though these island boundaries might lie within an IGP 
        area or AS. 

        No changes are proposed to the security procedures built into MPLS 
        and GMPLS signaling and routing. GMPLS signaling and routing inherit 
        their security mechanisms from MPLS signaling and routing without any 
        changes. Hence, there will be no issues with security in interworking 
        scenarios. Further, since the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing 
        security is provided on a hop-by-hop basis, and since all signaling 
        and routing exchanges described in this document for use between any 
        pair of LSRs are based on either MPLS or GMPLS, there are no changes 
        necessary to the security procedures.
