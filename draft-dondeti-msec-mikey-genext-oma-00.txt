Abstract

   This document specifies a new general extension payload type for use
   in the Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA) Browser and Content (BAC)
   Broadcast (BCAST) group.  OMA BCAST's service and content protection
   specification uses short term key message (STKM) and long term key
   message (LTKM) payloads that in certain broadcast distribution
   systems (BDS) are carried in the IETF MIKEY protocol [1].  A new
   MIKEY general extension payload specified in this document will be

Internet-Draft  OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload     April 2006


1.  Introduction

   The MIKEY specification [1]defines a General extensions payload to
   allow possible extensions to MIKEY without defining a new payload.
   The general extension payload can be used in any MIKEY message and is
   part of the authenticated/signed data part.  There is an 8-bit type
   field in that payload and the type code assignment is IANA managed
   and RFC 3830 requires IETF consensus for assignments from the public
   range of 0-240.

   The OMA BCAST Service and Content Protection specification [2]
   specifies the use of an STKM and an LTKM that carries attributes
   related to service and content protection (any keys associated with
   the attributes are part of the MIKEY message).  The STKM or the LTKM
   is to be carried in a MIKEY message in the context of the 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)'s Multimedia Broadcast/
   Multicast Service (MBMS) BDS.  This document specifies the use of the
   general extension payload of MIKEY's general extension payload to
   carry the LTKMs or STKMs.

   The MIKEY general extension payload specified in [3] along with the
   MBMS [4] specification specifies the transport of MIKEY messages via
   unicast or broadcast and the OMA specifications use either for
   transport of MIKEY messages.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [5].

      OMA General Extension payload: We refer to the general extension
      payload type -- value, to be assigned by IANA -- as the OMA GenExt
      payload.

   The intent is to define a fixed length TKM type variable as part of
   the OMA BCAST TKM SpecificData and use that to differentiate between
   STKMs and LTKMs.

   The only new field introduced from the IETF perspective is the OMA
   BCAST TKM specific data (variable length):

   OMA BCAST STKM contains the following fields:

      protocol_version

      protection_after_reception

      reserved_for_future_use

      access_criteria_flag

      traffic_protection_protocol

      traffic_authentication_flag

      reserved_for_future_use

      traffic_key_lifetime

      If access_criteria_flag is TRUE the following fields are present

         reserved_for_future_use

         number_of_access_criteria_descriptors

         access_criteria_descriptors

   OMA BCAST LTKM contains the following fields:

      TerminalBindingKeyID

      RightsIssuerURI


4.  Interoperability considerations

   This document requests a MIKEY [1] General Extension Payload Type
   number from IANA through IETF review.  The payload defined is
   relevant to the 3GPP MBMS adaptation of the OMA BCAST 1.0
   specification.  Interoperability considerations span at least 3 SDOs

Internet-Draft  OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload     April 2006


   and as such it is up to the OMA test planning to verify the
   interoperability of the MBMS adaptation of OMA BCAST 1.0.  This
   payload type assignment does not change MIKEY beyond RFC 3830 and
   [3].


5.  Security Considerations

   According to RFC 3830, the general extension payload can be used in
   any MIKEY message and is part of the authenticated/signed data part.
   The parameters proposed to be included in the OMA BCAST's MIKEY
   General extension payload (listed in Section Section 3) need only to
   be integrity protected, which is already allowed by the MIKEY
   specification.  The OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload SHALL
   be integrity protected.  Furthermore, keys or any parameters that
   require confidentiality MUST NOT be included in the General Extension
   Payload.  Note that MIKEY already provides replay protection and that
   protection covers the General Extension Payload also.


6.  IANA Considerations

   Please provide the next available number from the "General Extensions
   payload name spaces" in the IANA registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads for use by OMA BCAST
   GenExt payload.
