   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that

Abstract

   This document defines a new SIP header field for communications
   resource priority, called "Resource-Priority". This header field
   influences the behavior of gateways and SIP proxies. It does not
   influence the forwarding behavior of IP routers.

1 Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2 Introduction

   This document defines a new SIP [2] header field for communications
   resource priority, called "Resource-Priority". This header MAY be
   used by GSTN gateways and SIP proxy servers to influence their
   treatment of SIP requests, including the priority afforded to GSTN
   calls. For GSTN gateways, the behavior translates into the ITU
   Recommendation Q.735.3 [3] prioritization mechanism, in both GSTN-
   to-IP and IP-to-GSTN directions. For IP networks, proxies may offer
   mechanisms beyond the scope of this document to influence, for
   example, admission control or IP packet marking.

   The Resource-Priority header field may be inserted by proxies and SIP
   user agents.

   The Resource-Priority header field may be used in several situations:

        1.   Requesting elevated priority for access to PSTN gateway
             resources such as trunk circuits.

        2.   Carrying information from one multi-level priority domain
             in the telephone network, e.g., using the facilities of
             Q.735.3 [3], to another, without the SIP proxies themselves
             inspecting the header field.

        3.   Indicating signaling priority in SIP proxies and back-to-
             back user agents, with higher priorities displacing
             existing signaling requests or bypassing PSTN gateway
             capacity limits in effect for lower priorities.

   This header is related to, but differs in semantics from, the
   Priority header field (RFC 2543, Section 6.25). The Priority header
   field describes the priority that the SIP request should have to the
   receiving human or its agent. For example, it may be factored into
   decisions about call routing and acceptance. It does not influence
   the use of communications resources such as packet forwarding
   priority in routers.

   The mechanism described here can be used for emergency preparedness,
   but is only a small part of an emergency preparedness network.

   SIP entities supporting this specification MUST be able to generate

   and process this header.

3 The Resource-Priority Header Field

   This document defines the Resource-Priority general header field.



        Resource-Priority _  "Resource-Priority" HCOLON Resource-value
        Resource-value    _  namespace "." priority
        namespace         _  alphanum / "-"
        priority          _  alphanum / "-"


   As a response header, the value indicates the actual priority
   selected by the recipient. Implementations MAY change the value
   offered in the request; in some environments, the response value is
   known to be the same as in the request.

   The resource value is formatted as "namespace" "." "priority value".
   Name space and priority values are registered with IANA (see IANA
   Considerations).


   Header field       where  proxy  ACK  BYE  CAN  INV  OPT  REG
   _____________________________________________________________
   Resource-Priority    c     ar     -    -    -    o    -    -


   SIP elements MAY downgrade the Resource-Priority of or reject
   unauthenticated requests. Details are a matter of local policy.

   Proxies MAY downgrade the Resource-Priority value of unauthenticated
   requests. Details are specific to each administrative domain and
   beyond the scope of this document. Proxies SHOULD NOT reject requests
   with such headers but instead downgrade the resource priority value.

   A proxy or user agent MAY return status code 503 (Service
   Unavailable) if there are insufficient resources at the resource
   priority level specified. The response MAY also include a Warning
   header with warning code 370 (Insufficient Bandwidth) if the request
   failed due to insufficient capacity for the media streams, rather
   than insufficient signaling capacity.

4 IANA Considerations

   Additional name spaces and priority values are registered with IANA.
   Within each namespace, The registration MUST indicate the relative
   precedence levels, expressed as an ordered list. Existing lists of

Internet Draft             Resource Priority           February 19, 2002


   priorities can only be extended at the bottom, i.e., by adding values
   with lower priority than any currently registered values. TBD: Any
   restrictions on new namespaces?

5 Security Considerations

   The Resource-Priority header field can be abused to consume scarce
   communications resources. Thus, authentication of the requester is of
   particular importance. Authentication MAY be SIP-based.

A Namespace dsn

   An initial namespace, "dsn" (Defense Switched Network), contains the
   priority values, "flash-override", "flash", "immediate", "priority",
   "routine", where "flash-override" is the highest priority and
   "routine" is the lowest. [TBD: Should this just be registered by IANA
   rather than appear in the document?]

   The values are adopted from RFC 791 [4], omitting the levels "network
   control" and "internetwork control", as these are inappropriate here.

   The values are prioritized in the order "critic-ecp" (highest),
   "flash-override", "flash", "immediate", "priority" and "routine"
   (lowest). Additional values in the extension parameter are treated as
   "routine" by entities that do not understand the value.

   The value "critic-ecp" stands for "Critical and Emergency Call
   Processing" [4]. This value SHOULD only be used for authorized
   emergency communications, for example in the United States Government
   Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) [5], the United Kingdom
   Government Telephone Preference Scheme (GTPS) and similar government
   emergency preparedness or reactionary implementations elsewhere.

B Namespace q735

   The namespace "q735" is registered here. It supports carrying
   information between Q.735.3 (or equivalent) PSTN/ISDN entities
   without intervening interpretation by SIP proxies and avoids
   unnecessary interpretation between different networks. The namespace
   contains the priority values "0", "1", "2", "3" and "4", with "0"
   being the lowest value and the "4" the highest.
