1. Introduction
   Various derivative technologies of present mobile internet are 
   developed as commercialized technology. Among it, multicast and 
   fusion of Mobile technology may cause elevation of technique many
   services. Do so that can provide various service defining important 
   technology of such problem in this document. Take advantage of WLAN
   technology in mobile spot area in downtown, because other area with 
   transfer tele topology, dynamic group management and service 
   management for node who can use multicast without that have mobility 
   in carrying along internet environment are possible. Also, pare down 
   waste of mobile bandwidth utilizing group management who is 
   simplified than ex group management techniques in carrying along 
   internet environment and group management of base station(BS) 
   decreasing process of transfer node, because do  transfer node power
   consumption decrease possible. Finally, wide multicast services 
   support capacitates because connecting with technology of Mobile 
   VoIP, MANET, Telemetics, PAN, MBWA etc. So this document suggested to
   novel MBS zone Management Protocol(MzMP) based on the MBS zone 
   concept for supporting effective multicast service and group 
   management over IEEE 802.16e.

2. Terminology
   MBS: Multicast & Broadcast Service
   MCID (Multicast CID): The identifier that classified the multicast 
                         service and MBS zone
   MBS Zone: The region provide multicast and broadcast service that has 
             a specific MCID
   MBS Zone subscribes: Receiver of the multicast service that has its 
                        MCID
   MBS Zone leave: Discontinue receiving multicast service that has 
                   specific MCID
   MBS Server: The management server of MCID and BS for multicast 
               service
   BS (Base Station): The equipment supporting wireless access of MSS
   MSS: Mobile Subscriber Station
   ASA(Authentication and Service Authorization): The service and user 
                                                  authentication to MSS
   ASA Server: The server that performs grant, management and 
               authentication of unique authentication key to each MSS
   DSA-RSP: The serving BS sends this message to MSS in order to 
            response to a received DSA-REQ(connection info parameter,
	    connection setting parameter)
   SA: Security Association
   MCID: Multicast Connection Identifier

3. Requirements

3-1 MSS
   - MSS should be able to receive or request MCID list from MBS Server 
     or BS.
   - MSS should be able to transmit message for multicast server 
     discontinue.

3-2 MBS Server
   - It should maintain the list information of BS that receives the 
     Multicast Service Flow ID.(MCID)
   - It should transmit new MCID message by request of MCID list from 
     BSs or addition new MCID to own MBS management table.
   - It assigns a MCID per multicast service.
   - It may save multicast service contents.
     : The contents may be stored to Media server near by MBS Server in 
       this case, it needs message exchange with MBS Server.

3-3 BS
   - It should maintain MCID list from MBS Server and MSS receiving each 
     MCID service in the region.
   - It should save MCID list from MBS Server during a fixed term.
   - It should periodically update MCID list by new MCID message from 
     MBS Server.

3-4 SAS server
   - SAS server must authenticate user and service uses to MSS in 
     correspond MBS zone region.

            <Figure 1> BS1 subscribes the MBS zone

   Although BS1 has not subscribed to MBS zone, it contains MCID list 
   through periodic Advertisement message from MBS Server. MSS1 wants to 
   provide multicast service with MCID#1 of the MCID list. MSS1 obtains 
   MCID list from BS1.

   Figure 1 shows below sequence.
   1. MSS1 send the DSA_REQ message (MCID, SA information, etc) to BS1
      for request and authentication of MCID#1.
   2. BS1 send the authentication request message to ASA server for the 
      MSS1.
   3. ASA server sends SA response message of MSS1 to BS1.
   4. If authentication of MSS1 is completed, the BS1 sends the MBS MAP 
      message to MBS Server for requests to subscribe MBS zone.
   5. MBS Server registers BS1 as a multicast subscriber of MCID#1, and 
      maintains the table.
   6. MBS Server send ACK message to BS1.
   7. BS1, received ACK message, registers and manages MCID#1 and MSS1 
      in a table that contains information of its multicast service.
   8. MSS1 receive the DSA_RSP message from BS1. DSA_RSP means that 
      multicast service data zone broadcasting in BS1 by engaged SA.

     <Figure 2> MSS entered BS1 region subscribing at MBS zone

   BS1 already has subscribed MBS zone, and when MSS2 enters its region, 
   MSS2 receives MCID list from BS1 and wants to provide multicast 
   service of MCID#1. MBS cache table of BS1 already has contained 
   recipient MSS1 of MCID#1.

   Figure 2 shows below sequence.

   1. MSS2 sends the DSA_REQ message to BS1 for request and 
      authentication of MCID#1 multicast service.
   2. BS1 checks whether existence of MCID#1 in own MBS cache table.
   3. BS1 sends SA request message to ASA server for MSS2 
      authentication.
   4. ASA server send authentication SA response message for MSS2.
   5. MSS2 receives DSA_RSP message from BS1. In this case DSA_RSP means 
      that broadcasting multicast service data in BS1 zone depending on 
      the SA.

   When MSS2, it provided service of MCID#1 in BS1, moves into BS2 that

   performed step 1 to 7 of section 3.1 Request message of MCID#1 in 
   Step 1 can be requested in crossing region between BS1 and BS2, or 
   after complete entering the BS2.

             <Figure 4> Reduction of MBS zone

   BS1 has subscribed to MBS zone, so it has maintained and managed MBS 
   cache table that recorded informationto MSS, which it received MCID 
   list and each MCID. When last MSS1 of MCID#1 discontinues the service 
   due to several reason, or when SA is expired. Also, the reduction of 
   MBS zone is performed, when BS1 leaves its MBS zone and MBS zone is 
   reduced. 

   Figure 4 shows below sequence.
   
   1. MSS1 sends DSA_REQ message to BS1 for MCID#1 service 
      discontinuance and for SA cancellation.
   2. BS1 deletes the related information of MSS1 in MBS cache table.
   3. BS1 sends the MBS_MAP message for MBS zone reduce message of 
      MCID#1 to MBS Server, because no more necessity providing 
      multicast service of MCID#1. 
   4. MBS Server deletes BS1 of MCID#1 entry in MBS zone management 
      table.
   5. MBS Server sends ACK message to BS1.
   6. BS1 sends SA release message of MSS1 to ASA server.
   7. ASA server sends SA1 expire ACK message to BS1.
   8. BS1 send the DSA_RSP message for SA expire ACK message to MSS1 and 
      MSS1 expire own SA.

4-2-2 Last recipient moved out BS1 region subscribed to MBS zone
      When the last recipient MSS1 of BS1 moved another BS region, BS1 
      dose not detects data exchange for MCID#1 any more. In this case, 
      after during for fixed term, MBS zone reduced by performing step 3 
      to 7 in section 4-1.

5. Multicast data transmission of MBS Server
   MBS Server may become Media server to provide contents, or Multicast 
   server separate from Media server. In case of the separated system, 
   MBS Server distributes data to each BS for communicating with Media 
   server. MBS Server has the information of BSs with their MCID in MBS 
   zone, and transports their own data to corresponding BSs.
   In MSS is source of multicast data, MSS sends own data to its BS, and
   BS sends the data to MBS Server. After, multicast data transmission 
   is similar to central server.

6. MBS zone list management of BS
   MBS obtains current using MBS zone list from MBS Server by 
   periodically, or Advertisement message of MBSServer. As BS saves MBS 
   zone list, if MSS requested MBS zone list to MBS Server, we will be 
   able to reduce correspond delay and bandwidth waste. MBS Server sends 
   the MBS list to as BS by request of the BS, and it sends new MCID 
   message to the BS, whenever adding new MCID in own MBS management
