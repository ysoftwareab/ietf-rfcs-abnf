                draft-wahlstroem-oauth-cbor-web-token-00

Abstract

   CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web
   Token (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices.  The claims in
   a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
   and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added
   application layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of
   information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/
   value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.

1.  Introduction

   With JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) a standardized format of security tokens
   has been defined and has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
   deployments.  With JSON Web Signatures (JWS) and JSON Web Encryption
   (JWE) security the content of the JWT, which comes in form of claims,
   is protected.  The use of JSON for encoding information is popular
   for Web applications but it is still considered inefficient for use
   in many IoT systems that use low power radio technologies.

   In this document an alternative encoding of claims is defined.
   Instead of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification
   suggests the use of CBOR and calls this new structure 'CBOR Web Token
   (CWT)', which is a compact means of representing claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  To protect the claims inside the
   CWT the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specification is
   re-used.

   The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
   "cot".

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [1].

   This document reuses terminology and definitions from the CBOR [6]
   and COSE [4] specifications.

   The following data types are used in this document:

   StringOrURI:

      A CBOR major type 3, string value, with the additional requirement
      that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, any value
      containing a ":" character MUST be a URI [3].  StringOrURI values
      are compared as case-sensitive strings with no transformations or
      canonicalizations applied.

   DateTime:

      The date/time strings are defined in Section 2.4.1 in RFC 7049 [2]
      as a CBOR major type 6, with tag value 0.

3.  Claims

   The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is
   context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.
   Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
   understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
   the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
   by implementations MUST be ignored.

3.1.  Claim Names

   None of the claims defined below are intended to be mandatory to use
   or mandatory implement.  They rather provide a starting point for a
   set of useful, interoperable claims.  Applications using CWTs should
   define which specific claims they use and when they are required or
   optional.

3.1.1.  iss (Issuer) Claim

   The "iss" (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the
   CWT.  The "iss" value is a case-sensitive string containing a
   StringOrURI value.

3.1.2.  sub (Subject) Claim

   The "sub" (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the
   subject of the CWT.  The claims in a CWT are normally statements
   about the subject.  The subject value MUST either be scoped to be
   locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.
   The processing of this claim is generally application specific.  The
   "sub" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI
   value.

3.1.3.  aud (Audience) Claim

   The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the CWT is
   intended for.  Each principal intended to process the CWT MUST
   identify itself with a value in the audience claim.  If the principal
   processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the
   "aud" claim when this claim is present, then the CWT MUST be
   rejected.  In the general case, the "aud" value is an array of case-
   sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value.  In the
   special case when the CWT has one audience, the "aud" value MAY be a
   single case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.

3.1.4.  exp (Expiration Time) Claim

   The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on
   or after which the CWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
   processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
   MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
   Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
   a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number
   containing a DateTime value.

3.1.5.  nbf (Not Before) Claim

   The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the CWT
   MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of the "nbf"
   claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to
   the not-before date/time listed in the "nbf" claim.  Implementers MAY
   provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to
   account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number containing a
   DateTime value.

3.1.6.  iat (Issued At) Claim

   The "iat" (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the CWT was
   issued.  This claim can be used to determine the age of the CWT.  Its
   value MUST be a number containing a DateTime value.

3.1.7.  cti (CWT ID) Claim

   The "cti" (CWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the CWT.
   The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that
   there is a negligible probability that the same value will be
   accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application
   uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values
   produced by different issuers as well.  The "cti" claim can be used
   to prevent the CWT from being replayed.  The "cti" value is a case-
   sensitive string of CBOR major type 3.

3.1.8.  cks (COSE Key Structure) Claim

   The "cks" (COSE Key Structure) claim holds members representing a
   COSE Key Structure.  The members of the structure can be found in
   Section 7.1 of [4].  The "cti" value is a case-sensitive string of
   CBOR major type 2, byte string.

5.  CBOR Web Token Example

   This section illustrates a CWT in the CBOR diagnostic notation.  This
   example CWT was issued by the AS identified as
   "coap://as.example.com" in the "iss" (issuer) claim.  The CWT is only
   valid at a resource server at "coap://light.example.com".  Its
   validity is 2 minutes.

   {
     "iss": "coap://as.example.com",
     "aud": "coap://light.example.com",
     "exp": 1444064944,
     "iat": 1443944944
   }

          Figure 2: CWT Example in the CBOR Diagnostic Notation.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security of the CWT is dependent on the protection offered by
   COSE.  Without protecting the claims contained in a CWT an adversary
   is able to modify, add or remove claims.  Since the claims conveyed
   in a CWT are used to make authorization decisions it is not only
   important to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that the
   recipient is able to authenticate the party that collected the claims
   and created the CWT.  Without trust of the recipient in the party
   that created the CWT no sensible authorization decision can be made.
   Furthermore, the creator of the CWT needs to carefully evaluate each
   claim value prior to including it in the CWT so that the recipient
   can be assured about the correctness of the provided information.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section will create a registry for CWT claims, possibly relating
   them to the JWT Claims Registry.

   for the Internet of Things using OAuth 2.0" [5] with the help of
