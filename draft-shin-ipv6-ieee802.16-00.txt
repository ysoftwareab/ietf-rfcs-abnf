Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks        September 2005


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16d/e [IEEE802.16][IEEE802.16e] supports MSs (Subscriber
   Stations) moving at vehiclar speeds and thereby specifies a system
   for combined fixed and mobile broadband wireless access.

   As the deployment of IEEE 802.16 networks progresses, the IEEE 802.16
   MSs will be connected on IPv6 networks.  The characteristics of IEEE
   802.16 networks put special considerations on how IPv6 used.  This
   document describes considerations on IPv6 adoption in IEEE 802.16
   networks.

1.1.  Scope of this Document

   This document presents issues with discussion on the use of IPv6
   protocols when operating over IEEE 802.16 networks.  This document
   classifies the issues into six groups :

   Basic IP

      In this part, basic IPv6 issues such as Neighbor Discovery, IPv6
      packet transmission, addressing, and IPv6 control/management
      protocols are discussed.

1.2.  Terminology

   SS:

      Subscriber Station.  A general equipment set providing
      connectivity between subscriber equipment and a BS.

   MS:

      Mobile Station.  A station in the mobile service intended to be
      used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points.  A
      mobile station (MS) is always a subscriber station (SS) unless
      specifically excepted otherwise in this document.

   BS:

      Base Station.  A generalized equipment set providing connectivity,
      management and control of MS connection.  A unidirectional mapping
      between BS and MS medium access control (MAC) peers for the
      purpose of transporting a service flow's traffic.  Connections are
      identified by a conntion identifier (CID).  All traffic is carried
      on a connection.

   CID:

      Connection IDentifier.  A 16-bit value that identifies a
      connection to equivalent peers in the MAC of the BS and the MS.
      It maps to a service flow identifier (SFID), which also defines
      QoS parameters of the service flow associated with that
      connection.

   MBS:

      Multicast and Broadcast Services.  Some globally defined service
      flows may carry broadcast or multicast information that should be
      delivered to a plurality of SS or MS.

1.3.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Assumptions and Problem Statement

   In order to introduce IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 networks, characteristics
   of IEEE 802.16 network and considerations on IPv6 adoption should be
   carefully surveyed.

   IEEE 802.16d [IEEE802.16] specifies the air interface, including the
   medium access control layer and multiple phisical layer
   specifications, of fixed broadband wireless access (BWA) systems
   supporting multiple services in the 10-66 GHZ bands.  Also, operation
   of IEEE 802.16e [IEEE802.16e]is limited to licensed bands sutiable
   for mobility below 6 GHz.

   IEEE 802.16 supports two modes such as 2-way PMP (Point-to-
   Multipoint) and Mesh topology wireless networks.  In this document,
   we focus on 2-way PMP topology wireless networks.

   Some of the characteristics of IEEE 802.16 networks are :


   MS and BS links resemble a point-to-ponit link:

      In PMP, there are two kinds of nodes such as MS and BS.  The
      downlink, from the BS to the user, operates on a central BS.  MS
      shares the uplink to the BS on a demand basis.  The BS controls
      packet transmission for the uplink and the downlink.  For packet
      transmission between a MS and a BS, a connection should be
      established between the MS and the BS.  A connection is
      unidirectional and has a QoS specification.  Therefore, IEEE
      802.16 needs two connections for bidirectional communication.  In
      addition, it defines a multicast/broadcast connection for multiple
      users to receive the same packets per one transmission.

   MBS has different characteristics with IP multicast services:

      Two types of access to multicast and broadcast services (MBS) may
      be supported: single-BS access and multi-BS access.  Single-BS
      access is implemented over multicast and broadcast transport
      connections within one BS, while multi-BS access is implemented by
      transmitting data from Service Flow(s) over multiple BS.  It may
      be different with traditional IP multicast schemes.

   CID is used to identify a connection:

      In general IEEE 802.x networks, MAC address is used to generate
      IPv6 addresses (link-local, global, etc.) and transmit packets at
      link layer.  But, In IEEE 802.16 networks, CID is used to identify
      a connection to equivalent peers in the MAC of the BS and the MS.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks        September 2005


      Actually, existing MAC address is not necessary.

   The QoS has different semantics with IP QoS (e.g., diffserv):

      In IEEE 802.16 networks, a connection is unidirectional and has a
      QoS specification.  The QoS has different semantics with IP QoS
      (e.g., diffserv).  Mapping CID to Service Flow IDentifier (SFID)
      defines QoS parameters of the service flow associated with that
      connection.  In order to interwork with IP QoS, IP QoS (e.g.,
      diffserv, or flow label for IPv6) mapping should be provided.
      Note that this draft does not address QoS consideration at this
      phase.

3.  Basic IP

3.1.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, some Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461] messages
   can be unnecessary in certain cases, since MS and BS links resemble a
   point-to-point link; hence, the MS's only neighbor is the default
   router, BS that is already known through Router Discovery which is
   performed by link-layer mechanisms.  Also, Neighbor Discovery packets
   with a multicast detination address (e.g., all-node-multicast, or
   all-router-multicast addresses) are also transmitted as normal IEEE
   802.16 MAC frames, as the same as regular unicast packets.  Normal
   802.16 MAC header does not include MAC addresses.  Instead, in order
   to identify connections to equivalent peers in the MAC of the BS and
   the MS, CID is used.  In certain cases, multicast CID can be provided
   for in the downlink.  It can be useful to tranmit efficiently link-
   local multicast destination packets (e.g, Router Advertisements) from
   BS to MSs.  The packet transmission issues are discussed in section
   3.2.

   Note that considerations of Neighbor Discovery in IEEE 802.16
   networks is being discussed in other document [I-D.lee-ndp-
   ieee802.16].

   Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages can be
   classified into three functions; Address Resolution, Neighbor
   Unreachabilit Detection and Duplcate Address Detection.  Also, Router
   Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages are used for Router
   and Prefix Discovery.

3.1.1.  Address Resolution

   Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages for address
   resolution delivered between MS and BS are not needed, since MS and
   BS links resemble a point-to-point link; hence, the MS's only
   neighbor is the BS that is already known through Router Discovery
   which is performed by link configuration mechanisms.  Actually,
   Neighbor Cache is unnecessary.  Also, CID is used for link-layer
   transmission.  Thus, CID connection state is maintained, instead of
   Negibor Cache, The MS uses CID which is provideded to each connection
   by BS.  It must ensure the uniqueness of such connection on the link.

3.1.2.  Neighbor Unreachability Detection

   In general, Neighbor Unreachability Detection is used for all paths
   between hosts and neighboring nodes.  This fuction is used between MS
   and BS, since the MS's only neighbor is the BS.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks        September 2005


   Neighbor Unreachability Detection portion of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   protocol is not needed, since MS and BS don't maintain Neighbor
   Cache.  But MS and BS must know their neighbor reachability at IP
   layer in certain cases.  A BS is considered reachable if the MS has
   recently received a confirmation that packets sent recently to the
   neighbor were received by its IP layer.  Reachability confirmation
   can be gathered in two ways: hints from upper layer protocols that
   indicate a connection is making "forward progress", or from link
   layer trigger mechanisms in IEEE 802.16 networks.

3.1.3.  Duplcate Address Detection

   Usallay, BS shall assign a prefix that is unique to an MS.
   Therefore, this avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate Address
   Detection.  The allocation of a prefix to a MS will alow the MSs to
   implement the IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration [RFC2462] and
   privacy extension [RFC3041] without need for further Duplcate Address
   Detection.

   However, if BS asssigns a single prefix to its all of attached MS,
   Duplicate Address Detection must send Neighbor Solicitation messages
   with an unspecified source address targeting its own tentative
   address.  In order to efficiently perform a multicast Neighbor
   Advertisement for response, a BS can perform proxy Neighbor
   Advertisements for one or more other MSs.  In certain this, multicast
   CID can be used to to send the proxy Neighbor Advertisements to the
   MSs in the downlink.

   It might be dependent on implementation of IPv6 addressing/allocation
   model.  This issus is also discussed in section 3.3.

3.1.4.  Router and Prefix Discovery

   Acually, Router Discovery is already performed by link layer
   configuration mechanisms.  As for the Prefix Discovery, BS trasmits
   Router Advertisements that contain Prefix Information to the
   advertising interface whose corresponding AdvSendAdvertisements flag
   is TRUE.  The AdvSendAdvertisements flag must set when CID value is
   set at an interface.  An BS must not send Router Advertisements out
   any interface that is not an advertising interface.  In this case,
   multicast CID can be used to to transmit the Router Advertisements to
   the MSs in the downlink.

   To obtain Router Advertisements quickly, a MS can sends Router
   Solicitations to its BS.  In this case, MS's CID is used to identify
   the MS.

3.1.5.  Redirect Function

   Redirect message is not necessary in IEEE 802.16 networks, since the
   MS's only router is the BS.

3.2.  Transmission of IPv6 Packets

   IEEE 802.16 MAC header format is described in [IEEE802.16].

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |H|E|   Type    |R|C|EKS|R|LEN  |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |    LEN LSB    |    CID MSB    |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |    CID LSB    |    HCS        |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Figure 1: IEEE 802.16 MAC header format

   It is importmant to see that there is no MAC address in IEEE 802.16
   MAC header format.  Similar to general point-to-point links, MAC
   address is not used for link-layer transmission.  Hence, mapping
   unicast or multicast addresses to IEEE 802.16 MAC addresses is
   unnecessary.  Also. link-local addressess may be not needed.
   Instead, CID is used to identify connections to equivalent peers in
   the MAC of the BS and the MS in IEEE 802.16 networks.  In certain
   cases, multicast CID can be provided for in the downlink.  It can be
   useful to tranmit efficiently link-local multicast destination
   packets in the downlink.

3.3.  IPv6 Addressing

   There are two possiblities to allocate IPv6 prefix in 802.16
   networks.  The simple method is to assign a unique prefix to an MS.
   This avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate Address Detection.

   Second method is to assign a single prefix to its all of attached
   MSs.  In this case, Duplicate Address Detection must be supported.

   It might be dependent on implementation of IPv6 addressing/allocation
   model.  This issus should be intensively researached later, since it
   will affect the protocol implementation of Duplcate Address
   Detection.

3.4.  IP Control/Management Protocols

   In IPv6 protocols, there is a lot of control/management protocols
   including ICMP, DHCP, SNMP, DNS, etc.

   It is important to see that some of these protocols use link-local
   multicast destination addresses.  Within IEEE 802.16 networks, MSs
   connect to their BSs via point-to-ponit links.  Like some of Neighbor
   Discovery protocols in IEEE 802.16, these pakcets with link-local
   multicast destination addresses are transmitted as normal IEEE 802.16
   MAC frames, as the same as regular unicast packets.  Instead, CID is
   used to identify a connection to equivalent peers in the MAC of the
   BS and the MS.  Also, multicast CID can be used to tranmit
   efficiently these packets in the downlink.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks        September 2005


4.  Mobility

   As for the mobility management, the movement between BSs is handled
   by Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].  Also, in certain cases (e.g., fast
   handover [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fast-mipv6]) the link mobility information
   must be available on Mobile IPv6.

4.1.  Mobile IPv6

   Mobile IPv6 defines that movement detection uses Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection to detect when the default router is no
   longer bi-directionally reachable, in which case the mobile node must
   discover a new default router.  Periodic Router Advertisement for the
   rechability and the movement detection may be unnecessary becasue
   IEEE 802.16 MAC provides the reachabilty by the Ranging procedure and
   the movement detection by the Handoff procdure.

4.2.  Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers

   In addition, IEEE 802.16 defines L2 trigger whether refresh of a IP
   address is required during the handoff.  Through a handoff is
   occured, an additional Router Discovery procedure is not required in
   case of intra-subnet handoff.  Also, faster handoff may be occured by
   the L2 trigger in case of inter-subnet hnadoff.

   Also, IEEE 802.16g which is under-developed defines L2 trigger for
   link status auch as link-up, link-down, handoff-start.  These L2
   trigger may make the mobile IPv6 procedure more efficient and faster.
   In addition, Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover assumes the support from the
   link-layer technology, but the particular link-layer information
   available, as well as the timing of its availability (before, during
   or after a handover has occurred), differs according to the
   particular link-layer technology in use.

   This issue is also being dicussed in [I-D.jang-mipshop-fh80216e].

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks        September 2005


5.  Multicast

   In order to support multicast services in IEEE 802.16, Multicast
   Listener Discovery [RFC2710] must be supported between MS and BS.
   Also, interworking with IP multicast protocols and MBS should be
   considered.

5.1.  Multicast Listener Discovery

   Within IEEE 802.16 networks, an MS connect to its default router, BS
   via point-to-point links.  Multicast Listener Discovery sends link-
   local multicast destination queries and reports.  The packets are
   transmitted as normal IEEE 802.16 MAC frames, as the same as regular
   unicast packets.  Especially, multicast CID can be used to transmit
   efficiently query packets in the downlink.

   There are exactly two IP devices connected to the point-to-point
   link, and no attempt is made (at the link-layer) to suppress the
   forwarding of multicast traffic.  Consequently, sending Multicast
   Listener Discovery reports for link-local addresses in IEEE 802.16
   networks environment may not always be necessary.  Multicast Listener
   Discovery is needed for multicast group knowledge that is not link-
   local.

5.2.  Interworking with IP Multicast and MBS

   MBS defines Multicast and Broadcast Services, but actually, MBS seems
   to be broadcast service, not multicasting.  MBS adheres to broadcast
   service, while taditional IP multicast scheme defines multicast
   routing using shared tree or source-specific tree to deliver packets
   efficiently.

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, two types of access to multicast and
   broadcast services (MBS) may be supported: single-BS access and
   multi-BS access.  Therefore, these two type of services may be
   roughly mapped into Source-Specific Multicast and Any-Source
   Multicast, respectively.

   It should be intensively researched later, since MBS will be one of
   killer services in IEEE 802.16 networks.

6.  Security

6.1.  IPsec

   IPsec is a fundamental part of IPv6.  Unlike IPv4, IPsec for IPv6 may
   be used within global end-to-end architecture.  But, we don't have
   PKIs across organization and IPsec isn't integrated with IEEE 802.16
   network mobility management.

6.2.  Security Threat Analysis

   IEEE 802.16 networks threats may be different with IPv6 and IPv6
   transition threat models [I-D.ietf-v6ops-security-overview].  It will
   be discussed later.

7.  Multiple Interface with Different Properties

   If an MS has additional interfaces on which IP is used, (such as
   Ethernet, WLAN then there may be additional problems for the device.

   Some of these problems are :

   Protocol inconsitancy problems with the same fuctionalities:

      If an MS has additional interfaces on which IP is used, We need to
      figure out protocol inconsitancy if there are protocol issues
      (modification) in IEEE 802.16 networks.  Two or more different
      version of protocols (e.g., NDP) may be required within TCP/IP
      stack on the same MS.

   Roaming/movement problems between heterogenous networks:

      will be discussed later.

   MS multi-homing problems:

      will be discussed later.
