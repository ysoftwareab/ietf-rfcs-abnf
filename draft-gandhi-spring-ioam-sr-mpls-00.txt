                  draft-gandhi-spring-ioam-sr-mpls-00


Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the data packet while the
   packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  This
   document defines how IOAM data fields are transported with the
   Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) encapsulation.

1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses a
   particular network domain.  The term "in-situ" refers to the fact
   that the IOAM data fields are added to the data packets rather than
   being sent within probe packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  

   This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported with the
   Segment Routing with MPLS data plane
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] encapsulation.  

   The IOAM data fields carried are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], and can be used for various use-cases
   including Performance Measurement (PM).

3.  IOAM Data Field Encapsulation in SR-MPLS Header

   SR-MPLS encapsulation is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].  IOAM data fields are carried
   in the SR-MPLS header, as an IOAM data fields.  The different IOAM
   data fields defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] are added as TLVs. 
   More than one TLV can be present in the IOAM data fields.  The IOAM
   Indicator Label (value TBA1) is added at the bottom of the MPLS label
   stack to indicate the presence of the IOAM data fields in the header.

           Figure 1: IOAM data encapsulation in SR-MPLS Header

   IOAM Indicator Label is defined in this document as value TBA1.

   The fields related to the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in the
   SR-MPLS header are defined as follows:

    IOAM-Type:  8-bit field defining the IOAM Option type, as defined in
      Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

    IOAM HDR LEN:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IOAM HDR in
      4-octet units.

    RESERVED:  8-bit reserved field MUST be set to zero upon
      transmission and ignored upon receipt.

    IOAM Option and Data Space:  IOAM option header and data is present
      as defined by the IOAM-Type field, and is defined in Section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].


4.  Procedure

   This section summarizes the procedure for IOAM data encapsulation in
   SR-MPLS.

   o  The ingress node inserts the IOAM Indicator Label and IOAM TLV in
 


Gandhi, et al.           Expires April 26, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     In-situ OAM for SR-MPLS Data plane   October 23, 2018


      the MPLS header.

   o  On the ultimate node where the last MPLS label is popped from the
      header, the node "forwards and punts the timestamped copy" of the
      data packet with IOAM TLV when the node recognizes the IOAM
      Indicator Label.

   o  The ultimate node also pops the IOAM Indicator Label and the IOAM
      data fields from the MPLS header.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/mpls-label-values/mpls-label-
   values.xml>).  IANA is requested to allocate IOAM Indicator Label
   value from the "Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values" registry:

    +---------------+-------------------------+---------------+
    | Value         | Description             | Reference     |
    +---------------+-------------------------+---------------+
    | TBA1          | IOAM Indicator Label    | This document |
    +---------------+-------------------------+---------------+


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of SR-MPLS are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], and the security
   considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   IOAM is considered a "per domain" feature, where one or several
   operators decide on leveraging and configuring IOAM according to
   their needs.  Still, operators need to properly secure the IOAM
   domain to avoid malicious configuration and use, which could include
   injecting malicious IOAM packets into a domain.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Shwetha Bhandari and Vengada Prasad
   Govindan for the discussions on IOAM.
