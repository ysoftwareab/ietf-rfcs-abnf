Abstract

   IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support
   ASON routing requirements in [RFC5787].  No extensions were defined
   for bandwidth advertisement as the Interface Switching Capability
   Descriptor may optionally be included for each layer of a multi-layer
   link [RFC4202].  However, for some types SONET/SDH links there can be
   several data plane layers supported by a single link, and as a 
   result a need to carry several copies of the ISCD.

   This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for
   SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD
   sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with advertisement
   of bandwidth for OTN.

1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T defines the architecture of the Automatically Switched
   Optical Network (ASON) in [G.8080].

   [RFC4258] details the routing requirements for the GMPLS suite of
   routing protocols to support the capabilities and functionality of
   ASON control planes identified in [G.7715] and in [G.7715.1].

   [RFC4652] evaluates the IETF Link State Routing Protocols against the
   requirements identified in [RFC4258]. Section 7.1 of [RFC4652]
   summarizes the capabilities to be provided by OSPFv2 [RFC2328] in
   support of ASON routing. [RFC5787] is an Experimental RFC that
   defines extensions to OSPFv2 to support these requirements.  It
   notes that the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor may 
   be included for each layer of a multi-layer link [RFC4202] to meet
   ASON needs.  However, for some types SONET/SDH links there can be
   several data plane layers supported by a single link, and as a 
   result a need to carry several copies of the ISCD.

   This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for
   SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD
   sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with advertisement
   of bandwidth for OTN.


2.  Optimization of bandwidth advertisement for SONET/SDH

2.1 Requirements for Multi-layer SONET/SDH Links

   [RFC4652] notes that in the ASON context, bandwidth accounting 
   representations are possible, taking the form of a set of tuples 
   <signal_type; number of unallocated timeslots>, and that this    
   representation may also require definition of additional signal 
   types (from those defined in [RFC4606]) to represent support of
   contiguously concatenated signals,
   i.e., STS-(3xN)c SPE / VC-4-Nc, N = 4, 16, 64, 256.

   It notes that the ISCD defined in [RFC4202] can be used to
   support ASON without requiring any bandwidth accounting 
   change from an LSR perspective.  However, the ISCD defined
   in [RFC4202} must be advertised once per signal type 
   (identified by the Minimum Reservable Bandwidth value) in
   order to provide an accurate advertisement of bandwidth
   for each signal.  For SONET/SDH links, it is common to support
   4-5 signal types (e.g., STS-1, 3c, 12c, 48c and 192c) at once,

   and advertisement of 4-5 ISCD sub-TLVs would consume about
   200 bytes as compared to 20-30 bytes for a tuple format.

   Most of the ISCD bytes are required to advertise 8 levels of 
   priority.  We believe this overhead can be reduced as (a) ASON
   specifications do not identify priority as an ASON service; and
   (b) TDM networks generally to not support preemption priority 
   and do not require 8 levels of priority.


2.2.  Link Component Availability Sub-TLV

   A Link Component Availability Sub-TLV is defined that carries an
   indication of SONET/SDH bandwidth at multiple link component signal
   types as supplementary information to the ISCD sub-TLV.   

   When multiple SONET/SDH signal types are advertised, a single ISCD
   is given for the smallest bandwidth signal type and the LCA sub-TLV 
   is also advertised to provide compact bandwidth availability 
   advertisement for all signal types.  

   The type used for the sub-TLV is TBD.

   The following format is defined:

    0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |        Type (tbd)             |        Length = 8 + n*4       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Switching Cap |   Encoding    |          Reserved             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|    Reserved   |          Reserved             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                                                               |
    //                             ...                             //
    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   
   Note: n defines the number of signal types supported on this link,
   and thus has a value greater than or equal to 1.  Inherited from
   [RFC4202], the Switching Capability field and the Encoding field MUST
   take the following values for Sonet/SDH interfaces: Switching
   Capability (8 bits)=100 (TDM).  Encoding (8 bits)=5 (Sonet/SDH).

   Priority flags (8 bits): Indicate the priorities supported on the
   advertised link (0 is highest and 7 is lowest). When the flag is set,
   the corresponding priority is supported and for each signal type, a
   "row" (i.e. signal type + unreserved bandwidth field) is included,
   in order from the highest to the lowest priority.  

   If no priority is supported, just the 0 priority MUST be advertised.

   Signal Type (8 bits) (as defined in [RFC4606]):

   Value  Type (Elementary Signal)
   -----  ------------------------
    5     STS-1 SPE / VC-3 [RFC4606]
    6     STS-3c SPE / VC-4 [RFC4606]
    TBD   STS-12c SPE/VC-4-4c 
    TBD   STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c 
    TBD   STS-192c SPE/VC-4-64c 

   Number of Unallocated Timeslots (24 bits):

   Specifies the number of identical unallocated timeslots per Signal
   Type and per TE Link.  As such, the initial value(s) of this TLV
   indicates the total capacity in terms of number of timeslots per TE
   link.  The signal type included in the BW announcement is specific to
   the layer link being reported and is not derived from some other
   signal type (e.g.  STS-48c is not announced as 16 x STS-3c).

   For instance on an OC-192/STM-64 interface either the number of
   STS-3c SPE/VC-4 unallocated timeslots is initially equal to 64, or
   the number of STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c unallocated timeslots is equal to
   4 or even a combination of both type of signals depending on the
   interface capabilities.  Once one of these timeslots is occupied
   either by being allocated for a connection at the same or a larger
   signal type or by being blocked due to the allocation of part of
   the timeslot for a connection at a smaller signal type, the number
   of unallocated timeslots is decreased by the number of timeslots
   this connection implies.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will allocate codepoints for the new Link Component
   Allocation sub-TLV and its associated sub-fields from the
   standard range.  Three new Signal Type values are needed.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an optimization for SONET/SDH link bandwidth
   advertisement consistent with the requirements in [RFC4258] and 
   [RFC4652].  No additional security issues are identified.
