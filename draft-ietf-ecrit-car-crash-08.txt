           Next-Generation Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls
                   draft-ietf-ecrit-car-crash-08.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services
   mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed
   by vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious
   incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying
   vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash or incident.
   Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic Crash Notification"
   (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the
   case of manual trigger.  The "Advanced" qualifier refers to the
   ability to carry a richer set of data.

   This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency
   Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location data
   (often referred to as "crash data" even though there is not
   necessarily a crash).  An external specification for the data format,
   contents, and structure are referenced in this document.

   This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation pan-
   European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency
   calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe and other regions).
   However, this document specifies a different set of vehicle (crash)
   data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than
   the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an extension
   of the eCall document, with the primary differences being that this
   document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and
   extends the eCall metadata/control object to permit greater
   functionality.  This document also describes legacy (circuit-
   switched) ACN systems and their migration to next-generation
   emergency calling, to provide background information and context.

2.  Introduction

   Emergency calls made by in-vehicle systems (e.g., automatically in
   the event of a crash or serious incident or manually by a vehicle
   occupant) assist in significantly reducing road deaths and injuries
   by allowing emergency services to respond quickly and appropriately
   to the specifics of the incident, often with better location
   accuracy.

   Drivers often have a poor location awareness, especially outside of
   major cities, at night and when away from home (especially abroad).
   In the most crucial cases, the victim(s) might not be able to call
   because they have been injured or trapped.

   For more than two decades, some vehicles have been equipped with
   telematics systems that, among other features, place an emergency
   call automatically in the event of a crash or manually in response to
   an emergency call button.  Such systems generally have on-board
   location determination systems that make use of satellite-based
   positioning technology, inertial sensors, gyroscopes, etc., which can
   provide an accurate position for the vehicle.  Such built-in systems
   can take advantage of the benefits of being integrated into a
   vehicle, such as more power capacity, ability to have larger or
   specialized antenna, ability to be engineered to avoid or minimise
   degradation by vehicle glass coatings, interference from other

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   vehicle systems, etc.  Thus, the PSAP can be provided with a good
   estimate of where the vehicle is during an emergency.  Vehicle
   manufacturers are increasingly adopting such systems, both for the
   safety benefits and for the additional features and services they
   enable (e.g., remote engine diagnostics, remote door unlock, stolen
   vehicle tracking and disabling, etc.).

   The general term for such systems is Automatic Crash Notification
   (ACN) or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN).  "ACN" is
   used in this document as a general term.  ACN systems transmit some
   amount of data specific to the incident, referred to generally as
   "crash data" (the term is commonly used even though there might not
   have been a crash).  While different systems transmit different
   amounts of crash data, standardized formats, structures, and
   mechanisms are needed to provide interoperability among systems and
   PSAPs.

   As of the date of this document, currently deployed in-vehicle
   telematics systems are circuit-switched and lack a standards-based
   ability to convey crash data directly to the PSAP (generally relying
   on either a human advisor or an automated text-to-speech system to
   provide the PSAP call taker with some crash data orally, or in some
   cases via a proprietary mechanism).  In most cases, the PSAP call
   taker needs to first realize that the call is related to a vehicle
   incident, and then listen to the data and transcribe it.  Circuit-
   switched ACN systems are referred to here as CS-ACN.

   The transition to next-generation calling in general, and emergency
   calling in particular, provides an opportunity to vastly improve the
   scope, breadth, reliability and usefulness of crash data during an
   emergency by allowing it to be transmitted during call set-up, and to
   be automatically processed by the PSAP and made available to the call
   taker in an integrated, automated way, as well as provide the ability
   for a PSAP call taker to request that a vehicle take certain actions,
   such as flashing lights or unlocking doors.  In addition, vehicle
   manufacturers are provided an opportunity to take advantage of the
   same standardized mechanisms for data transmission and request
   processing for internal use if they wish (such as telemetry between
   the vehicle and a service center for both emergency and non-emergency
   uses, including location-based services, multi-media entertainment
   systems, remote door unlocking, and road-side assistance
   applications).

   Next-generation ACN provides an opportunity for such calls to be
   recognized and processed as such during call set-up, and routed to an
   equipped PSAP where the vehicle data is available to assist the call
   taker in assessing and responding to the situation.  Next-generation
   (IP-based) ACN systems are referred to here as NG-ACN.

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   An ACN call can initiated by a vehicle occupant or automatically
   initiated by vehicle systems in the event of a serious incident.
   (The "A" in "ACN" does stand for "Automatic," but the term is broadly
   used to refer to the class of calls that are placed by an in-vehicle
   system (IVS) or Telematics Service Providers (TSP) and that carry
   incident-related data as well as voice.)  Automatically triggered
   calls indicate a car crash or some other serious incident (e.g., a
   fire).  Manually triggered calls are often reports of observed
   crashes or serious hazards (such as impaired drivers or roadway
   debris).  Depending on the design, manually triggered calls might be
   more likely to be accidental.

   This document describes how the IETF mechanisms for IP-based
   emergency calls, including [RFC6443] and
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data], are used to provide the realization
   of next-generation ACN.

   This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation pan-
   European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency
   calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe and other regions), as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].  However, this document
   specifies a different set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically, the
   Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than the eCall Minimum Set
   of Data (MSD).  This document is an extension of
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall], with the differences being that this document
   makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and adds
   extension elements, attributes, and values to the eCall metadata/
   control object defined in that document.

   The Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO) and
   the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) have jointly
   developed a standardized set of incident-related vehicle data for ACN
   use, called the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) [VEDS].  Such data
   is often referred to as crash data although it is applicable in
   incidents other than crashes.

   VEDS provides a standard data set for the transmission, exchange, and
   interpretation of vehicle-related data.  A standard data format
   allows the data to be generated by an IVS or TSP and interpreted by
   PSAPs, emergency responders, and medical facilities.  It includes
   incident-related information such as airbag deployment, location and
   compass orientation of the vehicle, spatial orientation of the
   vehicle (e.g., upright, on its side or top or a bumper), various
   sensor data that can indicate the potential severity of the crash and
   the likelihood of severe injuries to the vehicle occupants, etc.
   This data better informs the PSAP and emergency responders as to the
   type of response that might be needed.  Some of this information has
   been included in U.S. government guidelines for field triage of



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017                [Page 6]

   injured patients [triage-2008] [triage-2011].  These guidelines are
   designed to help responders identify the potential existence of
   severe internal injuries and to make critical decisions about how and
   where a patient needs to be transported.

   This document registers the 'application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml'
   MIME content-type, and registers the 'VEDS' entry in the Emergency
   Call Additional Data registry.

   VEDS is an XML structure (see [VEDS]) transported in SIP using the
   'application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml' MIME content-type.  The
   'VEDS' entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry is used
   to construct a 'purpose' parameter value to indicate VEDS data in a
   Call-Info header (as described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data]).

   VEDS is a versatile structure that can accomodate varied needs.
   However, if additional sets of data are determined to be needed
   (e.g., in the future or in different regions), the steps to enable
   each data block are very briefly summarized below:

   o  A standardized format and encoding (such as XML) is defined and
      published by a Standards Development Organization (SDO)

   o  A MIME Content-Type is registered for it (typically under the
      'Application' media type) with a sub-type starting with
      'EmergencyCallData.'

   o  An entry for the block is added to the Emergency Call Additional
      Data Blocks sub-registry (established by
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data]); the registry entry is the root
      of the MIME sub-type (not including the 'EmergencyCallData' prefix
      and any suffix such as '+xml')

   A next-generation In-Vehicle System (IVS) or TSP transmits crash data
   by encoding it in a standardized and registered format (such as VEDS)
   and attaching it to a SIP message as a MIME body part.  The body part
   is identified by its MIME content-type (such as 'application/
   EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml') in the Content-Type header field of the
   body part.  The body part is assigned a unique identifier which is
   listed in a Content-ID header field in the body part.  The SIP
   message is marked as containing the crash data by adding a Call-Info
   header field at the top level of the message.  This Call-Info header
   field contains a CID URL referencing the body part's unique
   identifier, and a 'purpose' parameter identifying the data as the
   crash data per the registry entry.  The 'purpose' parameter's value
   is 'EmergencyCallData.' plus the value associated with the data type
   in the registry; for VEDS data, "purpose=EmergencyCallData.VEDS".

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   These mechanisms are thus used to place emergency calls that are
   identifiable as ACN calls and that carry one or more standardized
   crash data objects in an interoperable way.

   Calls by in-vehicle systems are placed via cellular networks, which
   might ignore location sent by an originating device in an emergency
   call INVITE, instead attaching their own location (often determined
   in cooperation with the originating device).  Standardized crash data
   structures often include location as determined by the IVS.  A
   benefit of this is that it allows the PSAP to see both the location
   as determined by the cellular network (often in cooperation with the
   originating device) and the location as determined by the IVS.

   This specification inherits the ability to utilize test call
   functionality from Section 15 of [RFC6881].

3.  Document Scope

   This document is focused on how an ACN emergency call is setup and
   incident-related data (including vehicle, sensor, and location data)
   is transmitted to the PSAP using IETF specifications.  For the direct
   model, this is the end-to-end description (between the vehicle and
   the PSAP).  For the TSP model, this describes the call leg between
   the TSP and the PSAP, leaving the call leg between the vehicle and
   the TSP up to the entities involved (i.e., IVS and TSP vendors) who
   are then free to use the same mechanism as for the right-hand side or
   not.

   Note that Europe has a mandated and standardized system for emergency
   calls by in-vehicle systems.  This pan-European system is known as
   "eCall" and is the subject of a separate document,
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall], which this document builds on.  Vehicles
   designed to operate in multiple regions might need to support eCall
   as well as the ACN described here.  In this case, a vehicle IVS might
   determine whether to use eCall or ACN by first determining a region
   or country in which it is located (e.g., from a GNSS location fix
   and/or identity of or information from an MNO).  If other regions
   adopt other data formats, a multi-region vehicle might need to
   support those as well.  This document adopts the call set-up and
   other technical aspects of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall], which uses
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data]; this makes it straightforward to
   use a different data set while keeping other technical aspects
   unchanged.  Hence, both NG-eCall and the NG-ACN mechanism described
   here are compatible, differing primarily in the specific data block
   that is sent (the eCall MSD in the case of NG-eCall, and the APCO/
   NENA VEDS used in this document), and some additions to the metadata/
   control data block.  If other regions adopt their own vehicle data

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   sets, this can be similarly accomodated without changing other
   technical aspects.

4.  Overview of Legacy Deployment Models

   Legacy (circuit-switched) systems for placing emergency calls by in-
   vehicle systems generally have some ability to convey at least
   location and in some cases telematics data to the PSAP.  Most such
   systems use one of three architectural models, which are described
   here as: "Telematics Service Provider" (TSP), "direct", and "paired".
   These three models are illustrated below.

   In the TSP model, both emergency and non-emergency calls are placed
   to a Telematics Service Provider (TSP); a proprietary technique is
   used for data transfer (such as a proprietary in-band modem) between
   the TSP and the vehicle.

   In an emergency, generally the TSP call taker bridges in the PSAP and
   communicates location, crash data (such as impact severity and trauma
   prediction), and other data (such as the vehicle description) to the
   PSAP call taker verbally (in some cases, a proprietary out-of-band
   interface is used).  Since the TSP knows the location of the vehicle
   (from on-board GNSS and sensors), location-based routing is usually
   used to route to the appropriate PSAP.  In some cases, the TSP is
   able to transmit location automatically, using similar techniques as
   for wireless calls.  Typically, a three-way voice call is established
   between the vehicle, the TSP, and the PSAP, allowing communication
   between the PSAP call taker, the TSP call taker, and the vehicle
   occupants (who might be unconscious).

                        Figure 1: Legacy TSP Model.

   In the paired model, the IVS uses a Bluetooth link with a previously-
   paired handset to establish an emergency call with the PSAP (by
   dialing a standard emergency number; 9-1-1 in North America), and
   then communicates location data to the PSAP via text-to-speech; crash
   data might or might not be conveyed also using text-to-speech.  Some
   such systems use an automated voice prompt menu for the PSAP call
   taker (e.g., "this is an automatic emergency call from a vehicle;
   press 1 to open a voice path to the vehicle; press 2 to hear the
   location read out") to allow the call taker to request location data
   via text-to-speech.

   In the direct model, the IVS directly places an emergency call with
   the PSAP by dialing a standard emergency number (9-1-1 in North
   America).  Such systems might communicate location data to the PSAP
   via text-to-speech; crash data might or might not be conveyed using
   text-to-speech.  Some such systems use an automated voice prompt menu
   (e.g., "this is an automatic emergency call from a vehicle; press 1

5.  Migration to Next-Generation

   Migration of emergency calls placed by in-vehicle systems to next-
   generation (all-IP) technology per this document provides a
   standardized mechanism to identify such calls and to present crash
   data with the call, as well as enabling additional communications
   modalities and enhanced functionality.  This allows ACN calls and
   crash data to be automatically processed by the PSAP and made
   available to the call taker in an integrated, automated way.  Because
   the crash data is carried in the initial SIP INVITE (per
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data]) the PSAP can present it to the call
   taker simultaneously with the appearance of the call.  The PSAP can
   also process the data to take other actions (e.g., if multiple calls
   from the same location arrive when the PSAP is busy and a subset of
   them are NG-ACN calls, a PSAP might choose to store the information
   and reject the calls, since the IVS will receive confirmation that
   the information has been successfully received; a PSAP could also
   choose to include a message stating that it is aware of the incident
   and responders are on the way; a PSAP could call the vehicle back
   when a call taker is available).

   Origination devices and networks, PSAPs, emergency services networks,
   and other telephony environments are migrating to next-generation.



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   This provides opportunities for significant enhancement to
   interoperability and functionality, especially for emergency calls
   carrying additional data such as vehicle crash data.  (In the U.S., a
   network specifically for emergency responders is being developed.
   This network, FirstNet, will be next-generation from the start,
   enhancing the ability for data exchange between PSAPs and
   responders.)

   Migration to next-generation (NG) provides an opportunity to
   significantly improve the handling and response to vehicle-initiated
   emergency calls.  Such calls can be recognized as originating from a
   vehicle, routed to a PSAP equipped both technically and operationally
   to handle such calls, and the vehicle-determined location and crash
   data can be made available to the call taker simultaneously with the
   call appearance.  The PSAP can take advantage of enhanced
   functionality, including the ability to request the vehicle to take
   an action, such as sending an updated set of data, converying a
   message to the occupants, flashing lights, unlocking doors, etc.

   Vehicle manufacturers using the TSP model can choose to take
   advantage of the same mechanism to carry telematics data and requests
   and responses between the vehicle and the TSP for both emergency and
   non-emergency calls as are used for the interface with the PSAP.

   A next-generation IVS establishes an emergency call using the
   emergency call solution as described in [RFC6443] and [RFC6881], with
   the difference that the Request-URI indicates an ACN type of
   emergency call, the IVS typically does not perform routing or
   location queries but relies on the carrier for this, and uses Call-
   Info header fields to indicates that vehicle crash and capabilities
   data is attached.  When an ESInet is deployed, the MNO only needs to
   recognize the call as an emergency call and route it to an ESInet.
   The ESInet can recognize the call as an ACN with vehicle data and can
   route the call to an NG-ACN capable PSAP.  Such a PSAP can interpret
   the vehicle data sent with the call and make it available to the call
   taker.

   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] registers new service URN children within the
   "sos" subservice.  These URNs request NG-ACN resources, and
   differentiate between manually and automatically triggered NG-ACN
   calls (which might be subject to different treatment depending on
   policy).  The two service URNs registered in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall]
   are "urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic" and
   "urn:service:sos.ecall.manual".  The same service URNs are used for
   ACN as for eCall since in any region only one of these is supported,
   making a distinction unnecessary.  (Further, PSAP equipment might
   support multiple data formats, allowing a PSAP to handle a vehicle
   that erroneously sent the wrong data object.)



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   Note that in North America, routing queries performed by clients
   outside of an ESInet typically treat all sub-services of "sos"
   identically to "sos" with no sub-service.  However, the Request-URI
   header field retains the full sub-service; route and handling
   decisions within an ESInet or PSAP can take the sub-service into
   account.  For example, in a region with multiple cooperating PSAPs,
   an NG-ACN call might be routed to a PSAP that is NG-ACN capable, or
   one that specializes in vehicle-related incidents.

   Migration of the three architectural models to next-generation (all-
   IP) is described below.

   In the TSP model, the IVS transmits crash and location data to the
   TSP either by re-using the mechanisms and data objects described
   here, or using a proprietary mechanism.  In an emergency, the TSP
   bridges in the PSAP and the TSP transmits crash and other data to the
   PSAP using the mechanisms and data objects described here.  There is
   a three-way call between the vehicle, the TSP, and the PSAP, allowing
   communication between the PSAP call taker, the TSP call taker, and
   the vehicle occupants (who might be unconscious).  The TSP relays
   PSAP requests and vehicle responses.

                  proprietary
      ///----\\\  or standard       +------+     standard       +------+
     ||| IVS ||| ------------------->+ TSP +------------------->+ PSAP |
      \\\----/// crash + other data +------+ crash + other data +------+

                    Figure 4: Next-Generation TSP Model

   The vehicle manufacturer and the TSP can choose to use the same
   mechanisms and data objects on the left call leg in Figure 4 as on
   the right.  (Note that the TSP model can be more difficult when the
   vehicle is in a different country than the TSP (e.g., a US resident
   driving in Canada or Mexico) because of the additional complexity in
   choosing the correct PSAP based on vehicle location performed by a
   TSP in a different country.)

   In the direct model, the IVS communicates crash data to the PSAP
   directly using the mechanisms and data objects described here.

     ///----\\\           NG emergency call              +------+
    ||| IVS |||----------------------------------------->+ PSAP |
     \\\----///          crash + other data              +------+

                  Figure 5: Next-Generation Direct Model

   In the paired model, the IVS uses a Bluetooth link to a previously-
   paired handset to establish an emergency call with the PSAP; it is



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   undefined what facilities are or will be available for transmitting
   crash data through the Bluetooth link to the handset for inclusion in
   an NG emergency call.  Hence, manufacturers that use the paired model
   for legacy calls might choose to adopt either the direct or TSP
   models for next-generation calls.

                                   +---+
      ///----\\\    (undefined)    | H |     standard       +------+
     ||| IVS |||------------------>| S +------------------->+ PSAP |
      \\\----///    (undefined)    +---+ crash + other data +------+

                  Figure 6: Next-Generation Paired Model

   If the call is routed to a PSAP that is not capable of processing the
   vehicle data, the PSAP ignores (or does not receive) the vehicle
   data.  This is detectable by the IVS or TSP when the status response
   to the INVITE (e.., 200 OK) lacks an eCall control structure
   acknowledging receipt of the data [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].  The IVS or
   TSP then proceeds as it would for a CS-ACN call (e.g., verbal
   conveyance of data)

6.  Call Setup

   A next-generation In-Vehicle System (IVS) initiates an NG-ACN call
   with a SIP INVITE using one of the SOS sub-services
   "SOS.ecall.automatic" or "SOS.ecall.manual" in the Request-URI,
   standard sets of crash data and capabilities data encoded in
   standardized and registered formats, attached as additional data
   blocks as specified in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data].  As described in that document,
   each data block is identified by its MIME content-type, and pointed
   to by a CID URL in a Call-Info header with a 'purpose' parameter
   value corresponding to the data block.

   Should new data blocks be needed (e.g., in other regions or in the
   future), the steps required during standardization are:

   o  A set of data is standardized by an SDO or appropriate
      organization

   o  A MIME Content-Type for the crash data set is registered with IANA

      *  If the data is specifically for use in emergency calling, the
         MIME type is normally under the 'application' type with a
         subtype starting with 'EmergencyCallData.'

      *  If the data format is XML, then by convention the name has a
         suffix of '+xml'



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   o  The item is registered in the Emergency Call Additional Data
      registry, as defined in Section 9.1.7 of
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data]

      *  For emergency-call-specific formats, the registered name is the
         root of the MIME Content-Type (not including the
         'EmergencyCallData' prefix and any suffix such as '+xml') as
         described in Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data].

   When placing an emergency call:

   o  The crash data set is created and encoded per its specification

   o  IVS capability data is encoded per the specification in
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] as extended in this document

   o  The crash data set and capabilities data are attached to the
      emergency call INVITE as specified in Section 4.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data], that is, as MIME body parts
      identified by the MIME Content-Type in the body part's Content-
      Type header field

   o  Each body part is assigned a unique identifier label in the
      Content-ID header field of the body part

   o  Call-Info header fields at the top level of the INVITE are added
      that reference the crash data and capabilities data and identify
      each by its MIME root (as registered in the Emergency Call
      Additional Data registry)

      *  The crash and capabilities data are referenced in Call-Info
         header fields by CID URLs that contain the unique Content ID
         assigned to the body part

      *  The crash and capabilities data are identified in the Call-Info
         header fields by a 'purpose' parameter whose value is
         'EmergencyCallData.' concatenated with the specific data
         block's entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry

      *  A Call-Info header field can be either solely to reference one
         item of data (and hence have only the one URL) or can also
         contain other URLs referencing other data

   o  Any additional data sets are included by following the same steps

   The Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) is an XML structure defined by
   the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO) and
   the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) [VEDS].  The



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   'application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml' MIME content-type is used to
   identify it.  The 'VEDS' entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data
   registry is used to construct a 'purpose' parameter value for
   conveying VEDS data in a Call-Info header.

   The VEDS data is attached as a body part with MIME content type
   'application/EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml' which is pointed at by a
   Call-Info URL of type CID with a 'purpose' parameter of
   'EmergencyCallData.VEDS'.

   Entities along the path between the vehicle and the PSAP are able to
   identify the call as an ACN call and handle it appropriately.  The
   PSAP is able to identify the crash data as well as any other
   additional data attached to the INVITE by examining the Call-Info
   header fields for 'purpose' parameters whose values start with
   'EmergencyCallData.'  The PSAP is able to access the data it is
   capable of handling and is interested in by checking the 'purpose'
   parameter values.

   This document extends [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] by reusing the call set-
   up and other normative requirements with the exception that in this
   document, support for the eCall MSD is OPTIONAL and support for VEDS
   in REQUIRED.  This document also extends the metadata/control object
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] by adding new elements, attributes,
   and values.

6.1.  Call Routing

   An Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) is a network operated by or
   on behalf of emergency services authorities.  It handles emergency
   call routing and processing before delivery to a PSAP.  In the
   NG9-1-1 architecture adopted by NENA as well as the NG1-1-2
   architecture adopted by EENA, each PSAP is connected to one or more
   ESInets.  Each originating network is also connected to one or more
   ESInets.  The ESInets maintain policy-based routing rules which
   control the routing and processing of emergency calls.  The
   centralization of such rules within ESInets provides for a cleaner
   separation between the responsibilities of the originating network
   and that of the emergency services network, and provides greater
   flexibility and control over processing of emergency calls by the
   emergency services authorities and PSAPs.  This makes it easier to
   react quickly to unusual situations that require changes in how
   emergency calls are routed or handled (e.g., a natural disaster
   closes a PSAP), as well as ease in making long-term changes that
   affect such routing (e.g., cooperative agreements to specially handle
   calls requiring translation or relay services).

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   In an environment that uses ESInets, the originating network need
   only detect that the service URN of an emergency call is or starts
   with "sos", passing all types of emergency calls to an ESInet.  The
   ESInet is then responsible for routing such calls to an appropriate
   PSAP.  In an environment without an ESInet, the emergency services
   authorities and the originating carriers determine how such calls are
   routed.

7.  eCall Metadata/Control Extensions

   This document extends the eCall metadata/control structure defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] by adding new elements, attributes, and
   values.

      The <ack> element is permitted in a control block sent by the IVS
      to the PSAP, to acknowledge receipt of a request by the PSAP and
      indicate if the request was carried out, when that request would
      not otherwise be acknowledged (if the PSAP requests the vehicle to
      send data and the vehicle does so, the data serves as a success
      acknowledgement).

      A new <capabilities> element is added; used in a control block
      sent from the IVS to the PSAP (e.g., in the initial INVITE) to
      inform the PSAP of the vehicle capabilities.  Child elements
      contain all actions and data types supported by the vehicle and
      all available lamps (lights) and cameras.

      New request values are added to the <request> element to enable
      the PSAP to request the vehicle to perform actions.

   Mandatory Actions (the IVS and the PSAP MUST support):

   o  Transmit data object (VEDS MUST be supported; MSD MAY be
      supported)

   Optional Actions (the IVS and the PSAP MAY support):

   o  Play and/or display static (pre-defined) message
   o  Speak/display dynamic text (text supplied in action)
   o  Flash or turn on or off a lamp (light)
   o  Honk horn
   o  Enable a camera

   The <ack> element indicates the object being acknowledged (i.e., a
   data object or a <request> element), and reports success or failure.

   The <capabilities> element has child <request> elements to indicate
   the actions supported by the IVS.



Gellens, et al.          Expires January 7, 2017               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   The <request> element contains attributes to indicate the request and
   to supply any needed information, and MAY contain a <text> child
   element to contain the text for a dynamic message.  The 'action'
   attribute is mandatory and indicates the specific action.
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] established an IANA registry to contain the
   allowed values; this document adds new values to that registry in
   Table 3.

7.1.  New values for the 'action' attribute'

   The following new "action" values are defined:

   'msg-static' displays or plays a predefined message (translated as
   appropriate for the language of the vehicle's interface).  A registry
   is created in Section 12.5 for messages and their IDs.  Vehicles
   include the highest registered message in their <capabilities>
   element to indicate support for all messages up to and including the
   indicated value.

   'msg-dynamic' displays or speaks (via text-to-speech) a dynamic
   message included in the request.

   'honk' sounds the horn.

   'lamp' turns a lamp (light) on, off, or flashes.

   'enable-camera' adds a one-way media stream (established via SIP re-
   INVITE sent by the vehicle) to enable the PSAP call taker to view a
   feed from a camera.

   Note that there is no 'request' action to play dynamic media (such as
   an audio message).  The PSAP can send a SIP re-INVITE to establish a
   one-way media stream for this purpose.

7.2.  <ack> element extensions

   The <ack> element is extended to be transmitted by the IVS to the
   PSAP to acknowledge receipt of a <request> element that requested the
   IVS to perform an action other than transmitting a data object (e.g.,
   a request to display a message would be acknowledged, but a request
   to transmit a data object would not result in a separate <ack>
   element being sent, since the data object itself serves as
   acknowledgment.)  An <ack> element sent by an IVS references the
   unique ID of the request being acknowledged, indicates whether the
   request was successfully performed, and if not, optionally includes
   an explanation.

   The <ack> element has the following new child elements:

7.2.1.  New Child Element of the <ack> element

   The <ack> element has the following new child element:

   Name:  actionResult
   Usage:  Optional
   Description:  An <actionResult> element indicates the result of an
      action (other than a 'send-data' action).  When an <ack> element
      is in response to a control object with multiple <request>
      elements (that are not 'send-data' actions), the <ack> element
      contains an <actionResult> element for each.
                 The <actionResult> element has the following
      attributes:



      Name:  action
      Usage:  Mandatory
      Type:  token
      Description:  Contains the value of the 'action' attribute of the
         <request> element

      Name:  success
      Usage:  Mandatory
      Type:  Boolean
      Description:  Indicates if the action was successfully
         accomplished

      Name:  reason
      Usage:  Conditional
      Type:  token
      Description:  Used when 'success' is "False", this attribute
         contains a reason code for a failure.  A registry for reason
         codes is defined in Section 12.6.

      Name:  details
      Usage:  optional
      Type:  string
      Description:  Contains further explanation of the circumstances of
         a success or failure.  The contents are implementation-specific
         and human-readable.

   Example:  <actionResult action="msg-dynamic" success="true"/>

7.3.  The <capabilities> element

   The <capabilities> element is transmitted by the IVS to indicate to
   the PSAP its capabilities.  No attributes for this element are
   currently defined.  The following child elements are defined:

7.3.1.  Child Elements of the <capabilities> element

   The <capabilities> element has the following child elements:

   Name:  request
   Usage:  Mandatory
   Description:  The <capabilities> element contains a <request> child
      element per action supported by the vehicle.

      Because support for a 'send-data' action is REQUIRED, a <request>
      child element with a "send-data" 'action' attribute is also
      REQUIRED.  The 'supported-datatypes' attribute is REQUIRED in this
      <request> element within a <capabilities> element, and MUST
      contain at a minimum the 'VEDS' data block value; it SHOULD
      contain all data blocks supported by the IVS.

      All other actions are OPTIONAL.

      If the "msg-static" action is supported, a <request> child element
      with a "msg-static" 'action' attribute is sent, with a 'msgid'

      the vehicle.  A registry is created in Section 12.5 to map 'msgid'
      values to static text messages.  By sending the highest supported
      static message number in its <capabilities> element, the vehicle
      indicates its support for all static messages in the registry up
      to and including that value.

      If the "lamp" action is supported, a <request> child element with
      a "lamp" 'action' is sent, with a 'supported-lamps' attribute set
      to all supported lamp IDs.

      If the "enable-camera" action is supported, a <request> child
      element with an "enable-camera" 'action' is sent, with a
      'supported-cameras' attribute set to all supported camera IDs.

   Examples:
      <request action="send-data" supported-datatypes="VEDS"/>
      <request action="send-data" supported-datatypes="VEDS; eCall.MSD"
      />

7.4.  <request> element extensions

   This document extends the <request> element to be permitted one or
   more times on its own or as a child elements of a <capabilities>
   element.  The following new attributes, values, and child elements
   are defined for the <request> element:

7.4.1.  New Attributes of the <request> element

   The <request> element has the following new attributes:


   Name:  msgid
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  int
   Description:  Mandatory with a "msg-static" action.  Indicates the
      identifier of the static message to be displayed and/or spoken for
      the vehicle occupants.  This document establishes an IANA registry
      for messages and their IDs, in Section 12.5
   Example:  msgid="3"

   Name:  persistance
   Usage:  Optional
   Type:  duration
   Description:  Specifies how long to carry on the specified action,
      for example, how long to continue honking or flashing.  If absent,
      the default is for the duration of the ACN call.
   Example:  persistance="PT1H"

   Name:  supported-datatypes
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  string
   Description:  Used with a 'send-data' action in a <request> element
      that is a child of a <capability> element, this attribute lists
      all data blocks that the vehicle can transmit, using the same
      identifier as in the 'purpose' attribute in a Call-Info header
      field to point to the data block.  Permitted values are contained
      in the 'Emergency Call Data Types' IANA registry established in
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data].  Multiple values are separated
      with a semicolon.
   Example:  supported-datatypes="VEDS; eCall.MSD"

   Name:  lamp-action
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  token
   Description:  Used with a 'lamp' action, indicates if the lamp is to
      be illuminated, turned off, or flashed.  Permitted values are
      'on', 'off', and 'flash'.

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   Example:  lamp-action="flash"

   Name:  lamp-ID
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  token
   Description:  Used with a 'lamp' action, indicates which lamp the
      action affects.  Permitted values are contained in the registry of
      lamp-ID tokens created in Section 12.7
   Example:  lamp-ID="hazard"

   Name:  supported-lamps
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  string
   Description:  Used with a 'lamp' action in a <request> element that
      is a child of a <capability> element, this attribute lists all
      supported lamps, using values in the registry of lamp-ID tokens
      created in Section 12.7.  Multiple values are separated with a
      semicolon.
   Example:  supported-lamps="head; interior; fog-front; fog-rear;
      brake; position-front; position-rear; turn-left; turn-right;
      hazard"

   Name:  camera-ID
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  token
   Description:  Used with an 'enable-camera' action, indicates which
      camera to enable.  Permitted values are contained in the registry
      of camera-ID tokens created in Section 12.8.  When a vehicle
      camera is enabled, the IVS sends a re-INVITE to negotiate a one-
      way media stream for the camera.
   Example:  camera-ID="backup"

   Name:  supported-cameras
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  string
   Description:  Used with an 'enable-camera' action in a <request>
      element that is a child of a <capability> element, this attribute
      lists all cameras that the vehicle supports (can add as a video
      feed in the current dialog), using the same identifiers as are
      used in the 'camera-ID' attribute (contained in the camera ID
      registry in Section 12.8).  Multiple values are separated with a
      semicolon.
   Example:  supported-cameras="backup; interior"

7.4.2.  New Child Elements of the <request> element

   The <request> element has the following new child elements:

   Name:  text
   Usage:  Conditional
   Type:  string
   Description:  Used within a <request action="msg-dynamic"> element to
      contain the text to be displayed and/or spoken (via text-to-
      speech) for the vehicle occupants.
   Example:  <text>Emergency authorities are aware of your incident and
      location.  Due to a multi-vehicle incident in your area, no one is
      able to speak with you right now.  Please remain calm.  We will
      assist you soon.</text>

8.  Test Calls

   An NG-ACN test call is a call that is recognized and treated to some
   extent as an NG-ACN call but not given emergency call treatment and
   not handled by a call taker.  The specific handling of test NG-ACN
   calls is not itself standardized; the test call facility is intended
   to allow the IVS, user, or TSP to verify that an NG-ACN call can be
   successfully established with voice and/or other media communication.
   The IVS might also be able to verify that the crash data was
   successfully received.

Internet-Draft      Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls          July 2016


   This document builds on [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall], which inherits the
   ability to utilize test call functionality from Section 15 of
   [RFC6881].  A service URN starting with "test." indicates a test
   call.  [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] registered "urn:service:test.sos.ecall"
   for test calls.

   MNOs, emergency authorities, ESInets, and PSAPs determine how to
   treat a vehicle call requesting the "test" service URN so that the
   desired functionality is tested, but this is outside the scope of
   this document.  (One possibility is that MNOs route such calls as
   non-emergency calls to an ESInet, which routes them to a PSAP that
   supports NG-ACN calls; the PSAP accepts test calls, sends a crash
   data acknowledgment, and plays an audio clip (for example, saying
   that the call reached an appropriate PSAP and the vehicle data was
   successfully processed) in addition to supporting media loopback per
   [RFC6881]).

   Note that since test calls are placed using "test" as the parent
   service URN and "sos" as a child, such calls are not treated as an
   emergency call and so some functionality might not apply (such as
   preemption or service availability for devices lacking service ("non-
   service-initialized" or "NSI" devices) if those are available for
   emergency calls).

9.  Example

   Figure 10 shows an NG-ACN call routing.  The mobile network operator
   (MNO) routes the call to an Emergency services IP Network (ESInet),
   as for any emergency call.  The ESInet routes the call to an
   appropriate NG-ACN-capable PSAP (using location information and the
   fact that that it is an NG-ACN call).  The call is processed by the
   Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP), as the entry point to the
   ESInet.  The ESRP routes the call to an appropriate NG-ACN-capable
   PSAP, where the call is received by a call taker.  (In deployments
   where there is no ESInet, the MNO itself routes the call directly to
   an appropriate NG-ACN-capable PSAP.)

     Figure 10: Example of Vehicle-Placed Emergency Call Message Flow

   The example, shown in Figure 11, illustrates a SIP emergency call
   INVITE with location information (a PIDF-LO), VEDS crash data (a VEDS
   data block), and capabilities data (an eCall metadata/control block
   with extensions defined in this document) attached to the SIP INVITE
   message.  The INVITE has a request URI containing the
   'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN.

   The example VEDS data structure shows information about about a
   crashed vehicle.  The example communicates that the car is a model
   year 2015 Saab 9-5 (a car which does not exist).  The front airbag
   deployed as a consequence of the crash.  The
   'VehicleBodyCategoryCode' indicates that the crashed vehicle is a
   passenger car (the code is set to '101') and that it is not a
   convertible (the 'ConvertibleIndicator' value is set to 'false').

   The 'VehicleCrashPulse' element provides further information about
   the crash, namely that the force of impact based on the change in
   velocity over the duration of the crash pulse was 100 MPH.  The
   principal direction of the force of the impact is set to '12' (which
   refers to 12 O'Clock, corresponding to a frontal collision).  This
   value is described in the 'CrashPulsePrincipalDirectionOfForceValue'
   element.

   The 'CrashPulseRolloverQuarterTurnsValue' indicates the number of
   quarter turns in concert with a rollover expressed as a number; in
   our case 1.

   No roll bar was deployed, as indicated in
   'VehicleRollbarDeployedIndicator' being set to 'false'.

   Next, there is information indicating seatbelt and seat sensor data
   for individual seat positions in the vehicle.  In our example,
   information from the driver seat is available (value '1' in the
   'VehicleSeatLocationCategoryCode' element), that the seatbelt was
   monitored ('VehicleSeatbeltMonitoredIndicator' element), that the
   seatbelt was fastened ('VehicleSeatbeltFastenedIndicator' element)
   and the seat sensor determined that the seat was occupied
   ('VehicleSeatOccupiedIndicator' element).

   Finally, information about the weight of the vehicle, which is 600
   kilogram in our example.

   In addition to the information about the vehicle, further indications
   are provided, namely the presence of fuel leakage
   ('FuelLeakingIndicator' element), an indication whether the vehicle
   was subjected to multiple impacts ('MultipleImpactsIndicator'
   element), the orientation of the vehicle at final rest
   ('VehicleFinalRestOrientationCategoryCode' element) and an indication
   that there are no parts of the vehicle on fire (the
   'VehicleFireIndicator' element).

10.  Security Considerations

   Since this document relies on [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall] and
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data], the security considerations
   described there and in [RFC5069] apply here.  Implementors are
   cautioned to read and understand the discussion in those documents.

   As with emergency service systems where location data is supplied or
   determined with the assistance of an end host, there is the
   possibility that that location is incorrect, either intentially
   (e.g., in a denial of service attack against the emergency services
   infrastructure) or due to a malfunctioning device.  The reader is
   referred to [RFC7378] for a discussion of some of these
   vulnerabilities.

   In addition to the security considerations discussion specific to the
   metadata/control object in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall], note that vehicles
   MAY decline to carry out any requested action (e.g., if the vehicle
   requires but is unable to verify the certificate used to sign the
   request).  The vehicle MAY use any value in the reason registry to
   indicate why it did not take an action (e.g., the generic "unable" or
   the more specific "security-failure").

11.  Privacy Considerations

   Since this document builds on [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall], which itself
   builds on [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data], the data structures
   specified there, and the corresponding privacy considerations
   discussed there, apply here as well.  The VEDS data structure
   contains optional elements that can carry identifying and personal
   information, both about the vehicle and about the owner, as well as
   location information, and so needs to be protected against
   unauthorized disclosure, as discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data].  Local regulations may impose
   additional privacy protection requirements.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the 'application/EmergencyCall.VEDS+xml' MIME
   content type, and adds "VEDS" to the Emergency Call Additional Data
   registry.  This document adds to and creates new sub-registries in
   the 'eCall Control Data' registry created in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].

12.1.  MIME Content-type Registration for 'application/
       EmergencyCall.VEDS+xml'

   This specification requests the registration of a new MIME type
   according to the procedures of RFC 4288 [RFC4288] and guidelines in
   RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: EmergencyCallData.VEDS+xml

      Mandatory parameters: none

      Optional parameters: charset

      Indicates the character encoding of enclosed XML.

      Encoding considerations: Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit
      characters, depending on the character encoding used.  See
      Section 3.2 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Security considerations:

         This content type is designed to carry vehicle crash data
         during an emergency call.

         This data can contain personal information including vehicle
         VIN, location, direction, etc.  Appropriate precautions need to
         be taken to limit unauthorized access, inappropriate disclosure
         to third parties, and eavesdropping of this information.
         Please refer to Section 7 and Section 8 of
         [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data] for more information.

         When this content type is contained in a signed or encrypted
         body part, the enclosing multipart (e.g., multipart/signed or
         multipart/encrypted) has the same Content-ID as the data part.
         This allows an entity to identify and access the data blocks it
         is interested in without having to dive deeply into the message
         structure or decrypt parts it is not interested in.  (The
         'purpose' parameter in a Call-Info header field identifies the
         data, and the CID URL points to the data block in the body,
         which has a matching Content-ID body part header field).

      Interoperability considerations: None

      Published specification: [VEDS]

      Applications which use this media type: Emergency Services

12.2.  Registration of the 'VEDS' entry in the Emergency Call Additional
       Data registry

   This specification requests IANA to add the 'VEDS' entry to the
   Emergency Call Additional Data registry, with a reference to this
   document.  The Emergency Call Additional Data registry has been
   established by [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data].

12.3.  Additions to the eCall Control Extension Registry

   This document uses the "eCall Control Extension Registry" to add new
   elements, attributes, and values to the eCall metadata/control
   object, as per [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall]:

12.5.  eCall Static Message Registry

   This document creates a new sub-registry called "eCall Static Message
   Registry" in the "eCall Control Data" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].  Because all compliant vehicles are expected
   to support all static messages translated into all languages
   supported by the vehicle, it is important to limit the number of such
   messages.  As defined in [RFC5226], this registry operates under
   "Publication Required" rules, which require a stable, public document
   and imply expert review of the publication.  The expert should
   determine that the document has been published by an appropriate
   emergency services organization (e.g., NENA, EENA, APCO) or by the
   IETF with input from an emergency services organization, and that the
   proposed message is sufficiently distinguishable from other messages.

   The content of this registry includes:

   ID:  An integer identifier to be used in the 'msgid' attribute of an
      eCall control <request> element.

   Message:  The text of the message.  Messages are listed in the
      registry in English; vehicles are expected to implement
      translations into languages supported by the vehicle.

   When new messages are added to the registry, the message text is
   determined by the registrant; IANA assigns the IDs.  Each message is

   assigned a consecutive integer value as its ID.  This allows an IVS
   to indicate by a single integer value that it supports all messages
   with that value or lower.

   The initial set of values is listed in Table 4.

12.6.  eCall Reason Registry

   This document creates a new sub-registry called "eCall Reason
   Registry" in the "eCall Control Data" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].  This new sub-registry contains values for
   the 'reason' attribute of the <actionResult> element.  As defined in
   [RFC5226], this registry operates under "Expert Review" rules.  The
   expert should determine that the proposed reason is sufficiently
   distinguishable from other reasons and that the proposed description
   is understandable and correctly worded.

   The content of this registry includes:

   ID:  A short string identifying the reason, for use in the 'reason'
      attribute of an <actionResult> element.

   Description:  A description of the reason.

   The initial set of values is listed in Table 5.

   This document creates a new sub-registry called "eCall Lamp ID
   Registry" in the "eCall Control Data" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].  This new sub-registry standardizes the names
   of automotive lamps (lights).  As defined in [RFC5226], this registry
   operates under "Expert Review" rules.  The expert should determine
   that the proposed lamp name is clearly understandable and is
   sufficiently distinguishable from other lamp names.

   The content of this registry includes:

   Name:  The identifier to be used in the 'lamp-ID' attribute of an
      eCall control <request> element.

12.8.  eCall Camera ID Registry

   This document creates a new sub-registry called "eCall Camera ID
   Registry" in the "eCall Control Data" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].  This new sub-registry standardizes the names
   of automotive camera.  As defined in [RFC5226], this registry
   operates under "Expert Review" rules.  The expert should determine
   that the proposed camera name is clearly understandable and is
   sufficiently distinguishable from other camera names.

   The content of this registry includes:

   Name:  The identifier to be used in the 'camera-ID' attribute of an
      eCall control <request> element.

   Description:  A description of the camera.

   The initial set of values is listed in Table 7.
