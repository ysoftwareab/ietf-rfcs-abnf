Abstract

   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 provides a mechanism for a
   service to be discovered in a single exchanged of messages.  This
   exchange of messages does not presently include any of the service's
   attributes.  This document specifies a SLPv2 extension which allows
   a User Agent to request a service's attributes be included as an
   extension to Service Reply messages.  This will eliminate the need
   for multiple round trip messages for a UA to acquire all service
   information.

1. Introduction

   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 [3] provides a mechanism for
   a service to be discovered in a single exchanged of messages.  The UA
   sends a Service Request message and the DA or SA (as is appropriate)
   sends a Service Reply message.

   It is clearly advantageous to be able to obtain all service
   information at once.  The Service Location Protocol separates
   messages which obtain different classes of information.  This
   extension enables an optimization to the basic exchange of messages,
   which currently does not include service attributes in Service Reply
   messages.

   This document specifies a SLPv2 extension which allows a User Agent
   to request that a service's attributes be included in Service Reply
   messages.  This will eliminate the need for multiple round trip
   messages for a UA to acquire all service information.

   If the DA or SA does not support the SLPv2 extension, it will simply
   return a Service Reply.  Support of this extension is OPTIONAL.

Internet Draft    Attribute List Extension for SLPv2     11 October 1999


1.1. Terminology

      User Agent (UA)
                A process working on the user's behalf to establish
                contact with some service.  The UA retrieves service
                information from the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA)
                A process working on the behalf of one or more services
                to advertise the services.

      Directory Agent (DA)
                A process which collects service advertisements.  There
                can only be one DA present per given host.


1.2. Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119  [2].


2. Attribute List Extension

   The format of the Attribute List Extension is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      Extension ID = TBD       |     Next Extension Offset     |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Offset, contd.|      Service URL Length       |  Service URL  \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Attribute List Length     |         Attribute List        \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |# of AttrAuths |(if present) Attribute Authentication Blocks...\
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Extension ID is TBD, and will be assigned from the 0x0002-0x3fff
   range (Standardized options which are optional to implement.)

   The Next Extension Offset value is the number of bytes till the next
   offset in the SLPv2 message.  If the next extension offset value is
   0, there are no more extensions in the message.

   A UA sends an Attribute List Extension with a Service Request.  The
   Service URL Length and Attribute List Length set to 0 and the Service
   URL and Attribute List fields omitted in this case.  The UA thereby

   requests that the SA or DA include an Attribute List Extension in its
   Service Reply by including such an 'empty' Attribute List Extension
   in the Service Request.

   A SA or DA which supports the Attribute List Extension returns one
   Attribute List extension for every URL Entry in the Service Reply
   message.  The order of the Attribute List Extensions SHOULD be the
   same as the URL Entries in the Service Reply.

   The Service URL [4] identifies the corresponding URL Entry.

   The Attribute List field is the entire attribute list of the service.
   These attributes must be in the same language as that indicated in
   the Service Request message.

   If the Service Request message includes a SLP SPI string, then
   the attribute list extension MUST include an authentication
   block.  If the SA or DA does not support or is unable to return an
   authentication block for the SLP SPI included in the Service Request,
   then the SA or DA MUST NOT return an Attribute List Extension.  The
   format of the Attribute List extension is exactly the same as would
   be included in an Attribute Reply or Service Registration message.


3. IANA Considerations

   This extension will have to have a unique SLPv2 extension number
   assigned.  According to RFC 2608:

      New SLP Extensions with types in the range 2-65535 may be
      registered following review by a Designated Expert [5].


4. Internationalization Considerations

   The Service Location Protocol, version 2 has mechanisms for allowing
   attribute to be transmitted with explicit language tagging [6].  The
   same mechanisms are used for this protocol extension.


5. Security Considerations

   The Service Location Protocol, version 2 has mechanisms for allowing
   authenticators to be returned with attribute lists so that UAs
   are able to verify a digital signature over the attributes they
   obtain.  This same mechanism is used for this protocol extension.
   The Attribute List Extension used in conjunction with SLPv2 is no
   less secure than SLPv2 without the extension.
