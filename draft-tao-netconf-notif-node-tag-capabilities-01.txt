               Self-explanation data Node tag capability
            draft-tao-netconf-notif-node-tag-capabilities-01

Abstract

   Before a client application subscribes to updates from a datastore,
   server capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG Datastores" can
   be advertised using YANG Instance Data format.  These server
   capabilities can be documented at implement time or reported at run-
   time.

   This document proposes a YANG module for self-explanation data Node
   tag capability which augments system capabilities model and provide
   additional self-explanation data node attributes associated with node
   selector within per-node capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.netconf-notification-capabilities], a server
   supporting YANG-Push MAY have a number of capabilities such as

   o  Supported (reporting) periods for periodic subscriptions

   o  Maximum number of objects that can be sent in an update

   o  Supported dampening periods for on-change subscriptions

   o  The set of data nodes for which on-change notification is
      supported;

   Notification capability model defined in [I-D.netconf-notification-
   capabilities] allows a client to discover basic system capability and
   YANG-Push related capabilities both at implementation-time and run-
   time.  Without using notification capability, it might lead to
   unexpected failure or additional message exchange for NETCONF clients
   to discover data models supported by a NETCONF server.

Internet-Draft            Node Tags Capability                March 2020


   When the state of all subscriptions of a particular Subscriber to be
   fetched is huge, filtering queries of operational state on a server
   based on server capabilities can greatly reduce the amount of data to
   be streamed out to the destination.

   However without self-explanation indication or instruction
   information associated with data node conveyed in Notification
   capability model [I-D.netconf-notification-capabilities] or pre-
   configured selection filter in the YANG Push model, it is hard for
   NETCONF clients to automatically select which data objects are of
   interest using machine to machine interface, e.g., identify a set of
   objects which have a common characteristic, collect specific object
   type nodes.

   This document proposes a YANG module for self-explanation data Node
   tag capability which augments System Capabilities model and provide
   additional self-explanation data node tag attributes associated with
   node selector for queries filtering.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Self-explanation data Node tag capability

   The YANG module ietf-notification-capabilities defined in [I-
   D.netconf-notification-capabilities] specify the following server
   capabilities related to YANG Push:

   o  A set of capabilities related to the amount of notifications the
      server can send out

   o  Specification of which data nodes support on-change notifications.

   o  Capability values can be specified on server level, datastore
      level or on specific data nodes (and their contained sub-tree) of
      a specific datastore.  Capability values on a smaller, more
      specific part of the server's data always override more generic
      values.

   o  On-change capability is not specified on a server level as
      different datastores usually have different on-change
      capabilities.  On a datastore level on-change capability for
      configuration and state data can be specified separately.

   These server capabilities can be provided either at implementation
   time or reported at run time.

   This document augments system capabilities model and provide
   additional data node self explaination attributes associated with
   node selector within per-node capabilities:

   o  Specification of which object type nodes, which performance metric
      nodes, which property related nodes they can push to the target
      recipient;

   o  Specification of measurement precision or granularity associated
      with performance metric related data nodes;

   o  Specification of operation type associated with performance metric
      related data nodes;

   o  Specification of service classification information associated
      with data nodes;

   o  Specification of task group information associated with a set of
      data nodes;

   o  Specification of group name of a set of data nodes they can push
      to the target recipient.

   o  Specification of data source type associated with a set of data
      nodes;

   o  Specfication of multi-source aggregation assocaited with a set of
      data nodes;

   model.

     reference:
        RFC XXXX (RFC Ed.: replace XXX with actual RFC number and remove
        this note.)

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
