Abstract  
   This document describes the different types of Internet Service   
   Provider (ISP) networks in existence today.  It will provide      
   design and operational considerations in delivering network       
   services to customers for seven specific areas in an effort to     
   better identify specific issues which may arise during a          
   transition to IPv6.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
1. Introduction  
                                                                     
   This document will describe the basic design of ISP networks      
   today.  It will be used to provide direction on what must be      
   considered to transition IPv4 networks to IPv6.  The main      
   purpose of this document is to identify, and document the issues  
   that must be considered before transitioning a network to IPv6.   
   This document is not meant to determine exactly how the           
   transition will occur for the various ISP networks.  This document
   is not meant to describe how to build an IPv6 network from scratch.
   This document will not describe what is or is not a "Tier 1" or        
   "Tier 2"..."Tier N" ISP.  The document focuses on IP capable      
   network devices and may reference non-IP related devices for      
   clarification purposes only.
                                                                     
2. Scope of the document 
                                                                     
   The scope of this document is to cover the major topics ISPs must 
   consider in building and running their IP networks.  The document 
   will include sections on Core backbone networks, Broadband DSL    
   networks, Broadband HFC Cable networks, Narrowband Dialup         
   networks, Public Wireless LAN Networks, Broadband Ethernet and
   Public Exchange Point networks.  The document will also identify 
   Security and Network Management concerns which in some cases will 
   be common to all as well some areas that may be unique to the 
   particular service.
   Although the Optical core is important in today's networks, that  
   layer is generally transparent to the IP layer except in a few    
   special cases where ISPs have allowed the IP core to be aware of  
   the optical layer underneath.  Hence, this draft does not include 
   further optical considerations.
   Each scenario will discuss issues related to network topology,    
   network hardware, routing, policing, security, network management,
   configuration and host gear.
                                                                     
3. Transition Scenarios
                                                                     
   This following sections will provide the description and design  
   considerations for the different types of ISP networks in         
   existence.  In some cases a single ISP may provide services 
   in more than one of the areas mentioned below.

4. Core/Backbone Networks 
                                                                     
   This section describes the general topologies of and 
   characteristics of today's CORE networks.  Although there are     
   numerous large scale networks out there today, most employ the    
   same basic set of principles when designing and building their    
   networks.

4.1 Topology
                                                                     
   In terms of physical equipment, today's backbone networks consist 
   mainly of high-speed routers that are configured in a basic core  
   and edge configuration.  In most configurations, for redundancy,  
   there are two or more core routers as well as two or more border  
   routers.  The border routers provide any local connectivity and   
   peering.  Generally filtering, routing policy and policing type   
   functions are done on the border routers.  The core routers       
   provide aggregation of border router traffic as well as           
   aggregation of long haul   circuits to remote sites.  The         
   physical topology is depicted in Figure 4.1.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
   The logical topology includes the core routers being IBGP peers   
   with every other POP in the mesh.  The local border routers are   
   route reflector clients of the core.
4.2. Hardware
   The hardware deployed in the CORE Backbone is similar across ISPs 
   and generally consists of high-speed routers.  The requirement    
   for switches in the CORE network is for infrastructure type       
   hosting gear.  In some cases CPE equipment is provided by the     
   CORE ISP.
4.3. Routing
                                                                     
4.3.1  IGP
   Internally Core ISPs generally use OSPF or ISIS as an IGP.        
   Loopback interfaces and point-to-point links are what make up     
   routes within the IGP.
4.3.2  EGP
   Generally BGP4 is the Edge gateway protocol of choice.  The EGP   
   routing table consists of networks, which are received via 
   customer advertisements, statically configured for customers who  
   are not running a dynamic routing protocol or networks that are   
   nailed up as part of the ISP infrastructure.
4.3.3  IRR & Routing Policy 
   Routing policy on the core includes multiple peer-groups setup to 
   represent a collection of customers, external peers or internal   
   peers.  In the case of customer connections, there are peer       
   groups that are configured to send FULL_ROUTES, CUSTOMER-ROUTES   
   or DEFAULT-ROUTES to a particular set of customers.  To perform   
   this function, the peer groups reference ROUTE-MAPs.  External    
   peers generally fit into the CUSTOMER_ROUTES peer group.  In the  
   case of internal peers an INTERNAL peer group is used to identify 
   internal routers that carry backbone circuits and an RRCLIENT     
   peer-group is created to group border routers with a common set   
   of characteristics.    
4.3.4  Multicast
   PIM-SM is the generally accepted solution for deploying multicast.

4.3.5  Addressing
   Addressing in the CORE of the network has two components. The     
   infrastructure routers have requirements for loopback and         
   point-to-point addresses.  These addresses are routed within the  
   IGP.  Customer routes are pinned up on core routers.
4.3.6     NAT
   NAT may be deployed in the CORE provider networks only in special 
   cases.   
4.3.7  Aggregation
   Aggregation of routes in the CORE networks should be done.        
   Networks that are used for loopbacks and interfaces should be     
   aggregated prior to being advertised externally.  Generally       
   aggregated "pin up" routes are placed on routers that carry       
   backbone trunks.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
4.4. Traffic Engineering
   CORE providers have few choices in terms of traffic engineering.  
   One method is MPLS.  To use MPLS, a provider only needs a traffic 
   matrix of next-hop data from within their network.  Once a        
   provider knows how much traffic is sent between all routers in    
   the network, MPLS tunnels can be built to steer traffic over the  
   optimum path to deliver all traffic.  This scheme is analogous to 
   the use of ATM PVCs over OC-12 circuits in prior years.  Most     
   networks employ some type of traffic engineering mechanism to     
   steer traffic around potentially congestive areas.  Beyond the    
   standard methods of TE, some ISPs attempt to adjust metrics or    
   cost on p2p links to perform TE.  An additional method involves   
   using varying BGP routing announcements to increase or decrease   
   traffic on a particular link.  Finally, there are also networks   
   that employ an over provisioning model to limit packet loss.  This
   involves adding capacity above and beyond what is needed.
4.5. Security
   In the CORE provider's network, security has a specific scope.    
   Securing a network is typically done on the border or edge router.
   Generally an attempt is made to filter BOGON(RFC 1918) routes,    
   traffic sourced from unallocated address space or sourced from    
   address ranges that are internal to the local ISP.  In some       
   cases, hosts that support the infrastructure network equipment    
   generally have filters in place to protect those hosts from       
   outside attacks.
4.5.1 Intrusion Detection
   Intrusion detection mechanisms and systems are used to protect    
   infrastructure and host gear.  Generally these intrusion          
   detection systems are placed at various points within the network 
   to search for vulnerabilities within the infrastructure as well   
   as monitor activity that may be considered suspicious.
4.5.2 Ingress Filtering
   Ingress filtering on CORE networks comes in multiple flavors.     
   For providers that do filter, the first level is EGP filtering.   
   When a peering session is setup, ISPs require a peer to register  
   their routes in an IRR and that data is used to create an EGP     
   filter on the peering session to only accept registered           
   advertised routes.  A step beyond this includes Reverse Path      
   Forwarding (RPF) checks to verify that traffic sourced from the   
   customer link is within the advertised range.  An alternative to
   the automated RPF checks is the brute force static packet filters
   which can be used to control traffic sourced from a particular
   customer link.  
4.6. Network Management
   Devices within the network must be monitored.  This is done over  
   in-band connections to the network devices.  Generally there are  
   filters on the routers to allow SNMP queries from the query       
   server.
4.6.1 Out of band
   Out of band networks allow access to consoles of the network      
   gear.  In some cases this access is done in-band.  There are also 
   cases where separate networks are built to allow access.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 

4.6.2 Configuration Tools
   Many ISPs have monitoring tools that query the network gear to    
   gather data.  These scripts may be written in perl or expect and  
   will access the device via the CLI over the in-band ipv4          
   connection.
                                                                     
4.6.3 SNMP
   Statistical monitoring of network gear is done via SNMP queries.  
   These queries are done via the in-band connection.
4.7. Hosting Gear
                                                                     
   In terms of host gear, the Core networks maintain hosts for       
   supporting and managing the network, but not necessarily the end  
   user.  The standard set of hosts include DNS servers, mail        
   gateways, authentication( RADIUS or TACACS), and network          
   management servers.  The servers are distributed to strategic     
   locations for diversity purposes.  Servers included in this model 
   include DNS and TACACS servers that directly support the          
   operator's network.  Reachability to the servers is over an IPv4  
   routed connection.  Cacheing infrastructure is deployed in CORE   
   provider networks in a very limited fashion to assist in reducing 
   the traffic pulled from external sources.

5.  Broadband HFC/Coax Networks 
                                                                     
   This section describes the infrastructure that exists in today's  
   HFC cable networks that support cable modem services to the home. 
   Since many cable providers are regional they generally have used  
   the backbone ISP networks for transit IP services beyond their    
   region.
                                                                     
5.1  Terminology

5.2 Topology
                                                                     
5.2.1 Physical
                                                                     
   HFC networks are a mix of fiber optic and coaxial cables          
   originally designed for the delivery of cable television.  A      
   single infrastructure can support video distribution, data        
   networking and telephony.  Video and data signals are typically   
   sourced from different systems and frequency division multiplexed 
   over the HFC network.  Historically HFC networks were             
   uni-directional and required some kind of telco-return path to    
   support bi-directional data.  Today much of the cable             
   infrastructure has been upgraded to support return paths over the 
   HFC network.
   A CMTS can serve quite a large geographic area: 10s of miles      
   radius is not uncommon and DOCSIS specifies a 100 mile diameter   
   upper limit.
   In a DOCSIS system, down-stream and up-stream channels are        
   distinct and occupy different frequency bands.  A CMTS may        
   terminate multiple up and downstream channels and a CM must tune  
   in to an up-stream and down-stream channels before communicating. 
   All packets on the HFC network are forwarded via the CMTS.  Cable 
   modems may forward packets between network segments attached to   
   CPE.  Hundreds of hosts on a cable network may be part of the     
   same broadcast domain.

   DOCSIS systems are designed to transport IP traffic.  The         
   following two paragraphs are present in all current DOCSIS        
   specifications.
   Section 1.3.1 [DOCSIS-1.1]:
       "The intended service will allow transparent bi-directional   
       transfer of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, between the cable 
       system headed and customer locations, over an all-coaxial or  
       hybrid-fiber/coax(HFC) cable network."
   Section 3.2.2.1 [DOCSIS-1.1]:
       "Forwarding of IP traffic MUST be supported. Other network    
   layer protocols MAY be supported. The ability to restrict the     
   network layer to a single protocol such as IP MUST be supported."
   In the context of the [DOCSIS-1.0], [DOCSIS-1.1] and [DOCSIS-2.0]

   Cable modems operate as transparent L2 bridges forwarding         
   datagrams from the HFC network to the CPE network.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
   Cable modems use a combination of policy settings and             
   IGMPv2[RFC2236] to control multicast forwarding (see Section 
   3.3.1 [DOCSIS-1.1]).
   Forwarding of IPv6 multicast datagrams may not occur properly as  
   CMs are required to forward multicast datagrams only when CPE     
   equipment has joined that group.  This is potentially a           
   show-stopper if native IPv6 Neighbor Discovery[RFC2461] is being  
   used through a CM.
5.3.2 CMTS Layer-2 Bridge
                                                                     
   A DOCSIS compliant CMTS may be implemented as a Layer-2           
   transparent bridge.  Forwarding of IPv4 packets by the            
   transparent bridge is mandatory and forwarding of other protocols 
   may be supported.  It is likely that implementers using this      
   approach will support forwarding of arbitrary protocols using     
   802.1d hence forwarding of native IPv6 datagrams should just work.
   IPv6 is then deployed on the ISP router infrastructure natively   
   or using an automatic tunneling scheme like 6to4[RFC3056].  As    
   with the CM, a bridged CMTS that selectively forwards multicast   
   datagrams on the basis of IGMPv2 will potentially break IPv6 ND.  
   This behavior is recommended but not mandated for a     Layer-2   
   CMTS.  Communication between CPE behind different cable modems is 
   always forwarded by the CMTS.  IPv6 communication between the     
   different  sites relies on multicast IPv6 Neighbor Discovery      
   [RFC2461] frames being forwarded correctly by the CM and the CMTS.
5.3.3 CMTS IP Router
                                                                     
   A DOCSIS compliant CMTS may be implemented as a Layer-3 IPv4      
   router.  In this case IPv6 packets passing from the WAN network   
   to CPE must be encapsulated in IPv4.  Forwarding between channels 
   on the HFC network (i.e.  within a CMTS) may still take place at  
   L2 hence the comments in Section 3.2 may also apply.
   A CMTS may also be an IPv6 router and thus support IPv6 natively. 
5.3.4 IPv4 NAT CPE routers
                                                                     
   A fairly common CPE device in HFC networks is the IPv4 NAT/DHCP   
   router.  It is usually connected between the cable modem and all  
   other CPE equipment allows multiple devices to share a single     
   IPv4 address and cable modem connection with a minimum of         
   configuration overhead.  The NAT/DHCP router is a directional     
   IPv4-only device in the communication path between the CMTS and   
   the CPE. Unfortunately the IPv4 NAT router prevents (or at least  
   seriously complicates) the deployment of IPv6 in a number of ways:
   o  As an IPv4-only device it will block native IPv6 frames        
   forwarded through the cable modem.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
   o  The use of private addresses on the CPE network means that     
      schemes relying on global IPv4 addresses (e.g.  6to4[RFC3056]) 
      cannot be used.
   o  Many NAT/DHCP routers only support forwarding of a limited     
      number of IPv4 protocols (e.g.  TCP, UDP, ICMP) and will drop  
      IPv4 encapsulated IPv6 with an "unknown" protocol number (e.g. 
      6to4 packets).
                                                                     
   In an ideal world every IPv4 NAT router would be upgraded to      
   additionally become a native IPv6 router using 6to4 automatic     
   tunneling.
   In general 6to4 residential gateway devices must be made as       
   self-configuring as existing IPv4 NAT routers.
                                                                     
5.4 Routing
                                                                     
   There are no known HFC-specific routing issues.
   Cable networks are typically access networks.  If the CMTS is a   
   native IPv6 router then it will likely need to participate in     
   ISPs the IGP of choice.  If the CMTS is a bridge, the             
   infrastructure router(s) that it connects to will need to speak   
   an IGP.  If 6to4[RFC3056] is used, it is recommended that the ISP 
   sink (and forward) traffic to the anycast 6to4 relay router address
   [RFC3068].
5.5 Policing
                                                                     
   Cable networks are large shared subnets.  Filtering is extensively
   used in this environment to ensure stability of the network and to
   protect subscribers.  For example, filters are used to prevent CPE
   DHCP server responses from escaping from the CPE network.  As a   
   security measure, filters are very often deployed to prevent file 
   sharing protocols leaking between different CPE sites.            
   IPv6 opens up a new communication channel.  Existing IPv4 filter  
   software will not block IPv6 communication.  If IPv6 is tunneled  
   over an IPv4 infrastructure filters may need to examine the       
   contents of encapsulated packets.
5.6 Security
                                                                     
   CPE NAT boxes are rectifying routers.  This can be viewed as an   
   implementation of an "outgoing only" security policy.  IPv6       
   devices need to be able to support a similar kind of policy.

5.7 Network Management
                                                                     
   DOCSIS cable modems use an out of band, privately addressed IPv4  
   network for configuration and network management functions.       
   DOCSIS cable modems and CMTS are IPv4 hosts on the out of band    
   management network.  At present there is no compelling need to    
   update this network to support IPv6.
   DOCSIS cable modems use:
      SNMP [RFC1157] for network management.
      TFTP [RFC1350] for software and configuration parameter        
      download
      DHCP [RFC2131] for acquiring IPv4 address, etc allowing        
      communication on the management network.
      ToD [RFC0868] for initial time synchronization.
   Various MIBs for RF and CPE filter configuration..  DOCSIS OSSI   
   docs override the IETF MIB specifications.  Any IPv6 issues in    
   there?
5.8  Host Gear
                                                                     
   Dual stack DNS server is necessary if you want to support         
   IPv6-only CPE equipment.
   DDNS is pretty much mandatory if you want to give CPE devices DNS 
   names.  This is because only the IPv6 host knows what its full    
   IPv6 address is (esp when privacy addresses are used).
   Transition functionality..  which?  where?
   v4/v6 translation between devices in the home is done where? If   
   RFC1918 addresses are in use (perhaps behind the NAT), then there 
   isn't much choice but to do it inside the CPE box.
   Transparent proxy caches aren't going to cache IPv6 web traffic.

6. Broadband DSL Networks 
                                                                     
   This section describes the infrastructure that exists in todays   
   High Speed DSL Networks. 
6.1 DSL physical architecture 
                                                                     
   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology is a modem technology    
   that allows subscribers to perform access from the home or office 
   to broadband network services by using existing twisted-pair      
   copper wire telephone lines.
   The term xDSL is the generic name that has been given to the      
   family of digital subscriber line technologies, including ADSL,   
   SDSL, HDSL, VDSL, and IDSL.
   The POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) takes only the frequency   
   range 0-3000 Hz but there is considerably more bandwidth on these 
   copper lines; DSL gets more from them by using sophisticated      
   digital coding and splitting the line (reserving the higher       
   frequencies for data, the lower for voice and fax) to achieve     
   high-speed data transmission over the local loop from the         
   customer site to a service provider's switching center. But the   
   bandwidth a subscriber can receive depends on the quality of the  
   line and on the distance to the service provider's center.
   Distance can be increased, but then speed is reduced. For         
   instance, it is possible to use ADSL up to 18,000 feet, but the   
   maximum downstream speed is then reduced to 1544 kbps.  Several   
   models are used to deploy IP over DSL services, but all use the   
   same components:

   The hosts are connected to the DSL network either directly        
   through a modem, either through a router and a modem. The modems  
   may be included in the hosts or in the routers. When it is not    
   the case, the DSL modems may be accessed through ATM, Ethernet or 
   USB.  It must be noted that when a router is used in customer     
   premises, it often has only very limited resources in terms of    
   memory or processing power.
   IP packets are then transported on twisted-pair telephone lines   
   to the NAP's DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexer), thanks to DSL        
   technology. The DSLAM terminates and multiplexes several DSL      
   accesses to the NAP's backbone. It forwards data to the BAS       
   (Broadband Access Server = DSLAM aggregator), which is in charge  
   of directing them to the POP (Point Of Presence = the ISP Edge    
   Router) of the NSP that the client has subscribed to. Note that   
   NAP and NSP can be the same organization. The technology used in  
   the NAP network is usually ATM, but other types of layer 2        
   technologies may be used.
   This model enables the local operator to make its local copper    
   available to other companies. Operators are then able to offer    
   DSL technology for broadband Internet access.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
   As the access network puts service users in communication with    
   their NSPs, security and access control are required.
6.2 Logical architectures used today for IPv4 access
                                                                     
   Data transport between the CPE and the service provider's point   
   of presence (POP) generally relies on an ATM based infrastructure.
   Two types of use of this infrastructure are common:
   * ATM point-to-point model: one PVC connects each subscriber to   
   its NSP. From the Broadband Access Server (BAS), there are        
   exactly as many PVCs across the NAP network as the number of      
   subscribers (i.e. one PVC per subscriber).  This model is         
   detailed in section 6.2.1.
   * Aggregation model: the BAS aggregates multiple subscriber PVCs  
   into trunk PVCs to reduce the number of PVC connections across    
   the NAP core network (one PVC provisioned for many subscribers to 
   the same destination NSP, or if the NSP offers multiple service   
   levels, more than one PVC could be established across the core).  
   There are two usual ways to aggregate connections:
   - PPP Terminated Aggregation (PTA): PPP sessions are opened       
   between each subscriber and the BAS. The BAS terminates PPP       
   sessions and transfers subscriber's traffic up to the POP.  This  
   model is detailed in section 6.2.2.
   - L2TP Access Aggregation (LAA): PPP sessions are opened          
     between each subscriber and the POP. The BAS dispatches PPP     
     sessions up to the POP, by encapsulating them into L2TP tunnels.
     This model is detailed in section 6.2.3.
                                                                     
                                                                     
6.2.1 ATM POINT-TO-POINT MODEL
                                                                     
   This model is adapted to networks with few subscribers and static 
   configuration. It is simple to deploy but it cannot be used in    
   large networks.
   In this model, each subscriber is connected to its NSP via one    
   PVC.  The user network IP packets are transmitted frames from the 
   CPE to the DSL modem or router. There, RFC 2684 bridging occurs:  
   The LAN frames are forwarded into an ATM PVC (segmenting them     
   into ATM cells through AAL5).
                                                                     
                                                                     
   The following figure describes the protocol architecture of this  
   model.

   Since the CPE is in bridging mode, this model is 
   layer 3-independent and the NAP is free of addressing and routing 
   concerns.  The NSP edge router sees all subscribers as attached   
   to the same Ethernet link. Very complex controls and restrictions 
   must thus be performed to avoid spoofing and broadcast storms.    
   Last, subscribers do not have access to multiple ISPs over a      
   single DSL line.
6.2.2 PPP TERMINATED AGGREGATION (PTA) MODEL  
                                                                     
   The PTA architecture relies on PPP-based technologies (PPPoA and  
   PPPoE), terminated at the BAS. The BAS has at least one PVC       
   opened to each NSP, but several PVCs are sometimes used when the  
   NSP offers differentiated services (QoS...).
   In this architecture, the aggregator BAS provides PPP session     
   termination and the subscriber data is then forwarded to the      
   NSP's edge router using IP over ATM.
                                                                     
   Since the PPP session is terminated at the BAS, the BAS must      
   perform per session authentication, authorization and accounting  
   on behalf of the NSP, and perform layer 3 routing.  The PTA       
   architecture has several advantages. First, it reduces the number 
   of PVCs used in the NAP core network. Second, it offers the       
   subscribers the capability to choose between several NSPs.        
   However, it is not as flexible as the LAA model from this point   
   of view: it requires strong coordination between the NSP and the  
   NAP. This model is often used when the NSP is also the NAP.

   The PPP sessions initiated by the CPEs are terminated at the       
   aggregation device (BAS), which authenticates users either by      
   using a local database or by sending a request to a remote server  
   located at the NSP (a RADIUS server for instance). When RADIUS is  
   used, a user can be authenticated based on a username or based on  
   the VPI/VCI used. There is only one PPP session per ATM PVC.
                                                                     
   Upon successful authentication, the customer premises equipment   
   may then be configured dynamically. Of course, static             
   configuration is also possible. When dynamic configuration is     
   used, the BAS obtains the address of a DNS server and an IPv4     
   address or prefix for the customer, usually through a DHCP server 
   or a RADIUS server. The BAS then sends this information to the    
   CPE via IPCP, and establishes a new route between the CPE and the 
   BAS.

   The PPPoE-based PTA model is more flexible than the PPPoA based 
   one:  several PPP sessions may be opened with the BAS at the same 
   time, over as many PPPoE sessions. This allows subscriber to      
   access several services at the same time, on the same VC.
   The authentication process is the same as the PPPoA one except    
   that VPI/VCI-based authentication cannot be used.  
   It must be noted that the extra PPPoE encapsulation reduces the   
   IP MTU and MRU, because two PPP and PPPoE headers (2+6 bytes) are 
   inserted between the IP packet and the Ethernet header. This also 
   results in a decrease of the MSS of TCP that applications should  
   use.  
6.2.3 L2TP ACCESS AGGREGATION (LAA) MODEL
                                                                     
   While PTA model terminates PPP sessions at the aggregation device 
   and then forwards IP traffic to its destination, LAA model allows 
   forwarding PPP sessions from subscribers to the NSP's point of    
   presence, via a L2TP tunnel.  When a CPE initiates a session with 
   its NSP, the BAS intercepts the PPP connection request. It reads  
   the PPP identities of the subscriber and of the NSP, and sends a  
   request to the NSP's RADIUS server, asking for the address of the 
   device to which the PPP connection should be forwarded. 
   If not opened yet, a L2TP tunnel is established between the BAS   
   and the NSP's server. The PPP connection is then encapsulated and 
   forwarded into this tunnel.  User authentication and dynamic      
   configuration are performed by the NSP itself.

6.2.4 OPTIMAL MTU CONFIGURATION FOR  DSL CONNECTIONS USING PPPOE
                                                                     
   While PPPoA does not impact the default MTU on an LAN environment 
   (1500 bytes), PPPoE induces a smaller MTU (1492 bytes, 1500 bytes 
   minus 2 bytes for PPP header and 6 bytes for PPPoE header).  This 
   causes some problems, especially when ICMP error messages such as 
   "Packet Too Big' are filtered by intermediate nodes.
6.3 ADDRESSING FOR TODAY'S IPv4 ACCESS
                                                                     
   One of the benefits of DSL for the customer is the capability to  
   enjoy a permanent connection to the Internet on the telephone     
   line. This allows the customers to use peer-to-peer applications  
   and to set up servers when they are given stable global IP        
   addresses.  However, some service providers do not supply static  
   addresses by default, and a lot of customers are using dynamic    
   addresses today.  Customers are usually disconnected every day    
   and are given a new address each time they reconnect.  Most of    
   the times, customers use private addressing on their LAN and the  
   access routers then perform NAT for Internet access.  Some small  
   ISPs do not even provide global addresses to their customers.
   These ISPs then operate NATs on their backbones.

6.4 ROUTING
                                                                     
   Customers of DSL services may run routing protocols on their LAN  
   (usually RIP or OSPF), but these LANs are usually small and do    
   not require the use of a routing protocol.
   When a router is used in the customer premises, it is usually     
   configured with a default route to the NSP's edge router. In case 
   of multi-homing, the customer's router may use BGP.
   The NAP may have to run an IGP (OSPF or IS-IS).
   Usually, the NSP uses an IGP (OSPF or IS-IS) on its core network. 
                                                                     
6.5 DNS
                                                                     
   Very often, the domain name of the customer is managed by the NSP 
   and the domain name server is also hosted by the NSP. 
   In fewer cases, the customer hosts the server on its own LAN.
6.6 Network management
                                                                     
   Usually, NSPs manage the edge routers by SNMP. The management     
   stations are located on the core network.
   Very few service providers manage equipment located on customers  
   LANs.  The use of NAT on the customer edge router forbids this    
   type of service.

7.  Narrowband Dialup Networks 
                                                                     
   This section describes Narrowband dialup networks that the        
   majority of internet users use today to get online.  The          
   scenarios will include solutions where the dial infrastructure is 
   controlled by one entity as well as solutions where ISPs lease    
   modems from a wholesale modem providers.
   There are multiple types of dialup services from plain/no frills  
   access to the Internet, to wholesale dialup networks that can     
   purchased by an organization wanting to resell internet services, 
   and then there are the full service dialup providers that provide 
   a long list of features to the end user.  Generally smaller       
   dialup ISPs purchase a T1 or greater facility from a Local        
   Exchange Carrier(LEC) to the facility where modem equipment is    
   housed.  The choice in terms of the number of T1s (or other) is   
   made dependent on how many simultaneous users are supported in    
   the ISP's business model.  Depending on the coverage area         
   multiple phone numbers may be provided for the end-user to dial   
   and the LEC may choose to route all calls to a common termination 
   point or provide the traffic across multiple T1 facilities.  When 
   an end-user dials an access number, the LEC routes the call to    
   the modem server location and is generally mapped by the LEC into 
   a T1 facility that terminates on the modem server.  The modem     
   server attempts to verify the user credentials by querying the    
   authentication server via an IP interface on the modem server.    
   The modem server is present on a LAN network segment along with   
   any relevant hosts as well as the default gateway router.  Some   
   services that are common to all dialup providers include the      
   ability to provide DNS service either primary or secondary and an 
   authentication server.  The wholesale dial provider builds out    
   the dial network just as the small dialup provider does.          
   Differences include the ability of the wholesale provider to hand 
   off aggregated traffic to the organization purchasing wholesale   
   access or to allow the aggregated traffic to reach the Internet   
   at large without the purchasing organization needing major        
   internet access facilities.  Each case has different implications.
                                                                     
   The infrastructure used in the foundation of these various        
   offerings is somewhat similar although the deployments vary       
   depending on the level of service offered.  The basic dialup      
   service provider model that includes modem access to the Internet 
   can be built from a terminal server (generally a digital modem    
   bank), a Layer 2 switch and routers.  For global reachability the 
   dialup provider must connect to a backbone provider.  The basic   
   design calls for the terminal server to be attached to a layer 2  
   switch that would in turn have connections to a router.  For      
   redundancy, a dialup

   disabled.  A more robust redundant solution would be to deploy    
   pairs of routers and use some Router Redundancy Protocol          
   functionality to maintain traffic in the event of a failure of    
   one router.

7.2. Hardware
   The hardware involved in dialup service provider connections      
   include the CPE device that is usually a 56K modem, the Terminal  
   server/modem bank and an authentication server.  
                                                                     
7.3. Routing
                                                                     
   From the host device the user connects to the terminal server     
   using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).  Once the PPP connection is  
   made the user credentials are sent to the Authentication server.  
   The user is then assigned an IP address and then the connection   
   is forwarded to the appropriate Internet Service Provider (ISP)   
   and then on to a Network Service Provider (NSP).  The NSP and ISP 
   network can be external or internal to the dialup service         
   provider.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
                                                                     
   In some cases Dialup service providers will use Network Address   
   Translation (NAT) to connect to external networks.  NAT is only   
   required if the address assigned by the authentication server is  
   not a public address.  Routing protocols such as an IGP or EGP    
   will only come into play between the ISP and NSP networks. The    
   address space required at a point of presence (POP) is determined 
   by summing the number of modem ports available at a POP.  IRR     
   routing policy is generally registered by the ISP or NSP but in   
   some cases the dialup provider may register policy.
                                                                     
7.4. Traffic Engineering
                                                                     
   Traffic Engineering (TE) at the dialup ISP level is closer to     
   connection load balancing.  TE is generally done by the           
   authentication servers, which monitor the number of active        
   connections and balance connections across available ISP routed   
   connections.
7.5. Security
                                                                     
   Security in the dialup ISP model is mainly meant to protect the   
   network gear from intrusion.  By default the terminal servers     
   prevent connections between users.
7.6. Network Management
   Accounting and statistical information is collected on a per 
   user basis for billing purposes and the tools required need to 
   support gathering IPv6 data.
                                                                     
7.7. Hosting Gear
   There are a number of hosts that support the dialup ISP model.    
   All servers do not necessarily reside at the terminal server      
   point of connection.  Servers included in this model include DNS, 
   Radius, and Mail servers that directly support the end user but   
   are deployed in an optimum location.  Reachability to the servers 
   is over an IPv4 routed connection.  Servers indirectly related to 
   supporting the user include TACACS servers used to authenticate   
   access to network equipment, tool servers to query and monitor,   
   and cache servers that assist in handling web requests.  Cache    
   servers are typically used transparently in between the user and  
   the Internet.

   Public wireless LAN (WLAN) enables subscribers within home,       
   office or the outdoors to perform Internet access by using WLAN   
   technology. WLAN technology is standardized by IEEE 802.11, and   
   its maximum transmission speed varies from 1 or 2 Mbps            
   (IEEE 802.11) and 11 Mbps (IEEE 802.11b) to 54 Mbps               
   (IEEE 802.11a).

   model.

   Hosts can connect to WLAN by using WLAN network interface card    
   (NIC), by using PCI or PCMCIA slot. WLAN is basically a broadcast 
   network, and several hosts can share the network by using carrier 
   sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access   
   mechanism. Legacy WLAN does not consider authentication and       
   security, but allow any subscriber to connect the network at any  
   time.  However, in order for WLAN to be used as public access     
   network, such authentication and security mechanisms are required.
   Access point (AP) acts as an authentication client, and sends     
   host's authentication parameter to authentication server. Such    
   mechanisms are presented in 3.x.5 in detail.  Once the host is    
   authenticated, AP acts as a bridge in order to relay host's       
   information to ISP or vice versa. Various access network          
   technologies can be used between AP and ISP.  Lease line, xDSL    
   and HFC/cable are few examples.

8.2 Routing and Addressing
                                                                     
   Public wireless LANs are usually configured in small area (aka,   
   hot spots) and basically broadcast networks. Thus, they do not    
   require the use of a routing protocol.  One of benefits of public 
   WLAN is to provide for customers convenient Internet access.      
   This allows the customers in the outdoors to connect to public    
   access networks.  ISPs supply not static addresses by default but 
   dynamic addresses by DHCP.  The customers are usually             
   disconnected every time and are given a new address each time     
   they reconnect.  Most of the times, customers use private         
   addressing and the access routers then perform NAT for Internet 
   access.

8.4 Security 
                                                                     
   Like ethernet, IEEE 802.11 standard dose not define               
   authentication and security mechanisms. Moreover, WLAN is         
   basically a broadcast network and each host can listen            
   information of another host within the same AP service area.      
   Therefore, in order for ISPs to use WLAN as public access         
   network, they should provide authentication and data privacy      
   mechanisms. Authentication mechanism is used to identify whether  
   a subscriber is registered to access the Internet. There can be   
   two authentication mechanisms: (1) IEEE 802.1x and                
  (2) non-standard MAC address based authentication. Once a          
   subscriber is considered as valid, information exchanged between  
   AP and the subscriber should be encrypted in order not to be      
   understood by others. IEEE 802.11i is being standardized on new   
   form of robust security network (RSN) architecture.
8.4.1 IEEE 802.1x based authentication
                                                                     
   IEEE 802.1x enables edge devices such as bridge or AP to perform  
   authentication mechanism, and determines whether to allow or      
   block data transmitted by hosts.  It uses extended authentication 
   protocol (EAP) as a standard protocol to transmit subscriber's    
   authentication data. Authentication is based of userID and/or     
   password, and packets transmitted by un-authenticated hosts are   
   filtered and dropped by AP

   authentication

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
   The operation of IEEE 802.11 is as follows. Host trying to access 
   the Internet sends EAP-start message to AP. Then AP requests to   
   host subscriber ID information necessary for user authentication. 
   In this case, subscriber ID follows network access ID (NAI)       
   similar to e-mail address format, in order to support global      
   roaming and accounting.  Subscriber ID is inserted in             
   AAA EAP-attribute message and transmitted to authentication       
   server (such as Radius or TACACS server). Finally, authentication 
   procedure is completed when AP receives authentication            
   success/failure message from authentication server.
8.4.2 MAC address based authentication (non-standard)
                                                                     
   This mechanism supports host that does not support IEEE 802.1x.   
   In this mechanism, AP inserts MAC address of hosts into username  
   field and sends authentication message to authentication server.  
   The server determines authentication based on MAC address of host.
   This mechanism can be considered as unsafe method because         
   subscriber can lose the WLAN card and MAC address can be changed.
8.4.3 Data privacy
                                                                     
   WLAN is basically broadcast network. Therefore, every host within 
   service area of an AP can listen another host's communication     
   contents. Therefore, very complicated data privacy mechanism must 
   be provided in order not to be revealed by other hosts except     
   intended host. One method to accomplish privacy is to use         
   extension of IEEE 802.1x.  Once the subscriber is successfully    
   authenticated, master session key generated during authentication 
   procedure is inserted in authentication success message and       
   transmitted to AP. Then, AP exchanges the key with end host by    
   using EAPoL-key message and synchronizes when to use the key. And 
   then, AP encrypts EAP-success message with the key and sends it to
   the host in order to notify that the host is allowed to connect   
   WLAN by using IEEE 802.1x. After that, host and AP use            
   dynamically distributed key in order to guarantee privacy within  
   wireless area.
8.4.4 Intrusion Detection, Ingress Filtering, and Prevention
                                                                     
   Moreover, intrusion detection, ingress filtering and prevention   
   should be considered.
8.5 Network Management 
                                                                     
   ISPs manage the edge routers by SNMP. As well, ISPs need the      
   management of AP by means of its configuration tools.

   The mail, dns, caching, etc. servers for the customer is usually  
   managed by the ISPs.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
                                                                     
                                                                     
9.0 Broadband Ethernet 
                                                                     
   This section describes the Ethernet based residential access.
                                                                     
9.1. Topology
   Physical
   The layouts of Ethernet based accesses to the home are all almost 
   identical. They usually consist in a star topology terminated in  
   the apartment building or at a central point in the network. The  
   latter is probably not a common case and is used only for fiber   
   based access. The termination point usually consists of a switch  
   with varying functionality and in some cases a router. At this    
   termination point the network can be connected directly to a      
   metro network or to an aggregation point and a network access     
   server. 
                                                                     
   Logical
   The logical architecture for an Ethernet based access varies but  
   is fundamentally the same. A common practice is to use layer 2    
   Ethernet VLANs to separate the customers up to the network access 
   server. This is done to assure traceability and prevent           
   eavesdropping by customers as well as to be able to block         
   services such as local file sharing. 
   User authentication, other than the physical connection, is in    
   some cases used. It can consist of web login or PPPoE. Web login  
   can be done in two ways, one time login where the device's MAC-   
   address is registered and kept or session login where login is    
   done to activate the connection every time the user starts to use 
   it.  
   The simplest solution is a pure switched network where the users  
   are assigned static addresses and the only controlled device is a 
   router servicing one or several apartment buildings. In this case 
   PPPoE can be used for user authentication if any authentication   
   is used at all. 
                                                                     
9.2 Hardware
   Routers 
   Routers are used in the apartment buildings or centralized to     
   control the user traffic in addition to the actual routing. The   
   most common case is to have only switches in the apartment        
   buildings and the routers at an aggregation point since this      
   allows for one router to service several apartment buildings.     
                                                                     
   Switches 
   Switches are common in an Ethernet based home access. Usually     
   only layer 2 functionality is used such as Ethernet VLAN.         
                                                                     
   CPE (router, modem, pc, gateway, appliance, etc)
   There is no actual CPEs used if not the actual appliances used by 
   the customer is included.

                Transition Scenarios for ISP Networks      Feb. 2003 
9.3 Routing
   IGP
   The interior routing for Ethernet access doesn't differ to any    
   other routing used with in one particular ISP.                    
   The routing protocols normally used are IS-IS or OSPF.            
                                                                     
   EGP
   BGP is used for exchanging external routes.
   Exterior routing is not used towards the end customers since the  
   customer networks are seen as being directly connected to the     
   edge router and not having a CPE router in between. This means    
   that the customer network is routed directly to an interface on   
   the edge router and not to a customer router.                     
                                                                     
   Multicast
   Sometimes locally enabled to support services like IP-TV. At the  
   moment multicast is not commonly deployed and it is therefore no  
   general way of implementing it. 
                                                                     
   Addressing
   Usually one address is assigned to the user, dynamically by DHCP  
   or statically by manual configuration. Some operators may allow   
   the use of multiple addresses. 
                                                                     
   NAT
   Used in some cases when the operator doesn't have enough          
   addresses.
                                                                     
   Aggregation
   Aggregation of routes is usually done in several stages in the    
   network.
                                                                     
9.4 Traffic Engineering
   Traffic engineering is sometime used in the form of bandwidth     
   throttling. This sometimes adds equipment to the network due to   
   the need of an enforcer. The enforcer could be integrated in the  
   edge router or in a separate entity. 
   Filtering of traffic is also implemented in many networks mostly  
   as a simple protection of the users or in other cases as a way of 
   preventing certain services such as mail servers.                 
9.5 Security
   Security is usually implemented in the form of Ethernet VLAN to   
   separate the users and to enable traceability. The use of VLAN is 
   then used instead of any form of login since the users can be     
   traced through their VLAN TAG. A database mapping VLAN to IP-     
   address is used to allow historical traceability.                 
   To prevent misuse of addresses anti spoofing is implemented in    
   the network, usually on a per user level to prevent a user from   
   *borrowing* another users address.

   If PPPoE is used it provides both user authentication and         
   traceability. 	
   Filtering of well known file sharing ports to prevent             
   unintentional services is used as mentioned earlier.              
                                                                     
9.6 Network Management
   Usually out of band management is used to configure both routers  
   and switches located in the apartment buildings. This is normally 
   done through a separate Ethernet VLAN. The management tools are   
   more or less the same as in the core network.                     
                                                                     
9.7 Hosting Gear
   DNS is managed by the operator as well as any additional services 
   such as mail and web servers. The latter can also in some cases be

10.0 Internet Exchange (IX) 
                                                                     
   This section describes the infrastructure that exists in IPv4     
   Internet exchanges (IX). 
   An IPv6 IX, unlike current NAPs, may assign independent long-haul 
   provider addresses, according to [RFC2374]. An organization       
   subscribing such addresses will be able to change long-haul       
   provider without having to renumber. 
                                                                     
10.1  Topology 
                                                                     
   An IX is based on a layer 2 infrastructure that can be, either    
   local to given building, or distributed over a large are by the   
   way multiple interconnected point of presence. This layer 2       
   infrastructure enables players (e.g. long haul providers) that are
   connected to the IX to exchange routes.
   Figure 10.1a below, describes a typical single sited IX.

                         Figure 10.1a                                
                                                                     
                                                                     
   According to [RFC2374] aggreatable addresses are organized into a 
   three level hierarchy. IXs, together with long haul providers,     
   belong the higher one called "Public Topology". IXs will allocate 
   IPv6 addresses to its directly connected subscribers, providing   
   them addressing independence from long haul providers.  IX will   
   then have to include layer 3 functions, e.g. by the means of a    
   router, in order to exchange routes with long haul provider, for  
   gaining global connectivity to its subscribers. The figure below, 
   describes such a new type of IX introducing layer 3 functions,    
   and that topology differs from regular IPv4 IX.

                         Figure 10.1b                                
                                                                     
10.1.1  Hardware 
                                                                     
   Basically, a regular IX is based on a layer 2 switch, or set of   
   layer 2 switches that may either local to a building, or          
   distributed over larger area. It provides also room space and     
   power supply to enable long haul providers to install their own   
   routers and to exchange routes to each other according to a       
   peering agreement.
                                                                     
   In the case of an IX providing independent addresses to its       
   directly connected subscribers, the needed layer 3 function will  
   be based on a regular IPv6 router.
                                                                     
10.2  Routing
                                                                     
   The main goal of an IX, is to enable long haul provider to        
   exchange routes by the way of BGP4+ peering. An IX implementing   
   layer 2 devices only will not participate to into routing and     
   BGP4+ peering. 
                                                                     
   An IX providing independent addresses to its directly connected   
   subscribers, will exchange routes with long haul provider by the  
   way of BGP4+ peering. 
                                                                     
10.3 Traffic Engineering/Policing 
                                                                     
   In the case of an IX providing independent addresses to its       
   directly connected subscribers, specific rules may be introduced  
   in order to filter the traffic from a given subscriber to a       
   provider (or a set of provider) according to a given subscription 
   agreement.
