                 IPv6 ND PIO Flags IANA considerations
                      draft-ietf-6man-ndpioiana-01

Abstract

   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router
   Advertisement defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags defined and
   the remaining 6 bits reserved (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has defined a
   new flag from this field without creating a IANA registry or updating
   RFC 4861.  The purpose of this document is to request that IANA to
   create a new registry for the PIO flags to avoid potential conflict
   in the use of these flags.  This document updates RFC 4861.

1.  Introduction

   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router
   Advertisement defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags defined and
   the remaining 6 bits reserved (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has defined a
   new flag from this field without creating a IANA registry or updating
   RFC 4861.  The purpose of this document is to request that IANA to
   create a new registry for the PIO flags to avoid potential conflict
   in the use of these flags.

2.  Current Prefix Information Option flags

   Currently, the NDP Prefix Information Option contains the following
   one-bit flags defined in published RFCs:


                               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                              |L|A|R|Reserved1|
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

      L - On-link Flag [RFC4861]

      A - Autonomous Address Configuration Flag [RFC4861]

      R - Router Address Agent Flag [RFC6275]

      Reserved1 - Reserved

3.  Updates to RFC4861

   This document updates Section 4.6.2 "Prefix Information" of [RFC4861]
   to point to the new IANA registry that is created in this document.

   Specifically: The current list of flags in the Prefix Information
   Option can be found in [IANA-TBD].

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to create a new registry for IPv6 ND Prefix
   Information Option flags.  This should include the current flags in
   the PIO option.  The format for the registry is:

   The assignment of new flags in the PIO option header require
   standards action.

   The registry for these flags should be added to:
