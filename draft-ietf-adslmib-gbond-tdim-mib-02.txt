Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                 August 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing
   (TDIM), a.k.a.  G.Bond/TDIM, is specified in ITU-T G.998.3
   recommendation [G.998.3], which defines a method for bonding (or
   aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines into a single bi-directional
   logical link, carrying a mix of various traffic streams, e.g.
   Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Time-Division
   Multiplexing (TDM).

   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/
   TDIM-specific objects for the management of G.998.3 bonded
   interfaces, extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-
   MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   Management Framework for xDSL Bonding [TR-159], defining a management
   model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL
   interfaces.

4.  Relationship to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                 August 2009


4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/TDIM port is a private case of a Bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/TDIM ports in a
   system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular is describes the bonding management, port and channel
   configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and GBOND-TDIM-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   All management objects defined in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module are
   contained in a single group gBondTdimPort.  This group is further
   split into 6 sub-groups:

   o  gBondTdimPortNotifications - containing notifications (TDIM
      Service Down/Up).

   o  gBondTdimPortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of a
      G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  gBondTdimPortCapabilityTable - containing objects reflecting
      capability of a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  gBondTdimPortStatusTable - containing objects providing overall
      status information of a G.Bond/TDIM port, complementing the
      generic status information from the ifTable of IF-MIB and
      gBondFltStatus of GBOND-MIB.

   o  gBondTdimServiceTable - containing objects for configuration and
      status of the services in a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  gBondTdimPM - containing objects for an OPTIONAL Historical
      Performance Monitoring (PM) of a G.Bond/TDIM port.

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                 August 2009


5.1.1.  TODO/Open Issues

   o  _EdNote: Should we add Threshold Crossing Alerts for the
      Performance Monitoring?_

   o  _EdNote: We probably don't need 64-bit counters for PM_

   o  _EdNote: Masking/Inhibition rules for Service Notifications_

5.2.  Protection Configuration

   G.Bond/TDIM specification allows an optional Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) and Interleaver block, which, if supported and enabled,
   provides a degree of protection against micro-interruptions, alien
   noise, and even individual Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) failures,
   a.k.a. cut-line protection.

   Management objects in the gBondTdimPortConfTable can be used to
   configure and quiery the FEC and Interleaver function of the G.Bond/
   TDIM port.

5.3.  Service Configuration

   Unlike the other two xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes (G.Bond/ATM and
   G.Bond/Ethernet), which send the information required for reassembly
   of the fragmented data along with the data, G.Bond/TDIM is a
   synchronous scheme, requiring both ends to know the data distribution
   tables before any actual data transfer can happen.

   Management objects in the gBondTdimServiceTable can be used to
   configure and quiery the configuration of services transported via
   the G.Bond/TDIM link.  The services may be configured when the link
   is down prior to the link's initialization.  The sum of all the
   services' bandwidth SHOULD be less or equal to the target data rate
   of the bonded link.  Note that G.Bond/TDIM links are symmetrical,
   i.e. their upstream data rate equals to the downstream data rate.

5.3.1.  Management of TDM Services

   G.Bond/TDIM protocol provides an ability to map TDM services into the
   TDIM bonded link directly, without any additional overhead.  It
   addresses only structure-agnostic TDM transport, disregarding any
   structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular the
   structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704].

   There can be up to 60 services defined on a G.Bond/TDIM port.
   Services (rows in the gBondTdimServiceTable, indexed by
   gBondTdimServiceIdx ) are defined sequentially, starting from index

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                 August 2009


   1.  Rows for the undefined services MUST NOT exist.

   During bandwidth degradation services with a lower priority are
   impaired or dropped first.  Synchronous services (fractional DS1/E1,
   clear channel E1/T1, T3/E3, clock) have higher priority than
   asynchronous services (Ethernet, ATM, GFP encapsulated).  Within the
   services of the same type, those with lower index have higher
   priority.

   The service table, defining the type and size of each service, can
   only be changed on a BTU-C side (independently from the port's
   operational state), since the GBS-C port communicates the service
   table to the peer GBS-R port.

   _EdNote: Think about common things between G.Bond/TDIM and PWE3, may
   be there's a potential for reuse, see PW-*-MIB modules in
   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/pwe3-charter.html _

5.4.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
   buckets (interval-counters), simlar to those defined in [TR-159] are
   implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-
   TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of
   the textual conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each one
   day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a G.Bond TDIM port is reinitialized, but
   rather only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under
   specific request outside the scope of this MIB module).

5.5.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 and ITU-T G.998.3 Managed
      Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and managed objects defined in this
   document.  Note that all management objects defined in [G.998.3] have
   corresponding objects in [TR-159].

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB
   module that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.
   Most objects are writeable only when the link is down.  Writing to
   these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation, for example:

   o  Changing of gBondTdimServiceTable configuration paratemers (e.g.
      gBondTdimServiceType or gBondTdimServiceSize) MAY lead to a
      potential service impairment, for example a TDM service would be
      dropped if there is not enough actual bandwidth on the bonded link
      to support this service.

   o  Changing of gBondTdimPortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      gBondTdimFecAdminState) MAY lead to anything from link quality and
      rate degradation to a complete link initialization failure.

   The user of the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module must therefore be aware that
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An object identifier for gBondTdimMIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be
   allocated by IANA [1] in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this
   document is published as an RFC.
