                  YANG module for Software Identifiers
                      draft-birkholz-yang-swid-00

Abstract

   This document provides a YANG module definition that enables a system
   entity to provide detailed information about installed software
   components.  The structure of the module is based on the Concise
   Software Identifier draft and therefore also strongly related to the
   ISO 19770-2:2015 Software Identifiers standard.  Both standards
   provide no interface to transport the SWID tag information between
   system entities and this document leverages the wide adoption of YANG
   based management interfaces.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   Software Identification Tags (SWID tags [SWID]) or their binary
   equivalent - the CoSWID tags [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] - provide a
   versatile document standard that can be installed in conjunction with
   a software component on a system entity.  There is no standard
   interface to access, export, or transfer these tag document between
   system entities.  The following YANG module enables full, fine-
   grained access to every attribute and metadata defined in the SWID
   standards via a YANG-based management interface.

2.  YANG SWID module

   Every node defined is read-only, as there is no installation or
   deployment capability associated with tag information.  The
   descriptions of each attribute are derived from the SWID XML schema
   definition provided by ISO:

   http://standards.iso.org/iso/19770/-2/2015-current/schema.xsd

   The definitions were adapted and modified if appropriate.

   The following summary illustrates the module in tree format.  The
   complete YANG module can be found in Appendix A.

           software component has more than one tag that can represent
           that specific release. This may be the case if a CoSWID tag
           producer creates and releases an incorrect tag that they
           subsequently want to fix,  but with no underlying changes to
           the product the CoSWID tag represents. This could happen if,
           for example, a patch is distributed that has a link
           reference that does not cover all the various software
           releases it can patch. A newer CoSWID tag for that patch can
           be generated and the tag-version value incremented to
           indicate that the data is updated.";
