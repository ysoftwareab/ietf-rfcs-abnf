Abstract

   In the current Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) proposals, the mobile nodes
   do not implement any mobility management protocol.  This document
   proposes an enhancement to PMIPv6 protocol in order to improve Layer
   3 handover performance through borrowing some ideas from FMIPv6
   protocol and using IEEE 802.21 triggers.  It proposes to use FMIP
   PAR-NAR signaling to establish a tunnel and PAR uses this tunnel to
   send MN's packets to NAR during handover.  FMIP PAR-NAR signaling
   depends on the predictive and reactive modes of handover.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4068] introduces the operation of fast handovers for Mobile IPv6.
   [I-D.sgundave-mip6-proxymip6] defines Proxy Mobile IPv6 procedures.
   Based on the primitives defined in [802.21], this memo combines
   FMIPv6 operation with PMIPv6 protocol, and proposes a high
   performance handover solution in PMIPv6.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   ACoA:  Agent Care of Address.  From Home Agent perspective, all MNs
      attached to the same AR share one or more IPv6 addresses as their
      CoAs in PMIPv6 scheme.  These addresses could be the AR's egress
      interface IP addresses, or it's loopback IP addresses.  Defined as
      Proxy Mobile Agent (PMA) CoA in [I-D.sgundave-mip6-proxymip6].

   [BS-ID, AR-ACoA] tuple:  Contains ACoA of an AR to which a Base
      Station (identified by BS-ID) is attached.

   Additionally, we use the following triggers that are proposed by IEEE
   [802.21] and their standardization is in progress.

   Link Going Down (LGD):  A trigger from the link layer to IP layer in
      a BS to report that a link down event will be fired in the near
      future.
   Link Up (LUP):  A trigger from the link layer to IP layer in a BS to
      report that an MN completes L2 connection establishment with the
      BS.

   We define the following messages and some are similar to the
   definitions in [RFC4068].
   Handover Initiate (HI):  A message from PAR to NAR regarding MN's
      handover.
   Handover Acknowledge (HAck):  A message from NAR to PAR as a response
      to HI.
   Fast Binding Update (FBU):  A message from NAR to PAR instructing PAR
      to redirect MN's traffic (toward NAR).
   Fast Binding Acknowledgment (FBack):  A message from PAR in response
      to FBU.

3.  Protocol Operation

   Depending on whether L2 HO signaling is finished on a previous link,
   there are two modes of operation, that is, predictive and reactive
   mode.  The predictive mode is that L2 HO signaling finish on the
   previous link.

   The procedure is as follows:
   1.  In stage 1a and 1b, an MN performs access authentication and
       address configuration.  After finishing IP connectivity, the PAR
       does the mobility related signaling on behalf of the MN.  For

       detailed information, please refer to
       [I-D.sgundave-mip6-proxymip6].
   2.  Before the MN moves from serving Base Station (s-BS) to target
       Base Station (t-BS), negotiation occurs between the MN and s-BS
       through L2 handover signaling.
   3.  When the L2 handover decision is achieved, the s-BS sends Link
       Going Down (LDG) message to the PAR.  The following information
       MUST be included: t-BS ID.
   4.  There are [BS-ID, AR-ACoA] tuples in ARs.  These tuples are
       probably manually configured or through other mechanisms which
       are out of scope for this memo.  Once receiving LGD message, the
       PAR retrieves NAR's ACoA through [BS-ID, AR-ACoA] tuple, and
       sends HI with the following information: the MN's IP address, the
       PAR's ACoA, the MN's Link Layer Address(LLA).  The NAR creates a
       Neighbor Cache entry for the MN based on the information of the
       HI message.
   5.  To reply the HI, the NAR sends HAck to the PAR.  Once HAck is
       received by the PAR, a bidirectional tunnel is established, and
       the PAR's ACoA and the NAR's ACoA are the tunnel's two ends.
   6.  PAR decapsulates the packets received from the HA-PAR tunnel and
       then relays them to NAR through PAR-NAR tunnel.
   7.  When a layer 2 link is established, the t-BS sends a LUP message
       to the NAR.
   8.  The NAR sends Router Advertisement(RA) with the NAR's information
       which facilitates the MN to send packets.
   9.  The NAR delivers the buffered packets to the MN.

                          Figure 2: Reactive Mode

   The procedure is as follows:

   1.  An MN performs network re-entry process, and link layer
       connectivity is established.

   2.  The target BS (t-BS) sends LUP message to the NAR.  The s-BS
       identifier, LLA of the MN MUST be included in this message.

   3.  The NAR sends Router Advertisement(RA) with the NAR's information
       which facilitates the MN to send packets.

   4.  There are [BS-ID, AR-ACoA] tuples in ARs.  These tuples are
       probably manually configured or through other mechanism, and how
       to formulate the tuples is out of scope for this memo.  Once
       receiving LUP message, the NAR retrieves PAR's ACoA through
       [BS-ID, AR-ACoA], and sends FBU to the PAR with the following
       information: the NAR's ACoA, MN's LLA.

   5.  Based on the MN's LLA, the PAR retrieves the MN's IP address from
       it's Neighbor Cache, and sends the IP address to the NAR in FBack
       message.  The NAR builds a Neighbor Cache entry of the MN after
       receiving FBack message.  During the message exchanges, a
       bidirectional tunnel is established, and the PAR's ACoA and the
       NAR's ACoA are the tunnel's two ends.

   6.  Packets destined to the MN are tunneled from HA to PAR then
       relayed to NAR through PAR-NAR tunnel.

   7.  The NAR delivers packets to the MN.


4.  IPv4 Considerations

   The main idea of this document is also applicable in IPv4 scenario,
   and some IPv6 specific sigaling should be modified.  Modifications
   are TBD.


5.  Message Formats

   All the messages between PAR and NAR are ICMPv6 messages and are
   defined in [RFC4068].  The messages that require modifications are
   specified below.

5.1.  Handover Initiate (HI)

   TBD

5.2.  Handover Acknowledge (HAck)

   TBD

5.3.  Fast Binding Update (FBU)

   TBD

5.4.  Fast Binding Acknowledgement (FBack)

   TBD


6.  Security Considerations

   The assumption of this proposal is that signaling between ARs is
   safe.  There is no signaling exchange between MNs and ARs.


7.  IANA consideration

   None.
