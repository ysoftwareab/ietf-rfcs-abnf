Abstract

   This memo defines a MIME directory profile for content transfer and
   encoding of meta data elements used for cataloging schema listings in
   a directory schema listing service.

1.0 Introduction

   The fastest route to interoperable directory services is through
   standard object classes and attribute types. There is a growing
   number of places where schema for Internet Directory Services and
   Internet Operations are being defined, with varying degrees of
   documentation.  This plethora of schema is unavoidable in the light
   of the needs of different service communities, but it makes it
   difficult for directory service builders to find and make use of an
   existing schema that will serve their needs and increase
   interoperability with other systems. A listing service providing a
   single point of discovery for directory service schema will promote
   schema reuse, reduce duplication of effort, and thus promote
   directory service interoperability. Meta data will be used to catalog

   and distinguish schema listings in this service. This document
   defines a [MIMEDIR] profile for meta data content transfer and
   encoding.

1.1 Terms and Definitions

   Information Object - a descriptive abstraction of some real-world
   object

   Schema - a collection of definitions for related information objects

   Listing Meta Data - characteristics that differentiate one schema
   from another; used to catalog schema

   Listing Content - a formal specification of a schema using a profile
   of [MIMEDIR]

   Schema Listing - the combination of listing meta data and all
   available listing content for a particular schema

   Repository - a database in which schema listings are stored

   Schema Listing Request - a schema listing formatted using [MIME]
   constructs that is submitted for consideration as a schema listing to
   be published in a repository

   Operator - an organization that administers and maintains a
   repository

   Primary Repository - the repository that masters the schema listings
   database

   Shadow Repository - a repository that mirrors the primary repository

   Contact Person - the name of the individual who holds the authority
   to update a schema listing and who should be contacted if questions
   or concerns arise related to a schema listing or schema listing
   request

   Listing Authority Contact - the name of the individual who holds
   authority to replace a contact person; can be either the contact
   person for a schema listing or an alternate contact within the
   organization to which the contact person belongs (this allows one
   person organizations to list schema)

   The terms for specifying requirement level described in [RFC2119] are
   used in this document.

2.0 The "schema-metadata-0" MIME Directory Profile Registration

   This profile is identified by the following registration template
   information.

   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME profile
    "schema-metadata-0"

   Profile Name: schema-metadata-0

   Profile Purpose: To represent meta data for a schema listing stored
    in the repository or a schema listing request under community
    review.

   Profile Types: listingName, schemaTitle, schemaUse, availableProfile,
    relatedTo, contactLanguage, contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone,
    contactAddress, authLanguage, authName, authEmail, authPhone,
    authAddress, contentURL, security, created, moreInfo, caveat,
    listingComments

   Profile Special Notes:

    The charset parameter MUST be present in the MIME content header and
    the value of this parameter MUST be "utf-8".

    Neither the "BEGIN", "END", nor "SOURCE" type is used in the
    contents of this profile.

    Type grouping is not used in the contents of this profile.

    Each MIME Directory Type Registration that follows in section 3 of
    this document includes a specification of whether or not a
    particular type is constrained to be single-valued or permitted to
    be multi-valued. Types that are permitted to be multi-valued MUST
    have at least one value, unless otherwise noted in the 'Type special
    notes' component of a type definition.

    Implementors should note that there will likely be values of profile
    types in some contents much longer than 76 bytes. In addition, there
    may be non-ASCII characters and embedded CRLFs inside of values,
    which could require either quoting of the value or use of a content
    transfer encoding.

    The following types MUST be included by schema writers in all schema
    listing requests: listingName, schemaTitle, schemaUse,
    availableProfile, contactLanguage, contactName, contactEmail,

INTERNET-DRAFT     Directory Schema Listing Meta Data   17 November 1997


    contactPhone, contactAddress, authLanguage, authName, authEmail,
    authPhone, authAddress, moreInfo, and security.

    The 'listingName' type value provided by the schema writer is
    temporary and only intended for use during the schema listing
    request review period.

    The permanent 'listingName' type value MUST be created by the
    primary listing repository operator.

    The 'relatedTo' type value MUST be provided by the schema writer as
    a part of the schema listing request if the schema listing proposed
    in the request has a relationship to published schema listings
    and/or other schema listing requests being review.

    If one or more schema writers are submitting a set of related schema
    listing requests in parallel, the <req-filename> production of the
    'relatedTo' type value MUST be used, rather than the <md-filename>
    production.

    The following types MUST be provided by the primary schema listing
    repository operator and MUST NOT be accepted from the schema writer:
    contentURL, created, and listingComments.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

3.0 MIME Directory Type Registrations

   This document defines all types use in the schema-metadata-0 profile.
   These types are intended for use in the "schema-metadata-0" profile,
   although they may be applicable to other profiles defined in the
   future.

3.1 listingName

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type listingName

   Type name: listingName

   Type purpose: To represent a globally unique identifier for the

   BNF in [RFC822]):

       ; name assigned by a schema writer during
       ; creation of a listing request

    guid = <a GUID as created according to [GUIDGEN] or [GUIDOTHER]>

   Type special notes:

    This type MUST be single-valued.

    A language parameter MUST NOT be used with this type.

    For published schema listings, a value of this type is an OID
    constructed by the primary listing repository operator based on a
    root OID administered by the operator, a listing sequence number
    generated by the operator, and a listing version number assigned by
    the operator.

    For schema listing requests a value of this type is an OID assigned
    by or a GUID generated by the schema writer creating the request
    with an appropriate prefix to indicate that it is a temporary schema
    listing name.

    Examples of such relationships include deprecation, revision,
    inheritance, and those specific to a particular vendor.

    of this type MUST be assigned a temporary value relavent to the

5.0 Security Considerations

   The text/directory profile defined in this document does not provide
   any method for carrying authentication information.




Apple                                                          [Page 21]

INTERNET-DRAFT     Directory Schema Listing Meta Data   17 November 1997


   The text/directory profile defined in this document allows content
   external to any schema listing service repository to be referenced in
   the schema listing and includes an MD5-based fingerprint of the
   refernced content itself. Users of the schema listing service SHOULD
   take steps to verify that this external information has not changed
   since schema listing publication. Users should also be aware that
   such external content is outside of the control of the schema listing
   service operators.

   A MIME body part containing contents structured according to the
   text/directory profile defined in this document MAY be incorporated
   in a digitally signed MIME content, which can be used to verify that
   the body part has not been modified during transit. If a signer has
   been certified by a trusted third party, it may also be possible to
   verify the origin of the content.
