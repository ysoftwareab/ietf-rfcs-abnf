Abstract

   This memo presents a technique for using XML (Extensible Mark-up
   Language) as a source format exchanging WHOIS data related to Domain
   Registration Information, for the purpose of exporting Registry, 
   Registrar, or Registrant  data into a portable and verifiable
   format. 

   Discussion on this Internet-Draft is to be held on the mailing list
   ietf-whois@imc.org, which is hosted by the Alice's Registry, Inc. To
   subscribe, send an email to ietf-whois-request@imc.org,  with the
   text "subscribe" as the only word in the body of the mail. There is

1. Introduction

   The whois service [4] has been distributed among ICANN approved
   registrars since the breakup of the NSI monopoly on Domain
   Registrations. This data is now served up my many non-interpolating
   WHOIS servers. 

   The data contained in a WHOIS response is consist and but the
   formatting varies from Registrar to Registrar. This document
   proposes a XML encapsulation of WHOIS data what will add the
   necessary structure to support the exchange of WHOIS records among
   Registrars. 

   This format is also suitable for Registrant data escrow required by
   ICANN for all Registrars.

2. Export Format Description

2.1 Whois Element

    "whois" example. 


             <whois registrar="example">
               ....
             </whois>

   The "whois" element is the outer most element in the XML DTD. This
   element MUST contain a mixture of "contact", "ns", or "domain"
   elements. 

   The "registrar" attribute is a unique string identifying the
   Registrar of record for the data presented in the "whois" element. 

   The "whois" element may also deligate authority for any object to
   another host. this is done by placing a hostname in the "referal"
   attribute as in the example below. 

    "whois referal" example. 


             <whois registrar="example" referal="whois.example.com">
               ....
             </whois>

   the the "status" Attribute SHOULD be set for the "domain" element. 

   The status attribute MUST be set to one of the following attributes: 

   active: This is the default status of a domain at registration time.
      The registry sets the domain to this status. The domain is
      modifiable by the registrar. The domain can be renewed. The

      domain SHALL be included in the zone file when in this status if
      the domain has at least one associated name server. 

   registry-lock: The registry sets the domain to this status. The
      domain cannot be modified or deleted by the registrar. The
      registry MUST remove the REGISTRY-LOCK status for the registrar
      to modify the domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL
      be included in the zone file when in this status if the domain
      has at least one associated name server. 

   registry-hold: The registry sets the domain to this status. The
      domain cannot be modified or deleted by the registrar. The
      registry MUST remove the REGISTRY-HOLD status for the registrar
      to modify the domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL
      NOT be included in the zone file when in this status. 

   registrar-hold: The registrar of the domain sets the domain to this
      status. The domain can not be modified or deleted when in this
      status. The registrar MUST remove REGISTRAR-HOLD status to modify
      the domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL NOT be
      included in the zone file when in this status. 

   registrar-lock: The registrar of the domain sets the domain to this
      status. The domain cannot be modified or deleted when in this
      status. The registrar MUST remove REGISTRAR-LOCK status to modify
      the domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL be
      included in the zone file when in this status. 

   registry-delete-notify: A domain is set on this status if it has
      expired and has child name servers that are hosting other
      domains. Only the registry may set this status. The domain SHALL
      be included in the zone file when in this status if the domain
      has at least one associated name server.

3. Query Format

   The ability to structure queries to XML enabled whois servers is
   critical for the ability to retrieve XML encapsulated results. Some
   of the objects MAY be implemented by Registries or Registrars, not
   all objects are required. 

3.1 The Query Element

   The "query" element provides a structured means to request an object
   from a XML capable Whois server. Query results MAY contain a Referal
   insted of a complete object. 

3.2 Query Attributes

3.2.1 The type Attribute

   The "type" attribute of a query MUST be set to one of the following
   values. 

   Finds a domain record. When the type attribute is set to "domain"
   this will restrict the query and result set to only domin objects. 
   For example, "domain example.com" 

   When the type attribute is set to "nameserver" this will restrict
   the query and result set to only host objects. For example,
   "nameserver ns1.example.com" 

   Finds records for "registrar". Find out Registrar name, mail
   address, phone number and contact information. For example,
   'registrar Network Solutions, Inc.' This value is only required by
   Registries. 

   Finds records for Individuals or Roles. 

   A value of "any" is the default, searching as many object types as
   available. 

3.2.2 The flags Attribute

   The "flags" attribute modify how the server responds to queries. 

   Queries will only be presented to other registrars and only will be
   applied to the authortative data stored in the registrars database. 

   This gives a complete response for each matching record, not just
   when there's only a single match. The results from a query resulting
   in large volumes of result sets, MAY impose a limit on how many
   result may be returned for a single query.

4. Security Considerations

   The Whois protocol doesn't include any security functions at all,
   and this paper raises no security issues nor adds any such security
   features. 

   If this export format is used for Data Escrow of a Registrars WHOIS
   data, the movement of the data from the registrar to ICANN or an
   ICANN representative tasked with performing the job of Data Escrow,
   the connection should be secured.
