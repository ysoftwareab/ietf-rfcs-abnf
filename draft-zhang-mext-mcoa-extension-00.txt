     Abstract 

       The Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration [2] is a useful protocol 
       which allows a mobile node to get Internet access through multiple 
       accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would be 
       configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses. It proposes 
       extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register and use multiple 
       care-of addresses with the Binding Identifier Mobility Option. This 
       document describes a simple extension to Binding Identifier Mobility 
       Option to allow mobile node to select the most wanted link for the 
       ongoing service.

      1. Introduction 

       The Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration [2] document proposes 
       extensions to Mobile IPv6 to allow a mobile node to register multiple 
       care-of addresses for a home address and create multiple binding 
       cache entries. The BID information stored in the Binding Identifier 
       Mobility Option is created for each binding the mobile node wants to 
       create and sent in the binding update. However, The Multiple Care-of 
       Addresses Registration [2] document mainly focuses on how to 
       establish and remove the multiple bindings and does not solve the 
       handover using from one binging to another which is a very actual 
       problem. The extension to the Binding Identifier Mobility Option 
       proposed in this document allows mobile node to notify corresponding 
       entity (Home Agent or Corresponding Node) of the most wanted using 
       link for the ongoing communication. 

      2. Extended Binding Identifier Mobility Option 

       The following (Figure 1) is the definition of the extended format of 
       Binding Identifier Mobility Option.

       Type 

       Type value for Binding Identifier is TBD 

       Length 

       8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the option, in octets, excluding 
       the Type and Length fields.  It MUST be set to either 6, 14, or 22 
       depending on the care-of address field.  When the care-of address is 
       not carried by this option, the length value MUST be set to 6.  If 
       the IPv4 care-of address is stored in the care-of address field, the 
       length MUST be 14.  Otherwise, the Length value MUST be set to 22 for 
       IPv6 care-of address. 

       Binding ID (BID) 

    The BID which is assigned to the binding indicated by the care-of 
    address in the Binding Update or the BID mobility option. The BID is a

    16-bit unsigned integer.  The value of zero is reserved and MUST NOT be 
    used. 

       Status 

    When the Binding Identifier mobility option is included in a Binding 
    Acknowledgement, this field overwrites the status field in the Binding 
    Acknowledgement.  If this field is zero, the receiver MUST use the 
    registration status stored in the Binding Acknowledgement message.  
    This Status field is also used to carry error information related to 
    the care-of address test in the Care-of Test message.  The status is 8-
    bit unsigned integer.  The possible status codes are the same as the 
    status codes of Binding Acknowledgement. 

       Overwrite (O) flag 

    When this flag is set, a mobile node requests the recipient to replace 
    all the bindings to binding entries stored in a Binding Update. 

       Simultaneous Home and Foreign Binding (H) flag 

    This flag indicates that the mobile node registers multiple bindings to 
    the home agent while is attached to the home link. This flag is valid 
    only for a Binding Update sent to the home agent. 

    Using BID changing (D) flag 

    When this flag is set, the mobile node requests the recipient to use 
    the binding identified by the BID and stop using the binding identified 
    by the UBID stored in the Using BID space. 

       Reserved 

    4 bits Reserved field.  The reserved field MUST be zero. 

       Using Binding ID (UBID) 

    The Using BID indicates the active binding which is used for the 
    ongoing communication. The BID is a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The value 
    of zero is reserved and MUST NOT be used. 

       Care-of Address 

    This field has the variable length depending on the specified flags.  
    Either IPv4 or IPv6 care-of address for the corresponding BID can be 
    stored in this field.  This field MUST NOT be used if a Binding

    Identifier mobility option is included in any other message other than 
    a Binding Update. 

      3. Security Considerations 

       This document introduces a new Multiple Care-of Addresses 
       Registration extension that is used to change the link for the 
       ongoing communication among the multiple links corresponding to 
       multiple bindings. The BID Mobility option messages that carry this 
       extension MUST be authenticated as described in [1], unless other 
       authentication methods have been agreed upon. Therefore, this 
       extension does not lessen the security of Multiple Care-of Addresses 
       Registration protocol.
