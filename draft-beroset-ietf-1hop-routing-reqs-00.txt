                  Mesh Under IPv6 Routing Requirements
              draft-beroset-ietf-1hop-routing-reqs-00.txt

Abstract

   Wireless mesh routing for low cost wireless mesh devices can be done
   at a layer under IPv6.  This document examines the functional
   requirements of this kind of routing and to explore why this approach
   might be used in some contexts.  It should be noted that this kind of
   routing is orthogonal to IP-level routing; there is no inherent
   conflict between the two.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Routing in wireless mesh networks is different from routing in
   conventional wired networks.  In a wireless mesh network, nodes that
   wish to send messages to distant nodes which may be beyond radio
   range may rely on intermediate nodes to relay messages, effectively
   increasing the effective range of all participating nodes.  In a
   conventional wired network, this routing and forwarding function is
   performed by routers, as distinguished from ordinary nodes which
   often do not have a routing function.  By contrast, in wireless mesh
   networks, it is not uncommon for every node to also perform a routing
   and forwarding function.  There has already been work done on the
   requirements for route-over schemes for wireless networks for
   buildings [RFC5867], homes [RFC5826], industrial automation [RFC5673]
   and urban applications [RFC5548] but not yet for the route-under
   variation in which routing is done beneath the IP level.

3.  Node and Channel Characteristics

   Nodes in this network may have very little memory, low bandwidth
   connections, power constraints due to battery power, and an expected
   long lifetime.  An example of such a node may be a wireless telemetry
   module for a water meter which is expected to last for more than a
   decade on a single battery.

   Further, nodes may have intermittent connectivity due to a variety of
   reasons, including channel fading, battery depletion in intermediate
   nodes, or temporary channel impairments such as may be caused by
   having a vehicle parked in the transmission path.  For these reasons,
   it can be expected that routing information may be quite dynamic,
   even in the case of a network consisting solely of fixed-location
   nodes.

4.  Requirements

   The routing protocol MUST be transparent to the overlying IP network.
   That is, each node within the wireless mesh network is one hop away
   from the IP perspective.

   The routing protocol MUST be usable even in the event that the
   underlying wireless netowrk is not capable of transmitting the full
   1260-byte IPv6 datagram, as specified in [RFC4944].

   The routing protocol MUST have a low burden on the intermediate
   nodes.  This burden includes computational, memory and power usage.
   Less obviously, perhaps, is that minimizing the number of timers used
   is also useful.

   The routing protocol MUST have a means by which troubleshooting can
   be effected.  That is, if personnel maintaining the devices must
   determine, for example, if a particular node is not performing
   adequately or correctly, some mechanism or data needs to be available
   to assist in that work.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations of routing protocols generally include the
   prvention and/or detection of denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.  In
   such attacks, an adversary causes one or more nodes to expend its
   resources to the degree that legitimate users of the network are
   denied access or suffer reduced performance.  It would be useful to
   consider ways in which this kind of attack could be eliminated.  If
   that is not possible given other requirements, it may be acceptable
   to reduce their effect and/or provide a mechanism to detect such
   attacks.
