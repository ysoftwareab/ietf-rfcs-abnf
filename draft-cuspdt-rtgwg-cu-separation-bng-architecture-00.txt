1.  Introduction

   BNG device is defined as an Ethernet-centric IP edge router, and the
   aggregation point for the user traffic.  It performs Ethernet
   aggregation and packets forwarding via IP/MPLS, and supports user
   management, access protocols termination, QoS and policy management,
   etc.

   This document introduce an architecture of BNG devices with control
   plane (CP) and user plane (UP) separation.  BNG-CP is a user control
   management component while BNG-UP takes responsibility as the network
   edge and user policy implementation components.  Both BNG-CP and BNG-
   UP are core components for fixed broadband services and deployed
   separately at different network layer in actual network.

1.1.  Motivation

   The rapid development of new services, such as 4K, IoT, etc, and
   increasing numbers of home broadband service users present some new
   challenges for BNGs such as:

      Low resource utilization: The traditional BNG acts as both a
      gateway for user access authentication and accounting and an IP
      network's Layer 3 edge.  The mutually affecting nature of the
      tightly coupled control plane and forwarding plane makes it
      difficult to achieve the maximum performance of either plane.

Internet-Draft      Architecture for CU Separated BNG          June 2018


      Complex management and maintenance: Due to the large numbers of
      traditional BNGs, a network must have each device configured one
      at a time when deploying global service policies.  As the network
      expands and new services are introduced, this deployment mode will
      cease to be feasible as it is unable to manage services
      effectively and rectify faults rapidly.

      Slow service provisioning: The coupling of control plane and
      forwarding plane, in addition to a distributed network control
      mechanism, means that any new technology has to rely heavily on
      the existing network devices.

   To address these challenges, cloud-based BNG with CU separation
   conception is raised [TR-384].  The main idea of Control-Plane and
   User-Plane separation method is to extract and centralize the user
   management functions of multiple BNG devices, forming an unified and
   centralized control plane (CP).  And the traditional router's Control
   Plane and Forwarding Plane are both preserved on BNG devices in the
   form of a user plane (UP).  Note that the CU separation conception
   also be introduced by 3GPP 5G architecture [3GPP.23.501].

2.  Concept and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   BNG: Broadband Network Gateway.  A broadband remote access server
   (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes traffic to and from broadband remote
   access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers
   (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider's (ISP) network.  BRAS can
   also be referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).

   CP: Control Plane.  The CP is a user control management component
   which supports to manage UP's resources such as the user entry and
   user's QoS policy

   UP: User Plane.  UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.  The traditional router's Control Plane and forwarding
   plane are both preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane.

   AAA: Authentication Authorization Accounting.

   DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

   MANO: Management and Orchestration.

   NFV: Network Function Virtualization.

   PPPoE: Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet.

3.  CU separated BNG architecture

   There are two parts of functions in traditional BNG: one is user
   access management function, the other is router function.  While in
   cloud-based BNG, we find out that tearing these two functions apart
   can make a difference.  Actually the user management function can be
   centralized deployed as a concentrated module or device which can be
   called BNG-CP (Control Plane).  The reserved functions such as router
   function and forwarding engine can be deployed in the form of BNG
   User Plane.  Thus the Cloud-based BNG architecture is made up of
   control plane and user plane.

   The following figure describes the architecture of CU separated BNG:

                     Architecture of CU Separated BNG


   AS above figure, the BNG Control Plane could be virtualized and
   centralized, which provides significant benefits such as centralized
   session management, flexible address allocation, high scalability for
   subscriber management capacity, and cost-efficient redundancy, etc.
   The functional components inside the BNG Service Control Plane can be
   implemented as VNFs and hosted in a NFVI.

   The User Plane Management module in the BNG control plane centrally
   manages the distributed BNG User Planes (e.g. load balancing), as
   well as the setup, deletion, maintenance of channels between Control
   Planes and User Planes.  Other modules in the BNG control plane, such
   as address management, AAA, and etc., are responsible for the
   connection with outside subsystems in order to fulfill the service.
   Note that the User Plane SHOULD support both physical and virtual
   network function.  For example, BNG user plane L3 forwarding related
   network functions can be disaggregated and distributed across the

   physical infrastructure.  And the other control plane and management
   plane functions in the CU Separation BNG can be moved into the NFVI
   for virtualization [TR-384].

   The details of CU separated BNG's function components are described
   as following:

   The Control Plane should supports:

      (1)Address management: unified address pool management.

      (2)AAA and RADIUS: cooperation with the RADIUS server and others
      to implement AAA for access users.

      (3)Subscriber management: user entry management and forwarding
      policy management.

      (4)PPPoE/IPoE: process user dialup packets of PPPoE/IPoE.

      (5)UP management: management of UP interface status, and the
      setup, deletion, maintenance of channels between CP and UP.

   The User Plane should supports:

      (1)Control plane functions including routing, multicast and MPLS.

      (2)Forwarding plane functions including traffic forwarding, QoS
      and traffic statistics collection.

3.1.  Internal interfaces between the CP and UP

   To support the communication between the Control Plane and User
   Plane, several interfaces are involved.  Figure 2 illustrates the
   internal interfaces of CU Separated BNG.

          Internal interfaces between the CP and UP of the BNG device

   Service interface: The CP and UP use this interface to establish
   VXLAN tunnels with each other and transmit PPPoE and IPoE packets
   over the VXLAN tunnels which be present in [draft-huang-nov3-vxlan-
   gpe-extension-for-vbng].

   Control interface: The CP uses this interface to deliver service
   entries, and the UP uses this interface to report service events to
   the CP.  The requirements of this interface are introduced in [draft-
   cuspdt-rtgwg-cusp-requirements], and the carrying protocol are
   presented in [draft-cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-bng-protocol], the
   information model of this interface are presented in [draft-cuspdt-
   rtgwg-cu-separation-infor-model].

   Management interface: The CP uses this interface to deliver
   configurations to the UP.  This interface runs NETCONF [draft-hu-
   rtgwg-cu-separation-yang-model].

4.  The usage of CU separation BNG

   In the CU seprated BNG scenario, there are several processes when a
   home user accesses the Internet:

      (1)User dialup packets of PPPoE or IPoE from BNG-UP which will
      send to BNG-CP from BNG-UP's Service Interface.

      (2)BNG-CP processes the dialup packet.  Confirming with the
      outside neighboring systems in the management network, BNG-CP
      makes the decision to permit or deny of the dial through
      certification.

Internet-Draft      Architecture for CU Separated BNG          June 2018


      (3)After that, BNG-CP tells UP to do the responding forwarding
      actions with related policies.

      (4)If the user is certificated and permitted, the UP forwards the
      traffic into the Internet with related policies such as limited
      bandwidth, etc.  Otherwise, the user is denied to access the
      Internet.

   In the actual deployment, a CU separated BNG device is composed of CP
   and UPs.  CP is centralized deployed which takes responsibility of a
   user control management component managing UP's resources such as the
   user entry and forwarding policy.  And UP is distributed in the
   bottom acting as a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.

   In order to fulfill a service, Neighboring policy and resource
   management systems is deployed outside.  In the neighboring system,
   different service systems such as RADIUS server, DHCP server and EMS
   are included.  Besides if BNG-CP is virtualized as a NFV.  The NFV
   infrastructure management system MANO is also included here.  BNG-CP
   has connections with the outside neighboring systems to transmit
   management traffic.

   The deployment scenarios are described as following figure:
