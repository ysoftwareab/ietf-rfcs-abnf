     Abstract 

     If a Mobile Node communicates with different Corresponding Nodes and 
     there exists a common path for these sessions, NSIS allows these 
     reservations to be aggregated. However, change of aggregation path 
     caused by mobility event creates problems related to the prompt removal 
     of the old aggregation state in case Correspondent Nodes are NSIS 
     Initiators,  i.e.  multiple  Correspondent  Nodes  will  send  multiple 
     teardown messages for tearing down the same unused aggregated section 
     and may cause problems of extra signaling overhead, delay in tearing 
     down, reliability, redundancy and extra processing overhead. This draft 
     presents the analysis of these problems.

     1. Introduction 

        In a mobile communication network, tunneling is widely used, e.g. 
        from a mobile terminal to its foreign agent or home agent. These 
        tunnels usually result in aggregation of the data traffic for 
        different sessions. For path coupled signaling schemes, such as RSVP 
        [1] or NSIS [2], the aggregation of data traffic also means the 
        aggregation of signaling. The aggregator would modify certain path 
        discovery message, so that the end to end signaling messages will 
        skip the aggregation interior nodes and head directly towards the de-
        aggregator  similar  to  NSIS  tunneling  operation[3].  As  for  the 
        aggregated section, a separate session would be allocated for the 
        signaling management. This type of solution yields reductions in the 
        amount of states to be stored and amount of signaling message

        exchanged in the aggregation region. However, it also causes problems 
        for mobility support.  

        When there is a mobility event at the aggregator resulting in a 
        change of the de-aggregator, then the old aggregated path is no 
        longer used and needs to be torn down. Under current NSIS Signaling 
        scheme, tearing down aggregated sessions requires multiple RESERVE-
        with-TEAR to be sent on the old path from each of the CNs in case the 
        CNs are NSIS Initiators (NIs). Every Reserve-with-Tear message will 
        result in an update message [3] to be sent within the aggregated path 
        thus resulting in high overhead; which would keep increasing as the 
        number  of  sessions  increase.  All  this  makes  the  tearing  down 
        operation very slow and requires high processing overhead at the de-
        aggregator as well as the path QNEs. Moreover, if any of the RESERVE-
        with-TEAR  messages  is  not  successfully  delivered  to  the  De-
        aggregator, the aggregated path would not be torn down immediately.. 
        In such a case, the aggregated path will only be torn down after the 
        soft-state timer has expired. Relying on the soft-state timer will 
        delay the tearing down of aggregated reservation which is a huge 
        chunk of resources. Obviously, this prohibits new reservations to 
        utilize the aggregated resources. Therefore, there exists a need to 
        develop a scheme for efficiently removing the aggregated resources. 

        This  draft  explores  the  problems  associated  with  tearing  down 
        aggregated reservations in NSIS. It also explores possible approaches 
        for  providing  expedited  and  efficient  teardown  of  aggregated 
        reservations. First, the Aggregation scenarios are presented in 
        section 2, followed by the possible problems that may arise while 
        tearing down the aggregated paths in section 3. Section 4 explores 
        the possible solution approaches, which are classified into two 
        categories: (a) Policy based and (b) Explicit signaling based. In 
        policy based approach the De-aggregator detects MN's movement and 
        tears down the path, whereas in the signaling based approach, the MN 
        signals to either the CN or the De-aggregator directly informing them 
        of the change in aggregation path.

     3. Aggregation Scenarios in Mobile Environments:-     

        In general, aggregation occurs, when there are multiple sessions 
        sharing a common path. When one of the end-nodes is a Mobile Node, 
        and there is a mobility event, the old aggregated section (MN' to DA-
        1 in figure 1) may become obsolete. The unused reservations on the 
        old aggregated path (MN' to DA-1) need to be quickly removed in order 
        for newer sessions to make use of the reserved network resources. In 
        such a scenario it may also happen that the de-aggregation point also 
        changes (DA-2). This may result in the old aggregate reservation 
        being left un-attended since both the end points are no longer 
        present on the new path.

        The above situation may arise in various network scenarios such as:- 

        (i) HMIP [6] case, wherein a MN may move from one MAP to another. 
        This may require the old tunnel from the MN to the previous MAP to be 
        removed. 

        (ii)  Another  scenario  can  be  3G  inter-working,  where  the  MN 
        establishes a new tunnel with another PDG after moving to a new 
        location. In this case also, the network needs to release the 
        reserved resources on the old aggregated path from the previous 
        location of the MN to the old PDG.  

        (iii) Still a more complicated scenario may exist, wherein in the 
        above mentioned scenarios, the MN might be replaced by a mobile 
        network (MR). In this case, the MR may establish a new tunnel with 
        another AR and the previous aggregation path to old AR (or another 
        Gateway) needs to be quickly torn down. Here the end-to-end signaling 
        point is different from the aggregation point. 

        To illustrate the problem, HMIP case is described below in more 
        detail as an example scenario. 

     3.1. HMIP Aggregation under Mobility Scenario 

        When a Mobile Node communicates with different Corresponding Nodes 
        (CNs), for example CN-1, CN-2 and CN-3 in figure 2, there may exist a 
        common path for these sessions, for example between MN to MAP. NSIS 
        must allow such reservations to be aggregated [5]. Aggregations 
        generally begin at the MN and end at the de-aggregation point (MAP-
        1), as shown in figure 2. Individual path reservation will only be 
        visible after the MAP-1.  

        When the MN moves to another location (MN' to MN as shown in figure 
        2), the aggregated path would change as well and a new de-aggregation 
        point (MAP-2) will thus be created. This is as shown in figure 2 
        where the aggregation portion shifts from the path between MN' and 
        MAP-1 to the path between MN and MAP-2.

     4. Problem Statement 

        When new aggregation section is created, old one needs to be torn-
        down. There are two ways of tearing down, i.e. Soft-state Timer or 
        Explicit  Teardown  signaling.  For  tearing  down  such  aggregated 
        reservation, sending explicit teardown message (RESERVE-with TEAR) is 
        generally preferred. This is because, if the soft-state timer is 
        used, the tearing down of aggregated reservation which is a huge 
        chunk of resources will be delayed prohibiting new reservation to 
        utilize the aggregated resources.  

        However, with the explicit teardown signaling the CN will send a 
        RESERVE-with TEAR message to the aggregation section, removing the 
        reserved resources. Under aggregation scenarios explicit teardown 
        signaling may not work that well, as it may lead to extra signaling 
        overhead, redundancy and higher processing overhead. These problems 
        are further explained below in more detail.

        Using current NSIS signaling scheme, when a MN moves to a second 
        Access Network, the CN can receive trigger to teardown the old path 
        and establish the new path. This is as shown in figure 4; CN-1 may 
        receive a Query-1 message from the MN (from new location). The 
        trigger may also be in the form of a Binding process carrying the new 
        CoA of the MN towards the CN [8].  

        When the CN receives the QUERY or the BU message, it will issue a 
        Reserve-with-Tear-Flag (R+T) message onto the old path [8] as shown 
        in the network scenario in figure 3: e.g. R+T-1, R+T-2 and; R+T-3 
        will be generated by CN-1, CN-2 and CN-3, if there are three separate 
        sessions each to the three separate CNs. The different Reserve-with-
        Tear-Flag-n messages generated by the various CNs will arrive at the 
        old de-aggregation point (MAP-1) separately. Once the De-aggregator 
        receives the R+T message, it generates an Update message to be sent 
        on the aggregated path, for example Update-1, Update-2 and Update-3 
        generated by MAP-1 in figure 4.  

        The above operation may lead to the following problems:- 

          a. Higher Overhead-> Each of the Reserve-with-Tear-Flag messages 
            generated by the CNs will trigger an UPDATE over the aggregated 
            path, in total three UPDATE messages will be generated in the 
            scenario shown in figure 3 along with 3 Reserve-with-Tear-Flag 
            message. 
           
          b. Slow Operation-> The previous de-aggregator (MAP-1) in figure 3 
            will have to wait for all the three Reserve-with-Tear-Flag 
            messages to be received before tearing down completely the 
            aggregated path. For example, if path from CN-3 to MAP-1 is very 
            long, it will delay the removal of the aggregated path, even 
            though MAP-1 may have received the other two Reserve-with-Tear-
            flag message long time ago from CN-1 and CN-2. 
      
          c. Higher Processing Overhead-> Multiple messages are generated in 
            the current process as described before i.e. three Reserve-with-
            Tear-Flag  and  three  update  (Update-1,  Update-2.  Update-3) 
            messages, which need to be processed at the de-aggregator 
            leading to high processing overhead at the de-aggregator. 
      
          d. Reliability (Message Loss) issues-> If any of the Reserve-with-
            Tear-Flag messages is not successfully delivered from the CN to 
            MAP-1, then the aggregated path will be torn down very late

            using soft state. This will result in wastage of network 
            resources.                         
      
        If a MN is performing many handovers (e.g. due to fast speed in 
        micro-architecture  type  of  networks)  and  establishes  aggregate 
        reservations for multiple sessions along the movement path, it will 
        hog up a lot of network resources and the above mentioned problem 
        will get further aggravated and hamper the normal operation of the 
        network. Therefore, the teardown procedure for aggregated sessions 
        must be efficiently carried out in an expedited fashion. 
         
     5. Possible Approaches for the NSIS WG 

        The problems presented above need to be addressed by NSIS and some 
        solution defined. Possible approaches could perhaps involve:- 

        o  Based on relevant policy [9], the De-aggregator may decide at 
           some point that an aggregate reservation is no longer needed and 
           should be torn down. An example could be when one of the QNI 
           sends a Reserve-with-Tear-Flag to the DA and the DA tears down the 
           whole aggregated path without waiting for the remaining individual 
           teardown messages for that aggregated path. However, the drawback 
           of this approach may be that a large number of QNI in the network 
           need to be updated to support the policy based algorithms.   

        o  Another  approach  would  be  for  MN  to  provide  some  mobility 
           information to the network in order to explicitly and efficiently 
           teardown the old aggregated path. This category can be sub-divided 
           based on who takes the action as follows:- 

           - Teardown initiated by QNI: - In this approach, the MN can send 
           some information to the CN on its movement and the CN can detect 
           the change and accordingly send a teardown on the old path. This 
           involves embedding extra information in the end-to-end Teardown 
           message regarding the aggregation portion. The De-aggregator may 
           be able to teardown the entire aggregated path as soon as it 
           receives the first such modified teardown message.  

           - Teardown initiated by Tunnel Controller: - In this approach, the 
           MN can directly instruct the tunnel controller of the aggregated 
           path previously under use to teardown as it is no longer in 
           operation.

     6. Security Considerations 

        Current NSIS [5] protocol provides the basic security mechanism for 
        signaling, however when aggregation is involved because of different 
        bindings and ownerships of the sessions. This should be considered in 
        the future versions of this draft. 

     7. Conclusions 

          Mobility  events  in  an  aggregation  scenario  require  multiple 
          teardown messages to be sent on the old path, resulting in 
          excessive signalling and processing overhead. This may also not be 
          very reliable since if one of the teardown messages is lost, the 
          aggregated section may not be torn down immediately. Without these 
          teardown messages the old-path QNEs will have to wait until the 
          soft-state timer expires. This may not be desirable as aggregated 
          reservation may be a huge chunk of resources and not releasing 
          these resources quickly may prohibit new connections to acquire 
          these trapped resources. Thus after re-establishing NSIS state 
          along a new path the aggregated reservation on the old path needs 
          to be quickly removed using some reliable teardown signalling in 
          order to avoid wastage of resources. Different solution approaches 
          to overcome these problems are presented in this draft, which can 
          be further discussed or analysed by the working group.
