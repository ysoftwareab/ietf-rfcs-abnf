  1. Abstract

     Efficient transmission of voice over wireless links requires
     significant engineering effort.  Because of the high cost of
     bandwidth on such links, special techniques for compression of
     voice data and its transmission over the air have been developed.
     The compression techniques and the wireless physical layers have
     been co-designed for maximum spectral efficiency and human
     perceptual euphony.

     Voice over IP (VOIP) applications should be able to leverage this
     engineering effort when used over wireless links.  We advocate a
     "zero-byte header compression" approach to this problem in order
     to minimize the impact on typical VOIP applications and to
     maximize the flexibility of the supporting network elements.  This
     document outlines an architectural framework for a wireless VOIP
     application, including the wireless link layer and its interface
     to typical IP stack implementations, and discusses the protocol
     elements that should be standardized between the various
     components.

  2. Introduction

     Voice over IP (VOIP) promises to change radically the way that
     telephony services are built and delivered.  Integration of voice
     with the Internet will not just be a change in the way traffic is
     carried; rather, new types of services will be made possible by
     the integration of voice with existing Internet applications such
     as the World Wide Web and e-mail.  The key to these new services
     will be a platform that offers open programmability while offering
     a transport for VOIP in an integrated, robust, and efficient way.

     Wireless links offer great challenges to the transport of voice
     traffic, and significant engineering effort has gone into making
     them efficient for circuit voice applications.  New voice
     compression algorithms ("codecs"), such as EVRC [TIA-IS127] or AMR
     [ETSI-AMR] have been developed to minimize the amount of data that
     must be carried, and special over-the-air channels have been
     implemented to carry these codecs with a minimum of overhead bits
     and minimal latency.

     VOIP flows will be carried inside the Real-Time Protocol (RTP)
     [Shulzrinne96] on wired links.  However, for wireless links, the
     situation is less clear.  The limited bandwidth of wireless links
     makes it impossible to transmit the entire IP/UDP/RTP header with
     every packet, as the overhead would be prohibitive.  It is
     possible to compress these headers by transmitting only updates to
     the fields that change rather than the entire header [Bormann00],
     but these compression schemes are complex and can never entirely
     eliminate the overhead due to RTP.  Even when the header is
     compressed down to one byte per frame on average, the impact on
     spectral capacity is significant [Hiller00].  Also, the variable-
     sized frames produced by these compression protocols are
     unsuitable for typical wireless links that support only a limited
     number of frame sizes.

     The fundamental reason why these schemes cannot achieve the same
     efficiency as circuit data is that they discard information that
     is available at the physical channel layer, including the real-
     time nature of the traffic, which can assist in reconstructing the
     RTP header.  This document describes an architectural framework
     that allows such real-time information to be used while not
     restricting the choice of call control protocol, placement of call
     feature servers, or mobile station architecture.

     Cellular wireless technologies will support distinct bearer
     channels for real-time audio flows versus non-real-time data.
     Data for TCP, such as web or e-mail traffic, will suffer from the
     lossy nature of the wireless link unless a link-layer
     retransmission protocol is used to improve its reliability.  Such

  McCann, Hiller     Standards Track - Expires 06/01                   2

     a retransmission protocol (called the Radio Link Protocol or RLP
     in the emerging cellular data networks) does improve reliability
     but only at the expense of additional buffering and latency.
     Real-time audio streams cannot tolerate the additional latency,
     which could be on the order of 2 seconds.  For this reason, a
     separate bearer channel will be used for voice that does no
     retransmission.  This bearer will be very similar to the existing
     circuit voice channels.  The architecture outlined below allows
     the mobile station to make effective use of this channel for VOIP.

     The architecture of a mobile station should allow maximum
     flexibility in its hardware and software choices.  Two basic
     mobile station models have been identified in the wireless data
     community.  A "network model" station is one that is completely
     integrated, such as a phone plus browser or a palmtop with
     integrated radio hardware.  Such a device usually has a real-time
     operating system, a DSP chip for processing the audio codec, and
     an embedded IP stack implementation.  In contrast, a "relay model"
     station is one that is split in two: it consists of a piece of
     terminal equipment (such as a laptop computer) connected to a
     piece of radio equipment, usually by a serial connection.  The
     idea is to make use of the mostly stock operating system on the
     terminal equipment, while "relaying" the data to and from the
     wireless network via the radio equipment.  We take the point of
     view that VOIP applications must be supported for both kinds of
     mobile stations.  While network model phones will offer a tightly
     integrated set of services, relay model stations are likely to
     offer a much more open and programmable environment on the
     terminal equipment.  As these devices evolve we expect the
     distinction between network and relay models will blur as the
     wireless device moves closer to the UNIX notion of a "network
     interface" to a stock operating system, and the operating system
     evolves to take on more real-time functionality.

      Figure 1.  Reference architecture for a system implementing
                 zero-byte header compression.


     The architecture diagram consists of nine components connected to
     a peer system.  Note that we expect zero-byte header compression
     to be somewhat asymmetric in that it will usually be implemented
     between a mobile station, where the VOIP and other applications
     reside, and a peer network entity that is just a data link
     termination point and a first-hop Internet router.  As such, the
     peer system in the network will likely be missing the audio
     hardware and codec implementation, and may not participate in the
     VOIP control.  Also, the mobile station may not need to actually
     perform header stripping and regeneration if its codec
     implementation is connected directly to the physical channel,
     which will likely be required to achieve the desired latency
     guarantees.

     We name the zero-byte header compression control portion as "GEHCO
     control" in reference to the Good Enough Header COmpression
     proposal [Hiller00].  That document serves as a good example for
     the kinds of negotiation procedures and message formats that could
     be used for zero-byte header compression, but we believe this
     architecture to be sufficiently general to accommodate any similar
     proposal.

     In the following subsections we discuss each of the architectural
     elements in turn.  The next section will discuss the interfaces
     between them.

  3.1 Non Real-time Components

     It is important to distinguish between the real-time and non real-
     time components of Figure 1.  This is especially important for a
     relay model mobile station, as it impacts which elements of stock
     operating systems can be reused and which must be implemented as
     new real-time extensions.  In this subsection we examine the non
     real-time components.


  3.1.1 VOIP Control

     The VOIP control component is the implementation of the call
     signaling protocol, such as SIP [Handley00] or H.323 [ITU-H323].
     We make no assumptions on which protocol is used, and we do not
     require the network-side peer system to contain this element.  The
     mobile station will use one of the VOIP signaling protocols to
     interact with call feature servers that could be anywhere on the
     Internet.

     We assume that this component will open network-layer connections
     and will have access to the transport endpoint identifiers for the
     IP/UDP/RTP flow.  However we do not require this element to
     actually process audio data; it will probably be implemented in
     user-space and would therefore add unpredictable latency to such
     flows.


  3.1.3 IP Protocol Stack Implementation

     We assume that the mobile station implements an IP protocol stack
     in conformance with RFC 1122 [Braden89].  Note that such an
     implementation is usually not capable of supporting hard real-time
     tasks.


  3.1.4 Data Link Layer

     The data link layer is the interface between the IP protocol stack
     and the wireless network device.  For cdma2000, this will be PPP
     [TIA-IS835].  For GPRS, this will be LLC [ETSI-LLC], and for UMTS,
     this will be PDCP [ETSI-PDCP].

     For cdma2000, we assume a mostly stock PPP implementation for
     interaction with the physical channels that support data and
     perform retransmission.  However, because the data link layer is
     not a hard real-time component, we would not place it on the audio
     traffic path inside the mobile station.

                                GEHCOARCH                  November 2000


  3.1.5 GEHCO Control

     The GEHCO control component is responsible for negotiating the use
     of GEHCO with the peer system and for setting up context
     information such as the fixed portion of the IP/UDP/RTP header.
     It will interact with the VOIP control component to acquire these
     parameters, and will send them across the data link layer to the
     peer system.  It will also interact with the wireless device
     (possibly through the data link layer) to establish the physical
     audio channels and will identify the channel to be used when
     sending context information to the peer system.


  3.1.6 Other Non-Real-Time Applications

     We expect the terminal equipment to be a general-purpose computer
     and as such will have other applications running.  These
     applications may interact with other components such as the IP
     protocol stack, but in general will not be hard real-time tasks.
     These applications must co-exist will all the other components.


  3.2 Real-time Components

     Because we make use of the real-time nature of the physical
     channel, several components must be implemented as real-time
     tasks.  For a network model phone, this is similar to existing
     practice: a tightly integrated, real-time operating system on an
     embedded device schedules the audio sampling and playback to
     coincide with the physical frame rate of the wireless link.  For a
     relay model terminal, we wish to make use of the audio hardware on
     the connected terminal equipment.  This may require that the
     components be implemented using special real-time extensions to
     existing stock operating systems.


  3.2.1 Audio Hardware

     The audio hardware consists of the analog-to-digital (A/D) and
     digital-to-analog (D/A) converters used for sampling and playing
     back sound, along with the analog microphones and speakers.  In a
     network model phone this consists of the integrated equipment that
     is part of the phone.  In a relay model terminal it would be the
     "sound card" or other audio peripheral.  To achieve the required
     hard real-time performance we assume that special software drivers
     may be required in such relay model terminals.

                                GEHCOARCH                  November 2000


  3.2.2 Codec Implementation

     The codec implementation converts the sampled audio to and from
     the special wireless-specific encoding format.  For a network
     model phone, this encoding is carried out on dedicated Digital
     Signal Processing (DSP) hardware.  In a relay model terminal, we
     assume this is performed on the general purpose CPU of the
     terminal equipment.


  3.2.3 Physical Channel

     As mentioned before, there will be two physical channels
     supporting the mobile station: one that runs RLP retransmission,
     supporting the latency tolerant data applications; and another
     that resembles a voice circuit.  VOIP control signaling will
     traverse the data-oriented RLP channel, while the voice bearer
     traffic will traverse the real-time circuit-like channel.

     Both channels must be available to the upper layers regardless of
     whether a relay model or network model terminal is used.  The
     voice channel supports real-time traffic and performs no
     buffering.  It will send a frame at precise, periodic intervals,
     such as 20 milliseconds for cdma2000.  The codec implementation
     must be able to supply frames for the physical channel at exactly
     this rate.


  3.2.4 Header Stripping/Regeneration

     We expect the codec implementation to be directly connected to the
     physical channel on the mobile terminal side, and so concrete
     IP/UDP/RTP headers may not necessarily appear inside the mobile
     terminal.  Therefore, the header stripping/regeneration component
     is only really necessary on the network side of the zero-byte
     header compression protocol.  This component is drawn next to the
     data link layer in the diagram, and is responsible for classifying
     each packet coming down from the IP protocol stack against the
     fixed IP/UDP/RTP header fields we are attempting to compress.  The
     value of these fields is established by the GEHCO control
     component and installed into the header stripping component,
     possibly via the data link layer.  Once the header has been
     stripped this component must schedule the payload for transmission
     on the physical layer at the appropriate frame interval, according
     to the sequence number and timestamp received in the header.

     In the opposite direction, when packets arrive on the network side
     from the physical channel, this component is responsible for
     regenerating the proper IP/UDP/RTP header and passing the packet
     on to the IP protocol stack.  It makes use of the physical arrival

                                GEHCOARCH                  November 2000


     time to generate the proper timestamp and sequence number in the
     RTP header.

     Because the header stripping/regeneration component is sending and
     receiving packets from the IP protocol stack, it is at best a soft
     real-time component.  However, it must interact with the physical
     voice channel, which is a hard real-time component, both to
     properly record the frame arrival time and to schedule outgoing
     packets for transmission.  If the header stripping/regeneration is
     implemented in a separate network element from the physical
     channel, as is likely to be the case in the emerging cellular
     architectures [TIA-IS835], then this interaction could be
     accomplished with the proper use of sequence numbers on the
     interfaces between them so that each physical frame carries the
     information about precisely when it arrived or when it is to be
     transmitted.


  4. Interfaces

     In this section we examine the interfaces between the above
     components.  We distinguish between those interfaces that should
     be implemented as protocols, suitable for standardization in the
     IETF or elsewhere, and those that should remain Application
     Programming Interfaces (APIs) that may or may not need to be
     standardized.


  4.1 Protocol Reference Points

     In terms of new protocols, the interfaces that need to be
     standardized are listed below.  Some of these interfaces are
     opportunities for IETF protocols, while others should be carried
     out by other standards-setting organizations.


  4.1.1 GEHCO Control to Data Link Layer

     The GEHCO control component needs to negotiate the use of GEHCO
     with its peer and convey the static portion of the IP/UDP/RTP
     header to the peer.  This should be done in such a way that the
     network side is not required to participate in the VOIP control
     protocol.  This means the network side depends on the mobile
     station to inform it what are the RTP flows that should be
     classified by the header stripping component as appropriate for
     sending over the physical voice channel.  Rather than create a new
     network-layer protocol, we advocate using new data link messages
     between the two systems to convey this information.

     When the data link layer is PPP, it is appropriate for the IETF to
     standardize new message types.  The GEHCO proposal [Hiller00] is

  McCann, Hiller     Standards Track - Expires 06/01                   8
                                GEHCOARCH                  November 2000


     an attempt at this.  For other link layers it may be more
     appropriate to carry out this work in other standards-setting
     bodies, although the IETF message formats may get re-used here.


  4.1.2 Data Link Layer to Physical Channel

     Mobile terminals running PPP will typically generate an octet
     stream that is appropriate for an underlying physical channel
     running RLP.  However, prior to running PPP the mobile terminal
     must take steps to establish the channel.  Also, we require that
     the terminal be able to dynamically establish and release the
     voice channels used for real-time audio.  For a network model
     phone this may be supported by APIs within the phone, but for a
     relay model terminal this signaling needs to be carried out across
     a serial port.  Such signaling is usually the provenance of a
     modem control protocol ("AT commands") and standardization is
     probably best carried out in the International Telecommunications
     Union (ITU).  Note that in addition to the usual signaling to
     establish and release channels, we also need to obtain identifying
     information for each channel, along with a precise reference for
     the time at which the first physical voice frame will be
     transported across the wireless link.  This information will be
     used by the GEHCO control component to communicate the initial
     timestamp and sequence number offsets to the peer.  It must be
     possible to signal this information during a running PPP session.
     Also, the precise timing of handoff events in the network must be
     communicated to the GEHCO control implementation so that it can
     properly carry out negotiation with the new peer system.
     Alternatively, if GEHCO state is transferred from a source peer
     system to a target peer system, the relationship between RTP
     timestamps and physical layer frames must be preserved.


  4.1.2 Physical Channel to Codec or Header Stripping/Regeneration

     As stated above, the physical channel will interface directly to
     the codec implementation on the mobile station side and to a
     header stripping/regeneration process on the network side.  For a
     network model phone, the codec interface may be a proprietary API.
     However, for a relay model terminal, we must standardize a new way
     to transport the frames across a serial connection in real-time.
     This will require that we multiplex the real-time frames with the
     non-real-time data for PPP.  This multiplexing could be carried
     out with the use of escape characters on the serial interface;
     again, this work is probably best carried out within the ITU.  Any
     new special characters would need to be properly inserted into the
     ACCM of the PPP implementation.

     On the network side, the physical voice channel may be separated
     from the header stripping/regeneration process by an IP network.

  McCann, Hiller     Standards Track - Expires 06/01                   9
                                GEHCOARCH                  November 2000


     If this is the case then each physical frame must carry a sequence
     number that indicates the exact frame time that it was received or
     is to be transmitted over the air.  Standardization of such
     interfaces is best carried out within the 3rd Generation
     Partnership Projects (3GPPs).


  4.2 API Reference Points

     Other interfaces between the components are best done as
     Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and may or may not need
     to be standardized.  In any case we do not advocate the
     standardization of APIs within the IETF and we discuss these
     interfaces for illustration purposes only.


  4.2.1 VOIP Control to GEHCO Control

     The VOIP control component is responsible for end-to-end VOIP
     signaling such as SIP [Handley00] or H.323 [ITU-H323].  We expect
     these applications to be implemented by many different people and
     to use standard operating system interfaces.  Also, these
     applications should work the same way when used in wireless or
     wireline settings, except that the codecs should be tailored for
     the specific link layer currently in use.

     When used over wireless links, we expect that applications will
     want to make use of the optimized real-time path outlined above
     (audio hardware to codec to physical channel) rather than taking
     audio data into user space, performing a user space codec
     transformation, constructing RTP packets, and writing them to a
     standard UDP socket.  Such user space manipulation of audio
     traffic would introduce unpredictable latency to the flow.

     To enable the optimized real-time path, the VOIP control protocol
     should signal to the GEHCO control component that it has completed
     VOIP signaling and is ready to begin audio bearer flow.  This
     signal might be a system call containing the IP/UDP/RTP parameters
     that have been negotiated and the codec to be used.  This system
     call would be a one-line addition to existing VOIP client
     implementations.


  4.2.2 GEHCO Control to Real-time Path

     When the GEHCO control component receives a signal from the VOIP
     control component that the VOIP signaling has been completed, it
     must take the following steps:

       2) Send the peer system information about the flow, including
          the static header fields and identification of the physical
          bearer channel; and, finally,

       3) Trigger the audio hardware to begin sampling, and the codec
          implementation to begin encoding/decoding.

     The first step could be accomplished via an interface to the data
     link layer, or may be accomplished directly.  In any case we need
     to acquire precise timing information about when the first voice
     physical frame will be sent and this timing needs to be related to
     the internal time reference that will be used for RTP timestamps.
     In the second step, this timing information is used to inform the
     peer what header fields should be placed on the first physical
     frame.  The third step requires interaction with the real-time
     components such as the audio hardware and codec implementation, to
     enable the real-time data to start flowing.


  4.2.3 Header Stripping/Regeneration to Data Link Layer

     The header stripping component must classify all traffic from the
     IP protocol stack as to whether it is part of the RTP flow that
     needs to be sent on the voice physical channel.  Because it must
     examine each packet, it will probably be fairly tightly integrated
     with the data link layer.

     The header regeneration component produces IP packets from the
     physical voice frames and sends them up the IP protocol stack.
     This also may be implemented by passing the packets through the
     data link layer.


  4.2.3 Other Interfaces

     The mobile terminal potentially will be executing many
     simultaneous applications and we expect all of the standard
     interfaces (network sockets, GUI) to be present.  Note that
     ordinary applications may want to use the audio hardware at the
     same time as a voice call is in progress.  This could be
     disallowed, or a special "audio mixer" process could be introduced
     between the audio hardware and the codec implementation to allow
     such simultaneous access.  For example, a system beep noise might
     be mixed into the telephone call in such a way that only the
     mobile terminal user would hear it.

     Much ado has been made about the proper reconstruction of the IP
     Identification field for each RTP packet.  We note that RTP
     payloads are required to stay within the path MTU [Handley99] and
     should never experience fragmentation.  However, in order to avoid
     any possibility of Identification field collision with other

     packets that may be fragmented, a new interface could be
     implemented between the GEHCO control and the IP protocol stack to
     "reserve" a range of Identification values for use by the RTP
     flow.  If the header regeneration component always increments the
     Identification field by one for each reconstructed header, and
     wraps around to the beginning when the range is about to overflow,
     then no additional work is necessary to ensure uniqueness of IP
     Identification fields.


  5. Conclusions

     This draft has presented an architecture for zero-byte header
     compression and its implications for both a mobile station and the
     supporting network.  On the network side, with this architecture
     the peer in the network does not need to be aware of the VOIP
     control between the mobile and a SIP/H323 server that could be
     anywhere in the network.  When the header stripping/regeneration
     is performed in a network element that is physically separated
     from the physical channel (e.g. a PDSN from 3GPP2 [TIA-IS835]),
     the hard real-time requirements on this element can be alleviated
     through the proper use of sequence numbers on its interface to the
     radio channel elements.

     On the mobile side, this draft provides high level requirements
     for support of zero-byte header compression in the form of
     protocol interfaces and APIs.  Both monolithic network style
     mobiles as well as relay phone mobiles with laptops are discussed.
     Proper architecture of the mobile station allows the segregation
     of hard real-time processing from the non-real-time IP stack and
     applications.  Furthermore, convergence of wireline and wireless
     applications is a long-standing goal in the wireless industry.
     This architecture allows mobile end systems to run VOIP based
     applications developed for wireline access to operate in the
     wireless environment (although with wireless-specific codecs). The
     impact on VOIP applications could be as little as one line of code
     in the VOIP client itself.

     Finally, the draft has outlined protocol work items suitable for
     the IETF as well as external standards bodies, including the ITU
     and 3rd Generation Partnership Projects.  Any necessary APIs could
     be standardized by a collaboration between operating system
     vendors (open source or otherwise) and third party application
     developers, driven by wireless service providers.
