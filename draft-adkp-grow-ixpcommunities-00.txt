        BGP Large Communities applications for IXP Route Servers
                   draft-adkp-grow-ixpcommunities-00

Abstract

   This document presents suggestion and examples for application of BGP
   Large Communities [RFC8092] at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).
   Suggestions are based on operational experiences from IXP operators
   and members.  Any IXP operator or IXP member can consider using these
   communities.  The document specifically focusses on Route Server
   [RFC7947] deployments in IXP context [RFC7948].

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.  Introduction

   This document presents suggestions for the application of BGP Large
   Communities [RFC8092] to IXP operators and members using the BGP
   [RFC4271] protocol.  It adds specific suggestions for the operators
   and members of IXPs deploying BGP Large Communities as suggested in
   [RFC8195].

2.  Justification

   Networks operating in the DFZ tend to exchange routing information at
   multiple IXP in order to improve redundancy and geographical
   optimization.  Besides 'the typical' IXP members an increasing amount
   of enterprise networks connect to IXPs.  They have additional
   requirements.  In order to offer a uniform mode of operation across
   different IXPs there is a need to provide standards.

3.  Suggested Large BGP Community Standard List

   This list proposes a standard to use in IXP operations for the use of
   BGP Large Communities.  It was first published at the EURO-IX website
   [EURO-IX].

   The tables below provide a per 'section' divided overview of Large
   Community usage.

4.  Security Considerations

   Operators should note the recommendations in Section 11 of BGP
   Operations and Security [RFC7454] and handle BGP Large Communities
   with their ASN in the Global Administrator field similarly.

5.  IANA Considerations

6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Colby Barth (Juniper Networks) and
   Bijal Sanghani (EURO-IX) for their support, insightful review, and
   comments.
