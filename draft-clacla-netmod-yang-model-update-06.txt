1.  Introduction

   This document puts forth a solution to the problems described in
   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] by proposing changes to
   [RFC7950] to address the various requirements that
   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] specifies.  At this time, the
   solution herein addresses requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2,
   4.3, 5.1, and 5.2.  Current gaps are documented in Appendix A.1
   below.

2.  The Solution

   The solution is composed of five parts:

   1.  A semantic versioning YANG extension, along with an optional
       additional check that validates the semantic versioning from a
       syntactic point of view, which can either assist in determining
       the correct semantic versioning value, or which can help in

       determining the values for YANG modules that do not support this
       extension.

   2.  An import by semantic version statement

   3.  Updates to the YANG 1.1 module update rules

   4.  Updates to ietf-yang-library

   5.  An introduction of deprecated and obsolote reason clauses

2.1.  Semantic Versioning

2.1.1.  Semantic Versioning, As Set by the YANG Module Designer

   The semantic versioning solution proposed here has already been
   proposed in [I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-catalog] (included here with
   the authors' permission) which itself is based on [openconfigsemver].
   The goal is to indicate the YANG module backward (in)compatibility,
   following semver.org semantic versioning [semver]:

   "The SEMVER version number for the module is introduced.  This is
   expressed as a semantic version number of the form: x.y.z

   o  x is the MAJOR version.  It is incremented when the new version of
      the specification is incompatible with previous versions.

   o  y is the MINOR version.  It is incremented when new functionality
      is added in a manner that is backward-compatible with previous
      versions.

   o  z is the PATCH version.  It is incremented when bug fixes are made
      in a backward-compatible manner."

   The semantic version value is set by the YANG module developer at the
   design and implementation times.  Along these lines, we propose the
   following YANG 1.1 extension for a more generic semantic version.
   The formal definition is found at the end of this document.  This
   semantic version extension and the text below address requirements
   1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 5.1 and 5.2 of
   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].

           extension module-version {
               argument semver;
           }

   The extension would typically be used this way:

2.1.2.  The Derived Semantic Version

   If an explicitly defined semantic version is not available in the
   YANG module, it is possible to algoritmically calculate a derived
   semantic version.  This can be used for modules not containing a
   definitive semantic-version as defined in this document or as a
   starting value when specifying the definitive semantic-version.  Be
   aware that this algorithm may sometimes incorrectly classify changes
   between the categories non-compatible, compatible or error-
   correction.

2.1.3.  Implementation Experience

   [yangcatalog] uses the pyang utility to calculate the derived-
   semantic-version for all of the modules contained within the catalog.
   [yangcatalog] contains many revisions of the same module in order to
   provide its derived-semantic-version for module consumers to know
   what has changed between revisions of the same module.

   Two distinct leafs in the YANG module
   [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog] contain this semver notation:

   o  the semantic-version leaf contains the value embedded within a
      YANG module (if it is available).

   o  the derived-semantic-version leaf is established by examining the
      the YANG module themselves.  As such derived-semantic-version only
      takes syntax into account as opposed to the meaning of various
      elements when it computes the semantic version.

   o  The algorithm used to produce the derived-semantic-version is as
      follows:

      1.  Order all modules of the same name by revision from oldest to
          newest.  Include module revisions that are not available, but
          which are defined in the revision statements in one of the
          available module versions.

      2.  If module A, revision N+1 has failed compilation, bump its
          derived semantic MAJOR version.  For unavailable module
          versions assume non-backward compatible changes were done.,
          thus bump its derived semantic MAJOR version.

      3.  Else, run "pyang --check-update-from" on module A, revision N
          and revision N+1 to see if backward-incompatible changes
          exist.

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                     July 2018


      4.  If backward-incompatible changes exist, bump module A,
          revision N+1's derived MAJOR semantic version.

      5.  If no backward-incompatible changes exist, compare the pyang
          trees of module A, revision N and revision N+1.

      6.  If there are structural differences (e.g., new nodes), bump
          module A, revision N+1's derived MINOR semantic version.

      7.  If no structural differences exist, bump module A, revision
          N+1's derived PATCH semantic version.

   The pyang utility checks many of the points listed in section 11 of
   [RFC7950] for known module incompatibilities.  While this approach is
   a good way to programmatically obtain a semantic version number, it
   does not address all cases whereby a major version number might need
   to be increased.  For example, a node may have the same name and same
   type, but its meaning may change from one revision of a module to
   another.  This represents a semantic change that breaks backward
   compatibility, but the above algorithm would not find it.  Therefore,
   additional, sometimes manual, rigor must be done to ensure a proper
   version is chosen for a given module revision.

2.2.  Import by Semantic Version

   If a module is imported by another one, it is usually not specified
   which revision of the imported module should be used.  However, not
   all revisions may be acceptable.  Today YANG 1.1 allows one to
   specify the revision date of the imported module, but that is too
   specific, as even a small spelling correction of the imported module
   results in a change to its revision date, thus making the module
   revision ineligible for import.

   Using semantic versioning to indicate the acceptable imported module
   versions is much more flexible.  For example:

   o  Only a module of a specific MAJOR version is acceptable.  All
      MINOR and PATCH versions can also be imported.

   o  A module at a specific MAJOR version or higher is acceptable.

   o  A module at a specific MAJOR.MINOR version is acceptable.  All
      PATCH versions can also be imported.

   o  A module within a certain range of versions are acceptable.  For
      example, in this case, a module between version 1.0.0 (inclusive)
      and 3.0.0 (exclusive) are acceptable.

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                     July 2018


   The ietf-semver module provides another extension, import-versions
   that is a child of import and specifies the rules for an acceptable
   set of versions of the given module.  This extension addresses
   requirement 1.3 of [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].  The
   structure of this extension is specified as follows:

   TODO: How to specify this?  One thought is below, not fully
   formalized as this should be discussed further.  Note: while this
   uses a comma to separate discrete versions, we could instead allow
   for this to be specified multiple times.

[\[(]X[.Y[.Z]][-[X[.Y[.X]]][\])]][,...]

Where the first character MAY be a '[' or '(' to indicate at least inclusive and at least
 exclusive (respectively).  If this is omitted, a full semantic version must be specified
 and the import will only support this one version.

The following version, if specified with a '[' or '(' indicates the lower bound.  This can
 be a full semantic version or a MAJOR only or MAJOR.MINOR only.

The '-', if specified, is a literal hyphen indicating a range will be specified.  If the second portion
 of the import-versions clause is omitted, then there is no upper bound on what will be considered
 an acceptable imported version.

After the '-' the upper bound semantic version (or part thereof) follows.

After the upper bound version, one of ']' or ')' MUST follow to indicate whether this limit is inclusive
 or exclusive of the upper bound respectively.

Finally, a literal comma (',') MAY be specified with additional ranges.  Each range is taken as a logical
 OR.

   The import statement SHOULD include a semver:import-versions
   statement and MUST NOT include a revision statement.  An import
   statement MUST NOT contain both a semver:import-versions and a
   revision substatement.  The use of the revision substatement for
   import should be discouraged.

2.3.  Updates to YANG 1.1 Module Update Rules

   RFC 7950 section 11, must be updated to allow for non-backward
   changes provided they follow the semantic versioning guidelines and
   increase the MAJOR version number when a backward incompatible change
   is made.  This change is in the spirit of requirement 5.1 from
   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].  The following is proposed
   text for this change.

   "As experience is gained with a module, it may be desirable to revise
   that module.  Changes to published modules are allowed, even if they
   have some potential to cause interoperability problems, if the
   module-version YANG extension is used in the revision statement to
   clearly indicate the nature of the change."

2.4.  Updates to ietf-yang-library

   The ietf-semver YANG module also specifies additional ietf-yang-
   library [RFC7895] [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis] leafs to be added at
   the module and submodule levels.  The first is module-version, which
   augments /yanglib:yang-library/yanglib:module-set/yanglib:module.
   This specifies the current semantic version of the associated module
   and revision in a given module-set.  The related submodule-version
   leaf is added at /yanglib:yang-library/yanglib:module-
   set/yanglib:module/yanglib:submodule to indicate the semantic version
   of a submodule.

   In order to satisfy the requirements 4.1 and 4.3 of
   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] that deprecated and obsolete
   node presence and operation are easily and clearly known to clients,
   ietf-semver also augments the ietf-yang-library with two additional
   boolean leafs at /yanglib:yang-library/yanglib:module-set/
   yanglib:module.  A client can make one request of the ietf-yang-
   library and know whether or a not a module that has deprecated or
   obsolete has those nodes implemented by the server, as opposed to
   making multiple requests for each node in question.

   deprecated-nodes-present :  A boolean that indicates whether or not
      this server implements deprecated nodes.  The value of this leaf
      SHOULD be true; and if so, the server MUST implement nodes within
      this module as they are documented.  If specific deprecated nodes




Claise, et al.           Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                     July 2018


      are not implemented as documented, then they MUST be listed as
      deviations.  This leaf defaults to true.

   obsolete-nodes-present :  A boolean that indicates whether or not
      this server implements obsolete nodes.  The value of this leaf
      SHOULD be false; and if so, the server MUST NOT implement nodes
      within this module.  If this leaf is true, then all nodes in this
      module MUST be implemented as documented in the module.  Any
      variation of this MUST be listed as deviations.  This leaf
      defaults to false.

   If a module does not have any deprecated or obsolete nodes, the
   server SHOULD set the corresponding leaf above to true.  This is
   helpful to clients, such that if the MAJOR version number has not
   changed, and these booleans are true, then a client does not have to
   check the status of any node for the module.

   Module compatibility can be affected if values other than the default
   are used for the leafs described here.  For example, if a server does
   not implemennt deprecated nodes, then a given module revision may be
   incompatible with a previous revision where the nodes were not
   deprecated.  When calculating backward compatibility, the default
   values of these leafs MUST be considered.  From a client's point of
   view, if two module revisions have the same MAJOR version but the
   run-time value of deprecated-nodes-present (as read from the ietf-
   yang-library) is false, then compatibility MUST NOT be assumed based
   on the module-version alone.

2.5.  Deprecated and Obsolete Reasons

   The ietf-semver module specifies an extension, status-description,
   that is designed to be used as a substatement of the status statement
   when the status is deprecated or obsolete.  The argument to this
   extension is freeform text that explains why the node was deprecated
   or made obsolete.  It may also point to other schema elements that
   take the place of the deprecated or obsolete node.  This text is
   designed for human consumption to aid in the migration away from
   nodes that will one day no longer work.  These extensions address
   requirement 4.2 of [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].  An
   example is shown below.

         This is expressed as a semantic version string in the form:
          x.y.z
         where:
          * x corresponds to the major version,
          * y corresponds to a minor version,
          * z corresponds to a patch version.

         A major version number of 0 indicates that this model is still
         in development, and is potentially subject to change.

         Following a release of major version 1, all modules will
         increment major revision number where backward incompatible
         changes to the model are made.

         The minor version is changed when features are added to the
         model that do not impact current clients use of the model.
         When major version is stepped, the minor version is reset to 0.

         The patch-level version is incremented when non-feature changes

         descriptions that do not impact model functionality) are made
         that maintain backward compatibility.
         When major or minor version is stepped, the patch-level is
         reset to 0.

         By comparing the module-version between two revisions of a
         given module, one can know if different revisions are backward
         compatible or not, as well as
         whether or not new features have been added to a newer revision.

         If a module contains this extension it indicates that for this
         module the updated status and update rules as this described in
         RFC XXXX are used.

         The statement MUST only be a substatement of the revision statement.

          exclusive (respectively).  If this is omitted, a full semantic version must be specified
          and the import will only support this one version.

         The following version, if specified with a '[' or '(' indicates the lower bound.  This can
          be a full semantic version or a MAJOR only or MAJOR.MINOR only.

         The '-', if specified, is a literal hyphen indicating a range will be specified.  If the second portion
          of the import-versions clause is omitted, then there is no upper bound on what will be considered
          an acceptable imported version.

         After the '-' the upper bound semantic version (or part thereof) follows.
         After the upper bound version, one of ']' or ')' MUST follow to indicate whether this limit is inclusive
          or exclusive of the upper bound respectively.

         Finally, a literal comma (',') MAY be specified with additional ranges.  Each range is taken as a logical

Appendix A.  Appendix

A.1.  Open Issues: Requirements to be Addressed

   There are a few requirements of
   [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] still to be addressed.  These
   include the following:

   o  A solution is required for client compatibility to address
      requirements 3.1 and 3.2 from
      [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].  This could include
      adding "module sets" support to ietf-yang-library where the client
      can choose one set with which to use.

   o  A solution for instance data to satisfy requirement 5.3 of
      [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] is also required.

   o  While it is believed one could work within this semver scheme to
      support multiple parallel trains of development within a given
      YANG module, some thought should be given to how this would work
      in support of optional requirement 4.4 of
      [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].

   o  While not mandatory, requirement 2.2 of
      [I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs] looks to provide a way to
      determine, at the node level, whether or not changes have occurred
      between revisions of a given YANG module.  This may require
      application of semver at the node level.

A.2.  Open Issues

   Additionally, there are a few open issues to be discussed and
   settled.  These include the following:

   o  Do we need a new version of YANG?
      While eventually this will fold into a new version, the belief is
      this solution can work with extensions alone with an update to the
      [RFC7950] text concerning module updates.

   o  Should IETF/IANA officially generate derived semantic versions for
      their own modules?  As they are the owner of the modules it should
      be their responsibility, but how to document it?  Note that next
      round of funding for the yangcatalog.org could help develop the
      perfect derived-semantic-version toolset

   o  We could consider a new naming convention for module files.
      Today, module files are named using a module@revision.yang
      notation.  We could consider module%semver.yang or

      module#version.yang variants.  Re-using the '@' for version is not
      ideal, so another separator character should be used.  In this
      manner, both version and revision could be used.
