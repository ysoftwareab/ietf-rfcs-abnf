   URI Fragment Identifiers for the application/pkix-cert Media Type
                       draft-seantek-certfrag-01

Abstract

   This memo describes Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) fragment
   identifiers for PKIX certificates, which are identified with the
   Internet media type application/pkix-cert.

1.  Fragment

   A digital certificate [RFC5280] is comprised of parts that are of
   interest to particular users and applications.  For example, a user
   agent may wish to draw attention to the "notAfter" time for an
   expired certificate.  Uniform Resource Indicators (URIs) can include
   fragment identifiers to identify such sub-parts of a resource; see
   Section 3.5 of [RFC3986].  However, the semantics of fragment
   identifiers depend upon the Internet media type [RFC2046], not the
   URI scheme.  Therefore, the fragment identifiers in this memo apply
   to the application/pkix-cert Internet media type [RFC2585].  The
   following fragments are hereby defined:

   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | Identifier | Certificate Part (ASN.1 identifier)                  |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | v          | tbsCertificate.version                               |
   | sn         | tbsCertificate.serialNumber                          |
   | sig        | tbsCertificate.signature; also signatureAlgorithm    |
   | issuer     | tbsCertificate.issuer                                |
   | nb         | tbsCertificate.validity.notBefore                    |
   | na         | tbsCertificate.validity.notAfter                     |
   | subject    | tbsCertificate.subject                               |
   | spki       | tbsCertificate.subjectPublicKeyInfo                  |
   | ext        | tbsCertificate.extensions                            |
   | ext:<OID>  | tbsCertificate.extensions                            |
   |            | {Extension matching extoid == extnID}*               |
   | sigval     | signatureValue                                       |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+

   * The particular extension in the Extensions "SEQUENCE" is identified
     by OID only; there are no textual identifiers.  The syntax of the
          <OID> matches the "numericoid" production of [RFC4512].

                 Table 1: Certificate Parts and Fragments

   The fragments defined in the table above are case-insensitive.  The
   table is not exhaustive: should additional identifiers be required, a
   future document may specify additional identifiers.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to add a reference to this specification in the
   application/pkix-cert media type registration.

   Additionally, the registration template needs to be updated to add
   the following section:

   Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification is
   supported by using fragment identifiers as specified by this memo.

3.  Security Considerations

   Digital certificates are important building blocks for
   authentication, integrity, authorization, and (occasionally)
   confidentiality services.  Accordingly, identifying digital
   certificates incorrectly can have significant security ramifications.

   A URI that identifies a certificate will likely be used by an
   application or user for some security-related service, such as to
   retrieve the certificate as part of a validation procedure.  When a
   fragment identifies a part of a certificate, the application will
   define the behavioral semantics.  A certificate displaying
   application might zoom in on that aspect of the certificate, while a
   public key-processing application might use a fragment identifier
   like "#spki" in a URI when identifying a certificate from which to
   extract the "SubjectPublicKeyInfo" structure for further processing.
   The (textual) values of the fragment identifier are not supposed to
   be used in lieu of the values they are supposed to be identifying
   because the fragment identifiers are not parts of the actual
   certificate.  Interpreting these identifiers incorrectly may cause
   denial-of-service attacks.
