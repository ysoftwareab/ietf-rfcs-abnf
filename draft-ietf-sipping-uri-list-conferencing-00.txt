   services. In particular, we describe a mechanism that allows a client
   to provide a conference server with the initial list of participants
   using an INVITE-contained URI-list.

Internet-Draft           INVITE-Contained Lists                July 2004


1.  Introduction

   Section 4.5 of [3] describes how to create a conference using ad-hoc
   SIP [2] methods. The client sends an INVITE request to a conference
   factory URI, and receives the actual conference URI, which contains
   the "IsFocus" feature tag, in the Contact header field of a response
   (typically a 200 OK).

   Once the client obtains the conference URI, it can add participants
   to the newly created conference in several ways, which are described
   in [3].

   Some environments have tough requirements regarding conference
   establishment time. So, they require the client to be able to request
   the creation of an ad-hoc conference and to provide the server with
   the initial set of participants in a single operation. This document
   describes how to meet this requirement using the mechanism to
   transport URI lists in SIP messages described in [4].

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3.  Providing a Conference Server with a URI-List

   A client that wants to include the set of initial participants in its
   initial INVITE to create an ad-hoc conference, adds a body whose
   disposition type is uri-list, as defined in [4], with a URI list that
   contains the participants that the client wants the server to INVITE.
   The client sends this INVITE to the conference factory URI.

4.  URI List Format

   As described in [4], the default format for URI lists in SIP is the
   XCAP resource list format [5]. Still, specific services need to
   describe which information clients should include in their URI lists,
   as described in [4].

   Conferencing UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no hierarchical lists),
   SHOULD NOT use any entry's attributes but "uri", and SHOULD NOT
   include any elements inside entries but "display-name" elements.

   A conference factory application receiving a URI list with more
   information than what we have just described SHOULD discard all the

   extra information.

5.  Conference Server Behavior

   On reception of an INVITE with a uri-list body as described in
   Section 3, a conference server MUST follow the rules described in [3]
   to create ad-hoc conferences. Once the ad-hoc conference is created,
   the conference server SHOULD attempt to add the participants in the
   URI list to the conference as if their addition had been requested
   using any of the methods described in [3] (e.g., using CPCP [7]).

   Once the conference server has created the ad-hoc conference and has
   attempted to add the initial set of participants, the conference
   server behaves as a regular conference server and MUST follow the
   rules in [3].

   Note that the status code in the response to the INVITE does not
   provide any information about whether or not the conference server
   was able to bring the users in the URI-list into the conference. That
   is, a 200 (OK) means that the conference was created successfully,
   that the client that generated the INVITE is in the conference, and
   that the server understood the URI list. If the client wishes to
   obtain information about the status of other users in the conference
   it SHOULD use general conference mechanisms, such as the conference
   package [8].

6.  Example

   The following is an example of an INVITE request, which carries a URI
   list in a uri-list body, sent by a UA to a conference factory
   application.


   INVITE sip:conf-fact@example.com SIP/2.0

7.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses setup of SIP conferences using a
   request-contained URI-list. Both conferencing and URI-lists services
   have specific security requirements which will be summarized here.
   Conferences generally have authorization rules about who may or may
   not join a conference, what type of media may or may not be used,
   etc. This information is used by the focus to admit or deny
   participation in a conference. It is RECOMMENDED that these types of
   authorization rules be used to provide security for a SIP conference.

   For this authorization information to be used, the focus needs to be
   able to authenticate potential participants.  Normal SIP mechanisms
   including Digest authentication and certificates can be used. These
   conference specific security requirements are discussed further in
   the requirements and framework documents.

   For conference creation using a list, there are some additional

   security considerations. The Security Considerations Section of the
   Requirements and Framework for SIP URI-List Services [6] discusses
   issues related to SIP URI-list services. Given that a conference
   server sending INVITEs to a set of users acts as an URI-list service,
   implementations of conference servers that handle lists MUST follow
   the security-related rules in [6]. These rules include mandatory
   authentication and authorization of clients, and opt-in lists.
