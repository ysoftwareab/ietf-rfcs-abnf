          YANG Data Model for Active-Active NVEs Configuration
             draft-zhang-nvo3-yang-active-active-cfg-03.txt

Abstract

   When a Tenant System is not collocated with Network Virtualization
   Edges (NVEs), it's possible for this Tenant System to connect to a
   group of NVEs or a single NVE with multiple underlay IP addresses to
   use the active-active multihoming L2/L3 service provided by these
   NVEs.

   This document defines the YANG data model that can be used to
   configure NVEs of a NVO3 network to achieve active-active multi-
   homing.

INTERNET-DRAFT   YANG Data Model for Active-Active NVEsDecember 16, 2015


1. Introduction

   Network virtualization over Layer 3 tunnels (NOV3) is a promising way
   for large scale data center network provision. In NVO3 architecture,
   the Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) sits at the edge of an overlay
   network of NVO3 and provides virtualized L2 and/or L3 service to the
   Tenant Systems (TS). At the Split-NVE scenario, where the NVE and the
   TS are not located in the same server (for example, the NVE resides
   on an adjacent switch to which the server is attached), it is
   possible that a Tenant System is multihomed to various NVEs or a
   single NVE with multiple under IP addresses. In that case, it's
   desirable that these NVEs provide the Tenant System with active-
   active multihoming.

   This document provides the YANG model for configuring NVEs to offer
   Tenant Systems with active-active L2 and/or L3 access, which admits
   centralized provisioning of virtualization (i.e. NVA based).

2. Acronyms and Terminology

2.1. Acronyms

   NVO3: Network Virtualization Overlays
   NVE: Network Virtualization Edge
   NVA: Network Authority Virtualization
   VNI: Virtual Network Instance
   VAP: Virtual Access Points [RFC7365]
   AANVE: Active-Active NVEs. The AANVE denotes the group of NVEs that
     offer active-active multi-homing VAPs to Tenant Systems. 

2.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Familiarity with [RFC7364], [RFC7365], [I-D.ietf-nvo3-dataplane-
   requirements] and [RFC7348] is assumed in this document.

3. The YANG Model for NVO3 Configuration

3.1. The Configuration Values

3.1.1. The End Device ID

   The 'end-id' is the identification of an end device [RFC7365] which
   can either be an L2 (a LAN) or L3 (a subnetwork) network device. This
   ID also identifies the redundant group of NVEs that offers the L2/L3

INTERNET-DRAFT   YANG Data Model for Active-Active NVEsDecember 16, 2015


   active-active access to the NVO3 overlay network. This ID may be
   shared among different Virtual Networks (a.k.a, Closed User Groups,
   CUGs [RFC7365]).

3.1.2. The NVE IP List

   The 'nve-ip', which is the underlay IP address, can either be IPV4 or
   IPv6 [RFC7365].

   If the network is configured according to the YANG model defined in
   this document, NVEs in an AANVE will discover each other's 'nve-ip'
   while remote NVEs learn the grouping of NVE IPs that are offering
   multi-homing to an end device.

3.1.2.1. The Priority

   For a BUM packet, the AANVE MUST determine a unique egress NVE
   otherwise the multi-homed Tenant System will see frame duplication.
   The 'priority' describes the primary and backup NVEs in an AANVE per
   VNI. For the BUM packet, the primary in the AANVE is supposed to act
   as the unique outgoing NVE. Other backup NVEs MUST NOT egress the BUM
   packet onto the end device.

3.1.2.2. The Virtual Access Points List

   The 'vap-list' specifies the interfaces that a NVE uses to connect to
   the multi-homed end device. For those VAPs listed in the 'vap-list',
   packets with ingress NVEs which are listed in the same AANVE as the
   VAPs' hosted NVE MUST NOT be egressed. This embodies the split-
   horizon.

   When a NVE is configured to have more than one VAPs for a given
   AANVE, the NVE MUST determine a unique VAP to deliver a received
   packet to the local tenant system.

3.1.4. The Virtual Network Instance

   The 'vni' specifies the identification of Virtual Network Instance
   [RFC7365]. The 'multi-attached-info' configuration is valid per VNI.

3.1.3. The Attached Tenant System Address List

   The 'attached-ts-addresses' given in the model is used to configure
   NVEs within a VNI the Tenant System MAC/IP addresses attached to the
   multi-homed end device. From the configuration, remote NVEs learn
   these addresses are multi-homed to the nve-ip listed in the 'nve-ip-
   list', therefore packet destined to these addresses are reachable via
   any of the listed NVEs. One of the learned NVEs will be installed

   into the data plane as the egress NVE on a per-VNI or per-ts-address
   basis.

   For L2 service, the MAC list in the configuration is prone to be more
   unstable than other part. Control protocols can be used to push the
   update of the MAC list per VNI. For example, [I-D.dunbar-nvo3-nva-
   mapping-distribution] can be used to distribute the MAC address of
   Tenant Systems. When the updated MAC list is pushed, it's REQUIRED
   that the 'end-id' is taken along. Through hearing the 'end-id',
   remote NVEs can identify the AANVE to which the pushed MAC addresses
   are attached.
