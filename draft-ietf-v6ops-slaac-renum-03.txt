Abstract

   In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
   prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit signaling of that
   condition (such as when a CPE crashes and reboots without knowledge
   of the previously-employed prefixes), nodes on the local network will
   continue using stale prefixes for an unacceptably long time, thus
   resulting in connectivity problems.  This document documents this
   issue and discusses operational workarounds that may help to improve
   network robustness.  Additionally, it highlights areas where further
   work may be needed.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 largely assumes prefix stability, with network renumbering only
   taking place in a planned manner, with old/stale prefixes being
   phased-out via reduced prefix lifetimes, and new prefixes (with
   longer lifetimes) being introduced at the same time.  However, there
   are several scenarios that may lead to the so-called "flash-
   renumbering" events, where the prefix employed by a network suddenly
   becomes invalid and replaced by a new prefix.  In some of these
   scenarios, the local router producing the network renumbering event
   may try to deprecate the currently-employed prefixes (by explicitly
   signaling the network about the renumbering event), whereas in other
   scenarios it may be unable to do so.

   In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
   prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit signaling of that

   condition, nodes on the local network will continue using stale
   prefixes for an unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in
   connectivity problems.

   Scenarios where this problem may arise include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

   o  The most common IPv6 deployment scenario for residential or small
      office networks is that in which a CPE router employs DHCPv6
      Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC8415] to request a prefix from
      an Internet Service Provider (ISP), and a sub-prefix of the leased
      prefix is advertised on the LAN-side of the CPE router via
      Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862].  In
      scenarios where the CPE router crashes and reboots, the CPE may
      obtain (via DHCPv6-PD) a different prefix from the one previously
      leased, and therefore advertise (via SLAAC) the new prefix on the
      LAN side.  Hosts will typically configure addresses for the new
      prefix, but will normally retain and actively employ the addresses
      configured for the previously-advertised prefix, since their
      associated Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime allow them to do
      so.

   o  A switch-port the host is connected to may be moved to another
      subnet (VLAN) as a result of manual switch-port reconfiguration or
      802.1x re-authentication.  In particular, there has been evidence
      that some 802.1x supplicants do not reset network settings after
      successful 802.1x authentication.  So if a host had failed 802.1x
      authentication for some reason, was placed in a "quarantine" VLAN
      and then got successfully authenticated later on, it might end up
      having IPv6 addresses from both old ("quarantine") and new VLANs.

   o  During the planned network renumbering, a router may be configured
      to send an RA with the Preferred Lifetime for the "old" Prefix
      Information Option (PIO) set to zero and the new PIO having non-
      zero Preferred Lifetime.  However, due to unsolicited RAs being
      sent as all-hosts multicast and multicast being rather unreliable
      on busy wifi networks, the RA may not be received by a host (or
      set of hosts).

   o  Automated device config management system performs periodic config
      pushes to network devices.  If such a push results in changing the
      subnet configured on a particular network, hosts attached to that
      network would not get notified about the subnet change, and their
      addresses from the "old" prefix will not be deprecated.  A related
      scenario is the incorrect network renumbering where a network
      administrator renumbers a network by simply removing the "old"
      prefix from the configuration and configuring a new prefix
      instead.

   Lacking any explicit signaling to deprecate the previously-advertised
   prefixes, hosts may continue to employ the previously-configured
   addresses, which will typically result in packets being blackholed --
   whether because of egress-filtering by the CPE or ISP, or packets
   being discarded or routed elsewhere.

   We note that the default values for the "Preferred Lifetime" and
   "Valid Lifetime" of PIOs, as specified in [RFC4861], are:

   o  Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7 days)

   o  Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30 days)

   This means that in the aforementioned scenarios, the stale addresses
   would be retained and also actively employed for new communications
   instances for an unacceptably long period of time (one month, and one
   week, respectively), leading to interoperability problems, instead of
   hosts transitioning to the newly-advertised prefix(es) in a timelier
   manner.

   Some devices have implemented ad-hoc mechanisms to address this
   problem, such as sending RAs to invalidate apparently-stale prefixes
   when the device receives any packets employing a source address from
   a prefix not currently advertised for address configuration on the
   local network [FRITZ].  However, this may introduce other
   interoperability problems, particularly in multihomed/multiprefix
   scenarios.  This is a clear indication that advice in this area is
   warranted.

   Unresponsiveness to these "flash-renumbering" events is caused by the
   inability of the network to deprecate stale information, as well as
   by the inability of hosts to react to network configuration changes
   in a timelier manner.  Clearly, it would be desirable that these
   flash-renumbering scenarios do not occur, and that, when they do
   occur, that hosts are explicitly notified of their occurrence.
   However, for robustness reasons, it is paramount for hosts to be able
   to recover from stale configuration information even when these
   flash-renumbering events occur and the network is unable to
   explicitly notify hosts about such conditions.

   Section 2 analyzes this problem in more detail.  Section 3 describes
   possible operational mitigations.  Section 4 describes possible
   future work to mitigate the aforementioned problem.

2.  Analysis of the Problem

   As noted in Section 1, the problems discussed in this document are
   exacerbated by the default values of some protocol parameters and
   other factors.  The following sections analyze each of them in
   detail.

2.1.  Use of Dynamic Prefixes

   In the residential or small office scenario, the problem discussed in
   this document would be avoided if DHCPv6-PD would lease "stable"
   prefixes.  However, a recent survey [UK-NOF] indicates that 37% of
   the responding ISPs employ dynamic prefixes.  That is, dynamic IPv6
   prefixes are an operational reality.

   Deployment reality aside, there are a number of possible issues
   associated with stable prefixes:

   o  Provisioning systems may be unable to deliver stable IPv6
      prefixes.

   o  While there is a range of information that may be employed to
      correlate network activity [RFC7721], the use of stable prefixes
      clearly simplifies network activity correlation, and may
      essentially render features such as "temporary addresses"
      [RFC4941] irrelevant.

   o  There may be existing advice for ISPs to deliver dynamic IPv6
      prefixes *by default* (see e.g.  [GERMAN-DP]) over privacy
      concerns associated with stable prefixes.

   For a number of reasons (such as the ones stated above), IPv6
   deployments may employ dynamic prefixes (even at the expense of the
   issues discussed in this document), and that there might be scenarios
   in which the dynamics of a network are such that the network exhibits
   the behaviour of dynamic prefixes.  Rather than trying to regulate
   how operators may run their networks, this document aims at improving
   network robustness in the deployed Internet.

2.2.  Default Timer Values in IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
      (SLAAC)

   Many protocols, from different layers, normally employ timers.  The
   general logic is as follows:

   o  A timer is set with a value such that, under normal conditions,
      the timer does *not* go off.




Gont, et al.            Expires February 26, 2021               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events          August 2020


   o  Whenever a fault condition arises, the timer goes off, and the
      protocol can perform fault recovery

   One use of timers is when implementing reliability mechanisms where a
   packet is transmitted, and, unless a response is received, a timer
   will fire to trigger retransmission of the original packet.

   For obvious reasons, the whole point of using timers in this way is
   that, in problematic scenarios, they trigger some recovery action.

   However, IPv6 SLAAC employs, for PIOs, these default values:

   o  Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7 days)

   o  Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30 days)

   Under normal network conditions, these timers will be reset/refreshed
   to the default values.  However, under problematic circumstances,
   such as where the corresponding network information has become stale
   without any explicit signal from the network (as described in
   Section 1), it will take a host 7 days (one week) to deprecate the
   corresponding addresses, and 30 days (one month) to eventually
   invalidate and remove any addresses configured for the stale prefix.

2.3.  Recovering from Stale Network Configuration Information

   SLAAC hosts are unable to recover from stale network configuration
   information for a number of reasons:

   o  Item "e)" of Section 5.5.3 of [RFC4862] specifies that an RA may
      never reduce the "RemainingLifetime" to less than two hours.  If
      the RemainingLifetime of an address is smaller than 2 hours, then
      a Valid Lifetime smaller than 2 hours will be ignored.  The
      Preferred Lifetime of an address can be reduced to any value to
      avoid using a stale prefix for new communications.

   o  In the absence of explicit signalling from SLAAC routers (such as
      sending PIOs with a "Preferred Lifetime" set to 0), SLAAC hosts
      fail to recover from stale configuration information in a timely
      manner.  However, when a network element is able to explicitly
      signal the renumbering event, it will only be able to deprecate
      the stale prefix, but not to invalidate the prefix in question.
      Therefore, communication with the new "owners" of the stale prefix
      will not be possible, since the stale prefix will still be
      considered "on-link".

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events          August 2020


2.4.  Lack of Explicit Signaling about Stale Information

   Whenever prefix information has changed, a SLAAC router should not
   only advertise the new information, but should also advertise the
   stale information with appropriate lifetime values (both "Preferred
   Lifetime" and "Valid Lifetime" set to 0).  This would provide
   explicit signaling to SLAAC hosts to remove the stale information
   (including configured addresses and routes).  However, in scenarios
   such as when a CPE router crashes and reboots, the CPE router may
   have no knowledge about the previously-advertised prefixes, and thus
   may be unable to advertise them with appropriate lifetimes (in order
   to deprecate them).

   However, we note that, as discussed in Section 2.3, PIOs with small
   Valid Lifetimes will not lower the Valid Lifetime to any value
   shorter than two hours (as per [RFC4862]).  Therefore, even if a
   SLAAC router were to explicitly signal the network about the stale
   configuration information via RAs, such signaling would be mostly
   ignored.

2.5.  Interaction Between DHCPv6-PD and SLAAC

   While DHCPv6-PD is normally employed along with SLAAC, the
   interaction between the two protocols is largely unspecified.  Not
   unusually, the two protocols are implemented in two different
   software components with the interface between the two implemented by
   some sort of script that feeds the SLAAC implementation with values
   learned from DHCPv6-PD.

   At times, the prefix lease time is fed as a constant value to the
   SLAAC router implementation, meaning that, eventually, the prefix
   lifetime advertised on the LAN side will span *past* the DHCPv6-PD
   lease time.  This is clearly incorrect, since the SLAAC router
   implementation would be allowing the use of such prefixes for a
   longer time than it has been granted usage of those prefixes via
   DHCPv6-PD.

3.  Operational Mitigations

   The following subsections discuss possible operational workarounds
   for the aforementioned problems.

3.1.  Stable Prefixes

   As noted in Section 2.1, the use of stable prefixes would eliminate
   the issue in *some* of the scenarios discussed in Section 1 of this
   document, such as the typical home network deployment.  However, even




Gont, et al.            Expires February 26, 2021               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events          August 2020


   in such scenarios, there might be reasons for which an administrator
   may want or may need to employ dynamic prefixes

3.2.  SLAAC Parameter Tweaking

   An operator may wish to override some SLAAC parameters such that,
   under normal circumstances (including some packet loss), the timers
   will be refreshed/reset, but in the presence of network faults (such
   as network configuration information becoming stale without explicit
   signaling), the timers go off and trigger some fault recovering
   action (such as deprecating the corresponding addresses and
   subsequently invalidating/removing them).

   The following router configuration variables from [RFC4861]
   (corresponding to the "lifetime" parameters of PIOs) could be
   overridden as follows:

      AdvPreferredLifetime: 2700 seconds (45 minutes)

      AdvValidLifetime: 5400 seconds (90 minutes)

   NOTES:
      A CPE router advertising a sub-prefix of a prefixed leased via
      DHCPv6-PD will periodically refresh the Preferred Lifetime and the
      Valid Lifetime of an advertised prefix to AdvPreferredLifetime and
      AdvValidLifetime, respectively, as long as the resulting lifetime
      of the corresponding prefixes does not extend past the DHCPv6-PD
      lease time [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum].

   RATIONALE:

      *  In the context of [RFC8028], where it is clear that use of
         addresses configured for a given prefix is tied to using the
         next-hop router that advertised the prefix, it does not make
         sense for the "Preferred Lifetime" of a PIO to be larger than
         the "Router Lifetime" (AdvDefaultLifetime) of the corresponding
         Router Advertisement messages.  The "Valid Lifetime" is set to
         a much larger value to cope with transient network problems.

      *  Lacking RAs that refresh information, addresses configured for
         advertised prefixes become deprecated in a timelier manner, and
         thus Rule 3 of [RFC6724] causes other configured addresses (if
         available) to be used instead.

      *  We note that lowering the default values for the "Valid
         Lifetime" helps reduce the amount of time a host may maintain
         stale information and the amount of time an advertising router
         would need to advertise stale prefixes to deprecate them, while

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events          August 2020


         reducing the default "Preferred Lifetime" would reduce the
         amount of time it takes for a host to prefer other working
         prefixes (see Section 12 of [RFC4861]).  However, while the
         aforementioned values are an improvement over the default
         values specified in [RFC4861], they will not lead to a timely
         recovery from the problem discussed in this document.

4.  Future Work

   Improvement in Customer Edge Routers [RFC7084] such that they can
   signal the network about stale prefixes and deprecate them
   accordingly can help mitigate the problem discussed in this document
   for the "home network" scenario.  Such work is currently being
   pursued in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum].

   Improvements in the SLAAC protocol [RFC4862] and other algorithms
   such as "Default Address Selection for IPv6" [RFC6724] would help
   improve network robustness.  Such work is currently being pursued in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum].

   The aforementioned work is considered out of the scope of this
   present document, which only focuses on documenting the problem and
   discussing operational mitigations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses a problem that may arise in scenarios where
   flash-renumbering events occur, and proposes workarounds to mitigate
   the aforementioned problems.  This document does not introduce any
   new security issues.
