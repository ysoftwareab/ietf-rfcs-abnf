                       Intent-Based Nemo Overview
                     draft-hares-ibnemo-overview-01

Abstract

   As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new
   interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on
   intent rather than detailed specifics.  An intent-based language is
   need to enable customers to easily describe their diverse intent for
   network connectivity to the network management systems.  This
   document describes the problem Intent-Based NEtwork Modelling (IB-
   NEMO) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use cases that
   demonstrate this problem, and a proposed scope of work.  Part of the
   scope is the validation of the language as a minimal (or reduced)
   subset.

   The IB-NEMO language consists of commands exchanged between an
   application and a network manager/controller.  Some would call this
   boundary between the application and the network management system as
   northbound interface (NBI).

   IB-NEMO focuses on creating minimal subset of the total possible
   Intent-Based commands to pass across this NBI.  By creating a minimal
   subset (about 20% of the total possible) of all intent commands, the
   IB-NEMO can be a simple Intent interface for most applications
   (hopefully 80%).  Part of validation of this command language is to
   to provide test cases where a set of commands are used to convey
   information for a use case which result in a particular data model in
   the network controller.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the problem Intent-Based Network MOdeling
   (IB-NEMO) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use cases and
   a proposed scope of work.

   IB-NEMO language is a set of commands that allows an application to
   express what it wants (its intent) for a network to the network
   management system (or network controller).  Some would describe the
   interface between the application and a network as the north bound
   interface (NBI) from the network manager.  This paper will utilize
   that term to indicate the point the IB-NEMO commands are exchanged
   across.  Intent simply means the user tells the network what the user
   wants, but not how to do it.  Network provisioning can then
   creatively fulfil the user's desire.  The key challenge is to provide
   the user with tools to express what the user wants.

   Creating a Intent-Based language with a minimal set of commands
   requires boiling down the possible alternative to a minimal subset.
   These minimal set of commands will be adapted to different contexts
   by providing additional context.  For networking, an example of this
   additional context may be the name to address mapping for the nodes
   an application desires to connect.

   To test IB-NEMO language exchange, the working group must select use
   cases and develop prototypical data models that should occur when IB-
   NEMO commands are exchanged.

1.1.  Where to start

   In the spirit of minimalism, this introduction starts with a 5
   question FAQ (frequently asked questions) for those who are familiar
   with the concepts of Intent-Based networking to answer "what is
   Intent-Based NEMO".  If the FAQ answers your questions, jump off to
   the use cases in this document or the [I-D.xia-sdnrg-nemo-language]
   along with its management yang modules [I-D.zhou-netmod-intent-nemo].

   If you are new to the Intent-Based networking, you'll want to read
   through the motivation section before looking at the rest of the
   document.

   The purpose of this document is simple: to provide others outside the
   project with "what, when, where, how, and why" the IB-NEMO network
   language should be standardized in the IETF as part of the larger
   Intent-Based network effort.

1.2.  FAQ

   Q1: There are many industry forums working on an Intent-based policy
   interface for applications.  Why should the IETF form a Working Group
   to examine an Intent-Based language?

   Over the years industry forums have tried to create a mosaic of
   standards groups where each standards group focuses on it's key role.
   IETF has focused its efforts on protocols that communicate across the
   IP network, and management protocols to manage these efforts.

   The Intent-Based Network Modelling (IB-NEMO) language is communicated
   between an application and a network management system that controls
   traffic through the network.  Different forums may call this network
   management different names (E.g.  SDN controller or centralized
   controller or others).

   IB-NEMO seeks to provide a minimal set of commands to express the
   intent from an application to the network management system which is
   controlling the networks.

   Q2: Can Intent North Bound Interfaces (NBIs) control more than
   networks?

   A user may use Intent-based language commands to control storage or
   CPU cycles, but an intent-based networking language focuses on
   networks.

   Telefonica and some of the cable operators supporting this work want
   to control virtual networks, service-based forwarding in networks or
   data center networks, home-networks, and mobile networks.  If Intent
   based networking is successful, then the community may turn to
   controlling networks plus storage plus CPU.  The group is starting
   with what they know.

   The [I-D.xia-sdnrg-nemo-language] focuses on three basic components:
   logical node, logical link, and a logical data flow.

   Q3: Why focus on creating a minimal set of commands?  How will you
   control all of the network management devices that control the
   network?

   IBNemo design goals are to create a simple language with a minimal
   set of commands so that most applications can easily use this
   interface to establish network connections.  Often most application
   users (say 80%) using a language utilize only 20% of the operations.
   We'll call this within this paper as the 80/20 rule of communication.

   The IB-NEMO commands [I-D.xia-sdnrg-nemo-language] allows groups of
   applications to simplify the interface by providing the capability to
   transfer a data model that can store common information (e.g. names
   or addresses) for nodes and links plus rate of data flow (e.g.
   10Gbit).  As an example, an application for a home-network on a cable
   network can simply load one set of data from a library and pass them
   to the network management system.  Applications for virtual networks
   for a company could load a different set of data from a library and
   send it to the network management system.

   The goal of this language is not to support all possible Intent
   language commands nor all network management systems.  The intent is
   to work within the 80/20 rule.

   Open-Daylight (ODL) has three Intent-Based Code projects:

   o  Network Intent Composition (NIC)
      (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/
      Project_Proposals:Network_Intent_Composition) (ODL:NIC),

   o  Open Daylight NEMO (ODL NEMO) https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/
      NEMO:Main, and

   o  Group Based Policy (ODL-GBP) (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/
      Group_Based_Policy_(GBP)).

   The ODL-NIC project is creating a Intent based interface whose focus
   is to include all necessary intent commands in the interface between
   the application and the network management system.  The ODL NEMO
   project is creating an interface with a minimal set of intent
   commands.  The ODL-GBP sees Group-based policy as the automation of
   Intent by creating contracts between groups of endpoints.

   Q4: Is it time for IETF standardization?

   An Open Source release of the Open Daylight code for IB-NEMO (ODL
   NEMO)under the Open Daylight NEMO occurred July of 2015.  Releases
   from July 2015 will contain versions of the IBNemo language
   interface.

   The IB-NEMO project team is working with the OPNFV Movie project
   (https://wiki.opnfv.org/movie) to provide use cases that will allow
   matching the ODL code bases with the OPNFV deployments.  Much of the
   open source code from ODL and OPNFV open source projects has moved
   into the product code bases of vendors.

Internet-Draft              IBNemo Framework                October 2015


   Now is the time for the IETF to begin to standardize the
   interoperability of the IB-NEMO commands as the ODL Nemo code is
   being distributed in these open source code bases.

   Telefonica, BT and the DOCSIS group see this as a key way to speed up
   provisioning by obtaining their users desires via the Intent
   Interface.

   Q5: What data models will IB-NEMO focus on?

   IB-NEMO language when passed to a network management system should
   fill in a set of data in a data model.

   IB-NEMO work standardization effort is focused on providing a suite
   of test scenario for applications and network management systems.
   Each test scenario will provide the following:

   o  a description of the test's context,

   o  a set of Intent Based commands to be sent from the application,

   o  yang data model used by the network management system,

   o  a set of information that should loaded in the network management
      systems' data model.

   The purpose is to indicate what service data models (such as the
   L3VPN service data model) input should be filled in by the IBNemo
   commands.

   IB-NEMO work is not to create the service yang data models, but to
   describe how these data models might be filled in by IB-NEMO
   commands.

   IB-NEMO work plan does not focus on being an automation architecture
   or protocol.  ANIMA is working on this in the IETF.

2.  Motivation for Intent Interfaces

   The IP networks within Carriers, Data Centers, Cloud provider, and
   Enterprises continue to grow in size and complexity.  Simultaneously,
   the services that are demanded by customers, particularly the upper
   layer applications, are becoming more and more complicated.  The
   users of these services demand that the services be available to
   mobile devices (E.g. iPADs, smart phones) as well as their desktops.
   New applications that demand these services have a short life span
   (months rather than years).  The current rigid service models are
   lacking the flexibility to meet this combination of requirements and
   scenarios.

   Recent efforts have looked to open source and open APIs for the IP
   devices and networks as a way to replace the rigid service models
   with fast-paced development.  ETSI's NFV group, CableLabs DOCSIS
   (docsis.org), and ONF Intent-Based NBI (North-Bound interface) are
   industry forums looking at Intent based open APIs.  OPNFV Movie
   project (https://wiki.opnfv.org/movie) is examining the intent-based
   use cases for OPNFV (https://www.opnfv.org/).  The use cases in this
   document encapsulate many of the use cases discussed with operators
   and vendors individually or within these forums.

   The idea of intent can be summed up in a simple phrase: "Do not tell
   me what to do, tell me what you want".  Traditional networking
   configures devices, network protocols, and topologies within a
   network.  It is network-device centric.  Intent-based networking
   focuses on what an application needs from the network.  It is
   application-centric.  In Intent-based networking, the network
   provisioning or network automation is free to operate in any way it
   chooses as long as it provides the application the requested service.

   Intent-based network models present the network as the application
   would see it.  Intent-Based NEMO utilizes the application-centric
   view in its modelling of a network.  These models may hide details
   the application does not need to know.

2.1.  Challenges in Intent-Based NEtwork MOdeling

   The challenges in Intent-Based NEMO are:

   1.  create a common definition of intent,

   2.  create a common architecture for an Interoperable Intent-Based
       Northbound API,






Hares                    Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 8]

   3.  create a standard and interoperable command language the
       applications can use communicate with the network management
       systems, and

   4.  create a way to reduce the complexity that the context places on
       the intent engine.

   The ODL projects, the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF -
   www.dmtf.org), Open Networking Foundation (ONF) Intent-Based
   Northbound interface(NBI) working group (ONF Intent NBI WG)
   (https://www.opennetworking.org/technical-communities/areas/
   services/1916-northbound-interfaces), and OpenStack Congress
   (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Congress) are working on definitions
   of Intent.

   ONF Intent NBI WG (http://www.onfsdninterfaces.org/) and ODL-NIC
   project are working on common architecture principles for the Intent-
   Based Northbound API (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/
   Network_Intent_Composition:Main) with work to define application end
   points (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/
   Network_Intent_Composition:Dynamic_Attributes).

   IB-NEMO seeks to simply apply this evolving work by creating an
   interoperable set of commands that application uses to communicate
   with the network management system (or network controller).  The IB-
   NEMO language interface seeks to reduces the number of commands from
   a full-set of commands in order by supporting a portion of the
   commands most often used for key use cases.

   The people on the ODL NEMO project
   (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/NEMO:Main) have selected a small
   set of commands and created an open-source prototype.  The IETF work
   is to review and standardize the set of commands to make sure it
   provides an interoperable set for all applications.

2.2.  Roles and User specific network information

   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) protocols such as
   Diameter and Radius pass information on the access permissions that
   certain users or user programs have to a network or virtual network.
   Group based policy suggests that a group of users may share a role
   which is associated with a set of policies that determines the access
   to the network or a virtual network.  Role-based network access
   suggests that roles can better summarize what access the user or user
   programs have to the network.  Since IB-NEMO is trying to use
   prototypical use cases to test the ability of the IB-NEMO command
   language to create the appropriate data models in the network

   management system, it is natural to use the role-based concepts of
   summarize these data models.

   The contextual information is the characteristics which make groups
   of applications unique when operating over the network.  Logically
   most of this information may be associated with roles.  For example,
   if you have a set of users in a home communicating over a home
   network the characteristics which are unique is a set names and
   address for devices, links, and policy within the home.  If it is a
   virtual network for a company, the unique information is the names,
   addresses, links, and bandwidth expected on the links along with
   security issues.  As these examples demonstrate, an intent language
   contains the intent plus contextual information.

2.3.  What is a simple Intent-Based Protocol?

   What is a simple interface?  It is said that 80% of the applications
   only use 20% of the commands in any API.  This paper calls this the
   80/20 rule of networking.  A simple Intent-based command language
   should only supports these 20% of commands that all applications will
   need to exchange information with the network management system.  Of
   course, the challenge in any simply interface is to select the 20% of
   commands that are being repeated used by applications.

   It is also important these commands be similar to a human being's
   natural language for easy debugging.

   The challenge is that different industries may have a different 20%
   of commands that are commonly used.  The NEMO Project teams in the
   ODL NEMO project and OPNFV Movie project are seeking uses cases to
   determine if there is common set of use cases that vary just by
   context.  For example, a global L3VPN for a company with three sites
   may be similar to a three site L3VPN across a cable network.

   After getting a set of uses cases, creating a simple interface is a
   four step repetitive process:

   1.  find use cases,

   2.  develop prototype code,

   3.  do early testing at proof of concept demonstrations and hack-
       a-thons

   4.  work with many vendors to clarify language to make the language
       small and interoperable, and

   5.  go back to step 1

   Where is NEMO is this process?

   IB-NEMO has gone through steps 1-3.  Use cases are listed below, and
   the OPNFV project is working on use cases.  IB-NEMO's ODL NEMO
   project is developing the code for the open source (ETA July
   release).  IB-NEMO is at a stage where it needs to work in a
   standards body to create a small, efficient, interoperable set of
   commands.

   The standardization through an IETF WG will help IB-NEMO to work on
   step 4.

   These are open-source coding efforts creating an intent-based
   northbound interface for intent-based networking.

   The ODL Group Based Policy (GBP) views policy as a contract between
   two endpoints, and sees its work as the automation of Intent.

   ODL-GBP was released in the ODL Lithium release in June of 2015.

   The ODL-NIC project is creating a Northbound interface (NBI) for
   network orchestration systems, SDN applications, and Network
   operators.  It may be defined as RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]
   protocol and/or Java APIs.  This extensible interface will be
   designed to allow any and all new intent expressions to be exposed as
   part of a consistent and integrated single NBI to SDN applications.
   The singularity is necessary for the Composition Function to provide
   a comprehensive capability to manage network resources and resolve
   conflicts across application's intents.  In a sense, the ODL-NIC
   project is suggesting a thin waist of a single API at the entrance to
   the networking layer, just as the IP protocol presents a thin waist
   of a single API at network layer.

   ODL NIC project was released in June of 2015.

   The ODL NEMO project has created a language with minimal operational
   commands.  The ODL NEMO command language has 15 operational commands
   in three groups.  Group 1 describes nodes, links, and flows between
   nodes.  Group 2 deals with operational checks (query, notification,
   policy, connect, disconnect, session (start), and commit (end of
   commands).  Group 3 defines the model that provides the context for
   nodes, links, flows and policy.

   ODL NEMO project first release in ODL was in July, 2015.

   ODL open source code is currently finding its way rapidly into other
   sources (E.g.  OPNFV code base) and into products that are within 6
   months to a year of release.

2.5.  IB-NEMO Intent NBI is Synergistic to NETCONF and I2RS

   The IETF NETCONF [RFC6541] and RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]
   protocols provide a network interface to the configuration and status
   information within IP network devices.  The IETF I2RS (Interface to
   Routing System) WG is creating a highly dynamic network interface to
   the routing system which can inject or retrieve state regarding
   routing state, topologies, filters, and operational state.  The PCE
   Working Group has protocols and methods to pass routing for
   calculation.  Each of these interfaces and protocols have a purpose
   in managing and enhancing IP network infrastructures.

   Intent Based NBI is synergistic to these IETF protocols to the
   devices.  Synergistic means that sum of Intent Based NEMO commands +
   NETCONF + RESTCONF + I2RS + PCE is more than any of the parts alone.
   Intent Based NEMO command can signals the application's intent to a
   network management system which configures, manages, and monitors
   network devices through NETCONF, RESTCONF or I2RS protocol.

2.6.  Rest of Document

   Based on this motivation, the next sections discuss:

   o  The Scope should the Intent-Based NBI work

   o  Summary of Use cases for this scope

   o  Gap Analysis and where IB-NEMO fits

   o  Transition from IRTF to IETF

3.  Scope

3.1.  In-Scope

   The initial scope of this IB-NEMO work has focused on:

   1.  creating a minimal set of language commands to express intent
       from the application to the network management device,

   2.  selecting use cases and associating them with prototype
       applications in order to determine the subset of commands that
       needs to be included in IB-NEMO language,

   3.  validating the IB-NEMO language by creating data models (which
       should exist in the network management system) for each
       application use case to determine if the language can help a
       network management system create the right data model

   4.  creating a yang data model to manage this Intent-Based Networking
       language, and

   5.  working with other forums to refine a definition of intent so
       that the minimal size language serves a wide range of use cases
       (target of 80% of known use cases) with an interoperable
       interface.

3.2.  Out-of-Scope

   The following things are outside the IB-NEMO scope:

   o  creating yang data models that describe service layers

   o  The creation of a language to communicate from a security network
      management system to the network security devices is outside this
      scope.  (Work denoted as I2NSF)

4.  Use cases for Intent-Based IB-NEMO

   The following use cases are described in this section:

   1.  Virtual WAN

   2.  Virtual Data Center

   3.  Bandwidth on Demand

   4.  Service Chaining

4.1.  Virtual Wide-Area Network (WAN)

   Description: Enterprises want to set up their own virtual WAN for
   more control and optimization.

   User Intent: Create virtual Wide-Area network between offices.

   Network management systems do the following:

   1.  Deploy virtual routers and links for a customized topology.

   2.  Identify flows.

   3.  Steer the traffic flows though different paths.  (E.g. real-time
       flow to go through a shortest path, and backup flow to go though
       a broadband path but may have more hops.)

   The network management system should have a data model that captures
   this information.  IB-NEMO commands are used by the application to
   pass the user's intent to set-up connections, the locations, and the
   type of flows.

   Network operator: Creates web portal for business customers to
   request a WAN connecting offices.  Interface request corporate ID,
   security ID, and a link to the payment system.

   The sub-cases of this general use are the following.

      Home LAN attached to Corporate Network

      parental controls for child travelling outside the home

4.2.  Virtual Data Center

   Description: User (corporate or home) creates a virtual data center
   with network.  The virtual data center has a front-end network of
   router to exterior firewall to DMZ LAN to interior firewall to
   computing user.

   User Intent: A Corporation wants to buy Cloud computing inside a
   virtual data center with secure computer cluster.

   Network Service Provider: Sales person of the provider is given a
   reduced group of well-known building blocks (DMZ, protected area,
   unprotected area) and that he/she uses these blocks to compose
   different kinds of vDC infrastructures for the client.  The sales
   person has an App on a PAD device that shows a cloud for the internet
   and the different building blocks (Exterior, DMZ, interior) and the
   user builds vDCs with these building blocks.

   The application the sales person is running queries the network
   management system using IB-NEMO commands on existing model components
   with the potential vDC functions.  The application expresses the
   user's desires/intent via IB-NEMO commands to the network management
   system.

   Operator automation: Based on the context with Intent, corporate
   context, secure vDC context, the operator automation series will
   place the virtual cluster in a data center, and set-up the vDC and

   the Cloud computer clusters.  The Corporate customer IDs that are
   pushing data to this vDC will have the vDC defined in the Corporate
   culture.

   Specific use cases from this prototypical use case are:

   o  User gets clean mail services with firewall and spam mail cleaner

   o  SMB Manufacturing network with Virtual DataCenter

   o  SMB with Sales-Marketing accounting on Virtual Data Center

   These are described in (draft-hares-nemo-usecases-00.txt)

4.3.  Bandwidth on Demand

   Description: The corporate user wants to create a virtual link
   between remote offices and headquarters that has bandwidth that can
   be adjusted based on time of day.

Internet-Draft              IBNemo Framework                October 2015


   User Intent:Corporation wants to connect branch office with corporate
   office with 10G of bandwidth for data flow 8am to 6pm, and 1G of
   bandwidth from 6pm to 8am.

   User interface: A web portal allows him to login (corporate ID and
   security IDs) and indicate this intent via a graphic picture of his
   network that allows him to indicate on-demand bandwidth size and time
   of day.

   Network Operator:Creates Web portal for business customers to put in
   request with corporate ID and level of security for entrance into the
   corporate intent site.  The Web portal allows for prototypical use
   case (virtual WAN, Virtual DC, Bandwidth-on-demand Virtual Private
   Network (VPN), Service Function Chaining (SFC).  The network
   operators store enough application-level topology that the the users
   intent is defined.

   Operator automation: Based on the IB-NEMO queries and commands, the
   application will pass the User's Intent to the the provisioning
   software which will automatically allocate bandwidth between these
   two sites at the rate indicated.  The access router/switch can
   optionally limit at a rate over this value.

   Corporate Virtual Data Center information: includes the IP address,
   DNS names, and application addresses (Transport Ports, application
   identifiers) of subnet with application works on, and the
   applications transferring data.  The corporate data also includes
   information on whether L2VPN or L3VPN is used by the customer.

   The following use cases are specific examples of this prototype use
   case:

      Home Network gaming system

      Home Security system zoom-in

      Application Big Data or SAP Transfers at night

      Database applications contact other database applications

4.4.  Service Chaining

   Description: Apply several virtual network functions, such as
   firewall, load balancer, WAN optimization between virtual private
   cloud and the internet.

   User Intent: User has a private cloud and wants to get a secure
   interface to the Internet.

   Network Operator network management system defines the secure access
   ring of protection around the private cloud to be the following
   virtual network topology:

   o  firewall

   o  load balance

   o  DPI inspection

   Network Operator: Has Web portal or Phone App for business customers
   to put in request with corporate ID and level.

   Corporate Information: Corporate context has the topology of private
   cloud, and the access points.  The network operator will access
   service chaining to through a virtual access ring.

   Operator automation: Based on the context of the network topology of
   the private cloud's link to the carrier network and the access points
   to service chains, the network automation sets up the traffic flow so
   that the traffic to and from the private cloud flows through a
   firewall, load balancer, and DPI inspection.

5.  Gap Analysis and where IB-NEMO Fits

5.1.  IETF Working groups Gap Analysis

   No working group is working on an Intent-Based commands.

   SUPA proposes to create an information model for event-condition-
   action based policy.

   NETCONF and NETMOD are not creating an intent-based interface.

Internet-Draft              IBNemo Framework                October 2015


5.2.  ODL Open-Source

   ODL network intent composition (ODL-NIC) is creating a full intent-
   based North Bound Interface.  ODL NEMO is creating a set of commands
   with a minimal set of operations as of the open source project.  The
   IETF IB-NEMO work will leverage the lessons learned from the ODL NEMO
   open source work to create a minimal subset.

   OPNFV Movie project (https://wiki.opnfv.org/movie) is defining the
   use cases for Intent-Based networking for OPNFV.  IETF IB-NEMO will
   expand on these use cases for non-OPNFV scenarios in Cable Networks
   (MSO).

5.3.  Open Stack Policy initiatives

   None of the Open Stack Congress work focuses on intent-based command
   language.

   Open Stacks policy includes network, compute, and storage.  Its work
   combines automation (scheduling of resources, monitoring cloud
   services, Event-Condition-Action (ECA) policy, ECA based management),
   store-related policy, and meta-data policy storage.  The projects
   are:

      OpenStack has Congress (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Congress)
      with its Congress initiative which aims to provide an extensible
      open-source framework for governance and regulatory compliance
      across any cloud services (e.g. application, network, compute and
      storage) within a dynamic infrastructure.

      SolverScheduler (Nova blueprint): The SolverScheduler provides an
      interface for using different constraint solvers to solve
      placement problems for Nova.  Depending on how it is applied, it
      could be used for initial provisioning, re-balancing loads, or
      both.

      Gantt: A scheduler framework for use by different OpenStack
      components.  Used to be a subgroup of Nova and focused on
      scheduling VMs based on resource utilization.  Includes plugin
      framework for making arbitrary metrics available to the scheduler.

      Neutron policy group: This group aims to add a policy API to
      Neutron, where tenants express policy between groups of networks
      and ports.  Policy statements are of the form "for every network
      flow between groups A and B that satisfies these conditions, apply
      a constraint on that flow".  Constraints are currently allow or
      deny, but this may expand.

Internet-Draft              IBNemo Framework                October 2015


      Open Attestation: This project provides an SDK for verifying host
      integrity.  It provides some policy-based management capabilities,
      though documentation is limited.

      Policy-based Scheduling Module (Nova blueprint): This effort aims
      to schedule Nova resources per client, per cluster of resources,
      and per context (e.g. overload, time, etc.).

      Tetris: This effort provides condition-action policies (Event-
      Condition-Action policy).  It is intended to be a generic
      condition-action engine handling complex actions and optimization.
      This effort subsumes the Runtime Policies blueprint within Nova.
      It also appears to subsume the Neat effort.  Tetris and Congress
      have recently decided to merge because of their highly aligned
      goals and approaches.

      Convergence Engine (Heat): This effort separates the ideas of
      desired state and observed state for the objects Heat manages.
      The Convergence Engine will detect when the desired state and
      observed state differ and take action to eliminate those
      differences.

      Swift Storage Policies: A Swift storage policy describes a virtual
      storage system that Swift implements with physical devices.  Today
      each policy dictates how many partitions the storage system has,
      how many replicas of each object it should maintain, and the
      minimum amount of time before a partition can be moved to a
      different physical location since the last time it was moved.

      Graffiti: Graffiti aims to store and query (hierarchical) meta-
      data about OpenStack objects, e.g. tagging a Glance image with the
      software installed on that image.  Currently, the team is working
      within other OpenStack projects to add user interfaces for people
      to create and query meta-data and to store that meta-data within
      the project's database.  This project is about creating meta-data,
      which could be useful for writing business policies, not about
      policies over that meta-data.

6.  From Open Source and IRTF to IETF

   As discussed above, the open-source work for ODL-NIC was first
   released in June, 2015, and ODL NEMO released its code in July of
   2015.  The movement of these code sources to OPNFV
   (https://www.opnfv.org/) will happen rapidly, aided by the OPNFV
   Movie project (https://wiki.opnfv.org/movie) use case work.  In order
   to get a command language with minimal number of operations that
   application vendors and network management devices agree upon, it is
   important to standardize the command language in IETF.

   Initial concepts for IB-NEMO have been presented in IRTF's NFVrg and
   SDNrg to obtain initial review.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security in a Intent-Based interface may require that most
   Intent-Based Networking operate across a secure transport security
   with encryption.  However, some use cases (in-home only) or some
   limited data may allow an unsecured transport.
