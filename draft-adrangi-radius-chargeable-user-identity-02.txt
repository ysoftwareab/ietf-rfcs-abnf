Internet-Draft          Chargeable User Identity            October 2004



1.  Introduction


   In certain authentication methods such as, EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS,
   EAP-SIM, and EAP-AKA, the true identity of the subscriber can be
   hidden from the RADIUS AAA servers outside the subscriber∆s home
   network.  In these methods the UserName(1) attribute contains an
   anonymous identity (e.g., @example.com) sufficient to route the
   RADIUS packets to the home network but otherwise insufficient to
   identify the subscriber.  While this mechanism is good practice there
   could be problems.  Because Local and intermediate networks may
   require a user identity in order to enforce usage policies.  For
   example, local or intermediate networks may wish to implement a limit
   on simultaneous sessions, and/or may require a billable user identity
   in order to demonstrate willingness to pay and limit the potential
   for fraud.


   This basically implies that a unique identity known by the home
   network needs to be conveyed to all parties involved in the roaming
   transaction for correlating the authentication and accounting
   packets.


   Providing a unique identity to intermediaries is therefore a
   requirement to fulfill certain business needs.  This fulfillment need
   not undermine the need to protect the anonymity of the user.  The
   mechanism provided by this draft allows the home operator to meet
   these business requirements by providing a temporal identity
   representing the subscriber and at the same time protecting the
   anonymity of the subscriber.


   Standard RADIUS Class(25) or UserName(1) attributes could be used to
   indicate the unique identity - hereafter it is referred to as the
   Chargeable User Identity (CUI).  However, in a complex global roaming
   environment where there could be one or more intermediary between the
   NAS and the home RADIUS server, the use of aforementioned attributes
   could lead to problems as described below.


      - On use of RADIUS Class(25) attribute, [RFC2865] states ÙThis
      Attribute is available to be sent by the server to the client in
      an Access-Accept and SHOULD be sent unmodified by the client to
      the accounting server as part of the Accounting-Request packet if
      accounting is supported.  The client MUST NOT interpret the
      attribute locally.ˆ  So RADIUS clients for intermediaries MUST NOT
      interpret the Class(25) attribute, which precludes determining
      whether it contains a CUI.  Furthermore, there could be multiple
      class attributes in a RADIUS packet with unspecified ordering,
      which makes it hard to the entities outside home network to
      determine which one contains the CUI.





Adrangi, et al.          Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft          Chargeable User Identity            October 2004




      - On use of RADIUS UserName(1), the home network could use
      UserName(1) in the Access-Accept message to convey the CUI to
      intermediaries and the NAS.  However, as the Access-Accept packet
      is routed to the NAS, the UserName(1) attribute could be
      (completely) rewritten by an intermediary and therefore the NAS or
      other intermediaries along the way will not have access to the
      CUI.  Furthermore, the NAS may use the original value of the
      UserName(1) attribute ( the one sent in the Access-Request packet)
      in the Accounting-Request packets to ensure the billing follows
      the same path as authentication packets.


   The CUI attribute provides a solution to the above problem and avoids
   overloading the use of current RADIUS attributes (e.g., UserName(1)
   re-write).  When the home network assigns a value to the CUI it
   asserts that this value represents a user in the home network.  The
   assertion should be temporary.  Long enough to be useful for the
   external applications and not too long to such that it can be used to
   identify the user.


1.1  Terminology


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2.  Operation


   This document assumes that the RADIUS protocol operates as specified
   in [RFC2865], [RFC2866], and the Diameter protocol as specified in
   [RFC3588].


2.1  Chargeable User Identity Attribute (CUI)


   This attribute serves as an alias to the user∆s identity.  It is
   assigned by the home RADIUS server and MAY be sent in Access-Accept
   message.  The NAS or the access network AAA server MUST include  this
   attribute  in  the  Accounting  Requests  (Start, Interim, and Stop)
   messages if it was included in the Access Accept message and
   supported by the NAS.  Entities (e.g., NASes, proxies) outside the
   home network MUST NOT modify the CUI attribute.


   The NAS SHOULD include the CUI attribute with a nul character for its
   data field in the Access-Request message to indicate its support for
   this attribute to the home RADIUS server.  In cases where the CUI is
   required for proper billing and the home RADIUS server cannot
   determine the NAS support for the CUI, the home RADIUS server MUST

Internet-Draft          Chargeable User Identity            October 2004



   reject the request by sending an Access-Reject message containing a
   Reply-Message(18) attribute indicating the failure text: "Support for
   CUI is required.  [Author's notes:  indicating the text error message
   via Reply-Message may not be useful to the NAS - we may want to use
   the error codes specifed in draft-zorn-radius-err-msg-01.txt.]


   if the CUI attribute is not included in the Access-Accept after the
   CUI support was indicated to the home RADIUS server in the
   Access-Request, the NAS MAY treat the Access-Accept as an
   Access-Reject.  [Author's notes: I am sure there will be some
   reaction to this statement, so let's discuss!]


   If the RADIUS server includes this attribute in an Access-Accept
   message it MAY also use this attribute as one of the identity
   attributes in a Disconnect Message and Change of Authorization
   message defined by [RFC3576].


   A summary of the RADIUS CUI Attribute is given below.



     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     | String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type: TBD for Chargeable User Identity.


   Length: >= 3


   String:


      The string identifies the CUI of the end-user and is of type
      UTF8String.  It consists of two colon separated parts.  The first
      part determines the CUI type and the  second  part  is  the
      actual  Chargeable User Identity value.  The CUI type is coded as
      two octet string representing a hexadecimal number.  The CUI value
      must be at least one octet.  In cases where the attribute is used
      to indicate the NAS support for the CUI, the string value contain
      a nul character.
      The following User-Identity types have been defined:


      00 ° E.164 number
         The  identifier  is  in  international  E.164  format (e.g.
         MSISDN, according to the ITU-T E.164 numbering plan as defined
         in [E164] and [CE164]).







Adrangi, et al.          Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 5]
Internet-Draft          Chargeable User Identity            October 2004




      01 ° IMSI
         The is in international IMSI format according to the ITU-T
         E.212 numbering plan as defined in [E212] and [CE212]).


      02 ° SIP URI
         The identifier is in the form of a SIP URI as defined (as
         defined in [RFC3261]).


      03 ° NAI
         The identifier is in the form of a Network Access Identifier as
         defined in [rfc2486bis].


      04 ° Opaque string
         Opaque string is a value that is assigned to the user by the
         home network in an unspecified format.  where the home network
         asserts that this value represents a particular user ° it∆s a
         handle to the user.


      05 ° reserved


      The length of time for which the CUI is valid is unspecified by
      this specification and typically would be long enough to serve
      some business needs and short enough such that it minimizes the
      chance of revealing the true identity of the user (either directly
      or indirectly).


      Below are examples of CUI strings with NAI and E.164 Charging
      Types:


                ˆ02:charging-id@realm.orgˆ
                ˆ03:+4689761234ˆ
                ˆ05:charging-idˆ


      Ideally, the real user identity should not be revealed through
      this attribute.  However, the operators will have the final word
      on the used charging type and its identifier.


   The following table provides a guide to which attribute(s) may be
   found in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.


   Request Accept Reject Challenge Accounting  #  Attribute
                                      Request
     0      0-1     0       0        0-1       TBD  Chargeable User ID


   [Note 1] If the Access-Accept contains CUI then the NAS MUST include
   the CUI in Accounting Requests (Start, Interim and Stop) packets.

Internet-Draft          Chargeable User Identity            October 2004



   Change of Authorization and Disconnect-Request
   Request      ACK      NAK   #    Attribute
      0-1       0        0     TBD  Chargeable User


   [Note 2] Where CUI attribute is included in Disconnect-Request or
   CoA-Request messages, it is used for session identification purposes
   only.  This attribute MUST NOT be used for purposes other than
   identification (e.g.  within CoA-Request messages to request
   authorization changes).


3.  Diameter RADIUS Interoperability


   In deployments where both RADIUS clients talking with Diameter
   Servers or Diameter Client talking with RADIUS server then a
   translation agent will be deployed and operate in accordance to the
   NASREQ specification.  A counterpart Diameter AVP with a similar
   content to CUI is Diameter Credit-Control Application∆s
   Subscription-ID AVP [DiameterCC].


4.  IANA Considerations


   This document requires the assignment of a new RADIUS attribute
   number for the CUI attribute.


5.  Security considerations


   The CUI attribute must be protected against Man-in-the-Middle
   attacks.  The CUI appears in Access-Accept and Accounting Requests
   packets and is protected by the mechanisms that are defined for
   RADIUS [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  Therefore there are no additional
   security considerations beyond those already identified in [RFC2865]
   and [RFC2866].


   Message-Authenticator(80) and Event-Timestamp can be used to further
   protect against Man-in-the-middle attacks.


   In this document we require that entities outside the home network
   not modify the value of this attribute yet there are no provisions
   for protecting against or detecting that a RADIUS Proxy has modified
   the attribute.
