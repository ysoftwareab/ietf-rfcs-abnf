                          Emergency Registries
               draft-rosen-ecrit-emergency-registries-00

Abstract

   Multiple emergency services standards organizations are developing
   standards based on IETF emergency call standards and other IETF
   protocols.  There is a desire among these organizations to use common
   registries not tied to a particular country or national SDO, in the
   long term pursuit of a single worldwide standard.  This document asks
   IANA to create a set of registries and provides processes for
   expanding the set and populating them.

   Authors' Addresses  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  54

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6443] establishes a framework for carrying emergency calls over
   the Internet using the SIP ( [RFC3261] ) protocol.  Various regional
   organizations are developing standards for how calls conforming to
   this framework are handled within the Emergency Services IP Networks
   (ESInets) established by local, regional or national authorities to
   handle such calls and deliver them to the appropriate Public Safety
   Answering Point (PSAP).  Many of these standards have needed
   registries of values used in the protocols and services the services
   define.  Prior to this document, such registries were managed by the
   regional SDOs themselves.  There is a desire among many of the
   regional emergency services SDOs to have a single world-wide standard
   for handling emergency calls and as part of that effort, a single set
   of registries managed by a neutral party.  This document requests
   IANA to establish a new registry area called "Emergency" and to
   create a set of registries within that area.  This document does not
   describe initial contents of the registries.  That will be
   accomplished by requests from the regional SDOs, including The NENA
   i3 Standard [NENAi3].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

2.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the workgroups and committees at NENA: The 9-1-1
   Association, especially the Core Services Agency Systems Committees,
   as well as ETSI and EENA for their contributions to unify
   international emergency calling standards.

3.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, "NG9-1-1" is use to describe next-generation
   emergency calling services generally and is meant to include NG112
   initiatives ongoing in Europe ([NG112]).

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a number of registries.  The initial values for
   these registries are not defined and will be submitted by regional
   and international SDOs such as NENA and ETSI.

4.1.  "emergency" URN namespace

   IANA is requested to register a new URN namespace for "emergency".

4.1.1.  Namespace Identifier

   emergency

4.1.2.  Version

   1

4.1.3.  Date

   RFC Editor: please insert the date this RFC was published

4.1.4.  Registrant

   IETF and the ecrit Working Group.  Should the working group cease to
   exist, discussion should be directed to the Applications and Real-
   Time Area or general IETF discussion forums, or the IESG.

4.1.5.  Purpose

   This namespace is used for unique identifiers for use in emergency
   services, including emergency calls.  Most uses for this identifiers
   will be used within private "Emergency Services IP Networks"
   (ESInets), some use in the public Internet is expected.  These
   identifiers will be used in several countries, and hopefully,
   eventually, worldwide for handling of emergency calls and incidents.
   Prior to this document, North American emergency services used the
   "nena" nid, defined in [RFC6061].  Most identifiers in urn:nena will
   be replaced by identifiers in urn:emergency in pursuit of a single
   worldwide standard set for emergency services which are not
   controlled by a single public safety organization like NENA.
   Identifiers with this nid do not require resolution.  Identifiers in
   this nid will primarily specified in public safety standards SDOs,
   but some IETF standards may use or define them.

Internet-Draft            Emergency Registries             December 2021


4.1.6.  Syntax

   The basic syntax for identifiers in the emergency nid is:

   urn:emergency:<top level class>:<:extended>

   where

   <top level class> is a member of the urn:emergency namespace
   registry, see Section 4.4

   <extended> is a class-specific value defined by the document
   describing the registry entry.  In many cases, the extension includes
   sub classes.  For example:
   urn:emergency:service:responder:police.local

   There are no special encoding rules for identifiers in urn:emergency.
   URN equivalence is non-case sensitive.  Hyphens are not expected in
   these identifiers, but if used, they are significant in comparisons.
   Quotes are not allowed in this nid.  There are no special
   considerations for conforming to URN syntax.  Percent encoding is
   permitted.  There are no uses for q-components or f-components in
   this namespace.

4.1.7.  Assignment

   Assignment of top level classes is by standards documents, both
   standards-track RFCs and standards documents in other SDOs.  See
   Section 4.4.  Assignments within top level classes are defined in the
   document that defines the class.  Such documents MUST specify how
   uniqueness within the class is achieved.

4.1.8.  Security and Privacy

   Each top level class, in its defining document MUST describe the
   security and privacy considerations of that class.  In general, there
   are no special security consierations for these identifiers.  Several
   top level classes are defined in this document.  In some
   circumstances, these identifiers may indicate what kind of agency is
   involved with a public safety incident, and some may identify a
   specific agency.  Encryption of the communications that contain the
   identifier in classes defined in this document is REQUIRED and MUST
   be TLS or an equally secure protocol.

Internet-Draft            Emergency Registries             December 2021


4.1.9.  Interoperability

   Many of the identifiers in urn:emergency are similar in construction
   and use as identifiers originally defined in urn:nena.  Backwards
   compatibility with those identifiers MUST be specified in the
   documents that use them.  NENA STA-010.3-2021 is the primary document
   that has this backwards compatibility requirement, as it defined most
   of the identifiers in urn:nena.  There are no other interoperability
   issues.

4.1.10.  Resolution

   No resolution of these identifiers is defined.

4.2.  "Emergency" Area

   IANA is requested to establish the registries within this section
   under the "Emergency" area.  These registries contain enumerated
   values used for emergency calling.  New registries or subregistrues
   in the "Emergency" area require a standards document, which MAY be a
   standards track RFC, but also MAY be a defined in a document from a
   recognized standards organization that promulgates emergency services
   standards.  Where a new registry or subregistry is defined in an
   external standards organization, an expert SHALL review the document
   to ascertain that it is relevant to the "Emergency" area, that the
   organization defining the registry is a recognized standards
   organization, that the document clearly articulates the management
   method for the regisry, which MUST be substantially similar to one or
   more of the management methods in [RFC8216], and if expert review is
   specified, that experts acceptable to the IESG for the registry are
   available.  The expert reviewing the new registry shall also request
   IANA to review the relevant documents using the same criteria as it
   would for a standards track RFC.  The expert SHALL NOT approve the
   new registry unless IANA is satisfied it can maintain the registry
   with the same or similar level of effort it expends for similar
   registries created by RFCs.  If the management of the registry is
   specified as First Come First Served, which, per RFC8126 does not
   require an expert, an expert acceptable to the IESG must be available
   to answer questions about registrations and advise IANA of any issues
   in registrations in that registry.

Internet-Draft            Emergency Registries             December 2021


   These registries are required to implement The NENA i3 Standard for
   Next-Generation 9-1-1 [NENAi3] as well as the NENA Standard for
   Emergency Incident Data Object [EIDO].  These standards, unless
   otherwise specified, will initially populate the registries created
   by this document.  Some registries previously existed in the NENA
   Registry System [NRS], but the intent of international SDOs is to
   maintain next-generation emergency calling registries under IANA in
   the future.  [NRS] will be maintained only for backwards
   compatibility, and for registries required only for North America.

4.3.  Emergency Call Additional Data Registry

   IANA is requested to move the Emergency Call Additional Data registry
   and its sub-registries to the Emergency Area

4.4.  "urn:emergency" registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry for the emergency nid top
   level classes in the emergency area.

4.4.1.  Name

   urn:emergency

4.4.2.  Information Needed to Create a New Value

   Name of the top level class, a short description and a reference to a
   document that defines it.

4.4.3.  Registration policy

   Specification Required [RFC8126], which requires expert review.  The
   specification MUST be from the IETF or a recognized standards
   organization that creates standards for emergency services.  The
   expert must confirm the requested class is appropriate for emergency
   services, if the registering organization is not the IETF, that it is
   an appropriate organization to define the class, that the purpose
   adequately describes the new class and the reference leads to a
   document that clearly describes the use of the class.  Also see
   Section 4.4.5

4.4.4.  Content

   This registry contains:

   *  The ASCII "Name" of the "top level" class (a short string)

4.4.5.  Subregistries for top level classes of urn:emergency

   In most cases, top level classes of urn:emergency will define
   subregistries.  Several levels of subregistries may be needed.  The
   document that defines the class MUST define the subregistry if
   needed.  IETF and emergency service standards organizations MAY
   define subregistries of urn:nena.  Instructions to IANA for the
   subregistry MUST conform to [RFC8126].  The expert reviewer for the
   top level class works with IANA to assure that they do if the
   standards organization creating the subregistry is not the IETF.

4.4.5.1.  "urn:emergency:service" Subregistry

   IANA is requested to create a subregistry for "urn:emergency:service"
   under "urn:emergency".

   When calls are routed within an Emergency Services IP Network
   (ESInet), the routing element queries a LoST [RFC5222] server for the
   (nominal) route.  It does so with a service URN.  Esternal routing is
   accomplished with "urn:service:sos", as defined by [RFC5031].  Within
   an ESInet, values under this registry are used.

   Service URNs as defined here begin with "urn:emergency:service".  The
   sub-namespace defined by this registry MAY be further subdivided
   (potentially several times), by sub-registries under this sub-
   registry.  The separator between urn:emergency:service and the entry
   in the subregistry is a colon (":").  A new entry starting with
   "urn:emergency:service" SHOULD denote a new type of route, which MUST
   be distinguished by the LoST server from other uses.  For example,
   emergency calls being routed within the ESInet use
   "urn:emergency:service:sos" (or a subspace of it).  Calls routed by a
   PSAP to a responder use "urn:emergency:service:responder" (the type
   of responder is also included, e.g.,
   "urn:emergency:service:responder.police").  A client specifies the
   URN in a LoST query, and the LoST Server uses it to choose a
   (nominal) route.

4.4.5.1.1.  Name

   urn:emergency:service

4.4.5.1.2.  Information Needed to Create a New Value

   Name of the entry, a short description and a reference to a document
   that defines it.

4.4.5.1.3.  Registration policy

   Specification Required [RFC8126], which requires expert review.  The
   specification MUST be from the IETF or a recognized standards
   organization that creates standards for emergency services.  The
   expert must confirm the requested entry is appropriate for emergency
   services, if the registering organization is not the IETF, that it is
   an appropriate organization to define the entry, that the purpose
   adequately describes the new entry and the reference leads to a
   document that clearly describes the use of the entry.  Also see
   Section 4.4.5

4.4.5.1.4.  Content

   This registry contains:

   *  The ASCII "Name" of the value (a short string)

   *  The ASCII "Purpose" of the value (explanatory text)

   *  A "Reference" (URI) to the document that defines the value

4.4.5.2.  "urn:emergency:service:sos" Subregistry

   IANA is requested to creates a subregistry for
   "urn:emergency:service:sos" under "urn:emergency:service".

   Routing of emergency calls within the ESInet is a primary function of
   systems that process such calls.  When routing entities must route
   calls within the ESInet, they query the LoST Server for the route.
   Routing for emergency calls may involve multiple levels of routing
   entities.  Each level may need a different URN to be distinguishable.
   Routing of emergency calls, including instant messages and non-
   interactive calls within an ESInet, is accomplished with a URN
   beginning with "urn:emergency:service:sos".  The
   "urn:emergency:service:sos" registry contains values appropriate for
   the various levels of routing within the ESInet.  The separator
   between urn:emergency:service:sos and entry in the subregistry is a
   colon (":").

4.4.5.2.1.  Name

   *  The ASCII "Purpose" of the value (explanatory text)

   *  A "Reference" (URI) to the document that defines the value

4.4.5.3.  "urn:emergency:service:test" Registry

   IANA is requested to creates a subregistry for
   "urn:emergency:service:test" under "urn:emergency:service".

   Test calls are directed to "urn:service:test.sos".  To route such
   test calls where the routing infrastructure uses multiple levels of
   routing, and thus uses URNs in the "urn:emergency:service:sos"
   registry, service URNs are needed for test calls with similar levels.
   IANA is requested to create an entry in the "urn:emergency:service"
   registry with the name "test" and with the purpose noted as "routing
   test calls within the ESInet toward a primary PSAP".  The reference
   will be to the registry created by this section,
   "urn:emergency:service:test".  The separator between the "test" label
   and the service ("urn:emergency:service:test" registry entry) is a
   period ".".  The "urn:emergency:service:test" registry contains label
   values corresponding to the levels in the "urn:emergency:service:sos"
   registry.  These registries are normally kept in sync, an entry added
   to "urn:emergency:service:sos" should also add a corresponding entry
   to urn:emergency:service:test.

4.4.5.3.3.  Registration policy

   Specification Required [RFC8126], which requires expert review.
   Normally, entries in urn:emergency:service:test mirror those in
   urn:emergency:service:sos.  If there are any discrepancies the expert
   shall determine if the requested entry meets the use defined above
   and the specification document adequately describes how the entry is
   used.

4.4.5.3.4.  Content

   The content of this registry should mirror the content of
   urn:service:test:sos except with the "test" label as described above.

4.4.5.4.  "urn:emergency:service:responder" Registry

   IANA is requested to create the "urn:emergency:service:responder"
   subregistry under "urn:emergency:service"

   Once a PSAP gets a call, they may have to transfer the call to a
   secondary PSAP.  The secondary PSAP is chosen based on the type of
   responder, and the location of the caller.  Routing of emergency
   calls from a PSAP towards a responder is accomplished with a URN
   beginning with "urn:emergency:service:responder".  IANA is requested
   to create an entry in the "urn:emergency:service" registry with the
   name "responder" and with the purpose noted as "routing emergency
   calls within the ESInet towards a responder".  The reference will be
   to the registry created by this section,
   "urn:emergency:service:responder".

   The "urn:emergency:service:responder" registry contains label values
   appropriate for the types of responders within the ESInet.  The
   separator between the "responder" label and the type of responder
   ("urn:emergency:service:responder" registry value) is a period ".".
   This registry is also used in other contexts where an agency type is
   useful.  For those purposes, a 'psap' entry is provided.
   "urn:emergency:service:responder.psap" must not be used to route
   emergency calls.  It is not equivalent to, or a substitute for
   "urn:service:sos" or "urn:emergency:service:sos".

   Some of the entries in this registry will require further
   subdivision.  Subregistries for such divisions are REQUIRED.

   the Service/Agency Locator.  The Service/Agency Locator is a
   distributed database.  There are several mechanisms by which the
   Service/Agency Locator can be searched to locate a specific service
   or agency.  When searching for a service by location, the LoST
   protocol ([RFC5222] is used, which accepts a URN that specifies the
   service being searched by location.  This registry provides urns to

4.4.5.10.  "urn:emergency:uid" Registry

   Various entities need to create globally unique identifiers.  A
   simple way to do that is to combine a locally unique identifier and a
   domain name (which is globally unique).  However, many entities need
   to create more than one type of globally unique identifier and
   knowing what type of identifier is helpful in diagnosing problems.
   For this purpose, the uid URN subregistry creates unique strings used
   to prepend identifiers that indicate the type of identifier it is.

   This document does not describe the structure of the identifier

4.5.22.  "Discrepancy Report Status Token" Registry

   Errors and discrepancies may occur in any set of data, including
   databases, configurations, etc.  Standardized Discrepancy Report (DR)
   functions allow reporting and responding to reports of discrepancies
   across vendors.  Various types of DRs and responses are defined in
   the standards.  Many of the reports and/or responses have elements
   that are tokens in a restricted list.  This registry enumerates the
   tokens, and where they can be used.

   The registry contains the name of the element in the DR object that
   uses the token, and the DR type that uses that element.  More than
   one element could use the same token, and more than one DR type could
   use the same element name (and token values).  This means
   registration requests can specify more than one value in the "Name"
   and "DiscrepancyReports" columns, and a new registration can add a
   value to "Name" or "Discrepancy Report" for an existing entry.

4.6.  EIDO Registries

   Following are registries needed to implement the Emergency Incident
   Data Object, the standard way to represent incident state when passed
   between entities in an ESInet or other emergency services networks,
   [EIDO].

4.6.1.  "EIDO-AgencyRole" Registry

   The role of the agency in relation to the Incident (e.g., "Call
   Receiving", "Dispatching", "Dispatched").  This may differ from
   agency role as defined in the Agency Role registry.

4.6.1.1.  Name

   *  The UTF-8 "Literal Description" (a short string)

   *  A "Reference" (URI) to a document that requests the entry

4.6.2.  "EIDO-IncidentType-Common" Registry

   When multiple agencies are involved in an incident, the type of
   incident must be communicated clearly.  Many agencies have internal
   incident typing systems that are incompatible with each other.  The
   Association of Public Safety Communications Offials (APCO) has
   documented a set of incident types which are the original basis for
   this registry ([APCO]), but there is no registry of codes.  This
   registry forms the complete listing of common type codes.

4.6.2.1.  Name

   EIDO-IncidentType-Common

4.6.2.2.  Information Needed to Create a New Value

   Name and description of the reason code.

4.6.2.3.  Registration policy

   Specification Required [RFC8126], which requires expert review.  The
   expert should confirm that the the entry represents a new incident
   type.  Generally this registry should track the APCO document, but
   additional codes are allowed to be added provided they are unique
   from the APCO codes and are adequately documented in the
   specification.

   in the incident ends.  The disposition code indicates whether follow-
   up reports are required and conveys other information about the
   incident, such as whether it resulted from a false or actual alarm.
   They are used to exchange the status and follow up requirements of an
   incident upon its closure.  The disposition codes are drawn from a
   registry containing common disposition codes for Police, Fire and EMS
   disciplines.  These codes are defined by [APCO1.111] and implemented
   by [EIDO].

   APCO ANS 1.111.2-2018 uses a two-digit integer as an incident status
   code.  IANA is also requested to hold values 46-100 for future
   versions of the standard.
