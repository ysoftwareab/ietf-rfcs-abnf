Abstract
    
    Tunnels are very common in the Internet. They are often
    used to deploy new technologies such as multicast or IPv6 when the
    underlying infrastructure is not ready to natively support
    those new protocols. Virtual Private Network are also often build
    using IP in IP tunnels.
    This document describe a MIME type that provide configuration
    information for tunnels.
    
    
1. Introduction
    
    Managing IP in IP tunnels can be a complex task and various
    approaches have been developed to assist network administrators.
    In the context of IPv6 transition, the tunnel broker model [BROKER]
    has been developed for that very purpose and highlighted the need
    for a formal description of IPv6 in IPv4 tunnels.
    However, such a description can be made more generic and provide
    information about almost any kind of tunnels.
    
2. Related work
    
    [RADTUN] describe tunnel attributes in RADIUS format.
    
    
3. Tunnel management
    
    Tools and/or protocols to do the actual tunnel management are
    out of the scope of this document.
    
    
4. MIME type definition
    
    In conformance with [MIME], the MIME object to describe
    tunnels is defined in the IETF tree as a subtype
    of the "Application" MIME type.
    
    The proposed subtype is "tunnel".
    
    The tunnel described by this object is a unidirectional tunnel
    from host SRC to host DST.

6. Security Considerations

    The information contained in this MIME type may be used by
