Abstract

   This document specifies the CDDL and usage description for Reference
   Integrity Measurements (RIM) in Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS).
   The specification is based on Concise Software Identification
   (CoSWID) and TCG Reference Integrity Manifest Information Model -
   based on Host Integrity at Runtime and Start-up (HIRS).  Extension
   points defined in CoSWID used to augment CoSWID tags with new
   attributes that can express the TCG Reference Integrity Manifest
   extensions.

1.  Introduction

   Reference Integrity Measurements describe the intended state of
   (composite) software components installed on a (composite) device.  A
   measurement of all installed software components of a devices allows
   for assertions about the trustworthiness of the given device.  In
   combination with a root of trust (RoT) for reporting (RTR), these
   measurements can be refined into evidence and enable Remote
   ATtestation procedureS (RATS).  RATS support the decision process of
   whether to put trust in the trustworthiness of a device - or not.

   The RATS architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] defines the
   following roles: Verifier, Attester, Endorse, and Relying Party, and
   Reference Value Provider.  The RATS architecture also specifies that

   attestation Evidence is created by Attesters and consumed by
   Verifiers.  Ultimately, the goal is to enable a Relying Party to put
   trust in the trustworthiness of a remote peer (the Attester).
   Attestation Evidence is composed of believable assertions about an
   Attester's trustworthiness characteristics.  In RATS, these
   assertions are called Claims.  The Verifier conducts a set of
   appraisal procedures in order to assess the compliance of an
   Attester's trustworthiness characteristics.

   A prominent appraisal procedure in RATS is the comparison of Claim
   values included in attestation Evidence with reference Claim values
   provided by Reference Value Providers (RVP, e.g. a supply chain
   entity).  The comparison of Claim values via Reference Claim Values
   (RCV) is vital for the assessment of compliance metrics with respect
   to software components installed on an Attester.  A typical objective
   here is the remediation of vulnerabilities discovered in certain
   versions of installed software components.

   The Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) of the Linux Security
   Modules (LSM) provides a detailed Event Log (sometimes also referred
   to as a Measurement Log) that retains a sequence of hash measurements
   of every software sub-component (e.g. a firmware, an ELF executable,
   or a configuration file) that is created and appended to the sequence
   of measurements that composes the event log before the software
   component in question is started or read - "first measure, than
   start".

   In essence, to enable this appraisal procedure conducted by Verfiers
   an Attester's IMA provides Event Logs that include the hash values of
   every started software component and therefore are part of the
   attestation Evidence an Attester creates.  The complementary well-
   known-values that Verifiers require are included in the Reference
   Integrity Measurements (RIM).  RIMs for software components can be
   provided via Concise Software Identification (CoSWID) tags created or
   maintained by RVPs, such as the software creators, manufacturers,
   vendors, or other trusted third parties (e.g. a certification
   entity).

   This document provides an extension to the CoSWID specification
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid].  The extension adds attributes to
   CoSWID tags that enable them to express RIMs.  One prominent subset
   of these attributes are illustrated in the TCG Reference Integrity
   Manifest Information Model [ref] specification.  These attributes are
   added to the existing CoSWID specification via the most general
   extension point the CoSWID specification provides: $$coswid-
   extensions.  An new map type-definition named "reference-values" is
   added and is defined in section [ref] of this document.

Internet-Draft                 CoSWID RIM                   January 2021


   Furthermore, a usage profile for signed CoSWID tags is defined in
   this specification in support of the software-component structure of
   systems managed by package managers.  Signed CoSWID tags that are
   aligned with that software model can be used to describe the contents
   of one or multiple of the packages that make up the contents of a
   system.  In order to minimize the impact on the sizes of packages, it
   is likely that any CoSWID tags delivered as part of packages as part
   of a package manager managed system will not contain actual reference
   values, but instead a link-entry to a CoSWID tag published by the
   vendor in a repository.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  CoSWID Attribute Extensions for RIM

   This specification defines two types of attribute sets that can be
   added to the CoSWID specification via the specified defined extension
   points:

   1.  Attributes that support RIM manifests for Measured Boot (often
       referred to as Secure Boot) and

   2.  Attributes that support the RPM package manager structure.

2.1.  RIM requirements on existing CoSWID attributes

   As defined by NIST IR 8060 [ref], there are required "Meta
   Attributes" for XML SWID tags that have to be included in a SWID tag
   in order to compose a valid SWID RIM.  In this section, these
   attributes are mapped to CoSWID attributes and corresponding
   requirements on attributes defined in the CoSWID specification to
   compose valid NIST IR 8060 signed Payload content in the Concise
   Software Identity Reference Integrity Measurement (CoSWID RIM)
   representation.

   The 'software-meta-entry' type defined in the CoSWID specification
   includes the optional members 'product', 'colloquial-version',
   'revision', and 'edition'.  These four members MUST be included in a
   CoSWID RIM in order to compose a valid Reference Integrity
   Measurement in alignment with NIST IR 8060.  Furthermore, the
   semantics of the text (tstr) typed values MUST convey content that
   allows for semantic interoperability in a given scope (e.g., an

   administrative domain).  The software-meta-entries provide vital
   support for steering decisions made by the RATS verifier role in
   order to enable discovery and matching of related or additional
   CoSWID RIM available to or discoverable by the verifier.

2.2.  RIM Extensions for HIRS

   The following attributes are derived from the TCG Reference Integrity
   Manifest Information Model [ref] specification.  These attributes
   support the creation of very small CoSWID RIM tags that enable the
   Remote Integrity Verification (RIV
   [I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation]) of small things,
   i.e., constrained devices in constrained network environments.  In
   consequence, the majority of the attributes listed in this section
   represent metadata about firmware and supply chain entities that
   provide firmware for a device (platform).  Analogously to the
   mandated software-meta-entries illustrated above, the attributes
   defined in the table below provide more context and enable steering
   decisions for the appraisal procedures of a Verifier.  Consecutively,
   RIM have to be managed and curated in a consistent manner so that
   there is no significant threshold for a Verifier to make use of them
   during an appraisal procedure.

   The design of the additional RIM attributes in this section is
   motivated by the vast variety of identifier types used in production
   today, e.g. endorsement documents [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] that
   are enrolled or on-boarded on the Attester itself.  It is vital to
   highlight that this variety can render semantic self-descriptiveness
   more difficult.  Most importantly though: interoperability beats
   self-descriptiveness.  A convergence towards a common identification
   scheme with respect to software components and its subset that is
   firmware is highly encouraged - alas not achieved at the time of
   creating this proposed standard.  The following table defines the
   semantics of the set of new members that are added via the reference-
   measurement-entry map.  The reference-measurement-entry map is added
   using the $$coswid-extension CDDL extension point.

2.3.  RIM Extensions for Software Package Management

   To enable very small CoSWID tags that basically are signed references
   to full Base RIMs for each software package that ultimately include
   all the hash values required by the appraisal procedure of a
   Verifier, the member rim-reference is added using the $$payload-
   extension CDDL extension point.

2.3.1.  CoSWID Version Scheme for RPM

   To enable encoding version information into a CoSWID tag for RPM
   packages, the SWID version scheme value index TBD1 has been
   registered.  RPM versions are defined as epoch:version-release-
   architecture, where the "epoch:" component is optional.  Epoch is a
   numerical value, which should be considered zero if the epoch
   component is missing.  Version and Release can be any string as long
   as they do not contain a hyphen (-).  Architecture is an
   alphanumerical string.

   Sorting of RPM versions is a multi-step process: - The epoch, version
   and release components are compared in that order, as soon as a
   difference is found, that is the overall difference. - The epoch
   component is compared as integers.  A higher number means a higher
   version. - The version and release components are compared
   alphabetically, until a digit is encountered in both strings, at
   which point as many digits are consumed from both to form an integer,
   which is then compared.  If the integers are identical, the
   comparison continues alphabetically. - The architecture component is
   never sorted.  If they are different between two versions, the
   versions are inequal, not higher or lower.

2.4.  CoSWID RIM CDDL

   The following CDDL specification uses the existing CDDL extension
   points as defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid]:

   o  $$coswid-extension

   o  $$payload-extension
