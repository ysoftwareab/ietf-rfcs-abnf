Abstract

   For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly
   deployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been
   proposed.  One such mechanism is configured tunnels.  This document
   provides a mechanism by which the DHCPv6 servers can provide
   information about the various configured tunnel end points to reach
   the IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.

1.  Introduction

   In the initial deployment of IPv6, the IPv6 nodes may need to
   communicate with the other IPv6 nodes via IPv4 networks.  Configured
   tunnels [3] provide a way to encapsulate the IPv6 packets in IPv4
   packets and tunnel them in the IPv4 network.  

   This document defines a new option called Configured Tunnel End Point
   by which the DHCPv6 [1] server can notify the client with the list of
   end point of the configured tunnels to the various IPv6 networks
   separated by the IPv4 networks.

2.  Requirements

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [1].

4.  Configured Tunnel End Point Option

   The Configured Tunnel End Point Option gives the information to the
   clients about the Configured Tunnel End Point [3] to be contacted for
   reaching the nodes in the various IPv6 networks which are separated
   by IPv4 networks.  The clients are expected to install these routes
   in their machines.

   The format of the Configured Tunnel End Point Option is as shown
   below:

    0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 support for IPv6 Transition        Dec 2003

   option-code:  OPTION_CTEP (TBD)

   option-len: Total length of the prefix-len, Destination Prefix and
       Configured Tunnel Address lists in octets; It should be a 
       multiple of 33.

   prefix-len:  prefix length of the Destination Prefix

   Destination Prefix:  IPv6 Prefix;

   Configured TEP Address:  IPv6 Address of the Configured TEP.

   The clients are expected to install the routes identified by the
   tuples <Destination Prefix/prefix-len, Configured TEP Address> once
   they receive this option from the server.

5.  Appearance of this option 
 
   The Configured Tunnel End Point Option MUST NOT appear in other than
   the following messages:  Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request and Reply.

   The option numbers of Configured Tunnel End Point option MAY appear
   in the Option Request Option [1] in the following messages:  Solicit,
   Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure.

6. Security Considerations 
 
   The Configured Tunnel End Point Option may be used by an intruder 
   DHCPv6 server to provide invalid or incorrect configured tunnel end
   point.  This makes the client unable to reach its destination IPv6
   node or to reach incorrect destination.  The latter one has very
   severe security issues as IPv6 destination is spoofed here.

   To avoid attacks through this option, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use
   authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" in
   the DHCPv6 specification [1]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options
   from the option-code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of the
   DHCPv6 specification [1].

	  Option Name       Value           Described in 
          OPTION_CTEP        TBD             Section 4
