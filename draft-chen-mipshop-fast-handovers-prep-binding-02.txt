1. Introduction 

    The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 document [RFC4068] defines the 
    Fast Handovers mechanisms between PAR and NAR.  

    After MN move to NAR from PAR and before MN finish binding update, 
    MN has to use PCoA as source IP address for communication with CN by 
    reverse tunnel. This document discusses a solution which support the 
    binding update when MN still in PAR network (Prep-Binding). Prep-
    Binding should send CNoA to CN. This solution support NCoA for 
    source IP address at that time without tunnel.

    The following documents have been reviewed while drafting this 
    document: 

   o Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6[RFC4068] 

   o Mobility Support in IPv6 [RFC3775] 

    

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].  The use 
   of the term, "silently ignore" is not defined in RFC 2119.  However, 
   the term is used in this document and can be similarly construed. 
    

   This document borrows all of the terminology from RFC4068. The 
   following terminology and abbreviations are used in this document. 

    

   Prep-Binding Update(PBU) 

            Special BU message which is sent by MN when MN generated 
   NCoA local in PAR 

    

   Prep-Binding Acknowledgement(PBA) 

            The Prep-Binding Acknowledgement is used to acknowledge 
   receipt of a Prep-Binding Update 

    

   Transitional Period of MN(TPoMN) 

            The period of MN after MN moves to NAR before MN finishes 
   Binding Update

               Figure 1: Reference Scenario for Handover 
   The figure 1 is borrowed from RFC4068 

   In section 3.1 of RFC4068, it described the transitional action of MN 
   in TPoMN. MN could receive packets from NAR while PAR SHOULD forward 
   packets in the tunnel to NAR. In the opposite direction, MN SHOULD 
   transmit packets to PAR by reverse tunnel until it completes the 
   Binding Update.  

    

   There are two problems with this solution. First is that one more 
   IPv6 header need to be added in each packet from MN to CN. It should 
   reduce the usable bandwidth of the network. Second is that the PAR

   and the MN MUST support reverse tunnel. It will farther reduce the 
   performance of transmission while a great many tunnels are generated. 

    

   This document discuss an alternative solution in section 3.2 

3.2. Solution of Prep-Binding Update  

    

3.2.1. Mobile Node Operation 

       MN sends PBU to CN after MN receives PrRtAdv from PAR and a NCoA 
   generated. The CoA carried in PBU message is NCoA. If MN received PBA 
   from CN, MN sends packets to CN using NCoA as source IP address in 
   TPoMN. PAR didn't need a reverse tunnel which is required by the 
   Fmipv6.  

    

   Prep-Binding Update(PBU) 

   It should use 1 reserved bit of BU message which defined in section 
   6.1.7 RFC3775.

Acknowledge (A) 
      The Acknowledge (A) bit MUST be set in the PBU message by MN to 
request a Prep-Binding Acknowledgement to be returned by CN. 
 
Prep-Binding(P) 
       The Prep-Binding Update(P) bit is set by MN to request CN to 
   create a new special entry in their Binding Cache. It means this 
   binding is a temporary Binding Update. The entry which created by 
   this kind of Binding Update works in TPoMN only. Because this entry 
   works before formal Binding Update, the Prep-Lifetime which defined 
   in section 3.2.2 in this packet should not be a large number. Setting 
   3 or 4 for Prep-Lifetime is desirable to increase security. 

    

3.2.2. Correspondent Node Operation 

   CN should setup a Prep-Binding Entry after CN received PBU and get 
   NCoA.  

   Conceptual Data Structures in CN 

      o  The home address of the mobile node.   

      o  The care-of address for the mobile node. 

      o  A lifetime value 

      o  A flag indicating whether this Binding Cache entry is a home 
   registration entry (applicable only on nodes which support home agent 
   functionality). 

      o  The maximum value of the Sequence Number field received in 
   previous Binding Updates for this home address. 

      o  Usage information for this Binding Cache entry. 

      o  A perp-lifetime of Prep-binding Update which  

               0 A formal Binding Cache Entry which process as same as 
   defined in [RFC3775]

               >0: A PEntry should work in TPoMN. The number of Perp-
   Lifetime means that lifetime of this entry after MN sent packet with 
   NCoA as source IP address in TPoMN. The lifetime of this entry 
   started to account when CN receive the first packet which the source 
   IP address is the NCoA in this entry. After start to account, the 
   lifetime of entry is the time of the lifetime record 

        

       CN send a Prep-Binding Acknowledgement with status is 2 to 
   acknowledge receipt of a PBU after setup PEnrty.

                  figure 3:Prep-Binding Fast Handover 

   The figure 3 describes the process of Prep-Binding Fast Handover. The 
   lines marked as 1, 2 and 3 are key point of the process. 

        o Step 1, MN sends PBU to CN after MN received PrRtAdv 

        o Step 2, CN creates a special entry in Binding Cache and 
          feedbacks PBA to MN. 

        o Step 3, when MN moves to NAR. MN sends packet containing NCoA 
          as source IP address. CN processes packet by PEntry. 

3.3. Issues of Prep-Binding Update 

   Several issues of Prep-Binding Update should be discussed about this 
   document. 

   1. Process's integrality of Prep-Binding Update 

   The DAD of home address and the Return Routability Procedure are not 
   discussed in this document. But the draft-zhang-mipshop-proactive-
   cot-00.txt has discussed the issues of proactive Care-of Address Test 

   2. Assigned Addressing in RFC4068 

   The RFC4068 define that the MN MUST use the assigned address upon 
   attaching to NAR If there is an assigned NCoA in the FBack message. 

   When should MN send PBU and receive PBA should be discussed. PEntry 
   in Binding Cache of CN should be wrong if PBU and PBA are sent before 
   Hack message and assigned addressing including in Hack. 

   3. Home Agent Operation 

   Does HA create PEntry? It is an issue.

4. Security Considerations 

   Prep-Binding Update should increase discussion of security. It could 
   be deceived attack if Prep-Binding Update has no mechanism of the 
   authentication and the security. 

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations defined in this document. 

6. Conclusions 

   This document described a kind of technique that MN could use NCoA 
   before Binding Update when MN moved to NAR's network. The NAR and PAR 
   are the router in access layer of network. The router's ability of 
   transmitting in access layer is low usually. Tunnel between MN and 
   PAR should reduce the ability of transmitting further. This document 
   suggests Prep-Binding Update to reduce the load of PAR.
