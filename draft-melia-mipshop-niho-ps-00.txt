Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Standards based IP mobility enabling protocols such as Mobile IP
   [RFC3344] [RFC3775], HIP [RFC4423], MOBIKE [RFC4555] and SCTP with
   address management support [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp] [mSCTP] are
   all mobile node centric: the handover related decision making is
   mostly done in the mobile node only.

   Public mobile network access is gaining increased diversity, both in
   terms of the types of access technologies, in terms of the diversity
   of the offer (with clear separation of roles between access and
   service providers), and in terms of the size of that offer.  This
   diversity has been compounded by increasing number of multi-access
   capable terminals equipped with IP technologies, and of operator-
   provided multi-technology mobile connection software.  Overall, this
   creates a complex environment, where the mobile terminal might not
   have enough information or even the possibility to make an
   intelligent handover decision (as is often the case of operator-
   provided software).  In fact, handover decisions and inherent target
   network selection is not necessarily anymore based on access
   availability but further depends on policies and commercial roaming
   arrangements on access network level, access provider level and
   service provider level.  Furthermore, the information required for an
   intelligent target network selection might change periodically with
   such a frequency that maintaining all knowledge (and intelligence) in
   the mobile node might not be viable anymore.  Some of this
   information is only available for network elements.  However, none of
   the mobility protocols above referred have capabilities or procedures
   to significantly involve network side entities in intelligent
   handover decision making.

   A good example of the type of information only available at network
   entities is radio resource usage.  It is expected that radio resource
   usage optimization will be a task of major relevance in future
   wireless network environments, with millions of users roaming between
   access routers across multiple technologies (i.e. 802.11, 802.16,
   e.g. [draft-cui-mobopts-hcf-wlan-00]).  This task can resort to
   mechanisms and algorithms able to gather measurements and force
   terminal handovers between cells.  The handover can be issued
   according to predefined mobility patterns, mechanisms for intelligent
   flow balancing, mechanisms for optimized resource re-allocation,
   mechanisms for user-traffic performance optimization, or mechanisms
   for user profiling (e.g. access rights) - all of them ultimately
   leading to better service to be provided to the users, with
   additional increased resource usage for the network operator.  For
   these expectations to be realized, network control capabilities are
   required to instruct specific terminals to perform handovers, either
   between access points or between different technologies.

   Going even further, handovers over administrative domains i.e. inter-
   domain handovers are not explicitly prohibited with the existing IP
   mobility enabling protocols, but at the same time these protocols are
   not designed or optimized for such cases in any way.  Also a general
   network controlled triggering mechanism for a handover from an
   administrative domain to another does not currently exists.  Some
   initial work in this direction is introduced in [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-
   hokey-ps].  The document describes how EAP keying material combined
   with hierarchical schemes could enhance roaming scenarios.

   This problem statement document describes various scenarios where
   handovers could be network initiated, even over administrative
   domains, presenting some ideas on functional components and protocol
   operations required to fulfill the above requirements.  This,
   however, will further require a new handover triggering mechanism
   that originates from entities located in the network side, and is
   acted upon by entities on the mobile node.  These network side
   entities may also be located in other administrative domains than the
   one the mobile node is currently visiting.  In Section 6 an example
   is provided on how IEEE 802.21 can implement the required signalling.
   Finally, this document also discusses and lists a set of goals and
   non-goals for further work that aims at enabling network initiated
   and assisted handovers, even over administrative domains.

1.1.  Overview of the problem

   Current standard mobility protocols provide Internet connectivity to
   mobile nodes roaming from one access router to another.  To reduce
   handover latency, extensions to mobility protocols are available
   (e.g.  [RFC4068], [RFC4140]).  Although some of the approaches
   support network initiation of the handover procedure, none of them
   takes into consideration the existence of a backend combining
   mobility, resource management and roaming scenarios.  In this
   document we present a list of requirements according to which this
   characteristic is not adequate, and the protocols need to be extended
   with handover initiation by the network.

   In [I-D.mohan-nflm-proto] a network based fast handoff based
   mechanism is proposed.  The scenario considers a mobility anchor
   point controlling several access routers.  On behalf of the mobile
   node the serving access routers updates routes and binding caches
   allowing the traffic to be routed to the new location.  The trigger
   comes from the mobile node.

   There has been work started in the last months to split local
   mobility from global mobility.  Local mobility in the access network
   mainly optimizes control signaling by reducing the need to update the
   home/visited network about user mobility.  Local mobility can be

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   handled independently of the global mobility.  As an example, in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-ps] a list of requirements is given in order
   to identify desired functionalities.  In the proposed document mobile
   devices are able to move across an access network by reducing to the
   minimum the complexity in the terminal itself.  Therefore the network
   is requested to handle user mobility by means of appropriate schemes.

   In this last proposal the trigger for host route update executed by
   the network (which is actually an handover execution) is originating
   in the terminal.  By means of layer two mechanisms (e.g. link up or
   link down in IEEE 802.11) or layer three mechanisms (e.g.  Neighbor
   discovery) the terminal is detected on the new link and the route to
   the host updated for packet delivery.  Thus, the whole network
   intervention is simply the support of route update.  The real
   trigger/decision comes, once again, from the terminal.

   Following the split between global mobility domain and local mobility
   domain, [3GPP.23.882] provides additional scenarios where the network
   controlled and initiated handovers are also considered.  The key
   point is that is the initiator of the handover procedure is mainly
   the serving radio access network, in contrast to the above explained
   methods.

   More short term deployable solutions have also been proposed.  In
   [draft-cui-mobopts-hcf-wlan-00] a WLAN scenario is presented and
   extensions to Mobile IPv6 messages are introduced to support an
   handover control function for handover decision.  [I-D.melia-mobopts-
   niho-fmip] proposes a fast mobile IP based approach where both mobile
   terminal and network initiated handovers are possible.  Network
   initiated handovers are combined with advanced admission control
   mechanisms and potential race conditions are solved by appropriate
   protocol operations.

   Additional ways of providing information to the network enabling
   handover decisions are presented in [I-D.korhonen-mobopts-link-
   characteristics-ps].  Methods are provided to enable Mobile IPv6 and
   Mobile IPv4 capable nodes to exchange link information with the HA
   and any CN.  However, to generalize the approach, the link
   characteristics exchange should happen during the handover process,
   since the Binding Update handshake conclude the handover process,
   when (bicasted) packets are already routed to the new Care-of Address
   (nCoA).  For instance, specialized traffic shapers could be installed
   in the ARs to adapt a selected MT-CN flow to the specific underlying
   wireless/wire line access technology.  Or (re)INVITE messages could
   be issued, in 3GPP multimedia communications.

   In the above mentioned examples we note an increasing involvement of
   the network in the mobility management problem.  The aim of this

   document is to identify common lines to existing solutions and to
   derive the set of functionalities required to perform this kind of
   handovers.

1.2.  Definition of Network Initiated Handover

   As mentioned above, available solutions rely on the existence of
   triggers generated in the mobile terminal and conveyed to respective
   network components which then will take adequate actions.  However,
   recently we have been assisting to new different trends [3GPP.23.882]
   where the serving radio access network issue handover preparation/
   execution by means of different events gathered at different levels
   (e.g. radio conditions, QoS requirements).  We therefore are required
   to define use cases in which the network takes active decisions
   without requiring the terminal to perform expensive operations.

   In this document by network initiated handover we identify the action
   taken in the network to initiate the handover based on:

   o  Link events originated in the mobile node.  In this case the
      terminal sends link events to the network.  The event might be
      generated because of radio variations, powering on of new network
      devices or new service requirements.  In all cases the measurement
      action is required to be performed also in critical conditions.
      For instance speed dynamic effects on terminal mobility have to be
      taken into account as well as variable round trip time.
      Positioning of the decision function is a critical issue.

   o  Events generated in the network for e.g. resource management
      reasons.  It should be noted that the Mobile Operator can initiate
      an handover procedure also based on location and current services.
      Multihoming scenarios can also be considered as part of the
      overall optimization problem.

   The action described is similar to exiting behavior of current GSM/3G
   systems.  Measurements are requested by the network and performed by
   the mobile terminal.  The results of these measurements, combined
   with current QoS conditions and other user profile requirements,
   could result in the execution of an handover.  Measurements are a key
   issue, for instance, in indoor wireless LANs environments, affected
   also by different user mobility patterns.

1.3.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",



Melia, et al.           Expires December 20, 2006               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   NAP

      Network Access Provider.  A network operator that provides direct
      IP packet forwarding to and from the end host.

   MRMH

      Mobility and Roaming Manager, usually located at home network.
      The Roaming Manager part is aware of administrative relationships
      between the home network, various ISPs and possibly with various
      NAPs as well.

   MRMV

      Mobility and Roaming Manager located at visited network.  MRMV is
      generally a local representative of MRMH in the visited network.

   MSP

      Mobility Service provider.  A service provider that provides IP
      mobility services.  In order to obtain such service, the mobile
      node must be authenticated and prove authorization to obtain the
      service.

   NIHO

      Network initiated and assisted handover.

   AN

      Access Network composed of several access routers.  Identified as
      well as local mobility domain.

   IS

      Information services provide an information query mechanism for
      mobile or network nodes to obtain information about specific
      networks and their capabilities, as explained in IEEE 802.21.  The
      information service plays a critical role in the network selection
      at the mobile node or in the network.

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   ES

      Event service is a protocol exchange mechanism between network
      nodes to inform of recently happened or impending change in link
      or network status information, as explained in IEEE 802.21.  The
      event notification can originate either from a mobile node or a
      node in the network.  Receipt and processing of an event belonging
      to the ES may generate a reaction in the receiving node (e.g.
      trigger IP layer mobility).

   CS

      Command service is a protocol exchange mechanism between network
      nodes to instruct the recipient network nodes to execute a
      specific function, as explained in IEEE 802.21.  Execution of a
      command service at the mobile node or a node in the network may
      result in loss of current link connectivity and/or change in the
      network point of attachment.  Receipt and processing of a command
      belonging to the CS generates an expected response in the
      receiving node (e.g. create a new link layer connection,
      disconnect a link layer connection, etc).

   MIHF

      Media independent handover function (MIHF)is a shim layer in the
      mobility management protocol stack of the mobile nodes or network
      element that provide media independent or inter-technology
      mobility, specifically handovers (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.21).
      MIHF can implement one or more of IS, ES and CS.

   MM

      A mobility management entity (MM) implements network selection and
      handover decision algorithms and utilizes mobility signaling
      protocols and other protocols that aid in mobility functions.  MM
      functionality should utilize MIHF.


2.  Assumptions

   This document has some few fundamental assumptions concerning the
   general networking environment and network initiated handovers.  The
   rest of the document makes use of the following assumptions:

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   o  Reusing existing security mechanisms -- The mobile node should
      reuse the existing security associations it created while
      establishing the initial access to the network and its mobility
      service provider (MSP).  Applicable scenarios are identified in
      [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps].

   o  All mobile nodes within the scope of this document are expected to
      support at least one (potentially modified) existing or future IP
      mobility enabling protocol.  However, if a MN does not support
      network initiated handover functionality, the network might refuse
      to give service to that MN.

   o  All mobile nodes, correspondent nodes and mobility management
      nodes are not expected to understand or support network initiated
      and assisted handovers.  When either peer lacks support for
      network initiated and assisted handover triggering and signaling
      the peer supporting these features must fall back to the base IP
      mobility protocol mechanisms.

   o  The network initiated handover concept relies on the presence of a
      centralized functional entity.  This entity controls the network
      side and implement the intelligence to select nodes and targets
      access routers.  It is not in the scope of this document to
      specify the policies that will be implemented.

   o  To provide adequate scalable support, distributed functions are
      required to support the above functional entity.  This gives more
      flexibility to the overall architecture and protocol operation.

   o  It is envisioned the presence of multi wireless access, such as
      802.11, 802.16, UMTS, forming an heterogeneous composition of
      macro and micro cells.  The network support SHOULD leverage user
      mobility focusing on vertical handovers.  Hence, the terminal does
      not need to apply filtering criteria to select a target network
      (which could be an expensive operation in heterogeneous
      environments).  Solutions similar to the 3GPP interface between
      the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and any application server, for
      downloading of filtering criteria at registration time, could be
      applied here - being the HSS a AAA backend, and the application
      server the MRMV/MRMH.

   o  Performing network initiated handover has the main implication
      that the network has first to assess the terminal view of the
      network.  Signal level evaluation is a important matter when
      considering user mobility.  This is typically very well handled
      with terminal initiated handovers and automatic evaluation of
      signal level.  Different methods apply to different technologies.

   o  Neighborhood discovery relates to the above assumption when
      neighborhood scanning is requested from the network.  It is
      expected these functions to be available on the terminal side.


3.  Scenarios

   This section describes few usage scenarios where the network
   initiated and assisted handover could be justified and deployed.
   Also we list here initial requirements for the general network
   initiated and assisted handover functionality.

3.1.  Administrative domain wise considerations

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 introduce two different possible scenarios.  In
   the first case one single administrative scenario is described.  The
   Mobile Operator (MO) owns both the ISPs and the NAPs.  It provides as
   well mobility services.  This is the simplest case where security
   restrictions are less relevant.  The MO has therefore full control.

   Figure 2 illustrates another example architecture, where the
   signaling and triggering relationship between home network domain,
   ISP domain, NAP domain and the mobile node domain are shown.  Each of
   previously mentioned technical domains may belong to a different
   administrative domain.

   Figure 2: An overall architecture for network initiated and assisted
   handovers over multiple administrative domains

   The architecture in Figure 2 has been divided into three different
   domains.  Domain 1 represents the home network or the services
   provider that owns and manages user's subscription.  It eventually
   contains Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as well.

   Domain 2 contains Network Access Providers (NAPs).  A NAP provides
   access services for one or more Home Networks.

   Domain 3 is the mobile node and may also represent the end user.  The
   end user does not need to have any relationship with NAPs or ISPs in
   order the gain access to the services accessible through the home
   network.

   Along these lines [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps] proposes a distributed

   system interacting with a AAA backend.  The introduced key Holder
   element acting as a AAA client for the AAA server COULD -- in this
   scenario -- be implemented at the boundaries of each single cloud,
   belonging either to a NAP or to an ISP.  SAs presented in the
   document can be mapped to the mechanisms depicted in Figure 2.

3.2.  Technology wise considerations

   In the previous section we provided an high level view of network
   relationships between the different entities involved.  Figure 1 and
   Figure 2 describes a general network view without describing which
   technologies are supported and where optimizations take place.  It is
   clear MO will have different environment deployments.  In the
   following we give some examples on how technologies can be mapped to
   NAP implementing several Access Networks and creating potentially
   complex overlapping of macro and micro cells scenarios.

   These cells can be actually owned by the same or by different NAPs.
   In any case, the MRMH will collect information about all these cells
   (as visible from the terminal) across the different domains.

3.3.  NIHO Application Areas

   We foresee three possible application areas that are listed and
   briefly described in the following section.  Each application area
   uses the NIHO triggering and signaling as part of their tasks.

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   o  Application for Mobility Reasons

      In this context user mobility is handled from the network side
      assisted by the mobile terminal.  This particular application
      requires network capabilities to request measurements and evaluate
      technologies specific link conditions.  The approach can be
      considered similar to what current mobile networks do.  The most
      challenging aspect is the freshness of the reported information.
      Particular scenarios, such as WLAN, could impose stringent
      requirements.

   o  Application for Resource Optimization Reasons

      As mentioned before, network optimization is a delicate issue when
      resources are scarce, especially in the wireless access network.
      Standards that able to support natively quality of services
      capabilities are becoming mature to be sold on the market
      (802.11e).  A cross layer design is therefore required to convey
      link layer specific information to decision points located in the
      access network.

      These decision points can combine standard admission control
      mechanisms with advanced NIHO functionalities, resulting in a new
      dimension of mobility management (i.e. more terminals can be
      granted with network access).

   o  Application for inter-domain handover

      Handovers that cause the mobile to cross administrative domain
      borders involve inter-domain signaling.  One example of this kind
      of scenario is when the mobile node moves between different NAPs
      under the same ISP or when even the ISP changes as a result of the
      movement.  In both of these scenarios the NIHO signaling could be
      used to prepare the new target domain (either ISP and/or NAP) for
      the arriving mobile node.  Especially if the handover was
      initiated from the network side, the handover initiating network
      could help distributing all security, policies, billing and
      service related material cross administrative domains before the
      mobile node arrives.


4.  General Requirements

4.1.  Network assistance with global mobility management

   This aspect is particularly important for inter-domain handovers.
   The network will provide information required for speeding the
   handover.  This information is related with two types of data: i)



Melia, et al.           Expires December 20, 2006              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   operator related data, such as billing information, policies, etc..;
   ii) terminal related data, such as security associations.

4.2.  Network assistance with local mobility management

   This aspect is particularly important for resource optimization and
   intra-domain handovers.  The network will provide information to lead
   (or impose) the mobile terminal to associate to specific access
   points.

4.3.  Inter-domain handovers

   Inter-domain handovers and inter-domain handover preparations require
   entities involved in the triggering and signaling to have security
   relationships in place between them.  For example the MRMH located at
   the home network (service provider) must have a security relationship
   between all ISPs the end user can use for accessing services.  Also
   ISPs must have security relationship between all NAPs the end user
   can use for accessing services.  However, NAPs do no necessarily need
   to have any relationship with the actual service provider.  And going
   even further the end user does not need to have any relationship
   between NAPs and ISPs, only with the service provider.  It is service
   provider's duty to grant access to services via any NAP and ISP the
   service provider has a direct or indirect pre-setup relationship.

   In addition to obvious security and AAA related challenges between
   the service operator, ISPs and NAPs, the general when and why to
   trigger a handover towards the mobile node is not a trivial task.
   The service provider's home network needs to have rather exact and up
   to date knowledge of the mobile node's current topological location
   and surrounding network conditions before it should trigger a
   handover on the mobile node due same policy decision at the home
   network.  Example of such policy decisions is when a mobile node
   roams (after a handover) to a target network the home network does
   not want the end user to use for the active service set the end user
   has requested.  As a consequence the home network MRMH triggers a new
   handover suggestion towards the mobile node indicating a more
   feasible target network (based on the information the mobile node has
   previously signaled to the home network MRMH).  Another home network
   policy decision could be distributing roaming end users in visited
   networks based on some distribution criteria.  Such criteria could,
   for example, be directing voice users to ISP A network, where as data
   service users to ISP B network.  A simpler rationale can be simply
   redirecting the user to the mobile network whose charges are lower at
   that time.  The IEEE 802.21 Information service, for instance, could
   help in this process.

   The whole policy mechanism in the home network MRMH is a complex



Melia, et al.           Expires December 20, 2006              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   issue and out of scope of this document.  However, the home network
   MRMH needs information of its end users from dedicated NAP and ISP
   entities.  These information aggregating entities are discussed in
   more detail in Section 5.


5.  Framework and Functional Components

   In the previous sections the need to implement decision points in the
   network as well as measurements and aggregation functions has been
   justified.  We can draw on the previous considerations to derive a
   framework view.

   o  Policy Decision Point

      This could be on the MRMH or MRML depending on the case.  In the
      IEEE 802.21 draft event and command services for network initiated
      handovers are associated with the Point of Services (PoS).  In
      [3GPP.23.882]the access nnetwork takes decision about initiating
      the handover.  Generalizing the approach we call this functional
      entity Policy Decision Point.  It is envisioned to place the PDP
      at the edge of a localized mobility domain or in the home network.
      In case of a ISP or NAP the PDP needs to have in place a SA with
      the home domain of the mobile user as specified in [I-D.nakhjiri-
      aaa-hokey-ps].

      The PDP can trigger/enforce a horizontal or vertical handover,
      depending on the user device.  It is also envisioned the
      possibility to detect multihomed devices as part of the resource
      management process.

   o  Policy Enforcement Point

      Enforcement points participating to the signalling, and
      contributing to the scalable approach, are necessary.  PEP are
      mainly access routers terminating different kind of transport
      protocols (e.g.  ICMPv6 over the last hop and SCTP between network
      components).

   o  Measurements Functions

      Measurements functions are critical components considering the
      overall procedure, being collectively distributed between the
      access routers and the mobile terminals.  As mentioned before, the
      network, prior to any action, needs to assess the terminal view
      (i.e. link signal quality) of the access network.  Currently none
      of the available protocols can support such feature.  Options
      could be specified, though scalability and security have to be

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


      deeply studied.  It is well understood measurements are requested
      from the network to the mobile terminal.

   o  Aggregators Components

      To increase the overall scalability of the procedure aggregation
      points could be installed in different places in the access
      networks.  Aggregated reports to PDP about QoS conditions, service
      availability, network load help in the decision process
      contributing to build an overall picture of the access network
      conditions. reports could be periodic or event based.  In either
      cases information of several hundreds of mobile terminals could be
      carried.

   Generally, the PDP acts upon events and combines required actions
   with user profiles.  Depending on billing rates, user preferences
   action A instead of action B can be issued.  The transfer and
   definition of such profiles is not in scope of this document.


6.  NIHO with IEEE 802.21

   IS, ES and CS as defined in IEEE 802.21 WG can be used as enablers
   for network initiated and assisted handover scenarios between
   different access technologies.  The discussion of such scenarios in
   IP networks can easily raise a long list of questions regarding the
   feasibility of e.g. sending information in real-time between the
   mobile node and the MM, and of sending commands between the MM and
   the mobile node.  The issue considered in these cases is typically
   the delay that can be introduced by the transport and that may make
   the overall handover delay quite considerable.  This document does
   not discuss these specific issues, and does not argue in favor or
   against such issues.  However, in order to identify some of the
   scenarios of applicability for IS, ES and CS for network-controlled
   handover, we need to consider the following classification of
   handovers.  There are two main reasons to perform a handover:

   1.  degradation of current link/connection quality: the quality of
       the link is degrading and it is necessary to perform a handover
       to avoid losing the current connection;

   2.  "opportunistic" handover: due to a set of events and based on
       specific policies, it is preferable to move the communication to
       another link.

   In order to support inter-technology network-controlled handovers the
   first case, the delay between the moment the handover decision is
   made and the moment the command to perform the handover is received



Melia, et al.           Expires December 20, 2006              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   by the mobile node needs to be considered carefully.  However, for
   "opportunistic" handover the impact of such delay is less
   significant, since the mobile node is not having any degradation over
   the current link, and the handover will be performed because the
   network has policies indicating that it is preferable to move to the
   new link.

   One motivation for performing opportunistic network-controlled
   handover is load sharing, in scenarios where a network exercises
   tight control of various wireless link technologies to distribute the
   load of communications according to network policies.

   The network may perform a network-controlled handover decision in at
   least two steps.

   1.  Network selection, and

   2.  Handover control.

   The two steps are described in the following sections

6.1.  Network Selection

   Network selection is a process of selecting a favorable network for a
   mobile node to transfer or handover the ongoing services to the
   selected network.  The selected network may be a different link
   technology from the previous one.  It may also be possible that the
   mobile node, after handover, may not experience exactly the same
   level of QoS as the current link due to this network selection.  But,
   in general, it may result in some user benefit in one way or another
   e.g. cost savings, higher bandwidth etc.  MM in the network may have
   access to subscriber profile, contracts, and device capabilities to
   make use of the network selection algorithms for a certain subscriber
   or mobile node.

   Figure 4 shows a simple network selection procedure with the help of
   the mobile node.  This example call flow diagram employs remote event
   services and information services.  Remote command services are not
   used in this particular example, however, they can also be useful in
   the network selection mechanisms under certain scenarios.  E.g.
   depending on user geographical location, the network may command the
   mobile node to perform a scan for a specific 802.11 network and
   report the results that can be used in the network selection process.

   In the scenario shown, the mobile node initially performs a
   registration or attachment to the network on any link, e.g. 3GPP
   network.  The MM and the mobile node are able to discover each other
   in the same or following step.  MM may then register for specific

   remote event services, e.g.  ES-link-detect by sending a registration
   request and filter information for both 802.16 and 802.11 networks.
   The mobile node accepts the request with a positive reply.  From time
   to time, the mobile node may receive broadcast information from
   802.11 and 802.16 networks.  In this scenario, the 802.16 broadcast
   is received and a link-detect is sent by the 802.16 MAC layer to the
   MIHF.  The MIHF translates this to an ES-link-detect message to the
   MIHF implementing ES in the network (collocated in the MM) with the
   basic network information received in the broadcast.

   The MM requests for more information about the network via the IS
   query to another MIHF implementing IS to check the suitability of the
   detected network due to roaming agreements.  The MM decides that this
   particular 802.16 network is not a favorable network and takes no
   action.  The mobile node also takes no action and does not report the
   detection of same network more than once.  At a later time, the
   mobile node may receive beacon information from 802.11 AP and the MAC
   layer in the mobile node reports the to the MIHF along with the SSID
   information.  The MIHF provides this information to the MM in the
   network.  The MM may perform an IS query based on the SSID
   information and determines that this SSID belongs to a favorable
   network.  The network selection process, thereby, is completed.

6.2.  Handover Control

   Handover control procedure follows a network selection process as
   explained in the previous section.  The following scenario in
   Figure 5 shows a network-controlled handover procedure with fast MIP
   handover signaling [RFC4068].  Here, the MM in the network utilizes
   MIHF implementing CS and generates a link switch command with CS-

   switch-req to the mobile node.  The parameters in the message may
   include that a make-before-break mechanism is to be performed along
   with the target link information e.g. 802.11 network as shown from
   the network selection procedure earlier.

   The MIHF indicates the Mobile IP function of the impending link
   switch along with new link information.  The Mobile IP functionality,
   If necessary, i.e., it does not have a valid Access Router Tuple-Info
   [RFC4068], it sends a Proxy Router Solicitation (PrRtrSol) with the
   new link information (e.g.  MAC address of AP) and the Proxy Router
   Advertisement (PrRtrAdv) provides the relevant L3 information for the
   mobile node to use on the new link.  The MIHF in the mobile node
   executes the command by sending an "associate" request to the 802.11
   MAC which will perform all necessary L2 association and
   authentication procedures for the new link.  For completeness, steps
   3 and 4 in Figure 5 can take place in parallel to steps 3 and 4.

   A link-up indication is sent to the interested parties including
   Mobile IP functionality.  Mobile IP sends a Fast Binding Update (FBU)
   to the old FA over the old link so that old FA could switch (tunnel)
   the packets to the new FA.  The mobile node now is able to receive
   packets from new FA that are tunneled from old FA.  At a later time,
   the mobile node performs an Mobile IP update procedure to update the
   binding in the HA and reroute the tunnels directly from HA to the new
   FA in the new network corresponding to the 802.11 link.  Once the
   traffic uses the new link, the MIHF releases the old link by sending
   a request to that MAC layer, here the 3GPP radio link.  A CS-switch-
   resp is sent back to the MM upon completion of the command.

   The following signaling flow shows how the network controlled handoff
   can work with fast MIP handover signaling [RFC4068].  It shows a
   make-before-break mechanism, so that the mobile node sends the FBU on
   the old link after the setup of the new link to minimize the latency
   due to L2 association and authentication procedures.  For
   completeness, steps 3 and 4 in Figure 5 can take place in parallel to
   steps 2 and 3.

7.  Design considerations

7.1.  Goals

   This section lists the general goals for the network initiated and
   assisted handovers framework design.  The network initiated and
   assisted handover framework solution MUST fulfill all the goals
   listed below:





Melia, et al.           Expires December 20, 2006              [Page 22]

Internet-Draft         Network Initiated Handovers             June 2006


   G1 Independent of the IP mobility management mechanism -- The network
      initiated and assisted handover triggering mechanism must be
      independent of any particular IP mobility management protocol.
      However, there might be mappings/implementations of the triggering
      mechanism to a specific IP mobility protocol such as Mobile IP.

   G2 Work over administrative domains e.g. in inter-domain handover
      cases or when a multi-homed host is attached to multiple ISPs.

   G3 Provide similar degree of security as existing with the current
      security protocols.

7.2.  Non-goals

   This section lists issues that are considered as strictly out of
   scope of this problem statement and requirements document.

   o  Designing a new security framework in order to enable network
      initiated and assisted handover triggering.

   o  Initial bootstrapping problem -- The mechanism to gain the initial
      access to some network is out of scope of.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new name spaces to be managed by
   IANA.  This document does not either reserve any new numbers or names
   under any existing name space managed by IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, the threats to network
   initiated and assisted IP handovers in general, and signaling and
   triggering between the mobile node and corresponding network entities
   are not widely understood, particularly in the inter-domain handover
   case when the signaling and triggering takes place across
   administrative domains.  Part of the experimental task in preparing
   network initiated and assisted handovers (even across administrative
   domains) for eventual standards track will be to better characterize
   threats to network initiated and assisted handovers, inter-domain
   triggering and signaling, and design specific mechanisms to counter
   them.

   Work along these lines already started.  [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps]
   presents initial ideas how the problems described in this document
   could be solved.
