Internet-Draft Additional CMS Revocation Information Choices   Dec 2009 
    

Abstract 

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) allows revocation information 
   to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData content types.  The 
   preferred format for revocation information is the Certificate 
   Revocation List (CRL), but an extension mechanism supports other 
   revocation information choices.  This document defines two additional 
   revocation information formats for Online Certificate Status Protocol 
   (OCSP) responses and Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol 
   (SCVP). 

1. Introduction 

   The RevocationInfoChoices type defined in [CMS] provides a set of 
   revocation status information alternatives, which allows revocation 
   information to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData content types.  The intent 
   is to provide information sufficient to determine whether the 
   certificates and attribute certificates carried elsewhere in the CMS 
   protecting content are revoked.  However, there MAY be more 
   revocation status information than necessary or there MAY be less 
   revocation status information than necessary. 

   X.509 Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) [PROFILE] are the primary 
   source of revocation status information, but any other revocation 
   information formats can be supported.  This document specifies two 
   other formats: Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses 
   [OCSP] and Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) 
   responses [SCVP]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [WORDS]. 

2. Revocation Information 

   For convenience, the ASN.1 definition of the RevocationInfoChoices 
   type from [CMS] is repeated here: 

   RevocationInfoChoices ::= SET OF RevocationInfoChoice 

     RevocationInfoChoice ::= CHOICE { 
     crl        CertificateList, 
     other  [1] IMPLICIT OtherRevocationInfoFormat }

   OtherRevocationInfoFormat ::= SEQUENCE { 
     otherRevInfoFormat  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
     otherRevInfo        ANY DEFINED BY otherRevInfoFormat } 

   The other CHOICE MUST be used to convey OCSP responses, SCVP 
   requests, and SCVP responses. 

   The revocation information choices are defined under the following 
   object identifier arc: 

   id-ri OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) 
     dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) ri(16) } 

3. OCSP Response 

   To carry an OCSP response, the otherRevInfoFormat is set to  
   id-ri-ocsp-response, which has the following ASN.1 definition: 

   id-ri-ocsp-response OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri 2 } 

   In this case, otherRevInfo MUST carry the OCSP response using the 
   OCSPResponse type defined in [OCSP].  The responseStatus field MUST 
   be successful and the responseBytes field MUST be present.  

4. SCVP Request and Response 

   Unlike OSCP, SCVP permits unprotected and protected responses, where 
   protected responses can be digitally signed or include message 
   authentication codes.  While this provides more flexibility, it 
   complicates when an SCVP response can be validated by entities other 
   than the entity that generated the SCVP request.  If a lower layer 
   provides authentication and integrity for the client-server 
   interaction and the response is not protected, then a third party 
   cannot validate the response because there is no way to know that the 
   response was returned over a protected connection.  If a message 
   authentication code is used, then the third party will be unable to 
   validate the message authentication code because it does not posses 
   the necessary private key.  For these reasons, SCVP responses sent to 
   a third party MUST be signed by the SCVP server so that the third 
   party can validate them. 

   SCVP response validation requires matching it to the SCVP request.  
   This means that the SCVP request MUST always be included with the 
   response.  SCVP permits the client can retain the response, and SCVP 
   permits the request to be returned in the response (in the requestReq 
   field).  The request need not be protected for matching to be 
   performed; nonces and certIds can be checked.

   To carry the SCVP request and response, the otherRevInfoFormat is set 
   to id-ri-scvp, which has the following ASN.1 definition: 

   id-ri-scvp OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri 4 } 

   In this case, the otherRevInfo MUST carry both the SCVP request and 
   response with the following structure: 

   SCVPReqRes ::= SEQUENCE { 
     request  [0] EXPLICIT ContentInfo OPTIONAL, 
     response     ContentInfo } 

   The SCVPReqRes has the following fields: 

   o request contains the SCVP request.  It contains the unprotected 
     request, authenticated request, or the signed request.  The 
     request MUST be present if the response does not include the 
     requestRef fullRequest field. 

   o response contains the SCVP response.  It MUST contain the signed 
     response.  Additionally, the responseStatus MUST be okay.   
     Unprotected and authenticated responses MUST NOT be included. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations of [CMS], [CMS-ASN], [OCSP], [SCVP], and 
   [PROFILE-ASN] apply. 

   To locally store unprotected or authenticated SCVP responses, an 
   entity can encapsulate the unprotected or authenticated SCVP response 
   in a SignedData.  It is a matter of local policy whether these 
   encapsulated SCVP responses are considered valid by another entity.   

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes use of object identifiers.  These object 
   identifiers are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX 
   Working Group.  No further action by IANA is necessary for this 
   document or any anticipated updates.
