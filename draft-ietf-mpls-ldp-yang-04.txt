                      YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP
                      draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-yang-04

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG data model for Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  This model also
   serves as the base model that is augmented to define Multipoint LDP
   (mLDP) model.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] is one of the
   network management protocols that defines mechanisms to manage
   network devices.  YANG [RFC6020] is a modular language that
   represents data structures in an XML tree format, and is used as a
   data modelling language for the NETCONF.

   This document introduces a YANG data model for MPLS Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036].  This model also covers LDP
   IPv6 [RFC7552] and LDP capabilities [RFC5561].

   The data model is defined for following constructs that are used for
   managing the protocol:

   o  Configuration

   o  Operational State

   o  Executables (Actions)

   o  Notifications

   This document is organized to define the data model for each of the
   above constructs in the sequence as listed above.

1.1.  Base and Extended

   The configuration and state items are divided into following two
   broad categories:

   o  Base

   o  Extended

   The "base" category contains the basic and fundamental features that
   are covered in LDP base specification [RFC5036] and constitute the
   minumum requirements for a typical base LDP deployment.  Whereas, the
   "extended" category contains all other non-base features.  All the
   items in a base category are mandatory and hence no "if-feature" is
   allowed under the "base" category model.  The base and extended
   catogories are defined in their own modules as described later.

   The example of base feature includes the configuration of LDP lsr-id,
   enabling LDP interfaces, setting password for LDP session etc.,

Internet-Draft        YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP            March 2018


   whereas the examples of extended feature include inbound/outbound
   label policies, igp sync, downstream-on-demand etc.  This is worth
   higlighting that LDP IPv6 [RFC7552] is also categorized as an
   extended feature.

   While "base" model support will suffice for small deployments, it is
   expected that large deployments will require not only the "base"
   module support from the vendors but also the support for "extended"
   model for some extended feature(s) of interest.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, the word "IP" is used to refer to both IPv4 and
   IPv6, unless otherwise explicitly stated.  For example, "IP address
   family" means and be read as "IPv4 and/or IPv6 address family"

3.  Overview

   This document defines two new modules for LDP YANG support:

   o  "ietf-mpls-ldp" module that models the base LDP features and
      augments /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols defined in
      [RFC8022]

   o  extended "ietf-mpls-ldp-extended" module that models the extended
      LDP features and augments the base LDP

   It is to be noted that mLDP data model [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-yang]
   augments LDP base and extended models to model the base and extended
   mLDP features respectively.

   There are four main containers in our module(s):

   o  Read-Write parameters for configuration (Discussed in Section 5)

   o  Read-only parameters for operational state (Discussed in
      Section 6)

   o  Notifications for events (Discussed in Section 7)

   o  RPCs for executing commands to perform some action (Discussed in
      Section 8)

Internet-Draft        YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP            March 2018


   The modeling in this document complies with the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].
   The operational state data is combined with the associated
   configuration data in the same hierarchy
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].  When protocol states are retrieved
   from the NMDA operational state datastore, the returned states cover
   all "config true" (rw) and "config false" (ro) nodes defined in the
   schema.

   hierarchy:

   Before going into data model details, it is important to take note of
   the following points:

Internet-Draft        YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP            March 2018


   o  This module aims to address only the core LDP parameters as per
      RFC specification, as well as some widely deployed non-RFC
      features (such as label policies, session authentication etc).
      Any vendor specific feature should be defined in a vendor-specific
      augmentation of this model.

   o  Multi-topology LDP [RFC7307] is beyond the scope of this document.

   o  This module does not cover any applications running on top of LDP,
      nor does it cover any OAM procedures for LDP.

   o  This model is a VPN Forwarding and Routing (VRF)-centric model.
      It is important to note that [RFC4364] defines VRF tables and
      default forwarding tables as different, however from a yang
      modelling perspective this introduces unnecessary complications,
      hence we are treating the default forwarding table as just another
      VRF.

   o  A "network-instance", as defined in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model],
      refers to a VRF instance (both default and non-default) within the
      scope of this model.

   o  This model supports two address-families, namely "ipv4" and
      "ipv6".

   o  This model assumes platform-wide label space (i.e. label space Id
      of zero).  However, when Upstream Label assignment [RFC6389] is in
      use, an upstream assigned label is looked up in a Context-Specific
      label space as defined in [RFC5331].

   o  The label and peer policies (including filters) are defined using
      a prefix-list.  When used for a peer policy, the prefix refers to
      the LSR Id of the peer.  The prefix-list is referenced from
      routing-policy model as defined in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model].

   o  This model uses the terms LDP "neighbor"/"adjacency", "session",
      and "peer" with the following semantics:

      *  Neighbor/Adjacency: An LDP enabled LSR that is discovered
         through LDP discovery mechanisms.

      *  Session: An LDP neighbor with whom a TCP connection has been
         established.

      *  Peer: An LDP session which has successfully progressed beyond
         its initialization phase and is either already exchanging the
         bindings or is ready to do so.

Internet-Draft        YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP            March 2018


      It is to be noted that LDP Graceful Restart mechanisms defined in
      [RFC3478] allow keeping the exchanged bindings for some time after
      a session goes down with a peer.  We call such a state belonging
      to a "stale" peer -- i.e. keeping peer bindings from a peer with
      whom currently there is either no connection established or
      connection is established but GR session is in recovery state.
      When used in this document, the above terms will refer strictly to
      the semantics and definitions defined for them.

   A graphical tree representation of full LDP YANG data model is
   presented in Figure 2, whereas LDP configuration (base and extended),
   state (base and extended), notification, and rpc are grapically
   represented in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 15, and
   Figure 16 respectively.  The actual base and extended model
   definition in YANG is captured in Section 9.

   While presenting the YANG tree view and actual .yang specification,
   this document assumes readers' familiarity with the concepts of YANG
   modeling, its presentation and its compilation.

5.  Configuration

   This specification defines the configuration parameters for base LDP
   as specified in [RFC5036] and LDP IPv6 [RFC7552].  Moreover, it
   incorporates provisions to enable LDP Capabilities [RFC5561], and
   defines some of the most significant and commonly used capabilities
   such as Typed Wildcard FEC [RFC5918], End-of-LIB [RFC5919], and LDP
   Upstream Label Assignment [RFC6389].

   This model augments /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols that is
   defined in [RFC8022] and follows NMDA as mentioned earlier.

   Following is the high-level configuration organization for base LDP:

   Given the configuration hierarchy, the model allows inheritance such
   that an item in a child tree is able to derive value from a similar
   or related item in one of the parent.  For instance, hello holdtime
   can be configured per-VRF or per-VRF-interface, thus allowing
   inheritance as well flexibility to override with a different value at
   any child level.

5.2.  Configuration Hierarchy

   The LDP configuration container is logically divided into following
   high-level config areas:


      Per-VRF parameters
          o Global parameters
          o Per-address-family parameters
          o LDP Capabilities parameters
          o Hello Discovery parameters
              - interfaces
                 - Per-interface:
                    Global
                    Per-address-family
              - targeted
                 - Per-target
         o Peer parameters
              - Global
              - Per-peer
                 Per-address-family

         o Forwarding parameters


                                 Figure 7

   Following subsections briefly explain these configuration areas.

5.2.1.  Per-VRF parameters

   LDP module resides under an network-instance and the scope of any LDP
   configuration defined under this tree is per network-instance (per-
   VRF).  This configuration is further divided into sub categories as
   follows.

5.2.1.1.  Per-VRF global parameters

   There are configuration items that are available directly under a VRF
   instance and do not fall under any other sub tree.  Example of such a
   parameter is LDP LSR id that is typically configured per VRF.  To
   keep legacy LDP features and applications working in an LDP IPv4

Internet-Draft        YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP            March 2018


   networks with this model, this document recommends an operator to
   pick a routable IPv4 unicast address as an LSR Id.

5.2.1.2.  Per-VRF Capabilities parameters

   This container falls under global tree and holds the LDP capabilities
   that are to be enabled for certain features.  By default, an LDP
   capability is disabled unless explicitly enabled.  These capabilities
   are typically used to negotiate with LDP peer(s) the support/non-
   support related to a feature and its parameters.  The scope of a
   capability enabled under this container applies to all LDP peers in
   the given VRF instance.  There is also a peer level capability
   container that is provided to override a capability that is enabled/
   specified at VRF level.

5.2.1.3.  Per-VRF Per-Address-Family parameters

   Any LDP configuration parameter related to IP address family (AF)
   whose scope is VRF wide is configured under this tree.  The examples
   of per-AF parameters include enabling LDP for an address family,
   prefix-list based label policies, and LDP transport address.

5.2.1.4.  Per-VRF Hello Discovery parameters

   This container is used to hold LDP configuration related to Hello and
   discovery process for both basic (link) and extended (targeted)
   discovery.

   The "interfaces" is a container to configure parameters related to
   VRF interfaces.  There are parameters that apply to all interfaces
   (such as hello timers), as well as parameters that can be configured
   per-interface.  Hence, an interface list is defined under
   "interfaces" container.  The model defines parameters to configure
   per-interface non AF related items, as well as per-interface per-AF
   items.  The example of former is interface hello timers, and example
   of latter is enabling hellos for a given AF under an interface.

   The "targeted" container under a VRF instance allows to configure LDP
   targeted discovery related parameters.  Within this container, the
   "target" list provides a mean to configure multiple target addresses
   to perform extended discovery to a specific destination target, as
   well as to fine-tune the per-target parameters.

5.2.1.5.  Per-VRF Peer parameters

   This container is used to hold LDP configuration related to LDP
   sessions and peers under a VRF instance.  This container allows to
   configure parameters that either apply on VRF's all peers or a subset



Raza, et al.            Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft        YANG Data Model for MPLS LDP            March 2018


   (peer-list) of VRF peers.  The example of such parameters include
   authentication password, session KA timers etc.  Moreover, the model
   also allows per-peer parameter tuning by specifying a "peer" list
   under the "peers" container.  A peer is uniquely identified using its
   LSR Id and hence LSR Id is the key for peer list

   Like per-interface parameters, some per-peer parameters are AF-
   agnostic (i.e. either non AF related or apply to both IP address
   families), and some that belong to an AF.  The example of former is
   per-peer session password configuration, whereas the example of
   latter is prefix-list based label policies (inbound and outbound)
   that apply to a given peer.

5.2.1.6.  Per-VRF Forwarding parameters

   This container is used to hold configuration used to control LDP
   forwarding behavior under a VRF instance.  One example of a
   configuration under this container is when a user wishes to enable
   neighbor discovery on an interface but wishes to disable use of the
   same interface as forwarding nexthop.  This example configuration
   makes sense only when there are more than one LDP enabled interfaces
   towards the neighbor.

6.  Operational State

   Operational state of LDP can be queried and obtained from read-only
   state containers that fall under the same tree (/rt:routing/
   rt:control-plane-protocols/) as the configuration.

6.1.  Operational Tree

6.1.1.  Base

   model for LDP operational state.

6.2.  States

   Following are main areas for which LDP operational state is defined:

      Neighbor Adjacencies

      Peer

      Bindings (FEC-label and address)

      Capabilities

6.2.1.  Adjacency state

   Neighbor adjacencies are per address-family hello adjacencies that
   are formed with neighbors as result of LDP basic or extended
   discovery.  In terms of organization, there is a source of discovery
   (e.g. interface or target address) along with its associated
   parameters and one or more discovered neighbors along with neighbor
   discovery related parameters.  For the basic discovery, there could
   be more than one discovered neighbor for a given source (interface),
   whereas there is at most one discovered neighbor for an extended
   discovery source (local-address and target-address).  This is also to
   be noted that the reason for a targeted neighbor adjacency could be
   either an active source (locally configured targeted) or passive
   source (to allow any incoming extended/targeted hellos).  A neighbor/
   adjacency record also contains session-state that helps highlight
   whether a given adjacency has progressed to subsequent session level
   or to eventual peer level.

   Following captures high level tree hierarchy for neighbor adjacency
   state.

6.2.2.  Peer state

   Peer related state is presented under peers tree.  This is one of the
   core state that provides info on the session related parameters
   (mode, authentication, KA timeout etc.), TCP connection info, hello
   adjacencies for the peer, statistics related to messages and
   bindings, and capabilities exchange info.

   Following captures high level tree hierarchy for peer state.

6.2.3.  Bindings state

   Binding state provides information on LDP FEC-label bindings as well
   as address binding for both inbound (received) as well as outbound
   (advertised) direction.  FEC-label bindings are presented as a FEC-
   centric view, and address bindings are presented as an address-
   centric view:

        FEC-Label bindings:
            FEC 203.0.113.1/32:
              advertised: local-label 16000
                peer 192.0.2.1:0

                peer 192.0.2.3:0
              received:
                peer 192.0.2.1:0, label 16002, used-in-forwarding=Yes
                peer 192.0.2.2:0, label 17002, used-in-forwarding=No
            FEC 203.0.113.2/32:
               . . . .
            FEC 198.51.100.0/24:
               . . . .

        Address bindings:
            Addr 192.0.2.10:
              advertised
            Addr 192.0.2.1:
              received, peer 192.0.2.1:0
            Addr 192.0.2.2:
              received, peer 192.0.2.2:0
            Addr 192.0.2.3:
              received, peer 192.0.2.3:0


                                 Figure 12

   Note that all local addresses are advertised to all peers and hence
   no need to provide per-peer information for local address
   advertisement.  Furthermore, note that it is easy to derive a peer-
   centric view for the bindings from the information already provided
   in this model.

   Following captures high level tree hierarchy for bindings state.

7.  Notifications

   This model defines a list of notifications to inform client of
   important events detected during the protocol operation.  These
   events include events related to changes in the operational state of
   an LDP peer, hello adjacency, and FEC etc.  It is to be noted that an

   LDP FEC is treated as operational (up) as long as it has at least 1
   NHLFE with outgoing label.

   for LDP notifications.

8.  Actions

   This model defines a list of rpcs that allow performing an action or
   executing a command on the protocol.  For example, it allows to clear
   (reset) LDP peers, hello-adjacencies, and statistics.  The model
   makes an effort to provide different level of control so that a user
   is able to either clear all, or clear all for a given type, or clear
   a specific entity.

   Following is a simplified graphical representation of the data model
   for LDP actions.

10.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, action and notification data defined using
   YANG data models in this document are likely to be accessed via the
   protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] etc.

   Hence, YANG implementations MUST comply with the security
   requirements specified in section 15 of [RFC6020].  Additionally,
   NETCONF implementations MUST comply with the security requirements
   specified in sections 2.2, 2.3 and 9 of [RFC6241] as well as section
   3.7 of [RFC6536].

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not extend LDP base protocol specifiction and
   hence there are no IANA considerations.

   Note to the RFC Editor: Please remove IANA section before the
   publication.

12.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to acknowledge Eddie Chami, Nagendra Kumar,
   Mannan Venkatesan, Pavan Beeram for their contribution to this
   document.  We also acknowledge Ladislav Lhotka for his useful
   comments as the YANG Doctor.
