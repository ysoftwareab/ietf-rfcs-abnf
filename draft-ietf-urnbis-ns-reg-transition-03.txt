     Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Registration Transition
                draft-ietf-urnbis-ns-reg-transition-03

Abstract

   The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement
   discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems
   that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed
   in [[RFC 3406bis]].  That document adopts a different model.  This
   document specifies IANA instructions to adapt selected existing
   registrations to the new model.  It also obsoletes some previous RFCs
   to eliminate any ambiguity about the status of new templates and
   updated registrations.

1.  Introduction

   [[CREF1: RFC Editor: Please note that mentions of "RFC 3406bis" in
   this I-D are defined as an Entity in the XML.  They should be
   corrected to show the actual RFC number before publication.]]

   [[CREF2: Note in draft: This document has been written in RFC form,
   i.e., assuming that it and 3406bis have been approved.  That style of
   writing assumes that RFC 3406 and the rules it specified are already
   obsolete.  It may be a bit awkward while the I-D is being evaluated
   by the WG and the IETF, but lowers the risk for errors or other
   surprises during the RFC editing process.]]

   As a part of the initial development of the Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) system in the late 1990s, the IETF URN working group agreed
   that it was important to demonstrate that the URN syntax can
   accommodate existing identifier systems.  RFC 2288 [RFC2288]
   investigated the feasibility of using three identifiers (ISBN, ISSN
   and SICI) as URNs, with positive results; however, it did not
   formally register corresponding URN namespaces.  This was in part due
   to the still evolving process to formalize criteria for namespace
   definition documents and registration, consolidated later in the IETF

   into successive Namespace Definition Mechanism documents [RFC2611]
   [RFC3406].

   URN Namespaces have subsequently been registered for NBN (National
   Bibliography Number) [RFC3188], ISBN (International Standard Book
   Number) [RFC3187], and ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)
   [RFC3044].

   The predecessor registration procedure for Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespaces [RFC3406] required IETF Consensus for formal
   namespaces.  That requirement discouraged some registrations and
   increased the risk for problems, including use of names without
   registration ("squatting"), that could occur as a result.  Those
   potential problems included the possibility of the same name being
   used to identify different namespaces with different rules.  The
   requirements have now been changed [RFC3406bis] to adopt a different
   model that focuses more on encouraging registration of all namespaces
   that follow the formal namespace syntax, with as much information
   collected as possible consistent with that goal.  This document
   specifies IANA instructions to adapt selected existing registrations
   to the new model and obsoletes the separate RFCs that specify the
   namespaces for International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs)
   [RFC3044] and International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) [RFC3187]
   to eliminate any ambiguity about the status of new templates and
   updated registrations.

   An updated version of the specification for the namespace for
   National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) [RFC3188] will be issued
   separately.  NBN is not a formal international standard and RFC 3188
   is the only formal document which specifies its scope.  The intention
   is to modernize the existing namespace registration so that it
   specifies the identifier and provides examples of its use, while the
   actual namespace registration will be done according to the new
   practice.

2.  Obsoleting Older Registration RFCs for ISSNs and ISBNs

   The existing RFCs that describe URN namespaces for ISSNs (RFC 3044)
   and ISBNs (RFC 3187) should be identified as "Historic" immediately
   after this document is approved and the new registration templates
   for those namespaces are submitted and incorporated into the URN
   Namespace registry by IANA.

   [[CREF3: Note in draft: The more information that can be supplied in
   the template or references from it, the better.  But, if there is
   information in the now-expired Internet-Drafts (draft-ietf-urnbis-
   rfc3187bis-isbn-urn, draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3044bis-issn-urn) that
   should be captured somewhere and that doesn't fit naturally in the

   template, the discussion below is probably a reasonable place to put
   it.]]
   [[CREF4: Similarly, if special transition discussions are needed for
   other URN namespaces registered prior to the intended transition,
   this document might be a place to discuss them if they are not too
   complicated (if they are complicated, they probably deserve their own
   documents).]]

   The updated templates reflect not only new template formats but
   substantive changes to the definitions of the namespaces.  The
   changes are summarized in the subsections that follow.

   For both ISSN and ISBN URNs, it is intended that the registrations
   track the evolution of ISO standardization without requiring
   resubmission of the templates or other formal IETF or IANA
   registration update approval procedures.

2.1.  ISBN URN Changes

   The revised ISBN namespace reflects the updated version of the ISO
   Standard for ISBNs, ISO 2108:2005 [ISO-ISBN-b].  The namespace allows
   for the use of both the ten character numbers described in RFC 3187
   and the earlier ISO 2108:1992 [ISO-ISBN-a] (known as ISBN-10), as
   well as the expanded ones of the revised standard (known as ISBN-13).

2.2.  ISSN URN Changes

   The ISSN namespace is also updated to reflect changes between the
   ISSN Standard when RFC 3044 was written and the newest, 2007 version
   [ISO-ISSN].

3.  Other existing URN registrations and RFCs

   The RFC Series and IANA Registry contain many URN definitions in
   addition to those for which this document calls out explicit actions.
   In general, those existing registrations are still appropriate but
   omit some information called for in RFC 3406bis.  Until and unless
   those registrations are updated as provided for in RFC 3406bis, the
   existing registration templates should be read as not requiring any
   features not specified by the earlier URN [RFC2141] and registration
   [RFC3406] specifications.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registry entries for URN ISSNs,
   ISBNs, and NRNs to reflect the new, RFC 3406bis-complaint templates
   as soon as they are available and to no longer reference the now-
   historic RFCs.  With respect to namespaces other than those listed

Internet-Draft         URN Registration Transition           August 2014


   above, registrations and templates conforming to the newer rules may
   be substituted for the older ones when they are available.  However,
   neither this document nor RFC 3406bis supercedes existing
   registrations other than those listed above.  Therefore, IANA needs
   to be prepared to maintain a registry whose contents reflect old-
   style templates for some namespaces and the newer ones for others.

   IANA should also note that the portions of the registrations that
   point to ISO Standards are intended to identify current versions
   (which may change) rather than only the versions that are active at
   the time this document is approved (see Section 2).

5.  Security Considerations

   While particular URN namespaces and their registrations might
   conceivably have security implications, this specification merely
   specifies a transition of a pair of registration procedures and does
   not have such implications.  The security implications associated
   with particular namespaces are expected to be listed in registration
   templates as specified in RFC 3406bis.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document draws heavily on discussions in the IETF URNbis Working
   Group in the second and third quarters of 2013, particularly during
   IETF 87 in August 2013, and on informal discussions during the
   plenary meeting of ISO TC 46 in June 2013.  The efforts of those who
   participated in those discussions are greatly appreciated.  It also
   draws on internet-drafts that were developed to update the older
   registrations before that approach was replaced by the new extended
   template model.  Those drafts were prepared by Pierre Godefroy, Juha
   Hakala, Alfred Hoenes, and Maarit Huttunen.

   The current draft benefits significantly from a careful reading and
   suggestions for editorial changes by Peter Saint-Andre.

7.  Contributors

   Alfred Hoenes was the editor and co-author of two of the documents
   from which this one is, in part, derived.  This document would not
   have been possible without his contributions.
