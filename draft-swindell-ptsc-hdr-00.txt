1. Abstract

   Anyone that has dealt at length with plain (ASCII [1]) text and
   source code files can testify that the lack of a global definition
   of the effect of the horizontal-tab character, all too often, causes
   ill-formed display and printed output of plain text files that
   utilize the horizontal-tab character for formatting.

   This document defines a common header for plain text and source code
   (PT/SC) files, whose primary purpose is to specify the tab-dependant
   formatting parameters to be used when displaying, printing, or
   editing such files.  The defined header also addresses such issues
   as whether to use the line-feed character or carriage-return/line-
   feed character sequence to terminate lines in the file.  Widespread
   adoption and support of the header defined in this document could
   substantially improve the interoperability of text and source code
   files distributed across the Internet and other mediums.

3. Introduction

   The tab key is typically used in plain (ASCII) text editors as a
   fast and convenient way to align text on predetermined column
   boundaries (tab-stops).  Upon editing or creating a file, when the
   tab key is pressed, the editor will usually place a horizontal-tab
   (ASCII 9) character in the current insert position and move the
   cursor forward to the next tab-stop position (i.e. indention).  The
   offset (tab-size) of each subsequent tab-stop is usually
   configurable in the editor, although the default value of this
   option is different from one editor to the next (typically in the
   range of two to eight character positions).  Additionally, some
   editors allow asymmetric tab-stops (variable tab-size) where for
   example, the first tab-stop may be at column five and the second at
   column eight.


3.1 The Problem

   The problem occurs when the file is printed, viewed, or loaded into
   a different editor, or perhaps loaded into the same editor, but with
   a different tab-size or tab-stop configuration.  The resulting file
   image may or may not resemble the original formatting of the file.
   This is especially critical for the legibility of program and script
   source code (C/C++, Java, HTML, etc.) files.

   The problem is especially apparent in a multi-author environment,
   where inevitably, different authors will have their editors and
   other text processing applications configured with different tab-
   dependent formatting parameters, resulting in what is affectionately
   referred to as "tab-hell".

   Example: Bob creates the following text file with his editor
   configured with eight space (symmetric) tab-stops:

        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+
        | User  | Meat  | Dairy | Favorite Food | Favorite Band |
        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+
        | Bob   | No    | Yes   | Salad         | Meat Loaf     |
        | Sally | Yes   | No    | Burrito       | Cream         |
        | Mike  | Yes   | No    | Pasta         | Vanilla Fudge |
        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+

   Julie would like to add herself to the table, so she loads the file
   into her editor, which happens to be configured for two space tab-
   stops (her preference).  This is what Julie is presented with:

        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+
        | User  | Meat  | Dairy | Favorite Food | Favorite Band |
        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+
        | Bob | No  | Yes | Salad   | Meat Loaf |
        | Sally | Yes | No  | Burrito | Cream   |
        | Mike  | Yes | No  | Pasta   | Vanilla Fudge |
        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+

   Confused, but determined, Julie adds herself to the table and prints
   the file for the caterer and DJ of the upcoming company party:

        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+
        | User  | Meat  | Dairy | Favorite Food | Favorite Band |
        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+
        | Bob | No  | Yes | Salad   | Meat Loaf |
        | Sally | Yes | No  | Burrito | Cream   |
        | Mike  | Yes | No  | Pasta   | Vanilla Fudge |
        | Julie | Yes | Yes | Milk    | Roast Beef |
        +-------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------+

   Needless to say, the party is a disaster: Bob's a vegetarian, Sally
   and Mike are lactose intolerant, and the DJ brings only Modern Dance
   music.

   This is obviously an extreme hypothetical example.  Typically, tab-
   related formatting problems are more of an esthetics than a
   logistics problem, but you get the idea.

   NOTE: This document must be viewed or printed using a non-
   proportional font for the above tables to appear as intended.


3.2 Existing Work-around

   Many existing text editors offer the option of writing the
   appropriate number of space (ASCII 32) characters to a file in place
   of horizontal-tab characters.  While such an option can be a
   functional work-around to the problem for files created and
   subsequently edited with an editor configured in this manner, it
   does nothing to solve the problem of correctly displaying, printing,
   or editing files that utilize horizontal-tab characters.

   Subsequent editing of a file that uses spaces in place of
   horizontal-tab characters may still adversely affect the formatting
   of the file if the author utilizes the tab key for indention and
   their editor is configured with different tab-stop parameters than
   the original editor configuration.

Internet Draft    Plain Text/Source Code File Header    September 1999


   Utilizing such an option also eliminates the possibility of
   convenient indentation/column resizing by simply adjusting the tab-
   stop configuration.  Additionally, most editors allow quick cursor
   movement through white-space in a file that utilizes the horizontal-
   tab character (typically, one arrow-key press per tab-stop), while
   white-space in files that use spaces in place of horizontal-tabs
   must be navigated one character position at a time (e.g. eight
   arrow-key presses per tab-stop).  An increasingly minor
   consideration is the fact that files (particularly source code
   files) that replace horizontal-tab characters with spaces can
   require as much as twenty percent more storage space than files that
   utilize horizontal-tab characters.


3.3 Proposed Solution

   While common computer users have migrated toward modern word
   processors and their elaborate document formats, this problem,
   although seemingly obscure, remains a thorn in the side of the
   minority of users who must still deal with plain text files.
   Ironically, the one group of computer users who are most affected by
   this problem are programmers, the same ones who are in a position to
   solve it by implementing a common solution.

   The solution proposed in this document is a plain text/source code
   (PT/SC) file header, whose primary purpose is to specify the tab-
   dependant formatting parameters to be used when printing,
   displaying, or editing such files.  Other common text file
   formatting issues (such as whether to use the line-feed character or
   carriage-return/line-feed character sequence to terminate lines) are
   also addressed in this header.

4. Application

   It is hoped that a significant percentage of the developers of plain
   text editors, specifically those designed for use in Integrated
   Development Environments (IDEs), will adopt this proposal.  Adoption
   would include parsing any PT/SC headers (if present) in files opened
   in the editor and setting the formatting parameters accordingly and
   optionally, adding PT/SC headers (if not already present) to files
   written to disk.

   A supporting editor MUST update any PT/SC headers (if present) with
   the current formatting parameters when a file is written to disk.  A
   supporting editor SHOULD allow the option of adding PT/SC headers to
   a file (if not already present) with all relevant formatting
   parameter values specified.

   Text editors that support multiple concurrently opened files MUST
   support a unique set of formatting parameters for each opened
   document.  Many editors already support a unique set of parameters
   based on the extension (e.g. ".c", ".pas", ".txt") of the opened
   file.  Such a feature would need to be extended to set the
   appropriate formatting parameters based on the values specified in
   any PT/SC headers present.

   Two-way support is defined as that of linking the PT/SC header
   values and corresponding configuration menu options (if applicable)
   such that a value changed in the file is reflected in the
   configuration menu and vice versa.  Two-way support is RECOMMENDED,
   but not required.

   It is also desirable that developers of applications designed to
   view, print, or modify in anyway plain text or source code files
   adopt this proposal.  Such applications include (but are not limited
   to) version control systems, file comparison utilities, syntax
   verification utilities, source-level debuggers, and universal
   document viewing and printing utilities.

   Authors of plain text and source code files need not wait for PT/SC
   header support in text editors.  The simplicity of the PT/SC header
   format allows authors to significantly help one another by at least
   "documenting" the original formatting parameters by hand-coding the
   PT/SC header so that other users and co-authors of such files need
   not "guess" at the correct formatting parameters.  And when
   applications supporting the PT/SC header become available, existing
   documents and source code files will immediately benefit from the
   automatic adjustment of formatting parameters based on the pre-
   existing PT/SC headers.

5. Header Format

   <BOF or LF or white-space>@format.<variable><white-space><value>

   Where <BOF> is the beginning of the file (offset 0), <LF> is the
   line-feed (ASCII 10) character, <white-space> is one or more space
   (ASCII 32) or horizontal-tab (ASCII 9) characters, <variable> is one
   of the supported format variable names (see section 6), and <value>
   is one or more desired values (separated by white-space) in the
   appropriate format for the corresponding variable.

   The "@format." header token and the supported format variable names
   SHALL NOT be case sensitive (i.e. "@FoRmAt." is a valid header
   token).  Decimal numeric values SHALL NOT be zero-padded (i.e. "08"
   is an invalid decimal value).  Hexadecimal numeric values MAY be
   zero-padded (i.e. "0x08" is a valid hexadecimal value).

   Example:

        This is MyFile.txt, @format.tab-size 8

   PT/SC headers may appear anywhere in a file, though they SHOULD be
   located as close to the beginning of the file as possible.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that no horizontal-tab characters precede the tab-
   dependant formatting variables in the header (if present).  If
   horizontal-tab characters precede the definition of the tab-
   size/tab-stop variables (for example), horizontal-tab characters may
   not be expanded correctly if the file is processed in a single pass
   (e.g. first line read, processed, printed, next line read,
   processed, printed, etc.).

   Multiple formatting variables may be specified by including multiple
   headers.  Multiple headers may be specified on a single line:

        This is MyFile.txt, @format.tab-size 8, @format.new-line crlf

   or multiple lines:

        This is MyFile.txt, @format.tab-size 8
                            @format.new-line crlf

   Format variables SHOULD NOT be multiply defined.  If a format
   variable is defined more than once in a file (e.g. this document),
   only the first occurrence SHALL be interpreted as valid.

5.1 Headers in Source Code Files

   PT/SC headers may be embedded in program or script source code files
   by including the header in the comment delimiters of the appropriate
   language for the file.

   Examples:

        /* MyProgram.c, @format.tab-size 4 */

        // MyProgram.cpp, @format.tab-size 3
        //                @format.use-tabs true

        <!-- MyPage.html, @format.tab-size 2 -->

        REM MyProgram.bas, @format.tab-size 8

        { MyProgram.pas, @format.tab-size 4 }

        ; MyProgram.asm, @format.tab-size 4

        # MyProgram.mak, @format.tab-size 4

        /**
         * MyProgram.java, JavaDoc comment
         * @author              R. R. Swindell
         * @version             1.00
         * @format.tab-size     4
         * @format.new-line     crlf
         */

   Since the comment delimiters are not part of the header format,
   PT/SC headers are not restricted to a specific set of programming or
   scripting languages and should remain compatible with any future
   languages provided they allow for free-form in-line comments.

   NOTE 1: PT/SC headers in source code files define formatting
   parameters for the display, editing, or printing of the source code
   itself and not the output of the resulting program or script.
   Although certain languages (e.g. HTML) could benefit from a
   standardized method of specifying formatting parameters for output
   (specifically tab-size/tab-stops), such a definition is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   NOTE 2: The PT/SC literal token, "@format." may be present in source
   code files without accidental interpretation as a PT/SC header by
   nesting the character string in quotes or the appropriate string
   delimiters for the language (the header format requires this token
   be located at the beginning of the file or immediately following a
   line-feed, space, or horizontal-tab character).

6. Format Variables

   Supported PT/SC Format Variables:

   tab-size
   tab-stops
   indent-size
   line-length
   new-line
   use-tabs

   If any of the supported format variables are not specified by a
   PT/SC header in a file, the value of the corresponding format
   parameter (if supported by the application) SHALL be left in its
   default or user-configured state unless otherwise noted.

   NOTE: Format variable names SHALL NOT be case sensitive (i.e. "tab-
   size" and "TAB-Size" are both valid format variable names).


6.1 tab-size

   The <tab-size> variable was the initial inspiration for the PT/SC
   header and remains its primary purpose.  The <tab-size> variable is
   used to specify the symmetric offset of each tab-stop in the file
   (in non-proportional character widths).

   Syntax: @format.tab-size<white-space><value>

        Where <value> is a positive decimal (base 10) number in the
        range of 1 to 60.

   Example: @format.tab-size 4

        Would result in tab-stops at offsets (from the beginning of
        each line) of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.

   If asymmetric tab-stops are supported by the application and the
   <tab-stops> variable is defined, the application SHALL ignore any
   definition of the <tab-size> variable and use the values specified
   for the <tab-stops> variable instead.

Internet Draft    Plain Text/Source Code File Header    September 1999


6.2 tab-stops

   The <tab-stops> variable is to be used in files that utilize
   asymmetric tab-stops.  The <tab-size> variable MAY still be
   specified as a back up in the case of applications that do not
   support asymmetric tab-stops.

   Syntax: @format.tab-stops<white-space><value><white-space><value>...

        Where each <value> is a positive decimal (base 10) number in
        the range of 1 to 255, increasing in order (e.g. 4 8 10).  A
        minimum of two (2) values MUST be specified.  A maximum of
        forty (40) values may be specified.  All values MUST be
        separated by white-space.

   Any tab-stops on a line beyond the offset of the last specified tab-
   stop MUST be interpreted as symmetric tab-stops with the width
   determined by the difference of the last two (2) specified tab-
   stops.

   Example: @format.tab-stops 4 8 10

        Would result in tab-stops at offsets (from the beginning of
        each line) of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, etc.

   If all tab-stops are symmetric, this variable MUST NOT be specified
   and the <tab-size> variable MUST be specified instead.


6.3 indent-size

   The <indent-size> variable is used in cases where the editor
   supports an indent-size configuration option and it has been
   configured with a value different than the configured tab-size.  The
   <indent-size> variable is used to specify the symmetric offset of
   each indent-stop in the file (in non-proportional character widths).
   Indent-stops are very similar to symmetric tab-stops, except that
   they are used only in the editing of the file; they are not used in
   the display or printing of the file.  If the <indent-size> variable
   is specified and the editor is configured to use horizontal-tab
   characters, it MUST use a combination of horizontal-tab and space
   characters to indent the proper number of character positions when
   the tab key is pressed.  If the editor supports an indent-size
   configuration option, but the <indent-size> variable has not been
   specified and the <tab-size> variable has, the indent-size option
   shall be set the value specified for the <tab-size> variable.

   Syntax: @format.indent-size<white-space><value>

        Where <value> is a positive decimal (base 10) number in range
        of 1 to 60.

   Example: @format.ident-size 4

Internet Draft    Plain Text/Source Code File Header    September 1999



6.4 line-length

   The <line-length> variable is used to specify the maximum allowable
   individual line length (excluding any end-of-line character
   sequences).  It is used in cases where the editor has been
   configured to enforce a right-hand margin.  In cases where the
   editor does not support a right margin, it may be specified by the
   author to notify the file's co-authors of the desired maximum line
   length.

   Syntax: @format.line-length<white-space><value>

        Where <value> is a positive decimal (base 10) number in the
        range of 1 to 255.

   Example: @format.line-length 79


6.5 new-line

   The <new-line> variable is used to specify the character sequence
   that signifies the end-of-line.  This character sequence will be
   used to determine the end of each line when the file is read and to
   terminate individual lines when the file is printed or written to
   disk.

   Syntax: @format.new-line<white-space><value>

        Where <value> is one or more decimal (base 10) numbers in the
        range of 0 to 255 or hexadecimal (base 16) numbers (signified
        by a "0x" prefix) in the range of 0x00 to 0xff.  A maximum of
        forty (40) values may be specified.  If multiple numeric values
        are specified, they must be separated by white-space.

        The keywords "CR" and "LF" may also be used in place of a
        numeric value to signify the carriage-return (ASCII 13) and
        line-feed (ASCII 10) characters respectively.  If the "CR" and
        "LF" keywords are used, they need not be separated by white-
        space.  The keywords are not case sensitive.

   Example: @format.new-line lf

        Would result in lines being terminated by the ASCII line-feed
        character upon input or output.

   Example: @format.new-line crlf

        Would result in lines being terminated by the ASCII carriage-
        return/line-feed character sequence upon input or output.

Internet Draft    Plain Text/Source Code File Header    September 1999


6.6 use-tabs

   The <use-tabs> variable is used to specify whether the editor was
   configured to write horizontal-tab (ASCII 9) characters to the file
   or use the appropriate number of space (ASCII 32) characters in
   place of each horizontal-tab character (see section 3.2).

   Syntax: @format.use-tabs<white-space><value>

        Where <value> is one of the following keywords (without
        quotes): "TRUE", "FALSE", "ON", "OFF", "YES", or "NO".

        The keywords "TRUE", "ON", and "YES" specify that horizontal-
        tab characters are to be written to the file.  The keywords
        "FALSE", "OFF", and "NO" specify that the appropriate number of
        space characters are to be used in place of each horizontal-tab
        character when the file is read from or written to disk.  The
        keywords are not case sensitive.

   Example: @format.use-tabs true


7. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) and Core Rules as described in RFC 2234 [3].

   file     = [header] *(*CHAR [escape header])

   header   = "@format." variable values

   escape   = WSP / LF

   variable = "tab-size" / "tab-stops" / "indent-size" /
              "line-length" / "new-line" / "use-tabs"

   values   = 1*40((1*WSP) value)

   value    = numeric / keyword

   numeric  = 1*3DIGIT / ("0x" 1*2HEXDIG)

   keyword  = "true" / "false" / "on" / "off" / "yes" / "no" /
              "cr" / "lf"


8. Security Considerations

   There are no known security issues with the solution proposed in
   this document.
