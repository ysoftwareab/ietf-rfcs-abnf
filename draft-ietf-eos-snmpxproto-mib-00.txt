1.  The SNMP Management Framework

  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
  components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
       1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
       in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
       STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
       the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
       track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
       [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
       message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
       [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
       [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
       in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
  can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is ;'ant to the SMIv2.  A
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
  MIB.

2. Introduction


   Traditionally, features have been added to SNMP by developing a new
   version of the protocol that supports these new features. Currently,
   SNMP entities that conform to [RFC 2571] are expected to  implement
   all the protocol functionality defined by the standards.

   The idea, moving forward, is to add features to SNMP in a more
   modular fashion and without necessarily increasing the version
   number.  Since the protocol version number is no longer sufficient
   information to determine which protocol features an SNMP entity
   supports, another method is required.  This memo defines a MIB to be
   used to determine the SNMP capabilities of an SNMP entity, above and
   beyond the base features of its protocol version.

   Requirements of this feature are:
     o It must be easy to determine the features that an SNMP entity
       supports;
     o It MUST be extensible so that vendor defined features may appear
       in the capabilities list.

   This feature is not required to:

     o List base features of the SNMPv3 protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3. Extended Protocol Management

3.1 Standard Extensions

   Standard protocol extensions are those extensions that are developed
   within the IETF and published in standards track RFCs.

3.2 Vendor Extensions

   Vendor Extensions are proprietary protocol extensions developed by a
   particular vendor.  They are not part of standard SNMP, and should
   not be positioned as such.

3.3 Interoperability

   An SNMP entity MUST only issue a response using an extended protocol
   feature if it received the request using the extended protocol
   feature.

   If an SNMP entity receives an extended protocol feature it does not
   understand, it MUST follow the unknown PDU response mechanism as

                       SNMP Extended Protocol MIB             April 2001


   defined in [RFC2262] section 4.2.2.1

3.4 Relation to Agent Capabilities

   Agent capability statements are used when describing capabilities of
   agents with respect to object definitions.  The extended protocol
   MIB is used when describing the capabilities of agents with respect
   to protocol operations.

4. MIB Overview

   The SNMP Extended Protocol MIB consists of snmpXProtoStandard to
   indicate which standard PDU extensions are supported and
   snmpXProtoVendorTable to indicate which vendor extensions are
   supported.

6 IANA Considerations

   IANASnmpExtendedProtocol is a bitmap which indicates which standard
   extensions to SNMP an SNMP entity supports.  It may be given out for
   SNMP protocol extensions published as standards track RFCs.

7. Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB
   is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.
