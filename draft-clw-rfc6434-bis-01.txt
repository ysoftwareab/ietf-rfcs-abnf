                         IPv6 Node Requirements
                        draft-clw-rfc6434-bis-01

Abstract

   This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes.  It is expected
   that IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and situations.
   Specifying the requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6 to function
   well and interoperate in a large number of situations and
   deployments.

   This document obsoletes RFC 6434, and in turn RFC 4294.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines common functionality required from both IPv6
   hosts and routers.  Many IPv6 nodes will implement optional or
   additional features, but this document collects and summarizes
   requirements from other published Standards Track documents in one
   place.

   This document tries to avoid discussion of protocol details and
   references RFCs for this purpose.  This document is intended to be an
   applicability statement and to provide guidance as to which IPv6
   specifications should be implemented in the general case and which
   specifications may be of interest to specific deployment scenarios.
   This document does not update any individual protocol document RFCs.

   Although this document points to different specifications, it should
   be noted that in many cases, the granularity of a particular



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   requirement will be smaller than a single specification, as many
   specifications define multiple, independent pieces, some of which may
   not be mandatory.  In addition, most specifications define both
   client and server behavior in the same specification, while many
   implementations will be focused on only one of those roles.

   This document defines a minimal level of requirement needed for a
   device to provide useful internet service and considers a broad range
   of device types and deployment scenarios.  Because of the wide range
   of deployment scenarios, the minimal requirements specified in this
   document may not be sufficient for all deployment scenarios.  It is
   perfectly reasonable (and indeed expected) for other profiles to
   define additional or stricter requirements appropriate for specific
   usage and deployment environments.  For example, this document does
   not mandate that all clients support DHCP, but some deployment
   scenarios may deem it appropriate to make such a requirement.  For
   example, government agencies in the USA have defined profiles for
   specialized requirements for IPv6 in target environments (see
   [USGv6]).

   As it is not always possible for an implementer to know the exact
   usage of IPv6 in a node, an overriding requirement for IPv6 nodes is
   that they should adhere to Jon Postel's Robustness Principle: "Be
   conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
   others" [RFC0793].

1.1.  Scope of This Document

   IPv6 covers many specifications.  It is intended that IPv6 will be
   deployed in many different situations and environments.  Therefore,
   it is important to develop requirements for IPv6 nodes to ensure
   interoperability.

   This document assumes that all IPv6 nodes meet the minimum
   requirements specified here.

1.2.  Description of IPv6 Nodes

   From the Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification [RFC2460],
   we have the following definitions:

   IPv6 node   - a device that implements IPv6.
   IPv6 router - a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly
                 addressed to itself.
   IPv6 host   - any node that is not a router.

   **BIS We will need to refer to 2460-bis, as well as 1981-bis and
   4291-bis, throughout this document.  These are still in flux, but we

   will know the final versions of these documents before this -bis is
   published, so can adapt text here once those updates are complete.**

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Sub-IP Layer

   An IPv6 node must include support for one or more IPv6 link-layer
   specifications.  Which link-layer specifications an implementation
   should include will depend upon what link-layers are supported by the
   hardware available on the system.  It is possible for a conformant
   IPv6 node to support IPv6 on some of its interfaces and not on
   others.

   As IPv6 is run over new layer 2 technologies, it is expected that new
   specifications will be issued.  In the following, we list some of the
   layer 2 technologies for which an IPv6 specification has been
   developed.  It is provided for informational purposes only and may
   not be complete.

   -  Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks [RFC2464]

   -  IPv6 over ATM Networks [RFC2492]

   -  Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Frame Relay Networks
      Specification [RFC2590]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   -  Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 1394 Networks [RFC3146]

   -  Transmission of IPv6, IPv4, and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
      Packets over Fibre Channel [RFC4338]

   -  Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks [RFC4944]

   -  Transmission of IPv6 via the IPv6 Convergence Sublayer over IEEE
      802.16 Networks [RFC5121]

   -  IP version 6 over PPP [RFC5072]

   -  IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks [RFC4944]

   In addition to traditional physical link-layers, it is also possible
   to tunnel IPv6 over other protocols.  Examples include:

   -  Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address
      Translations (NATs) [RFC4380]

   -  Section 3 of "Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and
      Routers" [RFC4213]

   **BIS Do we want a small section somewhere on UDP IPv6 tunneling, and
   issues like RFC 6935, or 6936?**

5.  IP Layer

5.1.  Internet Protocol Version 6 - RFC 2460

   The Internet Protocol Version 6 is specified in [RFC2460].  This
   specification MUST be supported.

   **BIS Again, update for RFC 2460 -bis **

   Any unrecognized extension headers or options MUST be processed as
   described in RFC 2460.

   The node MUST follow the packet transmission rules in RFC 2460.

   Nodes MUST always be able to send, receive, and process fragment
   headers.  All conformant IPv6 implementations MUST be capable of
   sending and receiving IPv6 packets; the forwarding functionality MAY
   be supported.  Overlapping fragments MUST be handled as described in
   [RFC5722].

   [RFC6946] discusses IPv6 atomic fragments, and recommends that IPv6
   atomic fragments are processed independently of any other fragments,



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   to protect against fragmenttation-based attacks.  [RFC8021] goes
   further and recommends the deprecation of atomic fragments.  Nodes
   thus MUST not generate atomic fragments.

   To mitigate a variety of potential attacks, nodes SHOULD avoid using
   predictable fragment Identification values in Fragment Headers, as
   discussed in [RFC7739].

   RFC 2460 specifies extension headers and the processing for these
   headers.

   An IPv6 node MUST be able to process these headers.  An exception is
   Routing Header type 0 (RH0), which was deprecated by [RFC5095] due to
   security concerns and which MUST be treated as an unrecognized
   routing type.

   Should a new type of Extension Header need to be defined, its format
   MUST follow the consistent format described in Section 4 of
   [RFC6564].

   Further, [RFC7045] adds specific requirements for processing of
   Extension Headers, in particular that any forwarding node along an
   IPv6 packet's path, which forwards the packet for any reason, SHOULD
   do so regardless of any extension headers that are present.

   [RFC7112] discusses issues with oversized IPv6 Extension Header
   chains, and states that when a node fragments an IPv6 datagram, it
   MUST include the entire IPv6 Header Chain in the First Fragment.

   **BIS Wait to see outcome of insertion of EHs issue in 2460-bis, and
   re-state here? **

   All nodes SHOULD support the setting and use of the IPv6 Flow Label
   field as defined in the IPv6 Flow Label specification [RFC6437].
   Forwarding nodes such as routers and load distributors MUST NOT
   depend only on Flow Label values being uniformly distributed.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that source hosts support the flow label by setting the
   Flow Label field for all packets of a given flow to the same value
   chosen from an approximation to a discrete uniform distribution.

5.2.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC 4861

   Neighbor Discovery is defined in [RFC4861]; the definition was
   updated by [RFC5942].  Neighbor Discovery SHOULD be supported.  RFC
   4861 states:

      Unless specified otherwise (in a document that covers operating IP
      over a particular link type) this document applies to all link



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


      types.  However, because ND uses link-layer multicast for some of
      its services, it is possible that on some link types (e.g., Non-
      Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) links), alternative protocols or
      mechanisms to implement those services will be specified (in the
      appropriate document covering the operation of IP over a
      particular link type).  The services described in this document
      that are not directly dependent on multicast, such as Redirects,
      next-hop determination, Neighbor Unreachability Detection, etc.,
      are expected to be provided as specified in this document.  The
      details of how one uses ND on NBMA links are addressed in
      [RFC2491].

   Some detailed analysis of Neighbor Discovery follows:

   Router Discovery is how hosts locate routers that reside on an
   attached link.  Hosts MUST support Router Discovery functionality.

   Prefix Discovery is how hosts discover the set of address prefixes
   that define which destinations are on-link for an attached link.
   Hosts MUST support Prefix Discovery.

   Hosts MUST also implement Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) for
   all paths between hosts and neighboring nodes.  NUD is not required
   for paths between routers.  However, all nodes MUST respond to
   unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages.

   [RFC7048] discusses NUD, in particular cases where it behaves too
   impatiently.  It states that if a node transmits more than a certain
   number of packets, then it SHOULD use the exponential backoff of the
   retransmit timer, up to a certain threshold point.

   Hosts MUST support the sending of Router Solicitations and the
   receiving of Router Advertisements.  The ability to understand
   individual Router Advertisement options is dependent on supporting
   the functionality making use of the particular option.

   [RFC7559] discusses packet loss resliency for Router Solicitations,
   and requires that nodes MUST use a specific exponential backoff
   algorithm for RS retransmissions.

   All nodes MUST support the sending and receiving of Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.  NS and
   NA messages are required for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

   Hosts SHOULD support the processing of Redirect functionality.
   Routers MUST support the sending of Redirects, though not necessarily
   for every individual packet (e.g., due to rate limiting).  Redirects
   are only useful on networks supporting hosts.  In core networks



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   dominated by routers, Redirects are typically disabled.  The sending
   of Redirects SHOULD be disabled by default on backbone routers.  They
   MAY be enabled by default on routers intended to support hosts on
   edge networks.

   "IPv6 Host-to-Router Load Sharing" [RFC4311] includes additional
   recommendations on how to select from a set of available routers.
   [RFC4311] SHOULD be supported.

5.3.  Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes - RFC 4191

   "Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes" [RFC4191]
   provides support for nodes attached to multiple (different) networks,
   each providing routers that advertise themselves as default routers
   via Router Advertisements.  In some scenarios, one router may provide
   connectivity to destinations the other router does not, and choosing
   the "wrong" default router can result in reachability failures.  In
   such cases, RFC 4191 can help.

   Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) deployments supported by routers
   adhering to [RFC7084] use RFC 4191 to advertise routes to certain
   local destinations.  Consequently, nodes that will be deployed in
   SOHO environments SHOULD implement RFC 4191.

5.4.  SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) - RFC 3971

   SEND [RFC3971] and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs)
   [RFC3972] provide a way to secure the message exchanges of Neighbor
   Discovery.  SEND has the potential to address certain classes of
   spoofing attacks, but it does not provide specific protection for
   threats from off-link attackers.  It requires relatively heavyweight
   provisioning, so is only likely to be used in scenarios where
   security considerations are particularly important.

   There have been relatively few implementations of SEND in common
   operating systems and platforms, and thus deployment experience has
   been limited to date.

   At this time, SEND is considered optional.  Due to the complexity in
   deploying SEND, its deployment is only likely to be considered where
   nodes are operating in a particularly strict security environment.

5.5.  IPv6 Router Advertisement Flags Option - RFC 5175

   Router Advertisements include an 8-bit field of single-bit Router
   Advertisement flags.  The Router Advertisement Flags Option extends
   the number of available flag bits by 48 bits.  At the time of this
   writing, 6 of the original 8 single-bit flags have been assigned,

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   while 2 remain available for future assignment.  No flags have been
   defined that make use of the new option, and thus, strictly speaking,
   there is no requirement to implement the option today.  However,
   implementations that are able to pass unrecognized options to a
   higher-level entity that may be able to understand them (e.g., a
   user-level process using a "raw socket" facility) MAY take steps to
   handle the option in anticipation of a future usage.

5.6.  Path MTU Discovery and Packet Size

5.6.1.  Path MTU Discovery - RFC 1981

   "Path MTU Discovery for IP version 6" [RFC1981] SHOULD be supported.
   From [RFC2460]:

      It is strongly recommended that IPv6 nodes implement Path MTU
      Discovery [RFC1981], in order to discover and take advantage of
      path MTUs greater than 1280 octets.  However, a minimal IPv6
      implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply restrict itself to
      sending packets no larger than 1280 octets, and omit
      implementation of Path MTU Discovery.

   The rules in [RFC2460] and [RFC5722] MUST be followed for packet
   fragmentation and reassembly.

   One operational issue with Path MTU Discovery occurs when firewalls
   block ICMP Packet Too Big messages.  Path MTU Discovery relies on
   such messages to determine what size messages can be successfully
   sent.  "Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery" [RFC4821] avoids
   having a dependency on Packet Too Big messages.

   **BIS Add note about 1280 MTU and UDP, as per Mark Andrews' comments
   in Berlin? **

5.7.  IPv6 Jumbograms - RFC 2675

   IPv6 Jumbograms [RFC2675] are an optional extension that allow the
   sending of IP datagrams larger than 65.535 bytes.  IPv6 Jumbograms
   make use of IPv6 hop-by-hop options and are only suitable on paths in
   which every hop and link are capable of supporting Jumbograms (e.g.,
   within a campus or datacenter).  To date, few implementations exist,
   and there is essentially no reported experience from usage.
   Consequently, IPv6 Jumbograms [RFC2675] remain optional at this time.

   **BIS Are these used?  Do we need to modify the text for that? **

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


5.8.  ICMP for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) - RFC 4443

   ICMPv6 [RFC4443] MUST be supported.  "Extended ICMP to Support Multi-
   Part Messages" [RFC4884] MAY be supported.

5.9.  Addressing

5.9.1.  IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture - RFC 4291

   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291] MUST be supported.

   **BIS Update to 4291-bis **

   **BIS Add note on Why /64?  RFC 7421, after the conclusion of the
   RFC4291-bis (lengthy!!!) discussions on the 64-bit IID topic.  But no
   need for /127 p2p text RFC 6164.  And no need for note on IID
   significance, as per RFC 7136. **

5.9.2.  Host Address Availability Recommendations

   Hosts may be configured with addresses through a variety of methods,
   including SLAAC, DHCPv6, or manual configuration.

   [RFC7934] recommends that networks provide general-purpose end hosts
   with multiple global IPv6 addresses when they attach, and it
   describes the benefits of and the options for doing so.  There are,
   for example, benefits to multiple addresses for privacy reasons, or
   to assigning hosts a whole /64 to avoid the need for host-based NAT.

5.9.3.  IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration - RFC 4862

   Hosts MUST support IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration as
   defined in either [RFC4862] or [RFC7217].  It is recommended that,
   unless there is a specific requirement for MAC addresses to be
   embedded in an IID, nodes follow the procedure in RFC7217 to generate
   SLAAC-based addresses.  Addresses generated through RFC7217 will be
   the same whenever a given device (re)appears on the same subnet (with
   a specific IPv6 prefix), but the IID will vary on each subnet
   visited.

   Nodes that are routers MUST be able to generate link-local addresses
   as described in [RFC4862].

   From RFC 4862:

      The autoconfiguration process specified in this document applies
      only to hosts and not routers.  Since host autoconfiguration uses
      information advertised by routers, routers will need to be



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


      configured by some other means.  However, it is expected that
      routers will generate link-local addresses using the mechanism
      described in this document.  In addition, routers are expected to
      successfully pass the Duplicate Address Detection procedure
      described in this document on all addresses prior to assigning
      them to an interface.

   All nodes MUST implement Duplicate Address Detection.  Quoting from
   Section 5.4 of RFC 4862:

      Duplicate Address Detection MUST be performed on all unicast
      addresses prior to assigning them to an interface, regardless of
      whether they are obtained through stateless autoconfiguration,
      DHCPv6, or manual configuration, with the following [exceptions
      noted therein].

   "Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for IPv6" [RFC4429]
   specifies a mechanism to reduce delays associated with generating
   addresses via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862].  RFC
   4429 was developed in conjunction with Mobile IPv6 in order to reduce
   the time needed to acquire and configure addresses as devices quickly
   move from one network to another, and it is desirable to minimize
   transition delays.  For general purpose devices, RFC 4429 remains
   optional at this time.

   [RFC7527] discusses enhanced DAD, and describes an algorithm to
   automate the detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used by DAD.
   Nodes SHOULD implement this behaviour where such detection is
   beneficial.

5.9.4.  Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6 - RFC 4941

   A node using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to form a
   globally unique IPv6 address using its MAC address to generate the
   IID will see that IID remain the same on any visited network, even
   though the network prefix part changes.  Thus it is possible for 3rd
   party devices such nodes communicate with to track the activities of
   the node as it moves around the network.  Privacy Extensions for
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4941] address this concern by
   allowing nodes to configure an additional temporary address where the
   IID is effectively randomly generated.  Privacy addresses are then
   used as source addresses for new communications initiated by the
   node.

   [RFC7721] discusses general privacy issues with IPv6 addressing.

   RFC 4941 SHOULD be supported.  In some scenarios, such as dedicated
   servers in a data center, it provides limited or no benefit, or may



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   complicate network management.  Thus devices implementing this
   specification MUST provide a way for the end user to explicitly
   enable or disable the use of such temporary addresses.

   Note that RFC4941 can be used independently of traditional SLAAC, or
   of RFC7217-based SLAAC.

   Implementers of RFC 4941 should be aware that certain addresses are
   reserved and should not be chosen for use as temporary addresses.
   Consult "Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers" [RFC5453] for more
   details.

5.9.5.  Default Address Selection for IPv6 - RFC 6724

   IPv6 nodes will invariably have multiple addresses configured
   simultaneously, and thus will need to choose which addresses to use
   for which communications.  The rules specified in the Default Address
   Selection for IPv6 [RFC6724] document MUST be implemented.

5.9.6.  Stateful Address Autoconfiguration (DHCPv6) - RFC 3315

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] can be used to obtain and configure addresses.  In
   general, a network may provide for the configuration of addresses
   through Router Advertisements, DHCPv6, or both.  There will be a wide
   range of IPv6 deployment models and differences in address assignment
   requirements, some of which may require DHCPv6 for stateful address
   assignment.  Consequently, all hosts SHOULD implement address
   configuration via DHCPv6.

   In the absence of a router, IPv6 nodes using DHCP for address
   assignment MAY initiate DHCP to obtain IPv6 addresses and other
   configuration information, as described in Section 5.5.2 of
   [RFC4862].

5.10.  Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6

   **BIS MLDv2 only?

   Nodes that need to join multicast groups MUST support MLDv1
   [RFC2710].  MLDv1 is needed by any node that is expected to receive
   and process multicast traffic.  Note that Neighbor Discovery (as used
   on most link types -- see Section 5.2) depends on multicast and
   requires that nodes join Solicited Node multicast addresses.

   MLDv2 [RFC3810] extends the functionality of MLDv1 by supporting
   Source-Specific Multicast.  The original MLDv2 protocol [RFC3810]
   supporting Source-Specific Multicast [RFC4607] supports two types of
   "filter modes".  Using an INCLUDE filter, a node indicates a



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   multicast group along with a list of senders for the group from which
   it wishes to receive traffic.  Using an EXCLUDE filter, a node
   indicates a multicast group along with a list of senders from which
   it wishes to exclude receiving traffic.  In practice, operations to
   block source(s) using EXCLUDE mode are rarely used but add
   considerable implementation complexity to MLDv2.  Lightweight MLDv2
   [RFC5790] is a simplified subset of the original MLDv2 specification
   that omits EXCLUDE filter mode to specify undesired source(s).

   Nodes SHOULD implement either MLDv2 [RFC3810] or Lightweight MLDv2
   [RFC5790].  Specifically, nodes supporting applications using Source-
   Specific Multicast that expect to take advantage of MLDv2's EXCLUDE
   functionality [RFC3810] MUST support MLDv2 as defined in [RFC3810],
   [RFC4604], and [RFC4607].  Nodes supporting applications that expect
   to only take advantage of MLDv2's INCLUDE functionality as well as
   Any-Source Multicast will find it sufficient to support Lightweight
   MLDv2 as defined in [RFC5790].

   If a node only supports applications that use Any-Source Multicast
   (i.e, they do not use Source-Specific Multicast), implementing MLDv1
   [RFC2710] is sufficient.  In all cases, however, nodes are strongly
   encouraged to implement MLDv2 or Lightweight MLDv2 rather than MLDv1,
   as the presence of a single MLDv1 participant on a link requires that
   all other nodes on the link operate in version 1 compatibility mode.

   When MLDv1 is used, the rules in the Source Address Selection for the
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Protocol [RFC3590] MUST be
   followed.

6.  DHCP versus Router Advertisement Options for Host Configuration

   **BIS this section probably needs rewriting **

   In IPv6, there are two main protocol mechanisms for propagating
   configuration information to hosts: Router Advertisements (RAs) and
   DHCP.  Historically, RA options have been restricted to those deemed
   essential for basic network functioning and for which all nodes are
   configured with exactly the same information.  Examples include the
   Prefix Information Options, the MTU option, etc.  On the other hand,
   DHCP has generally been preferred for configuration of more general
   parameters and for parameters that may be client-specific.  That
   said, identifying the exact line on whether a particular option
   should be configured via DHCP versus an RA option has not always been
   easy.  Generally speaking, however, there has been a desire to define
   only one mechanism for configuring a given option, rather than
   defining multiple (different) ways of configuring the same
   information.




Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   One issue with having multiple ways of configuring the same
   information is that interoperability suffers if a host chooses one
   mechanism but the network operator chooses a different mechanism.
   For "closed" environments, where the network operator has significant
   influence over what devices connect to the network and thus what
   configuration mechanisms they support, the operator may be able to
   ensure that a particular mechanism is supported by all connected
   hosts.  In more open environments, however, where arbitrary devices
   may connect (e.g., a WIFI hotspot), problems can arise.  To maximize
   interoperability in such environments, hosts would need to implement
   multiple configuration mechanisms to ensure interoperability.

7.  DNS and DHCP

7.1.  DNS

   DNS is described in [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC3363], and [RFC3596].
   Not all nodes will need to resolve names; those that will never need
   to resolve DNS names do not need to implement resolver functionality.
   However, the ability to resolve names is a basic infrastructure
   capability on which applications rely, and most nodes will need to
   provide support.  All nodes SHOULD implement stub-resolver [RFC1034]
   functionality, as in [RFC1034], Section 5.3.1, with support for:

   -  AAAA type Resource Records [RFC3596];

   -  reverse addressing in ip6.arpa using PTR records [RFC3596];

   -  Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) [RFC2671] to allow for DNS
      packet sizes larger than 512 octets.

   Those nodes are RECOMMENDED to support DNS security extensions
   [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035].

   A6 Resource Records, which were only ever defined with Experimental
   status in [RFC3363], are now classified as Historic, as per
   [RFC6563].

   **BIS Add DNS-SD? **

7.2.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) - RFC 3315

7.2.1.  Other Configuration Information

   IPv6 nodes use DHCP [RFC3315] to obtain address configuration
   information (see Section 5.9.6) and to obtain additional (non-
   address) configuration.  If a host implementation supports
   applications or other protocols that require configuration that is



Chown, et al.          Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   only available via DHCP, hosts SHOULD implement DHCP.  For
   specialized devices on which no such configuration need is present,
   DHCP may not be necessary.

   An IPv6 node can use the subset of DHCP (described in [RFC3736]) to
   obtain other configuration information.

7.2.2.  Use of Router Advertisements in Managed Environments

   Nodes using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
   are expected to determine their default router information and on-
   link prefix information from received Router Advertisements.  There
   is no defined DHCPv6 Gateway option.

7.3.  IPv6 Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration - RFC 6106

   Router Advertisements have historically limited options to those that
   are critical to basic IPv6 functioning.  Originally, DNS
   configuration was not included as an RA option, and DHCP was the
   recommended way to obtain DNS configuration information.  Over time,
   the thinking surrounding such an option has evolved.  It is now
   generally recognized that few nodes can function adequately without
   having access to a working DNS resolver.  [RFC5006] was published as
   an Experimental document in 2007, and recently, a revised version was
   placed on the Standards Track [RFC6106].

   Implementations SHOULD implement the DNS RA option [RFC6106].

8.  IPv4 Support and Transition

   IPv6 nodes MAY support IPv4.

8.1.  Transition Mechanisms

8.1.1.  Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers - RFC
        4213

   If an IPv6 node implements dual stack and tunneling, then [RFC4213]
   MUST be supported.

9.  Application Support

9.1.  Textual Representation of IPv6 Addresses - RFC 5952

   Software that allows users and operators to input IPv6 addresses in
   text form SHOULD support "A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text
   Representation" [RFC5952].

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


9.2.  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

   There are a number of IPv6-related APIs.  This document does not
   mandate the use of any, because the choice of API does not directly
   relate to on-the-wire behavior of protocols.  Implementers, however,
   would be advised to consider providing a common API or reviewing
   existing APIs for the type of functionality they provide to
   applications.

   "Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6" [RFC3493] provides IPv6
   functionality used by typical applications.  Implementers should note
   that RFC3493 has been picked up and further standardized by the
   Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) [POSIX].

   "Advanced Sockets Application Program Interface (API) for IPv6"
   [RFC3542] provides access to advanced IPv6 features needed by
   diagnostic and other more specialized applications.

   "IPv6 Socket API for Source Address Selection" [RFC5014] provides
   facilities that allow an application to override the default Source
   Address Selection rules of [RFC6724].

   "Socket Interface Extensions for Multicast Source Filters" [RFC3678]
   provides support for expressing source filters on multicast group
   memberships.

   "Extension to Sockets API for Mobile IPv6" [RFC4584] provides
   application support for accessing and enabling Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275]
   features.

10.  Cellular Host

   IPv6 for 3GPP [RFC7066] lists IPv6 Functionalities that need to be
   implemented above and beyond the recommendations in this document.
   Additionally a 3GPP IPv6 Host MAY implement [RFC7278] for delivering
   IPv6 prefixes on the LAN link.

11.  Security

   This section describes the specification for security for IPv6 nodes.

   Achieving security in practice is a complex undertaking.  Operational
   procedures, protocols, key distribution mechanisms, certificate
   management approaches, etc., are all components that impact the level
   of security actually achieved in practice.  More importantly,
   deficiencies or a poor fit in any one individual component can
   significantly reduce the overall effectiveness of a particular
   security approach.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   IPsec provides channel security at the Internet layer, making it
   possible to provide secure communication for all (or a subset of)
   communication flows at the IP layer between pairs of internet nodes.
   IPsec provides sufficient flexibility and granularity that individual
   TCP connections can (selectively) be protected, etc.

   Although IPsec can be used with manual keying in some cases, such
   usage has limited applicability and is not recommended.

   A range of security technologies and approaches proliferate today
   (e.g., IPsec, Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure SHell (SSH),
   etc.)  No one approach has emerged as an ideal technology for all
   needs and environments.  Moreover, IPsec is not viewed as the ideal
   security technology in all cases and is unlikely to displace the
   others.

   Previously, IPv6 mandated implementation of IPsec and recommended the
   key management approach of IKE.  This document updates that
   recommendation by making support of the IPsec Architecture [RFC4301]
   a SHOULD for all IPv6 nodes.  Note that the IPsec Architecture
   requires (e.g., Section 4.5 of RFC 4301) the implementation of both
   manual and automatic key management.  Currently, the default
   automated key management protocol to implement is IKEv2 [RFC5996].

   This document recognizes that there exists a range of device types
   and environments where approaches to security other than IPsec can be
   justified.  For example, special-purpose devices may support only a
   very limited number or type of applications, and an application-
   specific security approach may be sufficient for limited management
   or configuration capabilities.  Alternatively, some devices may run
   on extremely constrained hardware (e.g., sensors) where the full
   IPsec Architecture is not justified.

   **BIS Add note on security in IPv4-only networks?  RFC 7123?
   Relevant? **

11.1.  Requirements

   "Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol" [RFC4301] SHOULD be
   supported by all IPv6 nodes.  Note that the IPsec Architecture
   requires (e.g., Section 4.5 of [RFC4301]) the implementation of both
   manual and automatic key management.  Currently, the default
   automated key management protocol to implement is IKEv2.  As required
   in [RFC4301], IPv6 nodes implementing the IPsec Architecture MUST
   implement ESP [RFC4303] and MAY implement AH [RFC4302].

11.2.  Transforms and Algorithms

   The current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for the IPsec
   Architecture are defined in "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation
   Requirements For ESP and AH" [RFC4835].  IPv6 nodes implementing the
   IPsec Architecture MUST conform to the requirements in [RFC4835].
   Preferred cryptographic algorithms often change more frequently than
   security protocols.  Therefore, implementations MUST allow for
   migration to new algorithms, as RFC 4835 is replaced or updated in
   the future.

   **BIS update to 7321bis**

   The current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for IKEv2 are
   defined in "Cryptographic Algorithms for Use in the Internet Key
   Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)" [RFC4307].  IPv6 nodes implementing IKEv2
   MUST conform to the requirements in [RFC4307] and/or any future
   updates or replacements to [RFC4307].

   **BIS update to 4307bis**

12.  Router-Specific Functionality

   This section defines general host considerations for IPv6 nodes that
   act as routers.  Currently, this section does not discuss routing-
   specific requirements; for the case of typical home routers,
   [RFC7084] defines basic requirements for customer edge routers.

   **BIS Sync here with work by John Brzozowski et al. in draft-ali-
   ipv6rtr-reqs-02**

12.1.  IPv6 Router Alert Option - RFC 2711

   The IPv6 Router Alert Option [RFC2711] is an optional IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
   Header that is used in conjunction with some protocols (e.g., RSVP
   [RFC2205] or Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC2710]).  The
   Router Alert option will need to be implemented whenever protocols
   that mandate its usage (e.g., MLD) are implemented.  See
   Section 5.10.

12.2.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC 4861

   Sending Router Advertisements and processing Router Solicitations
   MUST be supported.

   Section 7 of [RFC6275] includes some mobility-specific extensions to
   Neighbor Discovery.  Routers SHOULD implement Sections 7.3 and 7.5,
   even if they do not implement Home Agent functionality.

12.3.  Stateful Address Autoconfiguration (DHCPv6) - RFC 3315

   A single DHCP server ([RFC3315] or [RFC4862]) can provide
   configuration information to devices directly attached to a shared
   link, as well as to devices located elsewhere within a site.
   Communication between a client and a DHCP server located on different
   links requires the use of DHCP relay agents on routers.

   In simple deployments, consisting of a single router and either a
   single LAN or multiple LANs attached to the single router, together
   with a WAN connection, a DHCP server embedded within the router is
   one common deployment scenario (e.g., [RFC7084]).  However, there is
   no need for relay agents in such scenarios.

   In more complex deployment scenarios, such as within enterprise or
   service provider networks, the use of DHCP requires some level of
   configuration, in order to configure relay agents, DHCP servers, etc.
   In such environments, the DHCP server might even be run on a
   traditional server, rather than as part of a router.

   Because of the wide range of deployment scenarios, support for DHCP
   server functionality on routers is optional.  However, routers
   targeted for deployment within more complex scenarios (as described
   above) SHOULD support relay agent functionality.  Note that "Basic
   Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers" [RFC7084] requires
   implementation of a DHCPv6 server function in IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
   routers.

13.  Network Management

   Network management MAY be supported by IPv6 nodes.  However, for IPv6
   nodes that are embedded devices, network management may be the only
   possible way of controlling these nodes.

   **BIS This is a little thin.  Add Netconf, restconf, yang models? **

   **BIS add the network polling/syslod nd for none DHCPv6 network

17.  Appendix: Changes from RFC 6434

   There have been many editorial clarifications as well as significant
   additions and updates.  While this section highlights some of the
   changes, readers should not rely on this section for a comprehensive
   list of all changes.

   1.  Added 6LoWPAN to link layers

   2.  Removed DOD IPv6 Profile updates

   3.  Removed IPv6 Mobility RFC6275

18.  Appendix: Changes from RFC 4294

   There have been many editorial clarifications as well as significant
   additions and updates.  While this section highlights some of the
   changes, readers should not rely on this section for a comprehensive
   list of all changes.

   1.   Updated the Introduction to indicate that this document is an
        applicability statement and is aimed at general nodes.

   2.   Significantly updated the section on Mobility protocols, adding
        references and downgrading previous SHOULDs to MAYs.

   3.   Changed Sub-IP Layer section to just list relevant RFCs, and
        added some more RFCs.

   4.   Added section on SEND (it is a MAY).

   5.   Revised section on Privacy Extensions [RFC4941] to add more
        nuance to recommendation.

   6.   Completely revised IPsec/IKEv2 section, downgrading overall
        recommendation to a SHOULD.

   7.   Upgraded recommendation of DHCPv6 to SHOULD.

   8.   Added background section on DHCP versus RA options, added SHOULD
        recommendation for DNS configuration via RAs [RFC6106], and
        cleaned up DHCP recommendations.

   9.   Added recommendation that routers implement Sections 7.3 and 7.5
        of [RFC6275].

   10.  Added pointer to subnet clarification document [RFC5942].

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Node Requirements               March 2017


   11.  Added text that "IPv6 Host-to-Router Load Sharing" [RFC4311]
        SHOULD be implemented.

   12.  Added reference to [RFC5722] (Overlapping Fragments), and made
        it a MUST to implement.

   13.  Made "A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation"
        [RFC5952] a SHOULD.

   14.  Removed mention of "DNAME" from the discussion about [RFC3363].

   15.  Numerous updates to reflect newer versions of IPv6 documents,
        including [RFC4443], [RFC4291], [RFC3596], and [RFC4213].

   16.  Removed discussion of "Managed" and "Other" flags in RAs.  There
        is no consensus at present on how to process these flags, and
        discussion of their semantics was removed in the most recent
        update of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862].

   17.  Added many more references to optional IPv6 documents.

   18.  Made "A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation"
        [RFC5952] a SHOULD.

   19.  Added reference to [RFC5722] (Overlapping Fragments), and made
        it a MUST to implement.

   20.  Updated MLD section to include reference to Lightweight MLD
        [RFC5790].

   21.  Added SHOULD recommendation for "Default Router Preferences and
        More-Specific Routes" [RFC4191].

   22.  Made "IPv6 Flow Label Specification" [RFC6437] a SHOULD.
