1.  Introduction

   Content delivery over HTTPS using one or more CDNs along the path
   requires credential management.  This is specifically needed when an
   entity delegates delivery of encrypted content to another trusted
   entity.

   Several delegation methods are currently proposed within different
   IETF working groups (refer to [I-D.fieau-cdni-https-delegation] for
   an overview of delegation works ongoing at the IETF).  They specify
   different methods for provisioning HTTPS delivery credentials.

   This document proposes an extension to the CDNI control / Triggers
   and Metadata interfaces to setup HTTPS delegation between an uCDN and
   dCDN.  Furthermore, it includes a proposal of registry to enable the
   adding of new methods in the future.

   Section 2 is about terminology used in this document.  Section 3
   presents delegation methods specified at the IETF.  Section 4
   introduces delegation metadata in CDNI.  Section 5 addresses the
   delegation methods objects.  Section 6 describes simple data types.
   Section 7 is about an IANA registry for delegation methods.
   Section 8 raises the security issues.

Internet-Draft    CDNI extensions for HTTPS delegation      January 2018


2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from CDNI framework documents such as
   CDNi framework document [RFC7336], CDNI requirements [RFC7337] and
   CDNI interface specifications documents: CDNI Metadata interface
   [RFC8006], CDNI Control interface / Triggers [RFC8007] and Logging
   interface [RFC7937].

3.  Known delegation methods

   A few methods are currently being proposed at the IETF to handle
   delegation of HTTPS delivery between entities, refer to
   [I-D.fieau-cdni-https-delegation].

   Regading the existing delegation methods, we need a common framework
   in CDNI that provides new requirements on the CDNI interfaces.

   This document considers the following methods supporting HTTPS
   delegation.  It may be used between two or more CDNs with applicable
   interface support following the CDNI framework, such as the CI/
   Triggers and Metadata Interface:

   - Sub-certificates [I-D.rescorla-tls-subcerts]

   - Short-term certificates in ACME using STAR API [I-D.ietf-acme-star]

4.  Extending the CDNI metadata model

4.1.  SecureDelegation object

   We suggest reusing the PathMetadata object by adding a new
   "SecureDelegation" object containing a "supportedDelegationMethods"
   property.

   Property: supportedDelegationMethods

      type: Array

      Description: List of delegation method(s) types that are enabled
      between a uCDN and a dCDN (ex.  "MI.SubcertsDelegationMethod",
      "MI.AcmeStarDelegationMethod", etc.), as defined in the next
      section.

   Example:

   As an example, the PathMatch object can reference a path-metadata
   that would point at the delegation information.  Delegation metadata
   are added to PathMetaData object.

Internet-Draft    CDNI extensions for HTTPS delegation      January 2018


  PathMatch:
  {
   "path-pattern": {
        "pattern": "/movies/*",
        "case-sensitive": true
   },
   "path-metadata": {
     "type": "MI.PathMetadata",
        "href": "https://metadata.ucdn.example/video.example.com/movies"
   }
  }

  PathMetaData Object related to /movie/*

  PathMetadata:
  {
   "metadata": [
    {
    "generic-metadata-type": "MI.TimeWindowACL",
    "generic-metadata-value": {
     "times": [
      "windows": [
      {
       "start": "1213948800",
       "end": "1478047392"
      }
     ],
     "action": "allow",
    }},
    {
    "generic-metadata-type": "MI.SecureDelegation"
    "generic-metadata-type": {
     "supportedDelegationMethods": ["MI.AcmeStarDelegationMethod"],
    }
    }
   ]
  }


   The existence of the "MI.SecureDelegation" object in a PathMetaData
   Object shall enable the use of one of the supported Methods, chosen
   by the delegate.  See next section for more details about delegation
   methods metadata specification.

4.2.  Delegation methods

   This section defines the delegation methods objects metadata.  Each
   object of the section consists in defining metadata related to the
   following steps:

   o  Bootstrapping: bootstrapping a secured delegation consists in
      providing the dCDN with enough parameters to set it up, e.g.  ACME
      servers, Key Servers, etc..

   o  Credential renewal: In case of certificates based approaches,
      [I-D.rescorla-tls-subcerts] and [I-D.ietf-acme-star], there is a
      need in CDNI to periodically provision and update credentials
      (certificates or private keys) on the dCDNs for a given delegated
      domain.

   o  Expiration/Revocation: expiration of delegation can occur for
      multiple reasons: changes in delegation rights, delegation
      validity is over.  In [I-D.rescorla-tls-subcerts] or
      [I-D.ietf-acme-star] approaches, the uCDN may implicitly enforce
      revocation and will prevent any dCDN to renew certificates, or
      access credentials, when delegation is expired.

   o  Logging: Regarding logging aspects, we consider to log usages and
      errors related to a delegated domain.  As an example, CDNI logs
      include: supported delegation method(s), credentials renewal
      requests, credential revocation notice, mutual agreement for
      selected credential method to use, credentials download status for
      a specific domain, as well as errors, related to credentials
      transfer, or crypto aspects such as bad cypher suite supports,
      revoked delegations, etc.

4.2.1.  AcmeStarDelegationMethod object

   This section defines the AcmeStarDelegationMethod object which
   describes metadata related to the use of Acme Star API presented in
   [I-D.ietf-acme-star]

   As expressed in [I-D.ietf-acme-star] and [I-D.nir-saag-star], when an
   origin has set a delegation to a specific domain (i.e. dCDN), the
   dCDN should present to the end-user client, a short-time certificate
   bound to the master certificate.

   Property: starproxy

      Type: Endpoint

Internet-Draft    CDNI extensions for HTTPS delegation      January 2018


      Description: Used to advertise the STAR Proxy to the dCDN.
      Endpoint type defined in RFC8006, section 4.3.3

   Property: acmeserver

      Type: Endpoint

      Description: used to advertise the ACME server to the dCDN.
      Endpoint type is defined in RFC8006, section 4.3.3

   Property: credentialslocationuri

      Type: Link

      Description: expresses the location of the credentials to be
      fetched by the dCDN.  Link type is as defined in RFC8006, section
      4.3.1

   Property: periodicity

      Type: Periodicity

      description: expresses the credentials renewal periodicity.  See
      next section on simple meta data type.

   As an example, AcmeStarDelegationMethod object could express the
   Acme-Star-delegation as the following:


   AcmeStarDelegationMethod: {
       "generic-metadata-type": "MI.AcmeStarDelegationMethod",
       "generic-metadata-value": {
           "starproxy": "10.2.2.2",
           "acmeserver": "10.2.3.3",
           "credentialslocationuri": "www.ucdn.com/credentials",
           "periodicity": 36000
       }
   }


4.2.2.  SubcertsDelegationMethod object

   This section defines the SubcertsDelegationMethod object which
   describes metadata related to the use of Subcerts as presented in
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-subcerts]

   As expressed in [I-D.rescorla-tls-subcerts], when an origin has set a
   delegation to a specific domain (i.e. dCDN), the dCDN should present

   the Origin or uCDN certificate or "delegated_credential" during the
   TLS handshake to the end-user client application, instead of its own
   certificate.

   Property: credentialsdelegatingentity

      Type: Endpoint

      Description: Endpoint ID (IP) of the delegating Entity (uCDN).
      Endpoint type defined in RFC8006, section 4.3.3

   Property: credentialrecipiententity

      Type: Endpoint

      Description: Endpoint ID (IP) of the delegated entity (dCDN).
      Endpoint type is defined in RFC8006, section 4.3.3

   Property: credentialslocationuri

      Type: Link

      Description: expresses the location of the credentials to be
      fetched by the dCDN.  Link type is as defined in RFC8006, section
      4.3.1

   Property: periodicity

      Type: Periodicity

      description: expresses the credentials renewal periodicity.  See
      next section on simple meta data type.

   As an example, AcmeStarDelegationMethod object could express the
   Acme-Star-delegation as the following:


   SubcertsDelegationMethod: {
       "generic-metadata-type": "MI.SubcertsDelegationMethod",
       "generic-metadata-value": {
           "credentialsdelegatingentity": "10.2.2.2",
           "credentialsrecepiententity": "10.2.3.3",
           "credentialslocationuri": "www.ucdn.com/credentials",
