Abstract 
 
   This is an initial draft for consideration by the SPEERMINT WG as a 
   candidate for the chartered work item dealing with "the minimum set of 
   requirements for SIP-based VoIP interconnection (BCP)", due in March 
   2007.  In its present form, this draft is intended solely to provide a 
   basis for WG discussion about requirements selection.  As such, it is 
   primarily structural and descriptive in nature, leaving prescriptive 
   content to later revisions driven by WG consensus.

Internet Draft  SIP-Based VoIP Peering Requirements  Feb 2006 
   The SPEERMINT WG addresses the use of the SIP signaling protocol to 
   enable real-time session peering between two or more administrative 
   domains over IP networks.  To achieve the kind of real-time session 
   peering intended, both signaling and media flows must be taken into 
   consideration.  While the long-term goal is to support a variety of 
   "rich media" (multimedia) applications, the initial focus is on SIP-
   based Voice over IP (VoIP). 
    
   This document defines requirements to enable SIP-based VoIP peering 
   among two or more administrative domains.  Valid peering relationships 
   exist in multiple architectures.  Section 3 outlines the collection of 
   all requirements that might individually apply to any applicable 
   peering architecture.  Section 4 presents a tabular view of subset 
   applicability in which the rows are the collection of requirements and 
   the columns are the peering architecture alternatives. 
 
2.   Terminology 
 
   In this document, the key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',    
   'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 
   'OPTIONAL' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and 
   indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations. 
    
2.1   VoIP Peering Architectures 
 
   The taxonomy and definitions for presented in this section and used in 
   later sections of this document come from draft-bhatia-sip-peering-
   00.txt (work in progress). [1] 
    
   The following figure comes from that document and provides essential 
   reference terminology: 
 
   +---+   /~~~~~~\    /~~~~\    /~~~~~~~\    /~~~~\    /~~~~~~\   +---+ 
   | O |->(Access-O)->(Core-O)->(Interconn)->(Core-T)->(Access-T)->| T | 
   +---+   \~~~~~~/    \~~~~/    \~~~~~~~/    \~~~~/    \~~~~~~/   +---+ 
 
 
 
 
2.2   Direct Peering 
 
   Direct Peering is the peering between Core-O and Core-T without any 
   other VoIP SP in the middle.  It typically takes two forms depending on 
   how some part of the peering policy may be provisioned, Federation or 
   local policy.

Internet Draft  SIP-Based VoIP Peering Requirements  Feb 2006 
    
2.3   Interconnect Peering 
 
   In most cases this model is used when the origination SP does not 
   prefer to directly connect to a termination SP due to business reasons.  
   Interconnect SP may also be used between the access SP and the Core SP 
   due to similar reasons. 
 
2.4   Access Peering 
 
   Access Peering may typically be used when the subscriber roams to a 
   place the Core SP does not offer service or is using a Layer 5 aware SP 
   to connect to its Core SP (which may be an ASP or content provider). 
 
3.   Requirements Catalogue 
 
   Each candidate requirements is presented in a separate subsection.  In 
   addition to the subsection number, an ordered numeric requirement ID 
   and a requirement title are used to identify each requirement.  The 
   numeric requirement ID ordering is intended to convey tentative degrees 
   of both association and, where appropriate, hierarchy. 
    
   Descriptive and prescriptive text will be added in future versions of 
   this document, once the WG has reached consensus on the specific set of 
   requirements to be included. 
    
   Also, requirements statements in [2] must be reconciled with this and 
   other documents.  At present, the intended context of those 
   requirements is unclear -- i.e., intended to guide WG work or actual 
   peering operations?

4.   Requirements to Peering Architecture Mapping 
 
   In a future version of this document, this section will present an 
   ASCII-art table with the requirements listed as row headings and the 
   peering architectures listed as column headings.  Some scheme such as 
   the following (TBD by WG consensus) will be used to denote 
   applicability: 
    
   M = Mandatory 
   R = Recommended 
   O = Optional 
   X = Not applicable

Internet Draft  SIP-Based VoIP Peering Requirements  Feb 2006 
   The eventual list will likely be long as we anticipate substantial WG 
   and (hopefully) industry input on this document before it reaches BCP 
   quality.  The relevant drafts by Dave Meyer and Medhavi Bhatia have 
   been very helpful even at this early stage. 
 
 
6.   Security Considerations 
 
   This document will likely not introduce any new security 
   considerations, but individual requirements will touch upon known 
   vulnerabilities and recommend solutions from existing practice. 
 
 
7.   IANA Considerations 
 
   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces [RFC2434].
