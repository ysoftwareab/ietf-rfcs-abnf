1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC3761 [1]) is a system that transforms 
   E.164 numbers [12] into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain Name
   Service, RFC1034 [2]) services like delegation through NS records and
   NAPTR records to look up what services are available for a specific
   domain name. 
  
   This document registers 'Enumservices' according to the guidelines
   given in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning in the services
   field of an NAPTR [13] resource record to indicate what class of
   functionality a given end point offers.  The registration is defined
   within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [3][4][5][6][7])
   hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application, defined in RFC 
   3761 [1].

   The following 'Enumservices' is registered with this document: 'mobileweb'.
   This document registers the ENUMservice "mobileweb" using the URI schemes
   'http:' and 'https:' as per the IANA registration process defined in the
   ENUM specification RFC3761. 

   ITU(International Telecommunication Union) made reports of world mobile
   usage, the total number of mobile subscribers has reached more than
   1.3 billion as of 2003 according to its statistics.   

   As the market of mobile telephony service has kept growing up, 
   the number of mobile internet users has been gradually increasing.

   Mobile ENUM usage will be of high importance according to its 
   convenience and portability.
       
   Mobile webpage is smaller and simpler than general webpage; 
   Mobile webpage is designed to be fitting in the pocket-sized display
   of mobile terminals.

   Mobile web services are being provided in different protocols.
   Currently there are three different protocols for the mobile
   web service : WAP[9], ME[10] and i-mode[11].

   This document registers mobile web-service(mobileweb) as ENUMservices
   according to the three protocols ; WAP, ME and i-mode.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [8].

3.  Current Status of Mobile Web Service

   Mobile Webpage is simplified form of general webpage to be displayed 
   in the small screen of Mobile Terminal. 
   
   Currently, there are three protocols for mobile terminal to access mobile
   web-pages. These three protocols are WAP(Wireless Application Protocol)[9],
   ME(Mobile Explorer)[10] and i-mode[11]. There are differences in the
   method for mobile terminal to request and receive a mobile webpage, and 
   the markup lanuage for mobile webpage.
   
   The followings are brief specifications of WAP, ME and i-mode.

   Without special application support, Mobile webpage does not be displayed
   properly on other terminals like desktop and laptop than mobile terminal.
   Likewise, general webpage does not be displayed properly on mobile terminals.
   
   If mobile web-serivce is registered as ENUMServices in accordance with 
   RFC4002(IANA Registration for ENUMServices web and ft), it is very hard
   for a mobile service provider, terminal and its user to distinguish
   mobile webpage from general webpage. Moreover, there is no way to discriminate
   the protocol(WAP, ME or i-mode) of mobile web-service to be supported by the
   terminal.
   
   Consequently, the ENUMservices registration of mobile web-service must
   be classified according to the protocol of it and use other registration than
   RFC 4002.
      
4.  Mobile Web Service Registration

4.1   Introduction

   The Enumservices registered in this section indicate that the resource
   identified by the associated URI is capable of being a source of
   information through a mobile webpage.
 
   There are two choices of ENUMservices registration of mobile web-service.
   They are 'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration' and 'Uniform Mobile
   Web Service Registration'.

   'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration' uses Enumservice Type 'mobileweb'
   and different Enumservice Subtypes according to the protocols(WAP, ME,
   i-mode) of mobile web-service. So far, for those Enumservices that have
   both a type and subtype, the type reflected the kind of service provided,
   and the subtype reflected the URI scheme needed. However, this document
   specifies the protocols of mobile web-service as the subtype because it is
   impossible to discern among the protocols of mobile web-service through
   specifying URI scheme as the subtype(for example, ME and i-mode use the same
   URI scheme, http(s)). As you can see in '2.4.2.1 ENUM Services' of RFC 3761,
   Enumservice specifications contain the functional specification, the valid
   protocols, and the URI schemes that may be returned. There is no implicit
   mapping between the textual string "type" or "subtype" in the grammar for
   the Enumservice and URI schemes or protocols. Accordingly, it is not
   wrong to specify the protocols of mobile web-service as the subtype.
   If there is one mobile web-site, and the mobile web-service is provided
   using different URIs according to the protocols of mobile web-service, then
   the mobile web-service provider uses 'Diverse Mobile Web Service
   Registration'

   On the other hand, 'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration' uses
   Enumservice Type 'mobileweb' but does not use any Enumservice Subtypes.
   If there is one mobile web-site, and the mobile web-service is
   provided using a same URI regardless of the protocols of mobile web-service
   (namely, if mobile web-server is intelligent and able to branch the
   connection to the proper web-page according to the supported protocol of
   mobile web-service), then the mobile web-service provider uses 'Uniform
   Mobile Web Service Registration'  

   Besides, in accordance with the trend that the protocols of mobile
   web-service are being unified and converged, this document proposes that
   the unified and converged mobile web-service be registered using 'Uniform
   Mobile Web Service Registration'.
   
4.2 Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration with 'http:','https:'

   Enumservice Name: "mobileweb"

   Enumservice Type: "mobileweb"

   Enumservice Subtype: "wap", "me", "imode"

   URI Scheme: 'http:', 'https'

   Functional Specification:
   
   This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the associated
   URI scheme is capable of being a source of information through a mobile
   webpage.
   
   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'Enumservice'. However,
   the general considerations of Section 7 apply.
   
   Intended Usage: COMMON

4.3 Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration with 'http:','https:'

   Enumservice Name: "mobileweb"

   Enumservice Type: "mobileweb"

   Enumservice Subtype: N/A

   URI Scheme: 'http:', 'https'

   Functional Specification:
   
   This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the associated
   URI scheme is capable of being a source of information through a mobile
   webpage.
   
   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'Enumservice'. However,

   Addresses section)
   
5. Considerations for the 'WAP' registration

   In 4.2, mobile web-service conforming to WAP protocol is registered with
   'http(s)' URI scheme. As you can see in the brief WAP specification above,
   for WAP 2.0, it is reasonable to use 'http(s)' URI scheme, while it might look
   unreasonable to use 'http(s)' URI scheme for WAP 1.x because WAP 1.x uses
   WSP/WTP for transport on terminal-side. However, it is noted that the terminal
   has a function that transforms http(s) requests in the browser(application) level
   to WSP/WTP forms, and WAP Gateway has a function that restores the WSP/WTP
   forms to the original http(s) requests again. Therefore, the fact that
   mobile web-service conforming to WAP is registered with 'http(s)' URI scheme
   doesn't make any issue. However, if a URI scheme(e.g wap, wsp, wtp, wsl and so on)
   for WAP would be devised in the future, mobile web-service conforming to WAP
   could be registered with the new URI scheme.    

6. Expected Behavior

   Browser(application) for mobile web-services and its user must know what
   protocol of mobile web-services is supported. Only so, it is possible
   to register and connect to a web-service properly.

   After a ENUM resolution of a E.164 associated with mobile web-service,
   there are three likely results.

   In case that only URIs registered by 'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration'
   are returned as the resolution result, browser(application) or its user
   selects the URI registered by a proper Enumservice Subtype(wap, me or imode)
   and tries making connection with the URI. If there are several proper URIs,
   browser(application) or its user can select a URI, based on the value of Order
   and Preference field of NAPTR or the own rule.   

   In case that only URIs registered by 'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration'
   are returned as the resolution result, browser(application) or its user
   selects a URI, based on the value of Order and Preference field of NAPTR or 
   the own rule. If the mobile web-server connected is intelligent and has an
   appropriate branch web-page, browser(application) and its user can be provided
   with mobile web-service. If the mobile web-server connected is intelligent
   and has no appropriate branch web-page, browser(application) and its user can
   not be provided with mobile web-service. If mobile web-service uses
   only the unified and converged protocol, and browser(application) supports it,
   browser(application) and its user can be provided with the mobile web-service.
   If mobile web-service uses only the unified and converged protocol, 
   and browser(application) does not support it, browser(application) and its user
   can not be provided with the mobile web-service.

   In case that URIs registered by 'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration' and
   URIs registered by 'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration' are returned
   simultaneoustly as the resolution result, browser(application) or its user
   must select preferentially a URI registered by 'Diverse Mobile Web Service
   Registration', based on the value of Order and Preference field of NAPTR or the
   own rule because it gurantees that browser(application) and its user
   are provided with mobile web-service. If there is no proper URI registered
   by 'Diverse Mobile Web Service Registration', browser(application) or its user
   can select a URI registered by 'Uniform Mobile Web Service Registration', based
   on the value of Order and Preference field of NAPTR or the own rule.    
   If the mobile web-server connected is intelligent and has an appropriate branch
   web-page, browser(application) and its user can be provided with mobile web-service.
   If the mobile web-server connected is intelligent and has no appropriate
   branch web-page, browser(application) and its user can not be provided with
   mobile web-service. If mobile web-service uses only the unified and converged
   protocol, and browser(application) supports it, browser(application) and
   its user can be provided with the mobile web-service. If mobile web-service
   uses only the unified and converged protocol, and browser(application) does
   not support it, browser(application) and its user can not be provided with the
   mobile web-service.

7.  Security Considerations

   As used by ENUM, DNS is a global, distributed database.  Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously.  Although
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a telephone
   directory, it does expose the data subject to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done, or by whom.

   Data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists of
   targets for unrequested information; in short, it is used to address
   "spam".  Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware that
   the volume of "spam" email they receive increases when they post to
   the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM is no
   different and may be used to send "junk faxes" or "junk SMS", for
   example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when they post to these lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails.  This is not so easy with published
   telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 [12] number assignment process is much
   more involved, and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed range of
   numbers) is associated with each PSTN access.  Thus, providing a
   "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give explicit informed
   consent when data is published in ENUM.

   In addition, the data subject should be made aware that, due to
   storage of such data during harvesting by third parties, removal of
   the data from publication will not remove any copies that have been
   taken; in effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from
   publication, and that consent for its publication is explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   The user SHOULD be asked to confirm opening a mobile webpage because
   it could impose a charge on the user.

   Using 'http' URI scheme to connect with a mobile webpage is not secure,
   so the user should apply the same caution when entering personal data
   as they would do if using a client application started with any other
   method.
   Although this is not a feature of ENUM or these Enumservices, the
   ENUM-using application on the end system may appear different from
   the user's "normal" browser, so the user SHOULD receive an indication
   of whether their communication is secured.

   As evaluating a mobile web page can involve execution of embedded (or
   linked) content that may include executable code, evaluating a mobile web
   URL involves risks.  If automatic evaluation of a mobile web link were
   to be used, the querying user would be exposed to risks associated with
   that automatic download and execution of content.  Thus, the client
   MUST ask the querying user for confirmation before evaluating the mobile 
   web URL; the client MUST NOT download and evaluate the mobile web content
   automatically.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,
   (threats against which are covered in [14]) and the applicability of
   DNSSEC to these, is provided in RFC 3761.
