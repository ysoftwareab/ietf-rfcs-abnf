    Architecture and Requirement for Distribution of Link-State and TE
                           Information via PCEP.



                      draft-leedhody-teas-pcep-ls-01


Abstract

   In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation
   Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering
   Database (TED). Traditionally this Link State and TE information has
   been obtained from a link state routing protocol (supporting traffic
   engineering extensions).

   This document provides possible architectural alternatives for link-
   state and TE information distribution and their potential impacts on
   PCE, network nodes, routing protocols etc.

1. Introduction

   In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS), a Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is used in computing
   paths for connection oriented packet services and for circuits. The
   TED contains all relevant information that a Path Computation
   Element (PCE) needs to perform its computations. It is important
   that the TED should be complete and accurate anytime so that the PCE
   can perform path computations.

   In MPLS and GMPLS networks, Interior Gateway routing Protocols
   (IGPs) have been used to create and maintain a copy of the TED at
   each node. One of the benefits of the PCE architecture [RFC4655] is
   the use of computationally more sophisticated path computation
   algorithms and the realization that these may need enhanced
   processing power not necessarily available at each node
   participating in an IGP.

   Section 4.3 of [RFC4655] describes the potential load of the TED on
   a network node and proposes an architecture where the TED is
   maintained by the PCE rather than the network nodes. However it does
   not describe how a PCE would obtain the information needed to
   populate its TED. PCE may construct its TED by participating in the
   IGP ([RFC3630] and [RFC5305] for MPLS-TE; [RFC4203] and [RFC5307]
   for GMPLS). An alternative is offered by [BGP-LS].

   [RFC7399] touches upon this issue: "It has also been proposed that
   the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] could be extended to
   serve as an information collection protocol to supply information
   from network devices to a PCE. The logic is that the network devices
   may already speak PCEP and so the protocol could easily be used to
   report details about the resources and state in the network,
   including the LSP state discussed in Sections 14 and 15."

   This document proposes alternative architecture approaches for
   learning and maintaining the Link State (and TE)  information
   directly on a PCE from network nodes as an alternative to IGPs and
   BGP transport and investigate the impact from the PCE, routing
   protocol, and network node perspectives.

2. Applicability

   Recent development of a stateful PCE Model changes the PCE operation
   from path computation alone to include the support of PCE-initiated
   LSPs. With a stateful PCE model, it is also noted that LSP-DB is
   maintained by the PCE. For LSP state synchronization of stateful
   PCEs in GMPLS networks, the LSP attributes, such as its bandwidth,
   associated route as well as protection information etc, should be
   updated by PCCs to PCE LSP database (LSP-DB) [S-PCE-GMPLS]. To
   support all these recent changes in a stateful PCE model, a direct
   PCE interface to each PCC has to be supported. Relevant TE resource
   and sate information can also be transported from each node to PCE
   using this PCC-PCE interface via PCEP. Any resource changes in the
   node and links can also be quickly updated to PCE using this
   interface. Convergence time of IGP in GMPLS networks may not be
   quick enough to support on-line dynamic connectivity required for
   some applications such as bandwidth calendaring or real-time
   disaster recovery or dynamic VM migration in contexts of data center
   interconnect (DCI).

   New application areas for GMPLS and PCE in optical transport
   networks include Wavelength Switched Optical Networking (WSON) and
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN). WSON scenarios can be divided into
   routing wavelength assignment (RWA) problems where a PCE requires
   detailed information about switching node asymmetries and wavelength
   constraints as well as detailed up to date information on wavelength
   usage per link [RFC6163]. As more data is anticipated to be made
   available to PCE with addition of OTN and Flex-grid and possible
   with some optical impairment data even with the minimum set
   specified in [G.680], the total amount of data requires
   significantly more information to be held in the TED than is
   required for other traffic engineered networks. Related to this
   issue published by [HWANG] indicated that long convergence time and
   large number of LSAs flooded in the network might cause scalability
   problems in OSPF-TE and impose limitations on OSPF-TE applications.

   There are numbers of main applicability of this alternative proposed
   by this draft:

   o  Where there is no IGP or BGP-LS running in the network nodes.

   o  Where there is no IGP or BGP-LS running at the PCE to learn
      Link-state (and TE) resource and state information.

   o  Where there is IGP or BGP-LS running but with a need for a
      faster link-state (and TE) resource and state population and

      convergence at the PCE.

      *  A PCE may receive partial Link-state (and TE) resource and
         state information (say basic TE) from IGP-TE and other
         information (optical and impairment) from PCEP.

      *  A PCE may receive an incremental update (as opposed to the
         entire TE-LSA).

      *  A PCE may receive full Link-state (and TE) resource and state
         information from both IGP-TE and PCEP.

  o  Where there is a need for transporting (abstract) Link-State
      and TE information from child PCE to a Parent PCE in H-PCE
      [RFC6805]; as well as for Physical Network Controller (PNC) to
      Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) in Abstraction and
      Control of TE Networks (ACTN) [ACTN].

   A PCC may further choose to send only local TE resource and state
   information or both local and remote learned TE resource and state
   information. How a PCE manages the TE resource and state information
   is implementation specific and thus out of scope of this document.

   This draft does not advocate that the alternative methods specified
   in this draft should completely replace the IGP-TE as the method of
   creating the TED. The split between the data to be distributed via
   an IGP-TE and the information conveyed via one of the alternatives
   in this document depends on the nature of the network situation. One
   could potentially choose to have some traffic engineering
   information distributed via an IGP-TE while other more specialized
   traffic information is only conveyed to the PCEs via an alternative
   interface discussed here.

   In addition, the methods specified in this draft is only relevant to
   a set of architecture options where routing decisions are wholly or
   partially made in the PCE. On the other hand, the networks that do
   not support IGP-TE/BGP-LS, the method proposed by this draft may be
   very relevant.

3. Architecture Options

   (1) There are two general architectural alternatives based on how
   nodes get their local link-state (and TE) resource information to
   the PCEs:

Internet-Draft  PCEP LS & TE Distribution Architecture         Oct 2015


     (1.1) All Nodes send local link-state (and TE) resource
     information to all PCEs;

     (1.2) All Nodes send local link-state (and TE) resource
     information to a designated PCE and have the PCEs share this
     information with each other.

   (2) Further, a designated node (PCC) can share both local and remote
   link-state (and TE) information to the PCEs, the remote information
   might be learned at the node via IGP:

     (2.1) Designated Node(s) send local and remote link-state (and TE)
     resource information to all PCEs;

   An important functionality that needs to be addressed in each of
   these approaches is how a new PCE gets initialized in a reasonably
   timely fashion.

   Figures 1-2 show examples of two options for nodes to share local TE
   resource information with multiple PCEs. As in the IGP case we
   assume that switching nodes know their local properties and state
   including the state of all their local links. In these figures the
   data plane links are shown with the character "o"; Link-state and TE
   resource information flow from nodes to PCE by the characters "|",
   "-", "/", or "\"; and PCE to PCE link-state and TE information, if
   any, by the character "i".

3.1. Option 1.1: All Nodes Send Local Link-State and TE Info to all
   PCEs

   Architectural alternative 1 shown in Figure 1 illustrates nodes
   sending their local link-state (and TE) resource information to all
   PCEs within their domain. As the number of PCEs grows we may have
   scalability concerns. In particular, each node needs to keep track
   of which PCE it has sent information to and update that information
   periodically. However, if we are only talking about 2-3 PCEs, then
   we do not have this scalability concern.

   If a new PCE is added to the domain all nodes must send all its
   local link-state and TE resource information to that PCE rather than
   just sending status updates.

3.2. Option 1.2: Each Node Sends Local Link-State and TE Info to one
   PCE

   In this architectural alternative, shown in Figure 2, each node
   would be associated with one PCE. This implies that each PCE will
   only have partial link-state (and TE) resource information directly
   from the nodes.  It would be the responsibility of a node to get its
   local information to its associated PCE, then the PCEs within a
   domain would then need to share the partial link-state (and
   TE)resource information they learned from their associated nodes
   with each other so that they can create and maintain the complete
   link-state (and TE)resource information.

   To allow for this sharing of information PCEs would need to peer
   with each other. PCE discovery extensions [RFC4674] could be used to
   allow PCEs to find other PCEs. If a new PCE is added to the domain
   it would need to peer with at least one other PCE and then PCE
   synchronization mechanism could then be used to initialize the new
   PCEs link-state (and TE)resource information.

   A number of approaches can be used to ensure control plane
   resilience in this architecture. (1) Each node can be configured
   with a primary and a secondary PCE to send its information to; In
   case of failure of communications with the primary PCE the node
   would send its information to a secondary PCE (warm standby). (2)
   Each node could be configured to send its information to two
   different PCEs (hot standby).

3.3. Option 2.1: Designated Node(s) Send Local and Remote Link-State
   and TE Info to all PCEs

   In this architectural alternative, shown in Figure 3, illustrates
   designated node(s) sending their local and remote link-state (and
   TE) resource information to all PCEs within their domain. Designated
   Node may learn remote information via IGP or BGP-LS. More than one
   designated node may be used to ensure control plane resilience in
   this architecture.

3.4. Hierarchy of PCE

   In case of H-PCE [RFC6805], a parent PCE can utilize the mechanism
   described in this document to prepare the domain topology map by
   transporting inter-domain link information from child PCE to Parent
   PCE.

3.5. Key Architectural Issues

3.5.1. Nodes Finding PCEs

   In all cases, nodes need to send TE information directly to PCEs.
   Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and network nodes participating in
   an IGP (with or without TE extensions) have a mechanism to discover
   a PCE and its capabilities.  [RFC4674] outlines the general
   requirements for this mechanism and extensions have been defined to
   provide information so that PCCs can obtain key details about
   available PCEs in OSPF [RFC5088] and in IS-IS [RFC5089].

   After finding candidate PCEs, a node would need to see which if any
   of the PCEs actually want to receive TE information directly from
   this node.

3.5.2. Node TE Information Update Procedures

   First, a node must establish an association between itself and a PCE
   that will be maintaining a link-state and TE information. It is the
   responsibility of the node to share link-state (and TE) information.
   This includes local information, e.g., links and node properties or
   remote information learned from neighbors. General and technology
   specific information models would specify the content of this
   information while the specific protocols would determine the format.
   Note that data plane neighbor information would be passed to the PCE
   embedded in TE link information.

   There will be cases where the node would have to send to the PCE
   only a subset of TE link information depending on the path
   computation option. For instance, if the node is responsible for
   routing while the PCE is responsible for wavelength assignment for
   the route, the node would only need to send the PCE the WSON link
   usage information. This path computation option is referred to as
   separate Fouting (R) and Wavelength Assignment (WA) option in
   [RFC7449].

3.5.3. PCE Link-state (and TE) Resource Information Maintenance
   Procedures

   The PCE is responsible for creating and maintaining the link-state
   (and TE) resource information that it will use. Key functions
   include:

     1. Establishing and authenticating communications between the PCE
        and sources of link-state (and TE) resource information.

     2. Timely updates of the link-state (and TE) resource with
        information received from nodes, peers or other entities.

     3. Verifying the validity of link-state (and TE) resource
        information, i.e., ensure that the network information obtained
        from nodes or elsewhere is relatively timely, or not stale. By
        analogy with similar functionality provided by IGPs this can be
        done via a process where discrete "chunks" of TE resource
        information are "aged" and discard when expired. This combined
        with nodes periodically resending their local TE resource
        information leads to a timely update of TE resource
        information.

4. Requirements for PCEP extension


   The key requirements associated with link-state (and TE)
   distribution are identified for PCEP and listed in [PCEP-LS].



5. New Functions to distribute link-state and TE via PCEP


   Several new functions are required in PCEP to support distribution
   of link-state and TE information.  The new functions are:

   o Capability advertisement: Advertise capability for link-state and
     TE information distribution


   o Link-State and TE synchronization: Ability to synchronize the
     Link-state and TE information after session initialization.

   o Link-State and TE Report (C-E): a PCC sends a LS and TE report to
     a PCE whenever the Link-State and TE information changes.

   These new functions required in PCEP to support distribution of
   link-state (and TE) information are described in some detail in
   [PCEP-LS].



6. Security Considerations

   This draft discusses an alternative technique for PCEs to build and
   maintain a link-state and traffic engineering database. In this

Internet-Draft  PCEP LS & TE Distribution Architecture         Oct 2015


   approach network nodes would directly send traffic engineering
   information to a PCE. It may be desirable to protect such
   information from disclosure to unauthorized parties in addition it
   may be desirable to protect such communications from interference
   (modification) since they can be critical to the operation of the
   network. In particular, this information is the same or similar to
   that which would be disseminated via a link state routing protocol
   with traffic engineering extensions.

7. IANA Considerations

   This version of this document does not introduce any items for IANA
   to consider.
