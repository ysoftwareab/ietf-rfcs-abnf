1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a file format for the storage of unavailable
   domain names and related details for a top level domain (TLD) name
   registry, designed to facilitate interoperability and reusability
   among domain name registries and registrars.

   The increased number of domain name registries and registrars, the
   greater number of reasons for domain names not being available, and
   to make accommodations for possible real-time communications issues
   between registries and registrars has driven the need for this
   standard sharable file.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  General File Format Elements

   File format will be a comma separated values (CSV) file and MUST use
   the US-ASCII character set.  See informational RFC 4180 and RFC 7111
   for details on the CSV file format.

   Filename has two forms depending on content.  For a file containing
   only a list of unavailable domain names in one Top Level Domain (TLD)
   the filename MUST be <TLD>-unavailablenames-<YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss>.csv.
   For a file containing a list of unavailable domain names in multiple
   Top Level Domains (TLDs) the filename MUST be unavailablenames-<YYYY-
   MM-DDThhmmss>.csv.  For an IDN TLD <TLD> MUST be ace-encoded (i.e. in
   the "xn--" format).  <YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss> MUST be the date and time
   (in UTC) the file was created indicating that all the names in the
   file were unavailable on that date at the time the file was created.

   The first row MUST be the column headings: TLD, Domain Name, Status.
   The remaining rows will contain the data (all unavailable names) from
   the registry in the following structure: <TLD>, <Domain Name>,
   <Status>.  Where <TLD> is the TLD of the domain name, <Domain Name>
   is the string of characters that represent the unavailable name, and
   <Status> is one of four values (REGISTERED, REGISTRY RESERVED, POLICY
   RESERVED, IDN VARIANT RESERVED).  If the <TLD> and/or <Domain Name>
   is an IDN it MUST be ace-encoded (i.e. in the "xn--" format).

   All domain name labels that are not available for registration in the
   SRS, for any reason, to the registrar channel MUST be included in
   this file.

3.  Examples

3.1.  Single TLD File Example

   Example of a file that contains unavailable domain names from a
   single TLD.

   FileName: example-unavailablenames-2016-05-01T010000.csv

      TLD,Domain Name,Status
      example,e.example,REGISTRY RESERVED
      example,ex.example,POLICY RESERVED
      example,example.example,REGISTERED
      example,xn--4gqvdy3r.example,REGISTERED

3.2.  Multiple TLDs File Example

   Example of a file that contains unavailable domain names from
   multiple TLDs.

   FileName: unavailablenames-2016-05-01T010000.csv

      TLD,Domain Name,Status
      example,e.example,REGISTRY RESERVED
      test,ex.test,POLICY RESERVED
      another,xn--4gqvdy3r.another,REGISTERED

4.  Security Considerations

   The file format described in this document does not provide any
   security services.
