              The VERBATIM Digest Algorithm for DS records
               draft-vandijk-dnsop-ds-digest-verbatim-00

Abstract

   The VERBATIM DS Digest is defined as a direct copy of the input data
   without any hashing.

1.  Introduction

   The currently defined DS Digest Algorithms take the input data and
   hash it into a fixed-length form using well defined hashing
   algorithms (several SHA variants, and one mostly unused GOST
   algorithm).  That hashing operation makes any data inside the
   (C)DNSKEY record unreachable until that data is retrieved from the
   child zone.  Thus, DS records do not actually convey information;
   they merely verify information that can be retrieved elsewhere.

   A DS record set can only answer the question 'this data that I have
   here, do you recognise it?'.  For several imagined use cases for
   signed data at the parent, this might not be sufficient.

   This document introduces a new Digest Algorithm, proposed name
   VERBATIM (alternative suggestion: NULL).  The VERBATIM Digest
   Algorithm takes the input data (DNSKEY owner name | DNSKEY RDATA per
   section 5.1.4 of [RFC4034]) and copies it unmodified into the DS
   Digest field.

2.  Document work

   This document lives on GitHub (https://github.com/PowerDNS/draft-
   dnsop-ds-digest-verbatim); proposed text and editorial changes are
   very much welcomed there, but any functional changes should always
   first be discussed on the IETF DNSOP WG mailing list.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Implementation

   The subsection titles in this section attempt to follow the
   terminology from [RFC8499] in as far as it has suitable terms.
   'Implementation' is understood to mean both 'code changes' and
   'operational changes' here.

4.1.  Authoritative server changes

   None, except where related tooling emits DS records to the
   administrator.

4.2.  Validating resolver changes

   Validating resolvers are encouraged to implement the VERBATIM Digest
   Algorithm.

4.3.  Stub resolver changes

   This specification defines no changes to query processing in stub
   resolvers.

4.4.  Zone validator changes

   Zone validators are encouraged to recognise the VERBATIM Digest
   Algorithm and, where possible, verify it against the child zone's
   DNSKEY, if it has any for the given algorithm.

4.5.  Domain registry changes

   Domain registries are encouraged to allow VERBATIM digests at their
   user's request.  However, a likely outcome is that domain registries
   will only allow the VERBATIM digest for DNSSEC algorithms whose
   specifications call for use of the VERBATIM digest.

5.  Security Considerations

6.  Implementation Status

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Delegation Signer (DS)
   Resource Record (RR) Type Digest Algorithms" at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/ds-rr-types/ds-rr-types.xhtml
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/ds-rr-types/ds-rr-types.xhtml)

   The following entry is added to the registry:

   +--------------+----------------+
   | Value        | TBD            |
   | Description  | VERBATIM       |
   | Status       | OPTIONAL       |
   | Reference    | RFC TBD2       |
   +--------------+----------------+
