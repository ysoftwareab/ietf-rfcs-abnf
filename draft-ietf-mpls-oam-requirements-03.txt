Abstract

   As transport of diverse traffic types such as voice, frame
   relay, and ATM over MPLS become more common, the ability to detect, 
   handle and diagnose control and data plane defects becomes 
   critical. 

   Detection and specification of how to handle those defects is not 
   only important because such defects may not only affect the 
   fundamental operation of an Multi-Protocol Label Switching network, 
   but also because they MAY impact service level specification commitments 
   for customers of that network.

1. Introduction

   This document describes requirements for user and data
   plane operations and management (OAM) for Multi-Protocol
   Label Switching (MPLS). These requirements have been gathered
   from network operators who have extensive experience deploying
   MPLS networks. This draft specifies OAM requirements
   for MPLS, as well as for applications of MPLS.

   No specific mechanisms are proposed to address these
   requirements at this time.  The goal of this draft is to
   identify a commonly applicable set of requirements for MPLS
   OAM at this time. Specifically, a set of requirements that apply 
   to the most common set of MPLS networks deployed by service
   provider organizations today. These requirements can then be used 
   as a base for network management tool development and to guide 
   the evolution of currently specified tools, as well as the
   specification of OAM functions that are intrinsic to protocols

   used in MPLS networks.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   CE:     Customer Edge

   Defect:   Any error condition that prevents an LSP
             functioning correctly. For example, loss of an
             IGP path will most likely also result in an LSP
             not being able to deliver traffic to its
             destination. Another example is the breakage of
             a TE tunnel.  These MAY be due to physical
             circuit failures or failure of switching nodes
             to operate as expected.

             Multi-vendor/multi-provider network operation typically
             requires agreed upon definitions of defects (when it is 
             broken and when it is not) such that both recovery 
             procedures and service level specification impacts can 
             be specified.

   ECMP:  Equal Cost Multipath

   LSP:   Label Switch Path

   LSR:   Label Switch Router

   OAM:   Operations and Management

   Head-end Label Switch Router (LSR): The beginning of a label switched path.

   probe-based-dectection: Active measurement using a tool such as LSP ping.

   collecting traffic: Passive measurement of network traffic.


3.  Motivations

   MPLS OAM has been tackled in numerous Internet drafts.
   However as of this writing, existing drafts focus on single provider
   solutions or focus on a single aspect of the MPLS architecture
   or application of MPLS. For example, the use of RSVP or LDP



MPLS Working Group           Expires February 2005           [Page 3]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



   signaling and defects MAY be covered in some deployments,
   and a corresponding SNMP MIB module exists to manage this
   application; however, the handling of defects and specification
   of which types of defects are interesting to operational
   networks MAY not have been created in concert with those for 
   other applications of MPLS such as L3 VPN.  This leads to 
   inconsistent and inefficient applicability across the MPLS 
   architecture, and/or requires significant modifications to 
   operational procedures and systems in order to provide consistent 
   and useful OAM functionality. As MPLS has matured, relationships 
   between providers has become more complex. Furthermore, the 
   deployment of multiple concurrent applications of MPLS is common
   place, leading to a need to consider broader and more uniform 
   solutions, rather than very specific ad hoc point solutions.

4. Requirements

   The following sections enumerate the OAM requirements
   gathered from service providers who have deployed MPLS
   and services based on MPLS networks. Each requirement is
   specified in detail to clarify its applicability. 
   Although the requirements specified herein are defined by 
   the IETF, they have been harmonized with requirements
   gathered by other standards bodies such as the ITU [Y1710].
      

   4.1 Detection of Broken Label Switch Paths

   The ability to detect a broken Label Switch Path (LSP)
   SHOULD not require manual hop-by-hop troubleshooting of
   each LSR used to switch traffic for that LSP. For example,
   it is not desirable to manually visit each LSR along the data 
   plane path used to transport an LSP; instead,this function 
   SHOULD be automated and performed from the origination of that LSP.
   This implies solutions that are interoperable as to allow for
   such automatic operation. Furthermore, the automation of path 
   liveliness is desired in cases where large numbers of LSPs might 
   be tested. For example, automated ingress LSR to egress LSR testing 
   functionality is desired for some LSPs. The goal is to detect LSP 
   problems before customers do, and this requires detection of problems 
   in a "reasonable" amount of time. One useful definition of reasonable 
   is both predictable and consistent. 

   Synchronization of detection time bounds by tools used to detect broken 
   LSPs is required. Failure to specifying defect detection time bounds may 
   result in an ambiguity in test results. If the time to detect is known, then 
   automated responses can be specified both with respect to and with 
   regard to resiliency and service level specification reporting. 
   Further, if synchronization of detection time bounds is possible, 
   an operational framework can be established that can guide the design and

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



   specification of MPLS applications. 
   
   Although ICMP-based ping can be sent through an LSP, the use of this tool 
   to verify the LSP path liveliness has the potential for returning erroneous 
   results (both positive and negative). For example, failures may occur when 
   inconsistencies exist between the IP and MPLS forwarding tables, 
   inconsistencies in the MPLS control and data planes or problems with the 
   reply path (i.e., a reverse path does not exist). As an example of a false 
   positive, consider the case where the MPLS data plane flows through a 
   network node using a different output line card than the data plane does to 
   each the next neighbor. Also assume that although the control plane is 
   functional, the data plane on the output line card where data traffic is 
   programmed to exit the device is defective. Now, if an LSP is signaled 
   using this node, any test based solely on the control plane's view of the 
   world (i.e., ICMP-based) will return with a false positive result because 
   although the control plane traffic at the node in the example would be 
   forwarded correctly, the actual data plane switching at the node in the 
   example would misroute or drop any traffic transmitted onto that LSP.
   An example of a false negative case would be when a functioning return 
   path does not exist. In this case, neither a positive nor a negative reply 
   will be received by the sender.

   The OAM packet MUST follow exactly the customer data path in order to 
   reflect path liveliness used by customer data. Particular cases of interest 
   are forwarding mechanisms such as equal cost  multipath (ECMP) scenarios 
   within the operator's network whereby flows are load-shared across parallel
   (i.e., equal IGP cost) paths. Where the customer traffic MAY be spread over
   multiple paths, what is required is to be able to detect failures on any of
   the path permutations.  Where the spreading mechanism is payload specific, 
   payloads need to have forwarding that is common with the traffic under test.
   Satisfying these requirements introduces complexity into ensuring that ECMP
   connectivity permutations are exercised, and that defect detection occurs 
   in a reasonable amount of time.

  4.2 Diagnosis of a Broken Label Switch Path

   The ability to diagnose a broken LSP and to isolate the failed component 
   (i.e., link or node) in the path is required. For example, note that 
   specifying recovery actions for misbranching defects in an LDP network is 
   a particularly difficult case. Diagnosis of defects and isolation of the 
   failed component is best accomplished via a path trace function which can 
   return the the entire list of LSRs and links used by a certain LSP (or at 
   least the set of LSRs/links up to the location of the defect) is required. 
   The tracing capability SHOULD include the ability to trace recursive paths,
   such as when nested LSPs are used, or when LSPs enter and exit traffic-
   engineered tunnels. This path trace function MUST also be capable of 
   diagnosing LSP mis-merging by permitting comparison of expected vs. actual 
   forwarding behavior at any LSR in the path. The path trace capability 
   SHOULD be capable of being executed from both the head-end Label Switch 
   Router (LSR) and any mid-point LSR. Additionally, the path trace function 



MPLS Working Group           Expires February 2005           [Page 5]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



   MUST have the ability to support equal cost multipath scenarios  
   described above in section 4.1.

  4.3 Path characterization

   The path characterization function is the ability to reveal details 
   of LSR forwarding operations. These details can then be compared 
   later during subsequent testing relevant to OAM functionality.
   This would include but is not limited to:

     - consistent use of pipe or uniform TTL models by an LSR
     - externally visible aspects of load spreading such as
       ECMP, the specific algorithm(s) used, and examples of how 
       algorithm will spread traffic.
     - data/control plane OAM capabilities of the LSR, such as 
       the ability of the data plane to reveal how it will forward
       an LSP so that this may be compared with the control
       plane notion of how this LSP is to be forwarded.
     - stack operations performed by the LSR, such as pushes, pops,
       and time to live (TTL) propigation at penultimate hop LSRs.


   4.4 Service Level Agreement Measurement

   Mechanisms are required to measure the diverse aspects of Service
   Level Agreements:
     - availability - in which the service is considered to be
       available and the other aspects of performance measurement 
       listed below have meaning, or unavailable and other aspects 
       of performance measurement do not.
     - latency - amount of time required for traffic to transit
       the network
     - packet loss
     - jitter - measurement of latency variation

   Such measurements can be made independently of the user traffic
   or via a hybrid of user traffic measurement and OAM probing.

   At least one mechanism is required to measure the number
   of OAM packets. In addition, the ability to measure the qualitative 
   aspects of OAM probing MUST be available to specifically compute the 
   latency of OAM packets generated and received at each end of a tested 
   LSP so as to accurately reflect the latency of data packets traveling 
   along that LSP. Note that latency is a measurable parameter in service 
   level specification reporting. Any method considered SHOULD be capable 
   of measuring the latency of an LSP with minimal impact on network 
   resources.

   4.5 Frequency of OAM Execution




MPLS Working Group           Expires February 2005           [Page 6]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



   The operator MUST have the flexibility to configure OAM
   parameters. This includes the frequency of the execution of any OAM
   functions. The capability to synchronize OAM operations is desired 
   as to to permit consistent measurement of service level agreements.
   To elaborate, there are defect conditions such as misbranching or 
   misdirection of traffic for which probe-based detection mechanisms 
   that incur significant mismatches in the probe rate MAY result in flapping.

   One observation would be that wide-spread deployment of MPLS, common
   implementation of monitoring tools and the need for inter-
   carrier synchronization of defect and service level specification handling 
   will drive specification of OAM parameters to commonly agreed on values and 
   such values will have to be harmonized with the surrounding 
   technologies (e.g. SONET/SDH, ATM etc.) in order to be useful. 
   This will become particularly important as networks scale
   and misconfiguration can result in churn, alarm flapping etc.


  4.5 Alarm Suppression, Aggregation and Layer Coordination

   Devices MUST provide alarm suppression functionality that prevents the 
   generation of superfluous generation of alarms by simply discarding them 
   (or not generating them in the first place), or by aggregating them 
   together, and thereby greatly reducing the number of notifications 
   emitted.  When viewed in conjuction with requirement 4.6 below, this
   typically requires fault notification to the LSP egress that 
   MAY have specific time constraints if the application using the LSP 
   independently implements path continuity testing (for example ATM I.610 
   Continuity check (CC)[I610]).  These constraints apply to LSPs that are
   monitored. The nature of MPLS applications allows for an arbitrary 
   hierarchy of LSPs. This introduces the opportunity to have multiple 
   MPLS applications attempt to respond to defects simultaneously. For
   example, layer-3 MPLS VPNs that utilize Traffic Engineered tunnels,
   where a failure occurs on the LSP carrying the Traffic Engineered
   tunnel. This failure would affect he VPN traffic that uses the tunnel's
   LSP. Mechanisms are required to coordinate network response to defects.


   4.6 Support for OAM Interworking for Fault Notification

   An LSR supporting the interworking of one or more networking technologies 
   over MPLS MUST be able to translate an MPLS defect into the native 
   technology's error condition. For example, errors occurring over a MPLS 
   transport LSP that supports an emulated ATM VC MUST translate errors into 
   native ATM OAM AIS cells at the termination points of the LSP. The 
   mechanism SHOULD consider possible bounded detection time parameters, e.g.,
   a "hold off" function before reacting as to synchronize with the OAM 
   functions. One goal would be alarm suppression by the upper layer using 
   the LSP. As observed in section 4.5, this requires that MPLS perform 
   detection in a bounded timeframe in order to initiate alarm suppression 



MPLS Working Group           Expires February 2005           [Page 7]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



   prior to the upper layer independently detecting the defect.

   4.7 Error Detection and Recovery.

   Recovery from a fault can be facilitated by OAM procedures. It is often 
   desirable for such recovery to be automatic. It is a requirement that 
   faults be detected prior to customers detecting them.

   4.8 Standard Management Interfaces

   The wide-spread deployment of MPLS requires common information modeling of 
   management and control of OAM functionality. This is reflected in the the 
   integration of standard MPLS-related MIBs (e.g. [RFC3813][RFC3812][RFC3814])
   for fault, statistics and configuration management. These standard 
   interfaces provide operators with common programmatic interface access to
   operations and management functions and their status.

   4.9  Detection of Denial of Service Attacks 

   The ability to detect denial of service (DoS) attacks against the 
   data or control plaes MUST be part of any security management related 
   to MPLS OAM tools or techniques.

   4.10 Per-LSP Accounting Requirements

   In an MPLS network, service providers (SPs) can measure traffic from an LSR 
   to the egress of the network using some MPLS related MIBs, for example. This 
   means that it is a reasonable to know how much traffic is traveling 
   from where to where (i.e., a traffic matrix) by analyzing the flow of traffic.
   Therefore, traffic accounting in an MPLS network can be summarized as the 
   following three items.

     (1) Collecting information to design network

         Providers and their customers MAY need to verify high-level service 
         level specifications, either to continuously optimize their networks,
         or to offer guaranteed bandwidth services. Therefore, traffic 
         accounting to monitor MPLS applications is required. 

     (2) Providing a Service Level Specification

         For the purpose of optimized network design, a service provider 
         may offer the traffic informationr. Optimizing network design 
         needs this information.

     (3) Inter-AS environment

         Service providers that offer inter-as services require accounting 
         of those services.




MPLS Working Group           Expires February 2005           [Page 8]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



     These three motivations need to satisfy the following.

        - In (1) and (2), collection of information on a per-LSP basis is a 
          minimum level of granularity of collecting accounting information at
          both of ingress and egress of an LSP.

        - In (3), SP's ASBR carry out interconnection functions as an
          intermediate LSR. Therefore, identifying a pair of ingress and 
          egress LSRs using each LSP is needed to determine the cost of the 
          service that a customer is using.

    4.10.1 Requirements

     Accounting on a per-LSP basis encompasses the following set of
     functions:

      (1) At an ingress LSR accounting of traffic through LSPs
          beginning at each egress in question.

      (2) At an intermediate LSR, accounting of traffic through
          LSPs for each pair of ingress to egress.

      (3) At egress LSR, accounting of traffic through LSPs
          for each ingress.

      (4) All LSRs that contain LSPs that are being measuremented
          need to have a common key to distinguish each LSP.
          The key MUST be unique to each LSP, and its mapping to
          LSP SHOULD be provided from whether manual or automatic
          configuration.

       In the case of non-merged LSPs, this can be achieved by
       simply reading traffic counters for the label stack associated
       with the LSP at any LSR along its path. However, in order to measure 
       merged LSPs, an LSR MUST have a means to distinguish the source of 
       each flow so as to disambiguate the statistics. For example, the 
       LSR might use an additional label as a key, further inspect the packet
       to uncover its source address, etc...

     4.10.2 Scalability

     It is not realistic to perform the just described operations by
     LSRs in a network on all LSPs that exist in a network.
     At a minimum, per-LSP based accounting SHOULD be performed on the
     edges of the network -- at the edges of both LSPs and the MPLS domain.

5. Security Considerations

   Provisions to any of the tools designed to satisfy the requirements
   described herin are required to prevent their unauthorized use. Likewise,



MPLS Working Group           Expires February 2005           [Page 9]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Requirements           August 2004



   these tools MUST provide a means by which an operator can prevent 
   denial of service attacks if those tools are used in such an attack.

   LSP mis-merging has security implications beyond that of simply
   being a network defect. LSP mis-merging can happen due to a number 
   of potential sources of failure, some of which (due to MPLS label 
   stacking) are new to  MPLS.

   The performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization 
   involve extracting a significant amount of information about 
   network construction which the network operator MAY consider 
   private.

6. IANA Considerations
 
   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
