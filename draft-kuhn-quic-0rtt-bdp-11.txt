   to improve the performance of ingress traffic.

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


   [RFC9000] mentions that "Generally, implementations are advised to be
   cautious when using previous values on a new path."  This draft
   proposes a discussion on how using previous values can be achieved in
   a interoperable manner and how it can be done safely.

   When clients resume a session to download a large object, the
   congestion control algorithms will require time to ramp-up the packet
   rate as a sequence of Round-Trip Time (RTT)-based increases.  This
   document specifies a method that can improve traffic delivery by
   allowing a QUIC connection to avoid a the slow process to discover
   key path parameters including a way to more rapidly grow the
   congestion window (cwnd):

   1.  During a previous session, current RTT (current_rtt), bottleneck
       bandwidth (current_bb) and current client IP (current_client_ip)
       are stored as saved_rtt, saved_bb and saved_client_ip;

   2.  When resuming a session to the same IP address, the server can
       then utilize the current_rtt and the current_bb to the saved_rtt
       and saved_bb of a previous connection.

   This method applies to any resumed QUIC session: both saved_session
   and recon_session can be a 0-RTT QUIC connection or a 1-RTT QUIC
   connection.

   The current version of this draft considers several possible
   solutions: (1) the saved parameters are stored at the server; they
   are not sent to the client; (2) the saved parameters are sent to the
   client as an encrypted opaque blob; although the client is unable to
   read the parameters can include this opaque blob in a subsequent
   request to the server; (3) the saved parameters are sent to the
   client and the client is notified of their value, but the parameters
   also include a cryptographic integrity check; the client can include
   both the parameters and the integrity check in a subsequent request
   to the server.

   None of these possible solutions allow q client to modify the
   parameters that will be used by the server.

   There are several cases where the parameters of a previous session
   are not appropriate.  These include:

      (1) the network conditions have changed and the current capacity
      is less than the previously estimated bottleneck bandwidth.  Using
      the saved congestion control state would increase congestion;

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


      (2) the network path has changed and the new path is different.
      Using the saved congestion control state could increase
      congestion.  This case might be accompanied by a change in the RTT
      or IP address.

      (3) a client uses parameters that are no longer appropriate, e.g.,
      to intentionally try to use a CWND larger than appropriate.

   This document:

   1.  proposes guidelines for how to safely apply the previously
       computed parameters to new sessions;

   2.  describes different implementation considerations for the
       proposed method using QUIC;

   3.  discusses the trade-offs associated with the different
       implementation solutions.

1.1.  Notations and terms

   *  IW: Initial Window (e.g., from [RFC6928]);

   *  current_iw: Current Initial Window

   *  recom_iw: Recommended Initial Window

   *  BDP: defined below

   *  CWND: the congestion window used by server (maximum number of
      bytes allowed in flight by the CC)

   *  current_bb : Current estimated bottleneck bandwidth

   *  saved_bb: Estimated bottleneck bandwidth preserved from a previous
      connection

   *  RTT: Round-Trip Time

   *  current_rtt: Current RTT

   *  saved_rtt: RTT preserved from a previous connection

   *  client_ip : IP address of the client

   *  current_client_ip : Current IP address of the client

   *  saved_client_ip : IP address of the client preserved from a
      previous connection

   *  remembered BDP parameters: a combination of saved_rtt and saved_bb

   *  ITT : Interpacket Transmission Time

   *  MSS : Maximum Message Size

   *  AEAD : Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data

   *  LRU : Least Recently Used

   [RFC6349] defines the BDP as follows: "Derived from Round-Trip Time
   (RTT) and network Bottleneck Bandwidth (BB), the Bandwidth-Delay
   Product (BDP) determines the Send and Received Socket buffer sizes
   required to achieve the maximum TCP Throughput."  This draft
   considers the BDP estimated by a server that includes all buffering
   along the network path.  In that sense, the BDP estimated is related
   to the amount of bytes in flight.

   A QUIC connection might not reproduce the procedure detailed in
   [RFC6349] to measure the BDP.  A server might be able to exploit an
   internal evaluation of the Bottleneck Bandwidth to estimate the BDP.

   This document refers to the saved_bb and current_bb for the
   previously estimated bottleneck bandwidth.  This value can be easilly
   estimated when using a rate-based congestion controller, such as BBR.
   Other congestion controllers, such as CUBIC or RENO, could estimate
   the bottleneck bandwidth by utilizing a combinatioin of the cwnd and
   the minimum RTT.  This approach could result in over estimating the
   bottleneck bandwidth and ought to be used with caution.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Safe jump start

2.1.  Rationale behind the safety guidelines

   The previously measured saved_rtt and saved_bb SHOULD NOT be used as-
   is, to avoid potential congestion collapse:




Kuhn, et al.              Expires 26 April 2022                 [Page 5]

   *  Rationale #1: Internet path capacity can change at any time.  An
      Internet method needs to be robust to network conditions that can
      differ from one session to the next.

   *  Rationale #2: Information sent by a malicious client is not
      relevant.  A client could try to convince a server to use a CWND
      higher than appropriate, to gain an unfair share of capacity for
      itself or to induce congestion for other flows.

2.2.  Rationale #1: Variable network conditions

   The server MUST check the validity of the saved_rtt and saved_bb
   parameters, whether these are sent by a client or are stored at the
   server.  The following events indicates cases where use of these
   parameters is inappropriate:

   *  IP address changed: If the client changes its IP address (i.e.
      the saved_client_ip is different from the current_client_ip), the
      different address is to be takne as an indication of a different
      network path.  This new path does not necessarily exhibit the same
      characteristics as the old one.  If the server changes its IP
      address after a migration, it would not be safe to exploit
      previously estimated parameters.

   *  RTT changed: A significant change in RTT might be an indication
      that the the network conditions changed.  Since the CC information
      is directly impacted by the RTT, a significant change in RTT is a
      strong indication that the previously estimated BDP parameters are
      likely to not be valid for the current path.

   *  Lifetime of the extension: The CC information is temporal.
      Frequent connections to the same IP address are likely to track
      changes, but long-term use of previous values are not appropriate.

   *  BB over estimation: There are cases where using the cwnd would
      infralte the bottleneck bandwidth.  However, at the end of a CC
      slow start, the value of cwnd can be significantly larger than the
      value, that the CC finally converges to (after a few more rounds).
      Directly exploiting such value for the bottleneck bandwidth
      estimation may be inappropriate.  One mitigation could be to
      restrict to only a fraction (e.g., 1/2) of the previously used
      cwnd; another mitigation might be to calculate the bottleneck
      bandwidth based on the flightsize.

   There are different solutions for the variable network conditions:

   *  Rationale #1 - Solution #1 : When resuming a session, restore the
      current_bb and current_rtt from the saved_bb and saved_rtt
      parameters estimated from a previous connection.

   *  Rationale #1 - Solution #2 : When resuming a session, implement a
      safety check to measure avoid using the saved_bb and saved_rtt
      parameters to cause congestion over the path.  In this case, the
      current_bb and current_rtt might not be set directly to the
      saved_bb and saved_rtt: the server might wait for the completion
      of the safety check before doing so.

   Section 3 describes various approaches for Rationale #1 - Solution
   #2.

2.3.  Rationale #2: Malicious clients

   The server MUST check the integrity of the saved_rtt and saved_bb
   parameters received from a client.

   There are several solutions to avoid attacks by malicious clients:

   *  Rationale #2 - Solution #1 : The server stores a local estimate of
      the bottleneck bandwidth and RTT parameters as the saved_bb and
      saved_rtt.

   *  Rationale #2 - Solution #2 : The server sends the estimate of the
      bottleneck bandwidth and RTT parameters to the client as the
      saved_bb and saved_rtt.  This information is encrypted by the
      server.  The client resends the same encrypted information when
      resuming a connection.  The client can neither read nor modify the
      saved_rtt and saved_bb parameters.

   *  Rationale #2 - Solution #3 : The server sends an estimate of the
      saved_rtt and saved_bb parameters to the client.  The information
      includes an integrity protection check.  The client can resend the
      information when resuming a connection.  This allows a client to
      read, but not modify, the saved_rtt and saved_bb parameters.  This
      might enable a client to decide whether the new parameters are
      appropriate, based on client-side information about the network
      conidtions or connectivity.

   Section 4 describes various implementation approaches for each of
   these solutions using local storage ( Section 4.2 for Rationale #2 -
   Solution #1), NEW_TOKEN Frame ( Section 4.3 for Rationale #2 -
   Solution #2), BDP extension Frame ( Section 4.4 for Rationale #2 -
   Solution #3).

2.4.  Trade-off between the different solutions

   This section provides a description of different implementation
   options and discusses their respective advantages and drawbacks.
   While there are some discussions for the solutions regarding
   Rationale #2, the server MUST consider Rationale #1 - Solution #2 and
   avoid Rationale #1 - Solution #1: the server MUST implement a safety
   check to measure whether the saved BDP parameters (i.e. saved_rtt and
   saved_bb) are relevant or check that their usage would not cause
   excessive congestion over the path.

2.4.1.  Security aspects

   The client can send information related to the saved_rtt and saved_bb
   to the server with the BDP Frame extension using either Rationale #2
   - Solution #2 or Rationale #2 - Solution #3.  However, the server
   SHOULD NOT trust the client.  Indeed, even if 0-RTT packets
   containing the BDP Frame are encrypted, a client could modify the
   values within the extension and encrypt the 0-RTT packet.
   Authentication mechanisms might not guarantee that the values are
   safe.  It is not an easy operation for a client to modify
   authenticated or encrypted data without this being detected by a
   server.  Modification could be realized by malicious clients.  One
   way to avoid this is for a server to also store the saved_rtt and
   saved_bb parameters.

   A malicious client might modify the saved_bb parameter to convince
   the server to use a larger CWND than appropriate.  Using the
   algorithms proposed in Section 3, the server may reduce any intended
   harm and can check that part of the information provided by the
   client are valid.

   Storing the BDP parameters locally at the server reduces the
   associated risks by allowing the client to transmit information
   related to the BDP of the path in the case of a malicious client
   trying to break the encryption mechanism that it had received.

2.4.2.  Interoperability and use-cases

   If the server stores a resumption ticket for each client to protect
   against replay on a third party IP, it could also store the IP
   address (i.e.  saved_client_ip) and BDP parameters (i.e. saved_rtt
   and saved_bb) of the previous session of the client.

   In cases where the BDP Frame extension is exploited, the approach of
   storing the BDP parameters locally at the server can provide a cross-
   check of the BDP parameters sent by a client.  The server can anyway
   enable a safe jumpstart, but without the BDP Frame extension.

   However, the client does not have the choice of accepting to use this
   or not, and is unable to utilize local knowledge of the network
   conditions or conenctivity.

   Storing local values related to the BDP would help in improving the
   ingress for 0-RTT connections, however, not using a BDP Frame
   extension could reduce the interest of the approach where (1) the
   client knows the BDP estimations done at the server, (2) the client
   decides to accept or reject ingress optimization, (3) the client
   tunes application level requests.

2.4.3.  Summary

   As a summary, the approach of local storage of values can be secure
   and the BDP Frame extension provides more information to the client
   and more interoperability.  The Figure 1 provides a summary of the
   advantages and drawbacks of each approach.

                       Figure 1: Comparing solutions

3.  Safety guidelines

   The safety guidelines are designed to avoid a server adding excessive
   congestion to an already congested path.  The following mechanisms
   help in fulfilling this objective:

   *  The server SHOULD compare the measured transport parameters (in
      particular current_rtt) of the 0-RTT connection with those of the
      1-RTT connection (in particular saved_rtt);

   *  The server SHOULD NOT consider the saved_bb parameter when there
      is any indicated congestion (e.g., loss of packet during the first
      transmission of data or ECN-CE mark);

   *  The server MUST NOT send more than the recommended maximum IW
      (recom_iw) in the first transmission of data.  This value could be
      based on a local understanding of the path characteristics.
      Knowing the congestion status of the network in closed
      environments may help in increasing the recommended maximum IW.

   *  The server SHOULD NOT store and/or send information related to the
      previously estimated bottleneck bandwidth (saved_bb) (see
      Section 1.1 for more details on bottleneck bandwidth definition),
      if this estimation has not been computed after some rounds during
      the 1-RTT connection.  At least, the 1-RTT connection should have
      reached the congestion avoidance phase.

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


   The proposed mechanisms SHOULD be limited by any rate-limitation
   mechanisms of QUIC, such as flow control mechanisms or amplification
   attack prevention.  In particular, it may be necessary to issue
   proactive MAX_DATA frames to increase the flow control limits of a
   connection.  In particular, the maximum number of packets that can be
   sent without acknowledgment needs to be chosen to avoid the creation
   and the increase of congestion for the path.

   This extension should not provide an opportunity for the current
   connection to be a vector of an amplification attack.  The address
   validation process, used to prevent amplification attacks, SHOULD be
   performed [RFC9000].

   The following mechanisms could be implemented:

   *  Exploit a standard IW:

      1.  The server sends the first data packet using the IW - this is
          a safe starting point for any path where there is no path
          information or where there is no congestion state.  This
          avoids adding excessive congestion to the path;

      2.  If the reception of IW exhibits characteristics that resemble
          those of a recent previous session from the client (i.e.
          current_rtt < 1.2*saved_rtt and all data was acknowledged
          without reported congestion), the method permits the sender to
          consider the saved_bb as an input to adapt current_bb to
          rapidly determine a new safe rate;

      3.  The sender needs to avoid a burst of packets resulting from a
          step-increase in the congestion window [RFC9000].  Pacing the
          packets as a function of the current_rtt can provide this
          additional safety during the period in which the CWND is
          increased by the method.

   *  Identify a relevant pacing rhythm:

      -  The server estimates the pacing rhythm using saved_rtt and
         saved_bb.  The Interpacket Transmission Time (ITT) is
         determined by the ratio between the current Maximum Message
         Size (MSS) for packets and the ratio between the saved_bb and
         saved_rtt.  A tunable safety margin might be introduced to
         avoid sending more than a recommended maximum IW (recom_iw):

         o  current_iw = min(recom_iw,saved_bb)

         o  ITT = MSS/(current_iw/saved_rtt)

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


      -  When the IW is acknowledged, the server falls back to a
         standard slow-start mechanism.

   *  Tune slow-start mechanisms: After transport parameters are set to
      a previously estimated bottleneck bandwidth, if slow-start
      mechanisms continue, the sender can overshoot the bottleneck
      capacity.  This can occur even if the safety check described in
      this section is implemented.

      -  For NewReno and CUBIC, it is recommended to exit slow-start and
         enter in congestion avoidance phase.

      -  For BBR, it is recommended to move to the "probe bandwidth"
         state.

   This follows the idea of [RFC4782],
   [I-D.irtf-iccrg-sallantin-initial-spreading] and [CONEXT15].

4.  Implementation considerations

4.1.  Rationale behind the different implementation options

   The NewSessionTickets messages of TLS offer a solution.  The idea
   would have been to add a 'bdp_metada' field in the NewSessionTickets
   that the client could read.  The sole extension currently defined in
   TLS1.3 that can be seen by the client is max_early_data_size (see
   section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446]).  However, in the general design of QUIC,
   TLS sessions are managed by the TLS stacks.

   Three distinct approaches are presented: sending an opaque blob to
   the client that it may return to the server for a future connection
   (see Section 4.3), enable a local storage of BDP related values (see
   Section 4.2) and a BDP Frame extension (see Section 4.4).

4.2.  Independent local storage of values

   This approach independently lets both a client and a server remember
   their BDP parameters:

   *  During a 1-RTT session, the endpoint stores the RTT (as the
      saved_rtt) and bottleneck bandwidth (as the saved_bb) together
      with the session resume ticket.  The client can also store the IP
      address of the server.

   *  The server maintains a table of previously issued tickets, indexed
      by the random ticket identifier that is used to guarantee
      uniqueness of the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
      (AEAD) encryption.  Old tokens are removed from the table using



Kuhn, et al.              Expires 26 April 2022                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


      the Least Recently Used (LRU) logic.  For each ticket identifier,
      the table holds the RTT and bottleneck bandwidth (i.e. saved_rtt
      and saved_bb), and also the IP address of the client (i.e.
      saved_client_ip).

   During the 0-RTT session, the endpoint waits for the first RTT
   measurement from the peer's IP address.  This is used to verify that
   the current_rtt has not significantly changed from the saved_rtt, and
   hence is an indication that the BDP information is appropriate to the
   path that is currently being used.

   If this RTT is confirmed (e.g. current_rtt < 1.2*saved_rtt, the
   endpoint also verifies that an initial window of data has been
   acknowledged without requiring retransmission.  This second check
   detects a path with significant incipient congestion (i.e. where it
   would not be safe to update the CWND based on the saved_bb).  In
   practice, this could be realized by a proportional increase in the
   CWND, where the increase is (saved_bb/IW)*proportion_of_IW_currently-
   ACKed.

   This solution does not allow the client to refuse the exploitation of
   the BDP parameters.  If the server does not want to store the metrics
   from previous connections, an equivalent of the tcp_no_metrics_save
   for QUIC may be necessary.  This option could be negociated that
   alows a client to choose whether to use the saved information.

4.3.  Using NEW_TOKEN frames

   Using NEW_TOKEN Frames, the server could send a token to the client
   through a NEW_TOKEN Frame.  The token is an opaque blob and the
   client can not read its content (see section 19.7 of [RFC9000]).  The
   client sends the received token in the header of an Initial packet
   for a later connection.

4.4.  BDP Frame

   This section describes the use of a new Frame, the BDP Frame.  The
   BDP Frame MUST be contained in 0-RTT packets, if sent by the client.
   The BDP Frame MUST be contained in 1-RTT packets, if sent by the
   server.  The BDP Frame MUST be considered by congestion control and
   its data is not be limited by flow control limits.  The server MAY
   send multiple BDP Frames in both 1-RTT and 0-RTT connections.  The
   client can send BDP Frames during 1-RTT and 0-RTT connections.

4.4.1.  BDP Frame Format

   A BDP Frame is formatted as shown in Figure 2.

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


   BDP Frame {
     Type (i) = 0xXXX,
     Lifetime (i),
     Saved BB (i),
     Saved RTT (i),
     Saved IP length (i),
     Saved IP (...)
   }

                         Figure 2: BDP Frame Format

   A BDP Frame contains the following fields:

   *  Lifetime (extension_lifetime): The extension_lifetime is a value
      in milliseconds, encoded as a variable length integer.  This
      follows the idea of NewSessionTicket of TLS [RFC8446].  This
      represents the validity in time of this extension.

   *  Saved BB (saved_bb): The saved_bb is a value in bytes, encoded as
      a variable length integer.  The bottleneck bandwidth estimated for
      the previous connection by the server.  Using the previous values
      of bytes_in_flight defined in [RFC9002] can result in overshoot of
      the bottleneck capacity and is not advised.

   *  Saved RTT (saved_rtt): The saved_rtt is a value in milliseconds,
      encoded as a variable length integer.  This could be set to the
      minimum RTT (min_rtt).  The saved_rtt can be set to min_rtt.
      NOTE: The min_rtt defined in [RFC9002], does not track a
      decreasing RTT: therefore min_rtt reported might be larger than
      the actual minimum RTT measured during the 1-RTT connection.

   *  Saved IP length (saved_ip_length) : The length of the IP address
      set to either 4 (IPv4) or 16 (IPv6).

   *  Saved IP (saved_client_ip) : The saved_client_ip could be set to
      the IP address of the client.

4.4.2.  Extension activation

   The client can accept the transmission of BDP Frames from the server
   by using the enable_bdp transport extension.

   enable_bdp (0xTBD): in the 1-RTT connection, the client indicates to
   the server that it wishes to receive BDP extension Frames for
   improving ingress of 0-RTT connection.  The default value is 0.
   Values strictly above 3 are invalid, and receipt of these values MUST
   be treated as a connection error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.

Internet-Draft             Transport for 0-RTT              October 2021


   *  0: Default value.  If the client does not send this parameter, the
      server considers that the client does not support or does not wish
      to activate the BDP extension.

   *  1: The client indicates to the server that it wishes to receive
      BDP Frame and activates the ingress optimization for the 0-RTT
      connection.

   *  2: The client indicates that it does not wish to receive BDP
      Frames but activates ingress optimization.

   *  3: The client indicates that it wishes to receive BDP Frames but
      does not activate ingress optimization.

   This Transport Parameter is encoded as per Section 18 of [RFC9000].

5.  Discussion

5.1.  BDP extension protected as much as initial_max_data

   The BDP metadata parameters are measured by the server during a
   previous connection.  The BDP extension is protected by the mechanism
   that protects the exchange of the 0-RTT transport parameters.  For
   version 1 of QUIC, the BDP extension is protected using the mechanism
   that already protects the "initial_max_data" parameter.  This is
   defined in sections 4.5 to 4.7 of [RFC9001].  This provides a way for
   the server to verify that the parameters proposed by the client are
   the same as those that the server sent to the client during the
   previous connection.

5.2.  Other use-cases

5.2.1.  Optimizing client's requests

   When using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTPS (DASH), clients
   might encounter issues in knowing the available path capacity or DASH
   can encounter issues in reaching the best available video playback
   quality.  The client requests could then be adapted and specific
   traffic could utilize information from the path characteristics (such
   as encouraging the client to increase the quality of video chunks, to
   fill the buffers and avoid video blocking or to send high quality
   adds).

   In other cases, applications could provide additional services if
   clients can know the server estimation of the path characteristics.

5.2.2.  Sharing transport information across multiple connections

   There can be benefit in sharing transport information across multiple
   connections.  [I-D.ietf-tcpm-2140bis] considers the sharing of
   transport parameters between TCP connections originating from the
   same host.  The proposal in this document has the advantage of
   storing server-generated information at the client and not requiring
   the server to retain additional state for each client.

   TBD: Text is required to register the BDP Frame and the enable_bdp
   transport parameter.  Parameters are registered using the procedure
   defined in [RFC9000].

   Security considerations are discussed in Section 5 and in Section 3.
