1.  Introduction

   In Mobile IPv6 [1], home agents are responsible for the registration
   of mobile nodes in the home network, and tunneling the data 
   packets to the mobile nodes when the mobile nodes are not reachable
   through its home IP addresses tentativly. but it will cause that 
   the traffic bottleneck could be formed at a home agent. When the home
   agent experiences high intensity of the tunneled traffic and the 
   mobile node registration information. DHAAD has been specified in
   base Mobile IPv6 protocol, but it can be only used for stationary
   load balance among multiple home agents. This protocol defines a
   hybrid load balance mechanism which takes account of not only the
   mobile node registration information but also the tunneled data
   traffic information to effectively release and prevent the formation
   of the traffic bottleneck at the home agent.

   Specific flow state establishment methods and the related service
   models are out of scope for this specification, but the generic
   requirements enabling co-existence of different methods in IPv6 nodes
   are set forth in section 4.

2 Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   Following terms are not re-defined. They are included for the
   convenience of the readers.

   IP
    Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).[2]

   Mobile IPv6
    Mobile IP for IPv6 [3]

   Home Agent (HA)
    A router on a MN's home link with which the MN has registered 
    its current Care-of address. While the MN is away from home, 
    the HA intercepts packets on the home link destined to the 
    MN's home address, encapsulates them, and tunnels them to the 
    MN's registered Care-of address.

   Mobile Node (MN)

    A node that can change its point of attachment from one link to
    another, while still being reachable via its home address.
    
   Correspondent Node (CN)

    A peer node with which a mobile node is communicating.  The
    correspondent node may be either mobile or stationary.

   Security Association (SA)

    An IPsec security association is a cooperative relationship formed
    by the sharing of cryptographic keying material and associated
    context.  Security associations are simplex.  That is, two
    security associations are needed to protect bidirectional traffic
    between two nodes, one for each direction.

   Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD)
   
    A protocol which describes how a home agent can help mobile nodes to
    discover the addresses of the home agents [3].  The home agent keeps
    track of the other home agents on the same link, and responds to
    queries sent by the mobile node.
    
   Home Agents List

    Home agents need to know which other home agents are on the same
    link.  This information is stored in the Home Agents List, as
    described in more detail in Section 10.1.  The list is used for
    informing mobile nodes during dynamic home agent address discovery.
    

3.  Previous Work 

   The document [4] has described the problem related to switch the 
   service from the failed home agent to another functional home agent,
   and propose some guideline for possible solution.  Load balance of
   multple home agents also has been illustrated. 
   
   In document [5], Virtual Home Agent Reliability Protocol has been 
   proposed to solve the realibility problem of home agent. The 
   solution is transparent to mobile node. Principally, this solution
   is quite similar to VRRPv6 [6]. Even for VRRP solution which is
   related to dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router
   to one of VRRP routers on a LAN, different vendor has different
   solution, some vendors provide layer 3 solution VIP (Virtual IP), and
   other vendors can provide layer 2 solution VMAC(Virtual MAC). Besides
   VRRP, some other proprietary protocol such as heart-beat can also be 
   used for avoding reliability problem of home agent. So that will be 
   inefficient to making a standard about home agent reliability, and
   not only vendors, but also carrier/SIP will be quite diffcult to
   handle this issue. Furthermore, home agent list and DHAAD have not
   been considered in this document yet, but DHAAD have  been originally
   designed to handle multiple home agents in base Mobile IPv6 protocol.
   Besides that, this protocol only has one active home agent to keep
   the transparent to mobile node, so it mightbe quite diffculty to do
   load balance based on this  mechanism. Problem of sequence number in
   security assocation have not yet been considered.

   Inter Home Agents Protocol (HAHA) [7] has been proposed to provide
   multiple home agent redundancy and load-balancing for both Mobile
   IPv6 protocol and Nemo basic support protocol. Because HAHA protocl
   allows multiple home agents to be placed at different links, it can
   prevent home link failure from Mobile IPv6. How to optimize the 
   synchronizing binding message among multiple link home agents will be
   the most important, but this problem has been omited in the document.
   Furthermore synchronizing binding of only one particular MN to
   multiple home agents simultaneously has been described. Suppose there
   are more than 0.1 million users, such kind of synchronizing signal
   will be a heavy burdern for network. Considering the reliability of
   home agent, if Primary Home Agent is failed, and one CN want to start
   communicate with MN, but based on the HAHA protocol, it will be quite
   diffcult for CN to find the where is MN because in the home network
   even other home agent existed and has been synchronizd. Another issue
   related to HAHA is that if all outgoing packets from MN will be
   always tunneled through primary home agent, realiability and load
   balance will have some problems. Finally network and signaling based
   on HAHA is complicatd, but carrier/ISP expect simple deployment of
   network architecuture, anyway this solution will be quite useful in 
   the case of NEMO. 
   

4.  Multiple Home Agents 

   The following Figure gives the topology layout to deploy this
   protocol for distributed home agents

                                             / 

   In this protocol, the home network is composed of multiple Mobile
   IPv6 home agents and multiple mobile nodes. Each home agent in the
   home network is attached with an access router. When the mobile
   nodes reside in the home network, the home agents do not execute any
   home agent tasks. 

   The home agent assignment of the mobile nodes in the home network
   can be either evenly assigned among the multiple HAs or unevenly
   assigned. Whether the home agent assignment is even or not would
   neither arbitrarily affect the original traffic burden problem nor
   affect the performance of this protocol.

5.  Modified Home Agents List

      Each home agent maintains a separate Home Agents List for each link
   on which it is serving as a home agent.  A new entry is created or an
   existing entry is updated in response to receipt of a valid Router
   Advertisement in which the Home Agent (H) bit is set.  Each Home
   Agents List entry conceptually contains the following fields:

   o  The link-local IP address of a home agent on the link.  This
      address is learned through the Source Address of the Router
      Advertisements [8] received from the router.

   o  One or more global IP addresses for this home agent.  Global
      addresses are learned through Prefix Information options with the
      Router Address (R) bit set, received in Router Advertisements from
      this link-local address.  Global addresses for the router in a
      Home Agents List entry MUST be deleted once the prefix associated
      with that address is no longer valid [8].

   o  The remaining lifetime of this Home Agents List entry.  If a Home
      Agent Information Option is present in a Router Advertisement
      received from a home agent, the lifetime of the Home Agents List
      entry representing that home agent is initialized from the Home
      Agent Lifetime field in the option (if present); otherwise, the
      lifetime is initialized from the Router Lifetime field in the
      received Router Advertisement.  If Home Agents List entry lifetime
      reaches zero, the entry MUST be deleted from the Home Agents List.

   o  The preference for this home agent; higher values indicate a more
      preferable home agent.  The preference value is taken from the
      Home Agent Preference field in the received Router Advertisement,
      if the Router Advertisement contains a Home Agent Information
      Option, and is otherwise set to the default value of 0.  A home
      agent uses this preference in ordering the Home Agents List when
      it sends an ICMP Home Agent Address Discovery message.

   Here we extend Home Agents List to support load balance mechanism,
   so it can share the traffic information among the home agents
   in the home network to make decisions of home agent Reassignment. 
   To do so, Home Agents List has been extended to indicate the traffic
   load level of all home agents in the home network.

   The entry has been added to Home Agent Lists related to traffic load
   information is:

   A.	Queue Size
   The traffic load indicates the buffer size at a home agent. When
   the buffer size of a home agent is lower than a threshold, the 
   buffer size is considered to be LIGHT.

INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-deng-mip6-ha-loadbalance-01.txt       April 2004   


   B.	Registered MN Number at a HA
   
   The home agent should monitor its queue size and the registered 
   mobile node number. Each home agent periodically broadcasts its
   traffic load information to all the other home agents in the home
   network throuth the router advertisement. 
   
6.  Modified Router Advertisement message 
   
   Here we extend the Unsolicited Router Advertisement Messages to
   include traffic load information. A new option - called traffic
   load - is embedded into the Option field of Unsolicited Router
   Advertisement Messages. 
      
   Routers send out Router Advertisement message periodically, or in
   response to a Router Solicitation.

      Router Lifetime
                     16-bit unsigned integer.  The lifetime associated
                     with the default router in units of seconds.  The
                     maximum value corresponds to 18.2 hours.  A
                     Lifetime of 0 indicates that the router is not a
                     default router and SHOULD NOT appear on the default
                     router list.  The Router Lifetime applies only to

                     message fields or options.  Options that need time
                     limits for their information include their own
                     lifetime fields.

      Prefix Information
                     These options specify the prefixes that are on-link
                     and/or are used for address autoconfiguration.  A
                     router SHOULD include all its on-link prefixes
                     (except the link-local prefix) so that multihomed
                     hosts have complete prefix information about on-
                     link destinations for the links to which they
                     attach.  If complete information is lacking, a
                     multihomed host may not be able to choose the
                     correct outgoing interface when sending traffic to
                     its neighbors.

   In the Prefix Information option for use in Router Advertisement
   1-bit router address flag Must be set to guarantee Prefix field
   containing a complete a global IPv6 address of this home agent.
   of The added Option field in the router advertisement should be as
   follows.

7 New Load Balance Information Option Format

   Load Balance among multiple home agents defines a new Load Balance
   Information option, used in Router Advertisements sent by a home
   agent to advertise information specific to this router's
   functionality as a home agent.  The format of the Load Balance
   Information option is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Type

   Length

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including the
      type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of this
      field MUST be 1.

INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-deng-mip6-ha-loadbalance-01.txt       April 2004   


   Reserved

      This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Queue Size (2 byte):          
           
      A coarse parameter for the Queue Size in the router's TLT
                                         
   Registered MN Number (2 byte):        
  
      Registered MN number. If more than 256 MN could register a HA, 
      the field should be a coarse paramter for the MN number in the
      router's TLT
                                         
   Unsolicited Router Advertisement messages should be sent at time 
   uniformly distributed within [MinRtrAdvInterval, MaxRtrAdvInterval] 
   according to [8].
   
   To make the traffic information more effective, the Unisolicited 
   Router Advertisement message with the Traffic Load information 
   should be sent at time uniformly distributed with in 
   [MinRtrAdvInterval, MinRtrAdvInterval + IntervalTLTExtention].
   
   IntervalTLTExtention = 2 * MinRtrAdvInterval

   Upon receiving the Router Advertisement with the Traffic Load 
   Information from other home agent, a home agent should record 
   the traffic load into the its extended Home Agents List. The home
   agent keeps the Home Agents List sorted in a non-ascending order
   of the traffic load field, unless the traffic load is LIGHT. 
   For the LIGHT home agent, the Home Agents List is sorted in a
   non-ascending order of the registered mobile node number.

   In this protocol, the Queue Size field is used to make decisions for
   home agent reassignment to release the traffic burden, while the 
   registered mobile node number field is used to prevent the formation
   of the traffic burden.

   Home agents MAY include this option in their Router Advertisements.
   This option MUST be silently ignored for other Neighbor Discovery
   messages.



8.  Home Agent Reassignments

   In this protocol, at each home agent, a timer is attached for each
   entry in the binding update cache. When the timer is time out, the
   mobile node corresponding to the entry is considered to be eligible
   for home agent reassignment. The timeout time is called RegTIMEOUT.


Deng, Zhang, Huang, Zhang         Expires: October 2004         [Page 9]
  
INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-deng-mip6-ha-loadbalance-01.txt       April 2004   

   
   RegTIMEOUT = MinRtrAdvInterval / Queue Size Indicator
   
   Queue Size Indicator is a paramter indicating the traffic load.
   
   The home agent may select a new home agent in the Home Agents List 
   for the timeout mobile node according to our home agent reassignment 
   algorithm. If a new home agent is assigned to the timeout mobile 
   node, the home agent actively sends out an ICMP Reply message to the 
   mobile node without the reception of any ICMP Request message. 
   Different from the standard ICMP reply packet, the ICMP here should 
   only contain one home agent in the home agent list, which is the 
   newly selected home agent, other than contains a list home agent. 
   By receiving this ICMP message, the timeout mobile node should 
   compare the indicated home agent with its old home agent. If the 
   indicated home agent in the ICMP Reply message is different from the 
   old home agent, the mobile node should modify its home agent field 
   and register at the new home agent by sending a binding update 
   message to the new home agent IP address. 
   
   By using the ICMP messages in the DHAAD mechanism, this protocol can
   be implemented in the IETF Mobile IPv6 draft without any changing of
   the protocols of the communication between home agents and mobile
   nodes.
   
   The frequency of selecting a new home agent for the mobile node is a
   tradeoff between the home agent handoff frequency and the load
   balance performance. The home agent should not frequently select a
   new home agent for the registered mobile node, because the home 
   agent handoff induces extra control traffic and delays the traffic
   forwarding to the mobile nodes. Thus only a very busy home agent or
   a potentially very busy home agent should proceed to the home agent
   handoff.

   When selecting a new home agent, the new home agent should be one of
   the most released home agents in the Traffic Load Table. There are
   two fields in the traffic load table should be considered in the
   home agent selection algorithm. One is the Queue Size field, which
   indicates the current traffic load. Another one is the registered
   mobile node number, which indicates the potential traffic load in
   the future. The home agent should prevent from having too many 
   registered mobile nodes, so that the future traffic burden formed by
   the tunneled traffic for the registered mobile nodes could be prevented.

   The new HA Reassignment algorithm is as follows.
   Algorithm. HA Reassignment
   IF (Self Queue Size > LIGHT) THEN
      IF (Other HA Queue Size < LIGHT) THEN
         Randomly select a HA with LIGHT Queue.
      ELSE IF (Self Queue Size is top 10% in the traffic table) THEN
         Randomly select a bottom 10% home agent in the traffic table
      END

   ELSE THEN
      IF (my registered MN number is top 10% in the traffic table) THEN
         Randomly select a bottom 10% home agent in the traffic table.
      END
   END

   In the home agent reassignment, only one of the most busy home
   agents can select a new home agent for its registered mobile node.
   Thus the new home agent assignment does not take place frequently.
   In Mobile IPv6, a mobile node only needs the home agent to tunnel
   the data traffic before the Correspondent Binding Update Procedure
   take place, when the mobile node is moving from one network to
   another network. Thus a home agent who has more number of registered
   mobile nodes is more likely to experience tunnel traffic because
   more mobile nodes potentially will move from one network to another
   network. This protocol can force a home agent to start the new home
   agent assignment even though the home agent does not experience much
   traffic, so that the future traffic burden could be prevented
   statistically.

9.  Prevention of Duplicate Home Agent Assignments

   The home agent reassignment may induce duplicate home agent
   assignments. When a mobile node subsequently sends more than one
   binding updates to the old home agent, the home agent may have
   different decisions on selecting the new home agent for the same
   mobile node. When the duplicate home agent assignment occurs, only
   the last new home agent is regarded as the new home agent of the
   mobile node. The mobile node will only process its Mobile IPv6
   tasks with the latest assigned new home agent, while other
   duplicate home agents assigned to the mobile node still sit in the
   home network without further updates from the mobile node. This
   situation is not allowed to happen, because the duplicate home
   agents cannot correctly forward the traffic to the mobile node
   without the updates from the mobile node.
   
   To uniquely assign a home agent for the mobile node, the home
   agent should maintain a Home Agent Handoff Table. The Handoff
   Table is used to record whether a mobile node has been handed over
   to another HA in a quite recent time. And if that is the case, it
   should discover which HA is the last HA assigned to the mobile
   node. Thus the last assigned HA will still be the HA assigned for
   the mobile node this time. An entry of the Handoff Table has
   following fields.   

   Mobile Node Address              This field represents the IP 
                                    address of a registered mobile
                                    node, which sends binding updates
                                    to the home agent periodically.

   Handing Off (true/false)         This field represents whether a 
                                    mobile node has been handed over 
                                    to another HA in a quite recent 
                                    time. If that is the case, the 
                                    mobile node should be assigned to 
                                    the same home agent as last 
                                    assignment.
                                    
   New Home Agent Address           This field records the last home
                                    agent assigned to a registered 
                                    mobile node. It avoids duplicate
                                    home agent assignments.
                                    
   Handoff Expire Time              This field represents whether the
                                    Handing Off field of this entry is 
                                    valid. If the handoff timer has 
                                    expired, the handing off field of 
                                    this entry is invalid.

   Before the home agent select a home agent for the registering
   mobile node, the home agent should check the Home Agent Handoff
   Table.

   If anyone of the following conditions is true, the mobile node
   should be regarded as eligible to select a new home agent.

   1.   There is no entry for the mobile node in the handoff table.
   2.   Handing off field is false. Thus the mobile node has not been 
        handed over to another HA in a quite recent time.
   3.   Handoff expire time is before the current time.

   If the mobile node is eligible to be assigned a new home agent,
   the home agent selects a new home agent and writes an entry for
   the mobile node into the Home Agent Handoff Table. The handing off
   field should be set true, and expire time should cover the
   subsequent several binding updates of the mobile nodes.   

   If the mobile node is illegible to a new home agent assignment,
   the home agent assigned to the mobile node should be the new home
   agent address in the Home Agent Handoff Table, or the home agent
   itself in case of no entry being found.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one new Neighbor Discovery [8] options,
   which must be assigned Option Type values within the option numbering
   space for Neighbor Discovery messages:
