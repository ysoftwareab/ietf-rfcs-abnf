1. Terminology

   This document follows the nomenclature of the MPLS Architecture
   defined in [RFC3031] and [LOOSE-REOPT].

1.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations

   This document follows the nomenclature defined in [LOOSE-REOPT]
   New add :

   local reoptimization: optimize a tunnel by loose node, not the
   ingress nodes.

   loose area: the traffic engineering area between loose nodes.

2. Introduction

   This document defines a mechanism for the reoptimization of loosely
   routed MPLS and GMPLS (Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching)
   Traffic Engineering LSPs signaled with RSVP-TE (see [RFC3209] and
   [RFC3473]).  A loosely routed LSP , defined in [LOOSE-REOPT],
   that does not contain a full explicit route identifying each
   LSR along the path of the LSP at the time it is signaled by the
   ingress LSR. Such an LSP is signaled with no ERO, with an ERO that
   contains at least one loose hop, or with an ERO that contains an
   abstract node that is not a simple abstract node (that is, an
   abstract node that identifies more than one LSR).

   Although, IETF provides a method to solve the reoptimization of
   loosely routed TE LSP, [LOOSE-REOPT], which is when the loose node
   finds the more optimal path, it will use notify message to inform
   the TE LSP head-end, then TE LSP head-end use the method of  "make
   before break" to create a new tunnel. when the new tunnel is  
   created successfully, then TE LSP head-end will delete the old path.
   But this method has some problems. Firstly, if loose node is far
   away form TE LSP head-end, there are some middle nodes between TE
   LSP head-end and the loose node, and the signal of reoptimization
   will spend long time, at the same time, the middle nodes which do
   not have more optimal path have to compute path also, and this will
   increase the signaling load of the whole network. Secondly, the
   loose node needs to inform the ingress LSR that the tunnel needs to
   be re-optimized, but the notify message may be lost. Although using
   reliable message is a good idea, but all of the nodes on the tunnel
   must support reliable message. So, based on these problems, this
   document suggests loose node re-optimization method locally, which
   can resolve these problems properly.

   This document supposes that the readers of the document are familiar

   with [LOOSE-REOPT], and in order to preserve integrity, the document
   cites narration from [LOOSE-REOPT].

   An example of an explicit loosely routed TE LSP signaling.

   <---area 1--><-area 0--><-area 2->

    R1---R2----R3---R6    R8---R10
     |          |    |   / | \  |
     |          |    |  /  |  \ |
     |          |    | /   |   \|
    R4---------R5---R7----R9---R11

   Assumptions
   - R3, R5, R8 and R9 are ABRs
   - The path of an inter-area TE LSP T1 from R1 (head-end LSR) to R11
    (tail-end LSR) is defined on R1 as the following loosely routed
     path: R1-R3(loose)-R8(loose)-R11(loose).  R3, R8 and R11 are
     defined as loose hops.
   - the loose area : from R3 to R8

   This document provides a method of local reoptimization of loose
   nodes will affect few nodes compareing with [LOOSE-REOPT]. When 
   a more optimal path appears at loose area (between R3 and R8), 
   messages of reoptimization will only signal between loose nodes, 
   for example R3 and R8, that is, upstream node (R3) will signal 
   messages of reoptimization to the downstream loose node (R8) , and 
   the downsteam loose node will not send message to other nodes,and 
   the ingress node (R1) does not need to do more extra work. The 
   ingress node may using RROs to record the new path which the 
   tunnel is passing, and show it to the user.
   
   This document provides a method of using methord of PATH refresh to
   implement roptimization, not using the method of "make-before
   break".This method will also decrease the works of the head-end.

   The mechanism which provided by this document is not give a denial
   to the methord of [LOOSE-REOPT], it can be supplement of
   [LOOSE-REOPT]. The loose node can choice the local reoptimization,
   and also can use the mothord in [LOOSE-REOPT].

3. Signaling extensions

   A new flag in the RECORD_ROUTE object and new value sub-codes in 
   the attributes flags TLV are proposed in this document.(to be 
   assigned by IANA).

      Length
     
         The length of the value field in bytes.  Thus, if no Value
         field is present the Length field contains the value zero.
         Each Value field must be zero padded at the end to take it
         up to a four byte boundary -- the padding is not included in
         the length so that a one byte value would be encoded in an
         eight byte TLV with Length field set to one.
  
      Value
  
         Local reoptimization desire  0x01
     
         This value permits transit routers to use a local
         reoptimization mechanism .When a more optimal path is
         detected , loose node may optimize tunnel between the
         loose node locally. The transit routers which are loose
         node will process this value. If the loose node which
         not supporting local reoptimization, must ignore this
         value, else must express in the RERORD_REROUTE object.
         This value must appear only in the PATH message, and
         only loose transit nodes have to process this value.
     
         Local reoptimization in use 0x02
     
         This value indicates that the message with this value,is the
         local reoptimization message, and the node which supporting
         local reoptimization must process  the message correctly. 
         This value can appear in the messages by RFC2205 defined.
         This TLV may appear in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES,and may appear
         in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES,but it is not suggested to
         appear in both at the same time.This document suggests that
         because local reoptimization is not mandatory function, so 
         the value of 0x01 should not appear in the

         LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES.
         
         In the local reoptimization , the tunnel ingress indicates that
         the tunnel need local reoptimization using the value 0x01 of
         LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES in PATH message, the transit nodes
         record information of local reoptimization, then response to
         the ingress node that it support this function.
     
         Local reoptimization delete 0x04
     
         This value indicates that the message with this value, is the
         local reoptimization message, and the node which supporting
         local reoptimization must should end the local reptimization 
         process, for example, delete the PSB or the RSB save in local  
         node. The value should appear in the PATH TEAR or RESV TEAR  
         messages of the local reoptimization. 
         

 3.2. RRO IPv4/IPv6 Sub-object Flags

   Extend RRO IPv4/IPv6 sub-objectFlags, new add
 
   Local reoptimization support   0x80

   This new flag indicates that the node which has the IP address
   supports local reoptimization function. When the node discovers more
   optimal path, it will reoptimize the tunnel which with "Local
   reoptimization desire" value in the loose area.

4. Mode of operation

4.1. Head-end reoptimization control

   The tunnel ingress may indicates that this tunnel permit
   reoptimization locally, by user config. If the tunnel need local
   reoptimization, the ingress must set "Local reoptimization desire"
   value in the PATH message.

   This value of "Local reoptimization desire" may appear in the 
   Attributes Flags TLV of LSP_ATTRIBUTES, or in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES. 
   This document suggests that the value should be included in the  
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES. If one of the two objects has the value in the sub TLV,  
   it indicates that the tunnel need to be reoptimized locally, when receiving 
   PATH message.       
   
4.1.1. process PATH message

   When receiving the PATH message from upstream node, The transit nodes



cui                Expires: Jan. 2008                       [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     draft-cui-ccamp-te-loose-reopt-local-01   Jul.2008


   should decide that if the tunnel is permited to local reoptimization.
   
   If the tunnel has "Local reoptimization desire" value in the PATH
   message, and at the same time, if the transit node is loose route
   node of this tunnel, that means the transit node can reoptimize this
   tunnel locally but not reoptimize this tunnel by the ingress node.
   Because the value of "Local reoptimization vesire" may appper in the
   Attributes Flags TLV of LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_ATTRIBUTES,
   so the process of the PATH message must abide by RFC4420.

4.1.2. process RESV message

    When receiving RESV message from the downstream node,the transit
    nodes should set the value of "Local reoptimization surpport" in  
    the RRO. Then the ingress can know the information about where 
    can support local reoptimization, that means which nodes have the  
    ability to reoptimize the tunnel locally. 

4.2. Processing after reoptimization triggers

   When a new TE link appears or bandwidth of TE link increases, this
   indicates that maybe a shorter path appears in the loose area. This
   information may be flooded in the traffic engineering area by IGP
   protocols. The traffic engineering area may be a area in the OSPF
   or a level in the ISIS.

   The loose node gets that information from IGP, if the loose node
   supports the method of local reoptimizaiton, it will re-compute
   tunnel through it by using CSPF. The loose node computes the path
   which the destination may be egress of the tunnel or may be another
   loose node. If CSPF compute successfully , loose node compares the
   new path with the old path which is using by the tunnel.

   If the new path is more optimal than the old one ,the loose node
   will signal the tunnel and complete reoptimization. If the loose 
   node does not support the local reoptimizaiton, this document 
   suggests that the loose node should send information to the tunnel 
   ingress or reoptimize the tunnel by using the methord in the  
   [LOOSE-REOPT].
   
   The transit nodes in the loose area will maintain the regular 
   refresh for the old path when processint the local reoptimization
   message.
 
4.2.1. Process PATH message

   Loose node sends the new PATH message, and some objects in the PATH
   message must be modified, the objects are ERO, HOP object and add 



cui                Expires: Jan. 2008                       [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     draft-cui-ccamp-te-loose-reopt-local-01   Jul.2007


   new object of LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES. LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES must 
   be include in the PATH message. If PSB has saved 
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES of the old path, then the new path must not 
   add this object again. The LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES must include 
   Attributes Flags TLV, and set value of "Local reoptimization in use" 
   in this sub-TLV. 
 
   The loose node computes the new explicit routes between the loose 
   area, that means that the destination is not the egress node but 
   loose node in the path. These new strict routes which computed by 
   CSPF are added into the new ERO, that means that the new ERO only 
   include the strict routes between the loose area and the last ERO 
   subobjects MUST be the destination loose node which should be set 
   loose node. The old explicit routes will be save the the loose node
   and not be deleted until the reoptimation of the tunnel success.

   The loose node may be modify the HOP object. If the new path has  
   new interface compare the old one, HOP object should be modified.  
   And the loose node should save the new objects for using local  
   reoptimation templately.
  
   When receiving the new PATH message, the transit nodes in the loose
   area must decide if there have PSB corresponding to the new PATH
   message. If there does not have corresponding PSB, then the transit
   nodes must create a new PSB for the new coming PATH message, save
   PATH message information, and express that the new coming message is
   the message of optimization, and send PATH message to downstream 
   node according to ERO; if there have PSB, then transit nodes MUST 
   save the HOP and new ERO of the new coming PATH message, at the same 
   time, mark reoptimizition flag to the these objects, but don't delete
   the old objects, and send PATH message to downstream nodtes according
   to the new ERO. 
   
   The destination of the local reoptimizaiton receives the new PATH 
   message, it knows that this PATH message is the reoptimization  
   message by the "Local reoptimization in use" value and it will find  
   that the last ERO subojects in the ERO subobjects in the new coming 
   message is same with itself adress . Then the destination loose node  
   will not send the PATH message to downstream nodes. The destination  
   loose node will send RESV message along the path of new PATH message 
   , and the RESV message MUST set the "Local reoptimization in use" 
   value in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES. 

   If the transit nodes don't not support the vale of "Local
   reoptimization in use", the PATH ERROR message MUST be sent to the
   local reoptimization ingress, and drop the new coming PATH message.
   The reoptimization ingress, which is signal the reoptimization
   message, receives the PATH ERROR message, should not process local

   reoptimization any more, it can make choice to send information to
   the tunnel ingress or just keep silence or use the methord of 
   reoptimation in the [LOOSE-REOPT].

4.2.2.  Process  RESV message

   When receiving RESV message with the "Local reoptimization in use"
   value in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES, the transit node in the loose 
   area knows that the RESV message is the local reoptimization message 
   but not regular RESV refresh message.

   When processing the RESV message, because the message is the local
   reoptimization message, the transit node should send RESV message
   along the path of local reoptimization. In this document, if the
   RESV message of local reoptimization has the same outgoing 
   interface with old RESV message of the tunnel, and the style of 
   tunnel is SE style, the reservation must to be do once.

   When ingress node of local reoptimization receives the first coming
   RESV message, it switches the traffic on the new path ,and then sends
   PATH TEAR message with the the "Local reoptimization in use" value
   in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES.

   If errors are to be found when processing the RESV message, the node
   MUST send RESV ERROR message, and drop the RESV message.

4.2.3 Process TEAR message
   The ingress node of local reoptimization will send new PATH TEAR 
   message to downstream nodes when it receives the RESV message from 
   the new path. It can find the value of "the Local reoptimization 
   in use" in the Attributes Flags TLV of LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES from
   the new come RESV message. Then it will send new PATH TEAR message to
   delete the old path. When the new PATH TEAR message is created 
   successfully, send along the old path, ingress node of local 
   reoptimization send this message with the "the Local reoptimization 
   in use" value in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES which 
   depend on the old PSB save which one. 
   
   If the ingress node receives the RESV TEAR message with the value of  
   "the Local reoptimization in use", it will send the PATH TEAR 
   messassage along the new path of reoptimization, MUST set the value 
    "the Local reoptimization delete " in the  Attributes Flags TLV of 
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES.

   After receiving the PATH TEAR message, the transit node should decide
   which path the new coming PATH TEAR message want to delete, that is  
   the old one or the new reoptimizate one. If the PSB dest not exist,
    the transit node should drop the message as RFC3209 requires. If 



cui                Expires: Jan. 2008                       [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     draft-cui-ccamp-te-loose-reopt-local-01   Jul.2007


   the PSB exists, then the transit node other information according 
   to the PATH TEAR message. If the PSB has reoptimization information,
   and the same time, the transit nodes find the value of "the Local 
   reoptimization in use", then it will send the PATH TEAR message of  
   local reoptimization along the old path ; else if it find the value 
   of "the Local reoptimization delete", it will send the PATH TEAR 
   message along the new path. Then the transit node  must replace the 
   ERO and HOP of local reoptimzation with old one, HOP object may be
   to that also.

   If PSB has not reoptimization information, and the same time, the 
   transit node find the value of "the Local reoptimization delete",
   it should drop the message. The transit node with no reoptimization
   information should process the PATH TEAR message as  RFC3209 defines.

   The destination node of local reoptimization receive the PATH TEAR 
   message with "the Local reoptimization in use" value or "the Local 
   reoptimization delete", it MUST not send the PATH TEAR message to 
   downsteam nodes.
   
   If receiving the PATH TEAR message with no value of "local 
   reoptimization in use" or "the Local reoptimization delete" value,
   the nodes must process the incoming message normally. At the same 
   time, the node which is has the information of local reoptimization
   MUST send PATH TEAR message out along reoptimization path, which  
   with the the "Local reoptimization delete" value in the 
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES.
   
   If receiving the RESV TEAR message with reoptimation, the destionation
   of the local reoptiomization should send PATH ERROR message with 
   "local reoptimization in use " along the new path to the ingress of 
   the local reoptimization. the ingress of the local reoptimization.

4.3 Process ERROR message

   The ingress node of local reoptimization, which signaling
   reoptimization message, receives the PATH ERROR message with "local 
   reoptimization in use ", and should knows that the reoptimzation  
   fail, then should send PATH TEAR message to delete the path created 
   by local reoptimization along the new path with the value of "local 
   reoptimization delete".

   For the RESV ERROR message with local reotpimization flag, the
   destination of local reoptimization should send PATH ERROR message
   to the ingress of local reoptimizaiton with "local reoptimization 
   in use ".
