Internet-Draft           IANA IAX Considerations            October 2008


Abstract

   This document establishes the IANA registries for IAX, the Inter-
   Asterisk eXchange protocol, an application-layer control and media
   protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions
   over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.  IAX was developed by the open
   source community for the Asterisk PBX and is targeted primarily at
   Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used
   with streaming video or any other type of multimedia.

Internet-Draft           IANA IAX Considerations            October 2008


1.  Introduction

   IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) is an "all in one" protocol for
   handling multimedia in IP networks.  It combines both control and
   media services in the same protocol.  In addition, IAX uses a single
   UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address
   Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other
   protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall
   management.  IAX employs a compact encoding which decreases bandwidth
   usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service.  In
   addition, its open nature permits new payload types additions needed
   to support additional services.

   This document specifies and provides the initial values for the
   creation of the IAX-related IANA registries as per [RFC5226].

2.  IANA Considerations

   The IAX protocol, as defined in [IAX], defines 15 namespaces that
   require registration.  These namespaces are described below.

   Each of these namespaces utilize an 'Expert Review' for extension.
   Documentation of new values is not mandated as RFCs.  The expert
   review should be guided by a few common sense considerations.  For
   example, new values should not be specific to a country, region,
   organization, or company; they should be well- defined and widely
   recognized.

2.1.  Meta Command

   Registry Name: IAX Meta Commands

   Required Information for New Values: Name, description, and relevant
   security considerations, if any.

   Description: See Section 8.1.3.2 of [IAX].

   Valid Range: 0x01-x7F.

   Display format: hex.

   The following table specifies the Initial Assignments of Meta Command
                                  values:

   +------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
   | TYPE | Name            | Description                              |
   +------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
   | 0x01 | Trunk Meta      | Indicates that frame is a trunk meta     |
   |      | Frame           | frame.                                   |
   +------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+

2.2.  Frame Types

   Registry Name: IAX Frame Types

   Required Information for New Values: Name, description, and relevant
   security considerations, if any.  In addition, the definition and
   description of subclasses.

   Description: See Section 8.2 of [IAX].

   Valid Range: 0x01-xFF.

   Display format: hex.
