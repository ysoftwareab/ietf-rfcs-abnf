Abstract

   The use of mail enabled applications such as calendaring and
   scheduling has grown considerably in the last decade. Enterprise and
   inter-enterprise business has become dependent on rapid scheduling of
   events and actions using this information technology. The store-and-
   forward characteristic of electronic messaging technologies has been
   shown to be complementary to the asynchronous nature of group
   communications. However, the longer term growth of mail enabled
   applications, such as calendaring and scheduling, is currently
   limited by the lack of Internet standards for the message content
   types that these groupware applications are based on. This
   specification is intended to progress the level of interoperability
   possible between dissimilar calendaring and scheduling applications
   that communicate using an SMTP or MIME transport.

   This specification defines a usage profile for the MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type [MIME-CAL]. Any MIME based calendaring
   and scheduling application that supports this MIME Calendaring and
   Scheduling Content Type profile will be able to interoperate with
   other MIME based calendaring and scheduling applications using a
   broad range of scheduling functions.

1. Introduction

   This specification defines a usage profile for the MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type [MIME-CAL]. [MIME-CAL] provides for the
   capture and exchange of information normally stored within a
   calendaring and scheduling application; such as a Personal
   Information Manager or a Group Scheduling product. The usage profile
   defines a set of MIME messages that form the basis for a message
   based protocol that supports a wide range of group scheduling
   capabilities. These capabilities include the ability to negotiate,
   schedule, modify, delegate and cancel calendar events or todos; as
   well as, request and reply with free/busy time data.

                                    data


1.2 Message Protocol Summary

   This usage profile provides for calendaring and scheduling operations
   including: requesting, replying to, modifying, canceling and
   delegating either an event or todo calendar component. In addition,


Dawson                             4                   Expires May 1997


Internet Draft       MIME C&S Content Type Profile     October 31, 1996


   the profiles provide for the request for and reply of free/busy time
   data. These functions are supported through the use of a simple
   message based protocol, as defined by this profile.

   The calendaring and scheduling capabilities are implemented by a
   request-and-reply form of message exchange. For example, an
   appointment type of event would be created between two individual by
   one individual, acting as the event _owner_,  sending an
   EVENT/REQUEST message to the other individual. The recipient of the
   event request message would confirm or decline the proposed
   appointment with an EVENT/REPLY message. A todo or action item could
   similarly be assigned with a TODO/REQUEST and TODO/REPLY message
   sequence. And, a free/busy time data representation of an interval of
   an individual's calendar can be retrieved by a FREE-BUSY/REQUEST and
   FREE-BUSY/REPLY message sequence. More sophisticated scheduling
   operations such as negotiating an appointment request is also
   supported with request-and-reply using the EVENT/COUNTER and
   EVENT/REPLACE or EVENT/DECLINE-COUNTER message sequences between a
   recipient of an EVENT/REQUEST and the _owner_ and/or _organizer_ of
   the event. Similarly, a todo can be negotiated between two
   individuals using the analogous todo component message types.

   The recipient of an event or a todo request can also request an
   updated or duplicate copy of the calendar component description with
   the EVENT/RESEND or TODO/RESENT message types. These messages are
   sent from the recipient of a existing event or todo request to the
   _owner_ and/or _organizer_ of the corresponding event or todo. The
   _owner_ and/or _organizer_ of the calendar component would reply with
   the EVENT/REPLACE or the TODO/REPLACE message type.

   A number of the calendaring and scheduling capabilities defined by
   this usage profile are based a single message exchange, rather than a
   request-and-reply message sequence. For example, an _owner_ or
   _organizer_ of an event or todo can modify a subset of the details of
   the calendar component with the EVENT/MODIFY or TODO/MODIFY message
   types. The complete set of calendar component details can be replaced
   with the EVENT/REPLACE or TODO/REPLACE message types. An event or an
   assigned todo can be canceled by the _owner_ and/or _organizer_ of
   the calendar component with the EVENT/CANCEL or the TODO/CANCEL
   message types.

2. Intended Use

   This usage profile defines a sequence of MIME message types that
   provide for a broad set of scheduling operations. The following
   scenarios provide a limited summary of some of the intended use of
   these messages. Refer to the MIME message segments in section 5 for a
   more detailed set of examples.

5.3 Event/request based on free-busy time search results

   The following example illustrates using free-busy time results to
   schedule an event with a group of individuals. The message sequence
   involves a free-busy/request from the orginator to a group of
   potential group of meeting attendees. The recipients return free/busy
   time results with the free-busy/reply message. The originator uses
   this information to generate an event/request. The messages are sent
   as singular _text/calendar_ content type, body parts.

   The following message segment is a free/busy time request to a group
   of potential meeting attendees.

   The following two message segment are the resultant free/busy time
   data replies from the two potential meeting attendees. The two reply
   messages assume that the originator had access privileges within the
   recipient calendaring and scheduling applications to get the returned
   information. The first message segment is the free-busy/reply from
   the first recipient. Notice that the first recipient's calendaring
   and scheduling application only returns free time data.
