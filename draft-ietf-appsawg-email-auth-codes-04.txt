                   Email Authentication Status Codes
                 draft-ietf-appsawg-email-auth-codes-04

Abstract

   There is at present no way to return a status code to an email client
   that indicates a message is being rejected or deferred specifically
   because of email authentication failures.  This document registers
   codes for this purpose.

Internet-Draft           Email Auth Status Codes               July 2014


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3463] introduced Enhanced Mail System Status Codes, and [RFC5248]
   created an IANA registry for these.

   [RFC6376] and [RFC7208] introduced, respectively, DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF), two
   protocols for conducting message authentication.  Another common
   email acceptance test is the reverse Domain Name System (DNS) check
   on an email client's IP address, as described in Section 3 of
   [RFC7001].

   The current set of enhanced status codes does not include any code
   for indicating that a message is being rejected or deferred due to
   local policy reasons related to any of these mechanisms.  This is
   potentially useful information to agents that need more than
   rudimentary handling information about the reason a message was
   rejected on receipt.  This document introduces enhanced status codes
   for reporting those cases to clients.

   This document updates [RFC7208] as new enhanced status codes relevant
   to that specification are being registered.

2.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  New Enhanced Status Codes

   The following new enhanced status codes are defined:

3.1.  DKIM Failure Codes


      Code:               X.7.20
      Sample Text:        No valid DKIM signature found
      Associated basic status code:  550
      Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                          did not contain a valid DKIM signature,
                          contrary to local policy requirements.
                          (Note that this violates the advice of
                          Section 6.1 of RFC6376.)

      Sample Text:        No valid author-aligned DKIM signature found
      Associated basic status code:  550
      Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                          did not contain a valid DKIM signature
                          whose identifier(s) match the address(es)
                          found in the From header field, contrary to
                          local policy requirements.  (Note that this
                          violates the advice of Section 6.1 of
                          RFC6376.)

      Code:               X.7.22
      Sample Text:        SPF validation failed
      Associated basic status code:  550
      Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                          completed an SPF check that produced a
                          "fail" result, contrary to local policy
                          requirements.  Used in place of 5.7.1 as
                          described in Section 8.4 of RFC7208.
      Reference:          [this document]; RFC7208

      Code:               X.7.23
      Sample Text:        SPF validation error
      Associated basic status code:  451/550
      Description:        This status code is returned when evaluation
                          of SPF relative to an arriving message
                          resulted in an error.  Used in place of
                          4.4.3 or 5.5.2 as described in Sections
                          8.6 and 8.7 of RFC7208.

4.  General Considerations

   By the nature of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), only one
   enhanced status code can be returned for a given exchange between
   client and server.  However, an operator might decide to defer or
   reject a message for a plurality of reasons.  Clients receiving these
   codes need to consider that the failure reflected by one of these
   status codes might not reflect the only reason, or the most important
   reason, for non-acceptance of the message or command.

   It is important to note that Section 6.1 of [RFC6376] discourages
   special treatment of messages bearing no valid DKIM signature.  There
   are some operators that disregard this advice, a few of which go so
   far as to require a valid Author Domain signature (that is, one
   matching the domain(s) in the From header field) in order to accept
   the message.  Moreover, some nascent technologies built atop SPF and
   DKIM depend on such authentications.  This work does not endorse
   configurations that violate DKIM's recommendations, but rather
   acknowledges that they do exist and merely seeks to provide for
   improved interoperability with such operators.

   A specific use case for these codes is mailing list software, which

Internet-Draft           Email Auth Status Codes               July 2014


   processes rejections in order to remove from the subscriber set those
   addresses that are no longer valid.  There is a need in that case to
   distinguish authentication failures versus indications that the
   recipient address is no longer valid.

   When multiple authentication methods fail, the SMTP server SHOULD use
   the code that indicates multiple methods failed rather than only the
   first one that failed.  It may be the case that one method is always
   expected to fail, and thus returning that method's specific code is
   not information useful to the sending agent.

   The reverse IP DNS check is defined in Section 2.6.3 of [RFC7001].

5.  Security Considerations

   Use of these codes reveals local policy with respect to email
   authentication, which can be useful information to actors attempting
   to deliver undesirable mail.  It should be noted that there is no
   specific obligation to use these codes; if an operator wishes not to
   reveal this aspect of local policy, it can continue using a generic
   result code such as 5.7.7, 5.7.1, or even 5.7.0.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of new enhanced status codes, for addition to the SMTP
   Enhanced Status Codes Registry, can be found in Section 3.
