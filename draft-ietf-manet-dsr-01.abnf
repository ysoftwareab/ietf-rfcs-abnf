SegLft = the value of Segments Left when the packet was received
NumAddrs = the total number of addresses in the Routing Header

    1. The address of the next hop, Address[NumAddrs - SegLft + 1],
       is copied into the IP.Destination_Address of the packet.  The
       existing IP.Destination_Address is NOT copied back into the
       Address list of the Routing Header.

    2. The interface used to transmit the packet to its next hop from
       this node MUST be the interface denoted by Index[NumAddrs -
       SegLft + 1].

    3. If the Acknowledgment Request (R) bit is set, the node MUST
       transmit a packet containing the DSR Acknowledgment option to
       the previous hop, Address[NumAddrs - SegLft - 1], performing
       Route Discovery if necessary.  (Address[0] is taken as the
       IP.Source_Address)

    4. Perform Route Maintenance by verifying that the packet was
       received by the next hop as described in Section 7.5.
m = number of addresses currently in the Route Request option
n = m + 1

d = H * (h - 1 + r)
