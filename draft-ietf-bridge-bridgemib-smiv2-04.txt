Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on

   the IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard between Local Area Network (LAN)
   segments.  Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.
   Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges
   connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.

   The MIB presented in this memo is a direct translation of the BRIDGE
   MIB defined in [RFC1493], to the SMIv2 syntax required for current
   IETF MIB standards.  This memo obsoletes RFC 1493.


1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].


    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate

Bridge Working Group            Expires May 2003          [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-bridge-bridgemib-smiv2-04.txt  Dec 03, 2002

   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Overview

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging; transparent and
   source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined in the
   IEEE 802.1D specification [IEEE8021D].  This memo defines those
   objects needed for the management of a bridging entity operating in
   the transparent mode, as well as some objects applicable to all types
   of bridges.

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as simple as possible.
   This was accomplished by applying the following criteria to objects
   proposed for inclusion:

   (1)  Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as
        further objects are needed.

   (2)  Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration
        management.

   (3)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

   (4)  Limit the total of objects.

   (5)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this
        or other MIBs.

   (6)  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  The
        guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section
        per layer.

2.1.  Structure of MIB

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.  Where
   appropriate the corresponding IEEE 802.1D [IEEE8021D] management
   object name is also included.

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   types of bridges.

   This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with
   respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.  If a node does not
   implemented the Spanning Tree Protocol, this group will not be
   implemented.

2.1.3.  The dot1dSr Group

   This group contains the objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to source route bridging.  If source routing is not supported
   this group will not be implemented.  This group is applicable to
   source route only, and SRT bridges.  This group will be described in
   a separate document applicable only to source route bridging.

2.1.4.  The dot1dTp Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to transparent bridging.  If transparent bridging is not
   supported this group will not be implemented.  This group is
   applicable to transparent only and SRT bridges.

2.1.5.  The dot1dStatic Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to destination-address filtering.  If destination-address
   filtering is not supported this group will not be implemented.  This
   group is applicable to any type of bridge which performs destination-
   address filtering.

2.2.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
   included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
   applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
   assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will also implement (at
   least) the 'system' group and the 'interfaces' group defined in MIB-
   II [RFC1213].

2.2.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

   In MIB-II [RFC1907], the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory
   for all systems such that each managed entity contains one instance
   of each object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to
   the entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole
   functionality is bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of
   the entity's functionality.

2.2.2.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group

   In the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863], the 'interfaces' group is
   defined as being mandatory for all systems and contains information
   on an entity's interfaces, where each interface is thought of as
   being attached to a `subnetwork'.  (Note that this term is not to be
   confused with `subnet' which refers to an addressing partitioning
   scheme used in the Internet suite of protocols.) The term 'segment'
   is used in this memo to refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an
   Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual
   circuit.

   Implicit in this Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each
   of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces'
   group, and in most situations, each port is associated with a

Bridge Working Group            Expires May 2003          [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-bridge-bridgemib-smiv2-04.txt  Dec 03, 2002

   different interface. However, there are situations in which multiple
   ports are associated with the same interface.  An example of such a
   situation would be several ports each corresponding one-to-one with
   several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same interface.

   Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has
   no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple
   case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding
   interface's interface number.  Port numbers are in the range
   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).

   Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through
   the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such
   situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface
   is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This
   subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of
   protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not
   being bridged. For example, in an entity which exclusively performed
   bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas
   in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only
   bridged other protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as
   being bridged.

   Thus, this Bridge MIB (and in particular, its counters) are
   applicable only to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces
   which is sent/received for a protocol being bridged.  All such data
   is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.

2.3.  Textual Conventions

   The datatypes, MacAddress, BridgeId and Timeout, are used as textual
   conventions in this document.  Objects defined using these
   conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that define
   their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
   necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted
   merely for the convenience of readers.

Timeout ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds.
        To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
        1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

            b = floor( (n * 256) / 100)

        where:
            floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
            n is the value in 1/100 second units
            b is the value in 1/256 second units

        To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
        1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

            n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)

        where:
            ceiling = quotient [if remainder is 0], or
                      quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
            n is the value in 1/100 second units
            b is the value in 1/256 second units

        Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
        done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first,
        divide second)."

4.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.


Bridge Working Group            Expires May 2003          [Page 33]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-ietf-bridge-bridgemib-smiv2-04.txt  Dec 03, 2002

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The MIB presented in this memo is a direct translation of the BRIDGE
   MIB defined in [RFC1493], to the SMIv2 syntax required for current
   IETF MIB standards.

   The original authors were E. Decker, P. Langille, A Rijsinghani and
   K. McCloghrie.  Further acknowledgement is given to the members of
   the original Bridge Working Group in [RFC1493].

   This document was produced on behalf of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   in the Operations and Management area of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   , especially Mike MacFadden and Bert Visscher for their many comments
   and suggestions which improved this effort.
