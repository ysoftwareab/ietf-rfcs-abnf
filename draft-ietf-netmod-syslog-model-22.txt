1.  Introduction

   Operating systems, processes and applications generate messages
   indicating their own status or the occurrence of events.  These
   messages are useful for managing and/or debugging the network and its
   services.  The BSD syslog protocol is a widely adopted protocol that
   is used for transmission and processing of the message.

   Since each process, application and operating system was written
   somewhat independently, there is little uniformity to the content of
   syslog messages.  For this reason, no assumption is made upon the
   formatting or contents of the messages.  The protocol is simply
   designed to transport these event messages.  No acknowledgement of
   the receipt is made.

   Essentially, a syslog process receives messages (from the kernel,
   processes, applications or other syslog processes) and processes
   them.  The processing may involve logging to a local file, and/or
   displaying on console, and/or relaying to syslog processes on other

   machines.  The processing is determined by the "facility" that
   originated the message and the "severity" assigned to the message by
   the facility.

   We are using definitions of syslog protocol from [RFC5424] in this
   RFC.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   The term "originator" is defined in [RFC5424]: an "originator"
   generates syslog content to be carried in a message.

   The term "relay" is defined in [RFC5424]: a "relay" forwards
   messages, accepting messages from originators or other relays and
   sending them to collectors or other relays

   The term "collectors" is defined in [RFC5424]: a "collector" gathers
   syslog content for further analysis.

   The term "action" refers to the processing that takes place for each
   syslog message received.

1.3.  NDMA Compliance

   The YANG model in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture defined in I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

1.4.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC) Editor)

   replaced with finalized values at the time of publication.  This note
   summarizes all of the substitutions that are needed.  No other RFC
   Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] configuration data model that
   may be used to configure the syslog feature running on a system.
   YANG models can be used with network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete the
   configuration of network devices.

   The data model makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows
   implementations to support only those syslog features that lie within
   their capabilities.

   This module can be used to configure the syslog application
   conceptual layers as implemented on the target system.

3.  Design of the Syslog Model

   The syslog model was designed by comparing various syslog features
   implemented by various vendors' in different implementations.

   This document addresses the common leafs between implementations and
   creates a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
   features, if necessary.  This model is designed to be very simple for
   maximum flexibility.

   Some optional features are defined in this document to specify
   functionality that is present in specific vendor configurations.

   Syslog consists of originators and collectors.  The following diagram
   shows syslog messages flowing from originators, to collectors where
   filtering can take place.

   Figure 1.  Syslog Processing Flow

   Collectors are configured using the leaves in the syslog model
   "actions" container which correspond to each message collector:

      console

      log file(s)

      remote relay(s)/collector(s)

   Within each action, a selector is used to filter syslog messages.  A
   selector consists of a list of one or more facility-severity matches,
   and, if supported via the select-match feature, an optional regular
   expression pattern match that is performed on the [RFC5424] field.

   A syslog message is processed if:

Internet-Draft              Syslog Management              February 2018


          There is an element of facility-list (F, S) where
              the message facility matches F
              and the message severity matches S
          and/or the message text matches the regex pattern (if it
              is present)

   The facility is one of a specific syslog-facility, or all facilities.

   The severity is one of type syslog-severity, all severities, or none.
   None is a special case that can be used to disable a filter.  When
   filtering severity, the default comparison is that messages of the
   specified severity and higher are selected to be logged.  This is
   shown in the model as "default equals-or-higher".  This behavior can
   be altered if the select-adv-compare feature is enabled to specify a
   compare operation and an action.  Compare operations are: "equals" to
   select messages with this single severity, or "equals-or-higher" to
   select messages of the specified severity and higher.  Actions are
   used to log the message or block the message from being logged.

   Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in
   their implementation.  An example is included in Extending Facilities
   (Appendix A.1).

5.  Usage Examples

      Requirement:
      Enable console logging of syslogs of severity critical

      Here is the example syslog configuration xml:
      <syslog xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog">
        <actions>
          <console>
            <facility-filter>
              <facility-list>
                <facility>all</facility>
                <severity>critical</severity>
              </facility-list>
            </facility-filter>
          </console>
        </actions>
      </syslog>

      Enable remote logging of syslogs to udp destination
      2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1 for facility auth, severity error

      <syslog xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog">
        <actions>
          <remote>
            <destination>
              <name>remote1</name>
              <udp>
                <address>2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1</address>
              </udp>
              <facility-filter>
                <facility-list>
                  <facility>auth</facility>
                  <severity>error</severity>
                </facility-list>
              </facility-filter>
            </destination>
          </remote>
        </actions>
      </syslog>

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

7.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7895].  Following the format in [RFC7950], the following
   registration is requested:

      name:         ietf-syslog
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog
      prefix:       ietf-syslog
      reference:    RFC zzzz


8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC6536]  provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes should be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in all network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,

Internet-Draft              Syslog Management              February 2018


   edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations and on network security.

   In addition there are data nodes that require careful analysis and
   review.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

      facility-filter/pattern-match:  When writing this node,
         implementations MUST ensure that the regular expression pattern
         match is not constructed to cause a regular expression denial
         of service attack due to a pattern that causes the regular
         expression implementation to work very slowly (exponentially
         related to input size).

      remote/destination/signing/cert-signer:  When writing this
         subtree, implementations MUST NOT specify a private key that is
         used for any other purpose.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      remote/destination/transport:  This subtree contains information
         about other hosts in the network, and the TLS transport
         certificate properties if TLS is selected as the transport
         protocol.

      remote/destination/signing:  This subtree contains information
         about the syslog message signing properties including signing
         certificate information.

   There are no RPC operations defined in this YANG module.

A.1.  Extending Facilities

   Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in
   their implementation.  Additional facilities may not work with the
   syslog protocol as defined in [RFC5424] and hence such facilities
   apply for local syslog-like logging functionality.

   The following is an example that shows how additional facilities
   could be added to the list of available facilities (in this example
   two facilities are added):
