2. Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the
   negative effects on MPLS traffic caused by LSR's control plane
   restart, and specifically by the restart of its LDP component, on
   LSRs that are capable of preserving the MPLS forwarding component
   across the restart.

3. Summary for Sub-IP Area


3.1. Summary

   This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the
   negative effects on MPLS traffic caused by LSR's control plane
   restart, and specifically by the restart of its LDP component, on
   LSRs that are capable of preserving the MPLS forwarding component
   across the restart.


3.2. Related documents

   See the Reference Section


3.3. Where does it fit in the Picture of the Sub-IP Work

   This work fits squarely in MPLS box.


3.4. Why is it Targeted at this WG

   The LDP is a product of the MPLS WG. This document specifies
   procedures to minimize the negative effects caused by the restart of
   the control plane LDP module. Since the procedures described in this
   document are directly related to LDP, it would be logical to target
   this document at the MPLS WG.


3.5. Justification

   The WG should consider this document, as it allows to minimize the
   negative effects caused by the restart of the control plane LDP
   module.

4. Motivation

   In the case where an LSR could preserve its MPLS forwarding state
   across restart of its control plane, and specifically its LDP
   component [LDP], it may be desirable not to perturb the LSPs going
   through that LSR (and specifically, the LSPs established by LDP).  In
   this document, we describe a mechanism, termed "LDP Graceful
   Restart", that allows to accomplish this goal.


5. LDP Extension

   An LSR indicates that it is capable of supporting LDP Graceful
   Restart, as defined in this document, by including the Graceful
   Restart TLV as an Optional Parameter in the LDP Initialization
   message.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1|0|     Type (TBD)            |            Length = 8         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                Restart Time (in milliseconds)                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                Recovery Time (in milliseconds)                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The value field of the Graceful Restart TLV contains two components:
   Restart Time, and Recovery Time.

   The Restart Time is the time (in milliseconds) that the sender of the
   TLV would like the receiver of that TLV to wait after the receiver
   detects the failure of LDP communication with the sender.  While
   waiting, the receiver should retain the LDP and MPLS forwarding state
   for the (already established) LSPs that traverse a link between the
   sender and the receiver. The Restart Time should be long enough to
   allow the restart of the control plane of the sender of the TLV, and
   specifically its LDP component to bring it to the state where the
   sender could exchange LDP messages with its neighbors.

   For a restarting LSR the Recovery Time carries the time (in
   milliseconds) the LSR is willing to retain its MPLS forwarding state
   that it preserved across the restart. The time is from the moment the
   LSR sends the Initialization message that carries the Graceful
   Restart TLV after restart. Setting this time to 0 indicates that the
   MPLS forwarding state wasn't preserved across the restart (or even if
   it was preserved, is no longer available).

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt         April 2002


   The Recovery Time should be long enough to allow the neighboring
   LSR's to re-sync all the LSP's in a graceful manner, without creating
   congestion in the LDP control plane.


6. Operations

   For the sake of brevity in the context of this document by "the
   control plane" we mean "the LDP component of the control plane".

   An LSR that supports functionality described in this document should
   advertise this to its LDP neighbors by carrying the Graceful Restart
   TLV in the LDP Initialization message.

   The procedures described in this document apply to downstream
   unsolicited label distribution. Extending these procedures to
   downstream on demand label distribution is for further study.

   This document assumes that in addition to the MPLS forwarding state,
   an LSR can also preserve its IP forwarding state across the restart.
   Procedures for preserving IP forwarding state across the restart are
   defined in [OSPF-RESTART], [ISIS-RESTART], and [BGP-RESTART].


6.1. Procedures for the restarting LSR

   For the sake of brevity in the context of this document by "MPLS
   forwarding state" we mean either <incoming label -> (outgoing label,
   next hop)> (non-ingress case), or <FEC->(outgoing label, next hop)>
   (ingress case) mapping.

   After an LSR restarts its control plane, the LSR should check whether
   it was able to preserve its MPLS forwarding state from prior to the
   restart. If no, then the LSR must set the Recovery Time to 0 in the
   Graceful Restart TLV the LSR sends to its neighbors.

   If the forwarding state has been preserved, then the LSR starts its
   internal timer, called MPLS Forwarding State Holding timer (the value
   of that timer should be configurable), and marks all the MPLS
   forwarding state entries as "stale". At the expiration of the timer,
   all the entries still marked as stale should be deleted. The value of
   the Recovery Time advertised in the Graceful Restart TLV should be
   set to the (current) value of the timer at the point when the
   Initialization message carrying the Graceful Restart TLV is sent.

   We say that an LSR is in the process of restarting when the MPLS
   Forwarding State Holding timer is not expired. Once the timer
   expires, we say that the LSR completed its restart.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt         April 2002


   The following procedures apply when an LSR is in the process of
   restarting.


6.1.1. Non-egress LSR

   If the label carried in the Mapping message is not an Implicit NULL,
   the LSR searches its MPLS forwarding table for an entry with the
   outgoing label equal to the label carried in the message, and the
   next hop equal to one of the addresses (next hops) received in the
   Address message from the peer. If such an entry is found, the LSR no
   longer marks the entry as stale. In addition, if the entry is of type
   <incoming label, (outgoing label, next hop)> (rather than <FEC,
   (outgoing label, next hop)>), the LSR associates the incoming label
   from that entry with the FEC received in the Label Mapping message,
   and advertises (via LDP) <incoming label, FEC> to its neighbors. If
   the found entry has no incoming label, or if no entry is found, the
   LSR follows the normal LDP procedures. (Note that this paragraph
   describes the scenario where the restarting LSR is neither the
   egress, nor the penultimate hop that uses penultimate hop popping for
   a particular LSP. Note also that this paragraph covers the case where
   the restarting LSR is the ingress.)

   If the label carried in the Mapping message is an Implicit NULL
   label, the LSR searches its MPLS forwarding table for an entry that
   indicates Label pop (means no outgoing label), and the next hop equal
   to one of the addresses (next hops) received in the Address message
   from the peer. If such an entry is found, the LSR no longer marks the
   entry as stale, the LSR associates the incoming label from that entry
   with the FEC received in the Label Mapping message from the neighbor,
   and advertises (via LDP) <incoming label, FEC> to its neighbors.  If
   the found entry has no incoming label, or if no entry is found, the
   LSR follows the normal LDP procedures. (Note that this paragraph
   describes the scenario where the restarting LSR is a penultimate hop
   for a particular LSP, and this LSP uses penultimate hop popping.)

   The description in the above paragraph assumes that the restarting
   LSR generates the same label for all the LSPs that terminate on the
   same LSR (different from the restarting LSR), and for which the
   restarting LSR is a penultimate hop. If this is not the case, and the
   restarting LSR generates a unique label per each such LSP, then the
   LSR needs to preserve across the restart not just <incoming label,
   (outgoing label, next hop)> mapping, but also the FEC associated with
   this mapping. In such case the LSR would search its MPLS forwarding
   state for an entry that (a) indicates Label pop (means no outgoing
   label), (b) the next hop equal to one of the addresses (next hops)
   received in the Address message from the peer, and (c) has the same
   FEC as the one received in the Label Mapping message. If such an



draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt                              [Page 5]





Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt         April 2002


   entry is found, the LSR no longer marks the entry as stale, the LSR
   associates the incoming label from that entry with the FEC received
   in the Label Mapping message from the neighbor, and advertises (via
   LDP) <incoming label, FEC> to its neighbors. If the found entry has
   no incoming label, or if no entry is found, the LSR follows the
   normal LDP procedures.


6.1.2. Egress LSR

   If an LSR determines that it is an egress for a particular FEC, the
   LSR is configured to generate a non-NULL label for that FEC, and the
   LSR is configured to generate the same (non-NULL) label for all the
   FECs that share the same next hop and for which the LSR is an egress,
   the LSR searches its MPLS forwarding table for an entry that
   indicates Label pop (means no outgoing label), and the next hop equal
   to the next hop for that FEC. (Determining the next hop for the FEC
   depends on the type of the FEC. For example, when the FEC is an IP
   address prefix, the next hop for that FEC is determined from the IP
   forwarding table.) If such an entry is found, the LSR no longer marks
   this entry as stale, the LSR associates the incoming label from that
   entry with the FEC, and advertises (via LDP) <incoming label, FEC> to
   its neighbors. If the found entry has no incoming label, or if no
   entry is found, the LSR follows the normal LDP procedures.

   If an LSR determines that it is an egress for a particular FEC, the
   LSR is configured to generate a non-NULL label for that FEC, and the
   LSR is configured to generate a unique label for each such FEC, then
   the LSR needs to preserve across the restart not just <incoming
   label, (outgoing label, next hop)> mapping, but also the FEC
   associated with this mapping. In such case the LSR would search its
   MPLS forwarding state for an entry that indicates Label pop (means no
   outgoing label), and the next hop equal to the next hop for that FEC
   associated with the entry (Determining the next hop for the FEC
   depends on the type of the FEC. For example, when the FEC is an IP
   address prefix, the next hop for that FEC is determined from the IP
   forwarding table.) If such an entry is found, the LSR no longer marks
   this entry as stale, the LSR associates the incoming label from that
   entry with the FEC, and advertises (via LDP) <incoming label, FEC> to
   its neighbors. If the found entry has no incoming label, or if no
   entry is found, the LSR follows the normal LDP procedures.

   If an LSR determines that it is an egress for a particular FEC, and
   the LSR is configured to generate a NULL (either Explicit or
   Implicit) label for that FEC, the LSR just advertises (via LDP) such
   label (together with the FEC) to its neighbors.

6.2. Alternative procedures for the restarting LSR

   In this section we describe an alternative to the procedures
   described in Section 6.1.

   The procedures described in this section assumes that the restarting
   LSR has (at least) as many unallocated as allocated labels.  The
   latter form the MPLS forwarding state that the LSR managed to
   preserve across the restart.

   After an LSR restarts its control plane, the LSR should check whether
   it was able to preserve its MPLS forwarding state from prior to the
   restart. If no, then the LSR must set the Recovery Time to 0 in the
   Graceful Restart TLV the LSR sends to its neighbors.

   If the forwarding state has been preserved, then the LSR starts its
   internal timer, called MPLS Forwarding State Holding timer (the value
   of that timer should be configurable), and marks all the MPLS
   forwarding state entries as "stale". At the expiration of the timer,
   all the entries still marked as stale should be deleted. The value of
   the Recovery Time advertised in the Graceful Restart TLV should be
   set to the (current) value of the timer at the point when the
   Initialization message carrying the Graceful Restart TLV is sent.

   We say that an LSR is in the process of restarting when the MPLS
   Forwarding State Holding timer is not expired. Once the timer
   expires, we say that the LSR completed its restart.

   While an LSR is in the process of restarting, the LSR creates local
   label binding by following the normal LDP procedures.

   Note that while an LSR is in the process of restarting, the LSR may
   have not one, but two local label bindings for a given FEC - one that
   was retained from prior to restart, and another that was created
   after the restart. Once the LSR completes its restart, the former
   will be deleted. Both of these bindings though would have the same
   outgoing label (and the same next hop).


6.3. Restart of LDP communication with a neighbor LSR

   When an LSR detects that its LDP session with a neighbor went down,
   and the LSR knows that the neighbor is capable of preserving its MPLS
   forwarding state across the restart (as was indicated by the Graceful
   Restart TLV in the Initialization message received from the
   neighbor), the LSR should retain the label-FEC bindings received via
   that session (rather than discarding the bindings), but should mark
   them as "stale".



draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt                              [Page 7]





Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt         April 2002


   After detecting that the LDP session with the neighbor went down, the
   LSR should try to re-establish LDP communication with the neighbor.

   The amount of time the LSR should keep its stale label-FEC bindings
   is set to the lesser of the Restart Time, as was advertised by the
   neighbor, and a local timer. After that, if the LSR still doesn't
   establish an LDP session with the neighbor, all stale bindings should
   be deleted. The local timer is started when the LSR detects that its
   LDP session with the neighbor went down. The value of the local timer
   should be configurable.

   If the LSR re-establishes an LDP session with the neighbor within the
   lesser of the Restart Time and the local timer, and the LSR
   determines that the neighbor was not able to preserve its MPLS
   forwarding state, the LSR should immediately delete all the stale
   label-FEC bindings received from that neighbor. If the LSR determines
   that the neighbor was able to preserve its MPLS forwarding state (as
   was indicated by the non-zero Recovery Time advertised by the
   neighbor), the LSR should further keep the stale label-FEC bindings
   received from the neighbor for as long as the lesser of the Recovery
   Time, advertised by the neighbor, and a local configurable value.

   The LSR  should try to complete the exchange of its label mapping
   information with the neighbor within the Recovery Time, as specified
   in the Graceful Restart TLV received from the neighbor.

   The LSR should handle the Label Mapping messages received from the
   neighbor by following the normal LDP procedures, except that (a) it
   should treat the stale entries in its Label Information Base (LIB),
   as if these entries have been received over the (newly established)
   session, (b) if the label-FEC binding carried in the message is the
   same as the one that is present in the LIB, but is marked as stale,
   the LIB entry should no longer be marked as stale, and (c) if for the
   FEC in the label-FEC binding carried in the message there is already
   a label-FEC binding in the LIB that is marked as stale, and the label
   in the LIB binding is different from the label carried in the
   message, the LSR should just update the LIB entry with the new label.

   An LSR, once it creates a <label, FEC> binding, should keep the value
   of the label in this binding for as long as the LSR has a route to
   the FEC in the binding. If the route to the FEC disappears, and then
   re-appears again later, then this may result in using a different
   label value, as when the route re-appears, the LSR would create a new
   <label, FEC> binding.

   To minimize the potential mis-routing caused by the label change,
   when creating a new <label, FEC> binding the LSR should pick up the
   least recently used label. Once an LSR releases a label, the LSR



draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt                              [Page 8]





Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-restart-01.txt         April 2002


   should not re-use this label for advertising a <label, FEC> binding
   to a neighbor that supports graceful restart for at least the sum of
   Restart Time plus Recovery Time, as advertised by the neighbor to the
   LSR.
