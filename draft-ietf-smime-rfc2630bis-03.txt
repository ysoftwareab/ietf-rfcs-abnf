Abstract

   This document describes the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  This
   syntax is used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt
   arbitrary messages.

   The CMS is derived from PKCS #7 version 1.5 as specified in RFC 2315
   [PKCS#7].  Wherever possible, backward compatibility is preserved;
   however, changes were necessary to accommodate attribute certificate
   transfer and key agreement techniques for key management.

   [*** NEW ***] Once approved, this draft will obsolete RFC 2630.  The
   discussion of specific cryptographic algorithms has been moved to a
   separate document [CMSALG].  Separation of the protocol and algorithm
   specifications allows the IETF to update each document independently.
   No mandatory to implement algorithms are specified.  Rather,
   protocols that reply on the CMS are expected to choose appropriate
   algorithms for their environment.  The algorithms may be selected

   Look for [*** NEW ***].  This string is used to identify text that is
   significantly different than RFC 2630.  However, editorial changes
   were made that are not flagged with this string.

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


1  Introduction

   This document describes the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  This
   syntax is used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt
   arbitrary messages.

   The CMS describes an encapsulation syntax for data protection.  It
   supports digital signatures and encryption.  The syntax allows
   multiple encapsulations; one encapsulation envelope can be nested
   inside another.  Likewise, one party can digitally sign some
   previously encapsulated data.  It also allows arbitrary attributes,
   such as signing time, to be signed along with the message content,
   and provides for other attributes such as countersignatures to be
   associated with a signature.

   The CMS can support a variety of architectures for certificate-based
   key management, such as the one defined by the PKIX working group
   [PROFILE].

   The CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X.208-88], using BER-
   encoding [X.209-88].  Values are typically represented as octet
   strings.  While many systems are capable of transmitting arbitrary
   octet strings reliably, it is well known that many electronic mail
   systems are not.  This document does not address mechanisms for
   encoding octet strings for reliable transmission in such
   environments.

   In this document, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as
   described by Scott Bradner in [STDWORDS].

2  General Overview

   The CMS is general enough to support many different content types.
   This document defines one protection content, ContentInfo.
   ContentInfo encapsulates a single identified content type, and the
   identified type may provide further encapsulation.  This document
   defines six content types: data, signed-data, enveloped-data,
   digested-data, encrypted-data, and authenticated-data.  Additional
   content types can be defined outside this document.

   An implementation that conforms to this specification MUST implement
   the protection content, ContentInfo, and MUST implement the data,
   signed-data, and enveloped-data content types.  The other content
   types MAY be implemented.

   As a general design philosophy, each content type permits single pass
   processing using indefinite-length Basic Encoding Rules (BER)



Housley                                                         [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   encoding.  Single-pass operation is especially helpful if content is
   large, stored on tapes, or is "piped" from another process.  Single-
   pass operation has one significant drawback: it is difficult to
   perform encode operations using the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER) [X.509-88] encoding in a single pass since the lengths of the
   various components may not be known in advance.  However, signed
   attributes within the signed-data content type and authenticated
   attributes within the authenticated-data content type need to be
   transmitted in DER form to ensure that recipients can verify a
   content that contains one or more unrecognized attributes.  Signed
   attributes and authenticated attributes are the only data types used
   in the CMS that require DER encoding.

3  General Syntax

   The following object identifier identifies the content information
   type:

      id-ct-contentInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) ct(1) 6 }

   The CMS associates a content type identifier with a content.  The
   syntax MUST have ASN.1 type ContentInfo:

      ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        contentType ContentType,
        content [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType }

      ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   The fields of ContentInfo have the following meanings:

      contentType indicates the type of the associated content.  It is
      an object identifier; it is a unique string of integers assigned
      by an authority that defines the content type.

      content is the associated content.  The type of content can be
      determined uniquely by contentType.  Content types for data,
      signed-data, enveloped-data, digested-data, encrypted-data, and
      authenticated-data are defined in this document.  If additional
      content types are defined in other documents, the ASN.1 type
      defined SHOULD NOT be a CHOICE type.

4  Data Content Type

   The following object identifier identifies the data content type:

      id-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)



Housley                                                         [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 1 }

   The data content type is intended to refer to arbitrary octet
   strings, such as ASCII text files; the interpretation is left to the
   application.  Such strings need not have any internal structure
   (although they could have their own ASN.1 definition or other
   structure).

   The data content type is generally encapsulated in the signed-data,
   enveloped-data, digested-data, encrypted-data, or authenticated-data
   content type.

5  Signed-data Content Type

   The signed-data content type consists of a content of any type and
   zero or more signature values.  Any number of signers in parallel can
   sign any type of content.

   The typical application of the signed-data content type represents
   one signer's digital signature on content of the data content type.
   Another typical application disseminates certificates and certificate
   revocation lists (CRLs).

   The process by which signed-data is constructed involves the
   following steps:

      1.  For each signer, a message digest, or hash value, is computed
      on the content with a signer-specific message-digest algorithm.
      If the signer is signing any information other than the content,
      the message digest of the content and the other information are
      digested with the signer's message digest algorithm (see Section
      5.4), and the result becomes the "message digest."

      2.  For each signer, the message digest is digitally signed using
      the signer's private key.

      3.  For each signer, the signature value and other signer-specific
      information are collected into a SignerInfo value, as defined in
      Section 5.3.  Certificates and CRLs for each signer, and those not
      corresponding to any signer, are collected in this step.

      4.  The message digest algorithms for all the signers and the
      SignerInfo values for all the signers are collected together with
      the content into a SignedData value, as defined in Section 5.1.

   A recipient independently computes the message digest.  This message
   digest and the signer's public key are used to verify the signature
   value.  The signer's public key is referenced either by an issuer



Housley                                                         [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   distinguished name along with an issuer-specific serial number or by
   a subject key identifier that uniquely identifies the certificate
   containing the public key.  The signer's certificate can be included
   in the SignedData certificates field.

   This section is divided into six parts.  The first part describes the
   top-level type SignedData, the second part describes
   EncapsulatedContentInfo, the third part describes the per-signer
   information type SignerInfo, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth parts
   describe the message digest calculation, signature generation, and
   signature verification processes, respectively.

5.1  SignedData Type

   The following object identifier identifies the signed-data content
   type:

      id-signedData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 2 }

   The signed-data content type shall have ASN.1 type SignedData:

      SignedData ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,
        digestAlgorithms DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers,
        encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
        certificates [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL,
        crls [1] IMPLICIT CertificateRevocationLists OPTIONAL,
        signerInfos SignerInfos }

      DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers ::= SET OF DigestAlgorithmIdentifier

      SignerInfos ::= SET OF SignerInfo

   The fields of type SignedData have the following meanings:

      [*** NEW ***] version is the syntax version number.  The
      appropriate value depends on certificates, eContentType, and
      SignerInfo.  The version MUST be assigned as follows:

         IF (certificates is present) AND
            (any version 2 attribute certificates are present)
         THEN version MUST be 4
         ELSE
            IF ((certificates is present) AND
                (any version 1 attribute certificates are present)) OR
               (encapContentInfo eContentType is other than id-data) OR
               (any SignerInfo structures are version 3)



Housley                                                         [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


            THEN version MUST be 3
            ELSE version MUST be 1

      digestAlgorithms is a collection of message digest algorithm
      identifiers.  There MAY be any number of elements in the
      collection, including zero.  Each element identifies the message
      digest algorithm, along with any associated parameters, used by
      one or more signer.  The collection is intended to list the
      message digest algorithms employed by all of the signers, in any
      order, to facilitate one-pass signature verification.
      Implementations MAY fail to validate signatures that use a digest
      algorithm that is not included in this set.  The message digesting
      process is described in Section 5.4.

      encapContentInfo is the signed content, consisting of a content
      type identifier and the content itself.  Details of the
      EncapsulatedContentInfo type are discussed in section 5.2.

      certificates is a collection of certificates.  It is intended that
      the set of certificates be sufficient to contain chains from a
      recognized "root" or "top-level certification authority" to all of
      the signers in the signerInfos field.  There may be more
      certificates than necessary, and there may be certificates
      sufficient to contain chains from two or more independent top-
      level certification authorities.  There may also be fewer
      certificates than necessary, if it is expected that recipients
      have an alternate means of obtaining necessary certificates (e.g.,
      from a previous set of certificates).  The signer's certificate
      MAY be included.  The use of version 1 attribute certificates is
      strongly discouraged.

      crls is a collection of certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  It
      is intended that the set contain information sufficient to
      determine whether or not the certificates in the certificates
      field are valid, but such correspondence is not necessary.  There
      MAY be more CRLs than necessary, and there MAY also be fewer CRLs
      than necessary.

      signerInfos is a collection of per-signer information.  There MAY
      be any number of elements in the collection, including zero.  The
      details of the SignerInfo type are discussed in section 5.3.
      Since each signer can employ a digital signature technique and
      future specifications could update the syntax, all implementations
      MUST gracefully handle unimplemented versions of SignerInfo.
      Further, since all implementations will not support every possible
      signature algorithm, all implementations MUST gracefully handle
      unimplemented signature algorithms when they are encountered.

5.2  EncapsulatedContentInfo Type

   The content is represented in the type EncapsulatedContentInfo:

      EncapsulatedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        eContentType ContentType,
        eContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

      ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   The fields of type EncapsulatedContentInfo have the following
   meanings:

      eContentType is an object identifier.  The object identifier
      uniquely specifies the content type.

      eContent is the content itself, carried as an octet string.  The
      eContent need not be DER encoded.

   The optional omission of the eContent within the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo field makes it possible to construct
   "external signatures."  In the case of external signatures, the
   content being signed is absent from the EncapsulatedContentInfo value
   included in the signed-data content type.  If the eContent value
   within EncapsulatedContentInfo is absent, then the signatureValue is
   calculated and the eContentType is assigned as though the eContent
   value was present.

   In the degenerate case where there are no signers, the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo value being "signed" is irrelevant.  In this
   case, the content type within the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being
   "signed" MUST be id-data (as defined in section 4), and the content
   field of the EncapsulatedContentInfo value MUST be omitted.

5.2.1  [*** NEW ***] Compatibility with PKCS #7

   This section contains a word of warning to implementers that wish to
   support both the CMS and PKCS #7 [PKCS#7].  Both the CMS and PKCS #7
   identify the type of the encapsulated content with an object
   identifier, but the ASN.1 type of the content itself was variable in
   PKCS #7.  The definition for eContent, in PKCS #7 this was:

      content [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType OPTIONAL

   In the CMS, the definition for eContent is:

      eContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL




Housley                                                        [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   The newer definition is much easier to use in most applications, and
   it is compatible with both S/MIME v2 and S/MIME v3.  However, there
   are some deployed applications that use the older PKCS #7 definition.
   For example, Microsoft AuthentiCode does not sign an OCTET STRING.

   To achive backward compatibility with PKCS #7, CMS implementations
   MAY examine the value of the eContentType, and then adjust the
   expected encoding of eContent based on the object identifier value.
   For example, to support Microsoft AuthentiCode, the following
   information might be included:

      eContentType Object Identifier = { 1 3 6 1 4 1 311 2 1 4 }
      eContent Type = SpcIndirectDataContext  -- Microsoft code signing

5.3  SignerInfo Type

   Per-signer information is represented in the type SignerInfo:

      SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,
        sid SignerIdentifier,
        digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
        signedAttrs [0] IMPLICIT SignedAttributes OPTIONAL,
        signatureAlgorithm SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier,
        signature SignatureValue,
        unsignedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnsignedAttributes OPTIONAL }

      SignerIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
        subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier }

      SignedAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

      UnsignedAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

      Attribute ::= SEQUENCE {
        attrType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        attrValues SET OF AttributeValue }

      AttributeValue ::= ANY

      SignatureValue ::= OCTET STRING

   The fields of type SignerInfo have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  If the SignerIdentifier is
      the CHOICE issuerAndSerialNumber, then the version MUST be 1.  If
      the SignerIdentifier is subjectKeyIdentifier, then the version

      MUST be 3.

      sid specifies the signer's certificate (and thereby the signer's
      public key).  The signer's public key is needed by the recipient
      to verify the signature.  SignerIdentifier provides two
      alternatives for specifying the signer's public key.  The
      issuerAndSerialNumber alternative identifies the signer's
      certificate by the issuer's distinguished name and the certificate
      serial number; the subjectKeyIdentifier identifies the signer's
      certificate by the X.509 subjectKeyIdentifier extension value.
      Implementations MUST support the reception of the
      issuerAndSerialNumber and subjectKeyIdentifier forms of
      SignerIdentifier.  When generating a SignerIdentifier,
      implementations MAY support one of the forms (either
      issuerAndSerialNumber or subjectKeyIdentifier) and always use it,
      or implementations MAY arbitrarily mix the two forms.

      digestAlgorithm identifies the message digest algorithm, and any
      associated parameters, used by the signer.  The message digest is
      computed on either the content being signed or the content
      together with the signed attributes using the process described in
      section 5.4.  The message digest algorithm SHOULD be among those
      listed in the digestAlgorithms field of the associated SignerData.
      Implementations MAY fail to validate signatures that use a digest
      algorithm that is not included in the SignedData digestAlgorithms
      set.

      signedAttrs is a collection of attributes that are signed.  The
      field is optional, but it MUST be present if the content type of
      the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being signed is not id-data.
      Each SignedAttribute in the SET MUST be DER encoded.  Useful
      attribute types, such as signing time, are defined in Section 11.
      If the field is present, it MUST contain, at a minimum, the
      following two attributes:

         A content-type attribute having as its value the content type
         of the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being signed.  Section
         11.1 defines the content-type attribute.  [*** NEW ***]
         However, the content-type attribute MUST NOT be used as part of
         a countersignature unsigned attribute as defined in section
         11.4.

         A message-digest attribute, having as its value the message
         digest of the content.  Section 11.2 defines the message-digest
         attribute.

      signatureAlgorithm identifies the signature algorithm, and any
      associated parameters, used by the signer to generate the digital

      signature.

      signature is the result of digital signature generation, using the
      message digest and the signer's private key.  [*** NEW ***] The
      details of the signature depend on the signature algorithm
      employed.

      unsignedAttrs is a collection of attributes that are not signed.
      The field is optional.  Useful attribute types, such as
      countersignatures, are defined in Section 11.

   The fields of type SignedAttribute and UnsignedAttribute have the
   following meanings:

      attrType indicates the type of attribute.  It is an object
      identifier.

      attrValues is a set of values that comprise the attribute.  The
      type of each value in the set can be determined uniquely by
      attrType.  The attrType can impose restrictions on the number of
      items in the set.

5.4  Message Digest Calculation Process

   The message digest calculation process computes a message digest on
   either the content being signed or the content together with the
   signed attributes.  In either case, the initial input to the message
   digest calculation process is the "value" of the encapsulated content
   being signed.  Specifically, the initial input is the
   encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING to which the signing process
   is applied.  Only the octets comprising the value of the eContent
   OCTET STRING are input to the message digest algorithm, not the tag
   or the length octets.

   The result of the message digest calculation process depends on
   whether the signedAttrs field is present.  When the field is absent,
   the result is just the message digest of the content as described
   above.  When the field is present, however, the result is the message
   digest of the complete DER encoding of the SignedAttrs value
   contained in the signedAttrs field.  Since the SignedAttrs value,
   when present, must contain the content-type and the message-digest
   attributes, those values are indirectly included in the result.  The
   content-type attribute MUST NOT be included in a countersignature
   unsigned attribute as defined in section 11.4.  A separate encoding
   of the signedAttrs field is performed for message digest calculation.
   The IMPLICIT [0] tag in the signedAttrs is not used for the DER
   encoding, rather an EXPLICIT SET OF tag is used.  That is, the DER
   encoding of the EXPLICIT SET OF tag, rather than of the IMPLICIT [0]



Housley                                                        [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   tag, MUST be included in the message digest calculation along with
   the length and content octets of the SignedAttributes value.

   When the signedAttrs field is absent, only the octets comprising the
   value of the signedData encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING (e.g.,
   the contents of a file) are input to the message digest calculation.
   This has the advantage that the length of the content being signed
   need not be known in advance of the signature generation process.

   Although the encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING tag and length
   octets are not included in the message digest calculation, they are
   protected by other means.  The length octets are protected by the
   nature of the message digest algorithm since it is computationally
   infeasible to find any two distinct messages of any length that have
   the same message digest.

5.5  Message Signature Generation Process

   The input to the signature generation process includes the result of
   the message digest calculation process and the signer's private key.
   The details of the signature generation depend on the signature
   algorithm employed.  The object identifier, along with any
   parameters, that specifies the signature algorithm employed by the
   signer is carried in the signatureAlgorithm field.  The signature
   value generated by the signer MUST be encoded as an OCTET STRING and
   carried in the signature field.

5.6  Message Signature Verification Process

   The input to the signature verification process includes the result
   of the message digest calculation process and the signer's public
   key.  The recipient MAY obtain the correct public key for the signer
   by any means, but the preferred method is from a certificate obtained
   from the SignedData certificates field.  The selection and validation
   of the signer's public key MAY be based on certification path
   validation (see [PROFILE]) as well as other external context, but is
   beyond the scope of this document.  The details of the signature
   verification depend on the signature algorithm employed.

   The recipient MUST NOT rely on any message digest values computed by
   the originator.  If the SignedData signerInfo includes
   signedAttributes, then the content message digest MUST be calculated
   as described in section 5.4.  For the signature to be valid, the
   message digest value calculated by the recipient MUST be the same as
   the value of the messageDigest attribute included in the
   signedAttributes of the SignedData signerInfo.

   If the SignedData signerInfo includes signedAttributes, then the



Housley                                                        [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   content-type attribute value MUST match the SignedData
   encapContentInfo eContentType value.

6  Enveloped-data Content Type

   The enveloped-data content type consists of an encrypted content of
   any type and encrypted content-encryption keys for one or more
   recipients.  The combination of the encrypted content and one
   encrypted content-encryption key for a recipient is a "digital
   envelope" for that recipient.  Any type of content can be enveloped
   for an arbitrary number of recipients using any of the three key
   management techniques for each recipient.

   The typical application of the enveloped-data content type will
   represent one or more recipients' digital envelopes on content of the
   data or signed-data content types.

   Enveloped-data is constructed by the following steps:

      1.  A content-encryption key for a particular content-encryption
      algorithm is generated at random.

      2.  The content-encryption key is encrypted for each recipient.
      The details of this encryption depend on the key management
      algorithm used, but four general techniques are supported:

         key transport:  the content-encryption key is encrypted in the
         recipient's public key;

         key agreement:  the recipient's public key and the sender's
         private key are used to generate a pairwise symmetric key, then
         the content-encryption key is encrypted in the pairwise
         symmetric key;

         symmetric key-encryption keys:  the content-encryption key is
         encrypted in a previously distributed symmetric key-encryption
         key; and

         passwords: the content-encryption key is encrypted in a key-
         encryption key that is derived from a password or other shared
         secret value.

      3.  For each recipient, the encrypted content-encryption key and
      other recipient-specific information are collected into a
      RecipientInfo value, defined in Section 6.2.

      4.  The content is encrypted with the content-encryption key.
      Content encryption may require that the content be padded to a



Housley                                                        [Page 15]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      multiple of some block size; see Section 6.3.

      5.  The RecipientInfo values for all the recipients are collected
      together with the encrypted content to form an EnvelopedData value
      as defined in Section 6.1.

   A recipient opens the digital envelope by decrypting one of the
   encrypted content-encryption keys and then decrypting the encrypted
   content with the recovered content-encryption key.

   This section is divided into four parts.  The first part describes
   the top-level type EnvelopedData, the second part describes the per-
   recipient information type RecipientInfo, and the third and fourth
   parts describe the content-encryption and key-encryption processes.

6.1  EnvelopedData Type

   The following object identifier identifies the enveloped-data content
   type:

      id-envelopedData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 3 }

   The enveloped-data content type shall have ASN.1 type EnvelopedData:

      EnvelopedData ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,
        originatorInfo [0] IMPLICIT OriginatorInfo OPTIONAL,
        recipientInfos RecipientInfos,
        encryptedContentInfo EncryptedContentInfo,
        unprotectedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnprotectedAttributes OPTIONAL }

      OriginatorInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        certs [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL,
        crls [1] IMPLICIT CertificateRevocationLists OPTIONAL }

      RecipientInfos ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF RecipientInfo

      EncryptedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        contentType ContentType,
        contentEncryptionAlgorithm ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
        encryptedContent [0] IMPLICIT EncryptedContent OPTIONAL }

      EncryptedContent ::= OCTET STRING

      UnprotectedAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

   The fields of type EnvelopedData have the following meanings:

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      [*** NEW ***] version is the syntax version number.  The
      appropriate value depends on originatorInfo, RecipientInfo, and
      unprotectedAttrs.  The version MUST be assigned as follows:

         IF ((originatorInfo is present) AND
             (any version 2 attribute certificates are present)) OR
            (any RecipientInfo structures include pwri) OR
            (any RecipientInfo structures include ori)
         THEN version is 3
         ELSE
            IF (originatorInfo is present) OR
               (unprotectedAttrs is present) OR
               (any RecipientInfo structures are a version other than 0)
            THEN version is 2
            ELSE version is 0

      originatorInfo optionally provides information about the
      originator.  It is present only if required by the key management
      algorithm.  It may contain certificates and CRLs:

         certs is a collection of certificates.  certs may contain
         originator certificates associated with several different key
         management algorithms.  certs may also contain attribute
         certificates associated with the originator.  The certificates
         contained in certs are intended to be sufficient for all
         recipients to build certification paths from a recognized
         "root" or "top-level certification authority."  However, certs
         may contain more certificates than necessary, and there may be
         certificates sufficient to make certification paths from two or
         more independent top-level certification authorities.
         Alternatively, certs may contain fewer certificates than
         necessary, if it is expected that recipients have an alternate
         means of obtaining necessary certificates (e.g., from a
         previous set of certificates).

         crls is a collection of CRLs.  It is intended that the set
         contain information sufficient to determine whether or not the
         certificates in the certs field are valid, but such
         correspondence is not necessary.  There MAY be more CRLs than
         necessary, and there MAY also be fewer CRLs than necessary.

      recipientInfos is a collection of per-recipient information.
      There MUST be at least one element in the collection.

      encryptedContentInfo is the encrypted content information.

      unprotectedAttrs is a collection of attributes that are not
      encrypted.  The field is optional.  Useful attribute types are

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      defined in Section 11.

   The fields of type EncryptedContentInfo have the following meanings:

      contentType indicates the type of content.

      contentEncryptionAlgorithm identifies the content-encryption
      algorithm, and any associated parameters, used to encrypt the
      content.  The content-encryption process is described in Section
      6.3.  The same content-encryption algorithm and content-encryption
      key are used for all recipients.

      encryptedContent is the result of encrypting the content.  The
      field is optional, and if the field is not present, its intended
      value must be supplied by other means.

   The recipientInfos field comes before the encryptedContentInfo field
   so that an EnvelopedData value may be processed in a single pass.

6.2  RecipientInfo Type

   [*** NEW ***] Per-recipient information is represented in the type
   RecipientInfo.  RecipientInfo has a different format for each of the
   supported key management techniques.  Any of the key management
   techniques can be used for each recipient of the same encrypted
   content.  In all cases, the content-encryption key is transferred to
   one or more recipient in encrypted form.

   [*** NEW ***] Since all implementations will not support every
   possible key management algorithm, all implementations MUST
   gracefully handle unimplemented algorithms when they are encountered.
   For example, if a recipient receives a content-encryption key
   encrypted in their RSA public key using RSA-OAEP and the
   implementation only supports RSA PKCS #1 v1.5, then a graceful
   failure must be implemented.

   [*** NEW ***] Implementations MUST support key transport, key
   agreement, and previously distributed symmetric key-encryption keys,
   as represented by ktri, kari, and kekri, respectively.
   Implementations MAY support the password-based key management as
   represented by pwri.  Implementations MAY support any other key
   management technique as represented by ori.  Since each recipient can
   employ a different key management technique and future specifications
   could define additional key management techniques, all
   implementations MUST gracefully handle unimplemented alternatives
   within the RecipientInfo CHOICE, all implementations MUST gracefully
   handle unimplemented versions of otherwise supported alternatives
   within the RecipientInfo CHOICE, and all implementations MUST

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   gracefully handle unimplemented or unknown ori alternatives.

      RecipientInfo ::= CHOICE {
        ktri KeyTransRecipientInfo,
        kari [1] KeyAgreeRecipientInfo,
        kekri [2] KEKRecipientInfo,
        pwri [3] PasswordRecipientinfo,
        ori [4] OtherRecipientInfo }

      EncryptedKey ::= OCTET STRING

6.2.1  KeyTransRecipientInfo Type

   Per-recipient information using key transport is represented in the
   type KeyTransRecipientInfo.  Each instance of KeyTransRecipientInfo
   transfers the content-encryption key to one recipient.

      KeyTransRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,  -- always set to 0 or 2
        rid RecipientIdentifier,
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
        encryptedKey EncryptedKey }

      RecipientIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
        subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier }

   The fields of type KeyTransRecipientInfo have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  If the RecipientIdentifier
      is the CHOICE issuerAndSerialNumber, then the version MUST be 0.
      If the RecipientIdentifier is subjectKeyIdentifier, then the
      version MUST be 2.

      rid specifies the recipient's certificate or key that was used by
      the sender to protect the content-encryption key.  The
      RecipientIdentifier provides two alternatives for specifying the
      recipient's certificate, and thereby the recipient's public key.
      The recipient's certificate must contain a key transport public
      key.  Therefore, a recipient X.509 version 3 certificate that
      contains a key usage extension MUST assert the keyEncipherment
      bit.  The content-encryption key is encrypted with the recipient's
      public key.  The issuerAndSerialNumber alternative identifies the
      recipient's certificate by the issuer's distinguished name and the
      certificate serial number; the subjectKeyIdentifier identifies the
      recipient's certificate by the X.509 subjectKeyIdentifier
      extension value.  [*** NEW ***] For recipient processing,
      implementations MUST support both of these alternatives for

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      specifying the recipient's certificate; and for sender processing,
      implementations MUST support at least one of these alternatives.

      keyEncryptionAlgorithm identifies the key-encryption algorithm,
      and any associated parameters, used to encrypt the content-
      encryption key for the recipient.  The key-encryption process is
      described in Section 6.4.

      encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the content-encryption
      key for the recipient.

6.2.2  KeyAgreeRecipientInfo Type

   Recipient information using key agreement is represented in the type
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo.  Each instance of KeyAgreeRecipientInfo will
   transfer the content-encryption key to one or more recipients that
   use the same key agreement algorithm and domain parameters for that
   algorithm.

      KeyAgreeRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,  -- always set to 3
        originator [0] EXPLICIT OriginatorIdentifierOrKey,
        ukm [1] EXPLICIT UserKeyingMaterial OPTIONAL,
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
        recipientEncryptedKeys RecipientEncryptedKeys }

      OriginatorIdentifierOrKey ::= CHOICE {
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
        subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier,
        originatorKey [1] OriginatorPublicKey }

      OriginatorPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
        algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
        publicKey BIT STRING }

      RecipientEncryptedKeys ::= SEQUENCE OF RecipientEncryptedKey

      RecipientEncryptedKey ::= SEQUENCE {
        rid KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier,
        encryptedKey EncryptedKey }

      KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
        rKeyId [0] IMPLICIT RecipientKeyIdentifier }

      RecipientKeyIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
        subjectKeyIdentifier SubjectKeyIdentifier,
        date GeneralizedTime OPTIONAL,

        other OtherKeyAttribute OPTIONAL }

      SubjectKeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING

   The fields of type KeyAgreeRecipientInfo have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  It MUST always be 3.

      originator is a CHOICE with three alternatives specifying the
      sender's key agreement public key.  The sender uses the
      corresponding private key and the recipient's public key to
      generate a pairwise key.  The content-encryption key is encrypted
      in the pairwise key.  The issuerAndSerialNumber alternative
      identifies the sender's certificate, and thereby the sender's
      public key, by the issuer's distinguished name and the certificate
      serial number.  The subjectKeyIdentifier alternative identifies
      the sender's certificate, and thereby the sender's public key, by
      the X.509 subjectKeyIdentifier extension value.  The originatorKey
      alternative includes the algorithm identifier and sender's key
      agreement public key.  This alternative permits originator
      anonymity since the public key is not certified.  [*** NEW ***]
      Implementations MUST support all three alternatives for specifying
      the sender's public key.

      ukm is optional.  With some key agreement algorithms, the sender
      provides a User Keying Material (UKM) to ensure that a different
      key is generated each time the same two parties generate a
      pairwise key.  [*** NEW ***] Implementations MUST support
      recipient processing of a KeyAgreeRecipientInfo SEQUENCE that
      includes a ukm field.  Implementations that do not support key
      agreement algorithms that make use of UKMs MUST gracefully handle
      the presence of UKMs.

      keyEncryptionAlgorithm identifies the key-encryption algorithm,
      and any associated parameters, used to encrypt the content-
      encryption key with the key-encryption key.  The key-encryption
      process is described in Section 6.4.

      recipientEncryptedKeys includes a recipient identifier and
      encrypted key for one or more recipients.  The
      KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier is a CHOICE with two alternatives
      specifying the recipient's certificate, and thereby the
      recipient's public key, that was used by the sender to generate a
      pairwise key-encryption key.  The recipient's certificate must
      contain a key agreement public key.  Therefore, a recipient X.509
      version 3 certificate that contains a key usage extension MUST
      assert the keyAgreement bit.  The content-encryption key is
      encrypted in the pairwise key-encryption key.  The

      issuerAndSerialNumber alternative identifies the recipient's
      certificate by the issuer's distinguished name and the certificate
      serial number; the RecipientKeyIdentifier is described below.  The
      encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the content-encryption
      key in the pairwise key-encryption key generated using the key
      agreement algorithm.  [*** NEW ***] Implementations MUST support
      both alternatives for specifying the recipient's certificate.

   The fields of type RecipientKeyIdentifier have the following
   meanings:

      subjectKeyIdentifier identifies the recipient's certificate by the
      X.509 subjectKeyIdentifier extension value.

      date is optional.  When present, the date specifies which of the
      recipient's previously distributed UKMs was used by the sender.

      other is optional.  When present, this field contains additional
      information used by the recipient to locate the public keying
      material used by the sender.

6.2.3  KEKRecipientInfo Type

   Recipient information using previously distributed symmetric keys is
   represented in the type KEKRecipientInfo.  Each instance of
   KEKRecipientInfo will transfer the content-encryption key to one or
   more recipients who have the previously distributed key-encryption
   key.

      KEKRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,  -- always set to 4
        kekid KEKIdentifier,
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
        encryptedKey EncryptedKey }

      KEKIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
        keyIdentifier OCTET STRING,
        date GeneralizedTime OPTIONAL,
        other OtherKeyAttribute OPTIONAL }

   The fields of type KEKRecipientInfo have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  It MUST always be 4.

      kekid specifies a symmetric key-encryption key that was previously
      distributed to the sender and one or more recipients.

      keyEncryptionAlgorithm identifies the key-encryption algorithm,

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      and any associated parameters, used to encrypt the content-
      encryption key with the key-encryption key.  The key-encryption
      process is described in Section 6.4.

      encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the content-encryption
      key in the key-encryption key.

   The fields of type KEKIdentifier have the following meanings:

      keyIdentifier identifies the key-encryption key that was
      previously distributed to the sender and one or more recipients.

      date is optional.  When present, the date specifies a single key-
      encryption key from a set that was previously distributed.

      other is optional.  When present, this field contains additional
      information used by the recipient to determine the key-encryption
      key used by the sender.

6.2.4  [*** NEW ***] PasswordRecipientInfo Type

   Recipient information using a password or shared secret value is
   represented in the type PasswordRecipientInfo.  Each instance of
   PasswordRecipientInfo will transfer the content-encryption key to one
   or more recipients who possess the password or shared secret value.

   The PasswordRecipientInfo Type is specified in RFC <TBD> [PWRI].  The
   PasswordRecipientInfo structure is repeated here for completeness.

      PasswordRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,   -- Always set to 0
        keyDerivationAlgorithm [0] KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier
                                   OPTIONAL,
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
        encryptedKey EncryptedKey }
   The fields of type PasswordRecipientInfo have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  It MUST always be 0.

      keyDerivationAlgorithm identifies the key-derivation algorithm,
      and any associated parameters, used to derive the key-encryption
      key from the password or shared secret value.  If this field is
      absent, the key-encryption key is supplied from an external
      source, for example a hardware crypto token such as a smart card.

      keyEncryptionAlgorithm identifies the encryption algorithm, and
      any associated parameters, used to encrypt the content-encryption
      key with the key-encryption key.



Housley                                                        [Page 23]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the content-encryption
      key with the key-encryption key.

6.2.5  [*** NEW ***] OtherRecipientInfo Type

   Recipient information for additional key management techniques are
   represented in the type OtherRecipientInfo.  The OtherRecipientInfo
   type allows key management techniques beyond key transport, key
   agreement, previously distributed symmetric key-encryption keys, and
   password-based key management to be specified in future documents.
   An object identifier uniquely identifies such key management
   techniques.

      OtherRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        oriType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        oriValue ANY DEFINED BY oriType }
   The fields of type OtherRecipientInfo have the following meanings:

      oriType identifies the key management technique.

      oriValue contains the protocol data elements needed by a recipient
      using the identified key management technique.

6.3  Content-encryption Process

   The content-encryption key for the desired content-encryption
   algorithm is randomly generated.  The data to be protected is padded
   as described below, then the padded data is encrypted using the
   content-encryption key.  The encryption operation maps an arbitrary
   string of octets (the data) to another string of octets (the
   ciphertext) under control of a content-encryption key.  The encrypted
   data is included in the envelopedData encryptedContentInfo
   encryptedContent OCTET STRING.

   Some content-encryption algorithms assume the input length is a
   multiple of k octets, where k is greater than one.  For such
   algorithms, the input shall be padded at the trailing end with
   k-(lth mod k) octets all having value k-(lth mod k), where lth is
   the length of the input.  In other words, the input is padded at
   the trailing end with one of the following strings:

                     01 -- if lth mod k = k-1
                  02 02 -- if lth mod k = k-2
                      .
                      .
                      .
            k k ... k k -- if lth mod k = 0




Housley                                                        [Page 24]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   The padding can be removed unambiguously since all input is padded,
   including input values that are already a multiple of the block size,
   and no padding string is a suffix of another.  This padding method is
   well defined if and only if k is less than 256.

6.4  Key-encryption Process

   The input to the key-encryption process -- the value supplied to the
   recipient's key-encryption algorithm --is just the "value" of the
   content-encryption key.

   Any of the aforementioned key management techniques can be used for
   each recipient of the same encrypted content.

7  Digested-data Content Type

   The digested-data content type consists of content of any type and a
   message digest of the content.

   Typically, the digested-data content type is used to provide content
   integrity, and the result generally becomes an input to the
   enveloped-data content type.

   The following steps construct digested-data:

      1.  A message digest is computed on the content with a message-
      digest algorithm.

      2.  The message-digest algorithm and the message digest are
      collected together with the content into a DigestedData value.

   A recipient verifies the message digest by comparing the message
   digest to an independently computed message digest.

   The following object identifier identifies the digested-data content
   type:

      id-digestedData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 5 }

   The digested-data content type shall have ASN.1 type DigestedData:

      DigestedData ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,
        digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
        encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
        digest Digest }




Housley                                                        [Page 25]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      Digest ::= OCTET STRING

   The fields of type DigestedData have the following meanings:

      version is the syntax version number.  If the encapsulated content
      type is id-data, then the value of version MUST be 0; however, if
      the encapsulated content type is other than id-data, then the
      value of version MUST be 2.

      digestAlgorithm identifies the message digest algorithm, and any
      associated parameters, under which the content is digested.  The
      message-digesting process is the same as in Section 5.4 in the
      case when there are no signed attributes.

      encapContentInfo is the content that is digested, as defined in
      section 5.2.

      digest is the result of the message-digesting process.

   The ordering of the digestAlgorithm field, the encapContentInfo
   field, and the digest field makes it possible to process a
   DigestedData value in a single pass.

8  Encrypted-data Content Type

   The encrypted-data content type consists of encrypted content of any
   type.  Unlike the enveloped-data content type, the encrypted-data
   content type has neither recipients nor encrypted content-encryption
   keys.  Keys MUST be managed by other means.

   The typical application of the encrypted-data content type will be to
   encrypt the content of the data content type for local storage,
   perhaps where the encryption key is derived from a password.

   The following object identifier identifies the encrypted-data content
   type:

      id-encryptedData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 6 }

   The encrypted-data content type shall have ASN.1 type EncryptedData:

      EncryptedData ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,
        encryptedContentInfo EncryptedContentInfo,
        unprotectedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnprotectedAttributes OPTIONAL }

   The fields of type EncryptedData have the following meanings:



Housley                                                        [Page 26]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      version is the syntax version number.  If unprotectedAttrs is
      present, then version MUST be 2.  If unprotectedAttrs is absent,
      then version MUST be 0.

      encryptedContentInfo is the encrypted content information, as
      defined in Section 6.1.

      unprotectedAttrs is a collection of attributes that are not
      encrypted.  The field is optional.  Useful attribute types are
      defined in Section 11.

9  Authenticated-data Content Type

   The authenticated-data content type consists of content of any type,
   a message authentication code (MAC), and encrypted authentication
   keys for one or more recipients.  The combination of the MAC and one
   encrypted authentication key for a recipient is necessary for that
   recipient to verify the integrity of the content.  Any type of
   content can be integrity protected for an arbitrary number of
   recipients.

   The process by which authenticated-data is constructed involves the
   following steps:

      1.  A message-authentication key for a particular message-
      authentication algorithm is generated at random.

      2.  The message-authentication key is encrypted for each
      recipient.  The details of this encryption depend on the key
      management algorithm used.

      3.  For each recipient, the encrypted message-authentication key
      and other recipient-specific information are collected into a
      RecipientInfo value, defined in Section 6.2.

      4.  Using the message-authentication key, the originator computes
      a MAC value on the content.  If the originator is authenticating
      any information in addition to the content (see Section 9.2), a
      message digest is calculated on the content, the message digest of
      the content and the other information are authenticated using the
      message-authentication key, and the result becomes the "MAC
      value."

9.1  AuthenticatedData Type

   The following object identifier identifies the authenticated-data
   content type:




Housley                                                        [Page 27]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      id-ct-authData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16)
          ct(1) 2 }

   The authenticated-data content type shall have ASN.1 type
   AuthenticatedData:

      AuthenticatedData ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,
        originatorInfo [0] IMPLICIT OriginatorInfo OPTIONAL,
        recipientInfos RecipientInfos,
        macAlgorithm MessageAuthenticationCodeAlgorithm,
        digestAlgorithm [1] DigestAlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,
        encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
        authAttrs [2] IMPLICIT AuthAttributes OPTIONAL,
        mac MessageAuthenticationCode,
        unauthAttrs [3] IMPLICIT UnauthAttributes OPTIONAL }

      AuthAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

      UnauthAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

      MessageAuthenticationCode ::= OCTET STRING

   The fields of type AuthenticatedData have the following meanings:

      [*** NEW ***] version is the syntax version number.  The version
      MUST be assigned as follows:

         IF ((originatorInfo is present) AND
             (any version 2 attribute certificates are present))
         THEN version is 1
         ELSE version is 0

      originatorInfo optionally provides information about the
      originator.  It is present only if required by the key management
      algorithm.  It MAY contain certificates, attribute certificates,
      and CRLs, as defined in Section 6.1.

      recipientInfos is a collection of per-recipient information, as
      defined in Section 6.1.  There MUST be at least one element in the
      collection.

      macAlgorithm is a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm
      identifier.  It identifies the MAC algorithm, along with any
      associated parameters, used by the originator.  Placement of the
      macAlgorithm field facilitates one-pass processing by the
      recipient.



Housley                                                        [Page 28]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      digestAlgorithm identifies the message digest algorithm, and any
      associated parameters, used to compute a message digest on the
      encapsulated content if authenticated attributes are present.  The
      message digesting process is described in Section 9.2.  Placement
      of the digestAlgorithm field facilitates one-pass processing by
      the recipient.  If the digestAlgorithm field is present, then the
      authAttrs field MUST also be present.

      encapContentInfo is the content that is authenticated, as defined
      in section 5.2.

      authAttrs is a collection of authenticated attributes.  The
      authAttrs structure is optional, but it MUST be present if the
      content type of the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being
      authenticated is not id-data.  If the authAttrs field is present,
      then the digestAlgorithm field MUST also be present.  Each
      attribute in the SET MUST be DER encoded.  Useful attribute types
      are defined in Section 11.  If the authAttrs field is present, it
      MUST contain, at a minimum, the following two attributes:

         A content-type attribute having as its value the content type
         of the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being authenticated.
         Section 11.1 defines the content-type attribute.

         A message-digest attribute, having as its value the message
         digest of the content.  Section 11.2 defines the message-digest
         attribute.

      mac is the message authentication code.

      unauthAttrs is a collection of attributes that are not
      authenticated.  The field is optional.  To date, no attributes
      have been defined for use as unauthenticated attributes, but other
      useful attribute types are defined in Section 11.

9.2  MAC Generation

   The MAC calculation process computes a message authentication code
   (MAC) on either the message being authenticated or a message digest
   of message being authenticated together with the originator's
   authenticated attributes.

   If authAttrs field is absent, the input to the MAC calculation
   process is the value of the encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING.
   Only the octets comprising the value of the eContent OCTET STRING are
   input to the MAC algorithm; the tag and the length octets are
   omitted.  This has the advantage that the length of the content being
   authenticated need not be known in advance of the MAC generation



Housley                                                        [Page 29]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   process.

   If authAttrs field is present, the content-type attribute (as
   described in Section 11.1) and the message-digest attribute (as
   described in section 11.2) MUST be included, and the input to the MAC
   calculation process is the DER encoding of authAttrs.  A separate
   encoding of the authAttrs field is performed for message digest
   calculation.  The IMPLICIT [2] tag in the authAttrs field is not used
   for the DER encoding, rather an EXPLICIT SET OF tag is used.  That
   is, the DER encoding of the SET OF tag, rather than of the IMPLICIT
   [2] tag, is to be included in the message digest calculation along
   with the length and content octets of the authAttrs value.

   The message digest calculation process computes a message digest on
   the content being authenticated.  The initial input to the message
   digest calculation process is the "value" of the encapsulated content
   being authenticated.  Specifically, the input is the encapContentInfo
   eContent OCTET STRING to which the authentication process is applied.
   Only the octets comprising the value of the encapContentInfo eContent
   OCTET STRING are input to the message digest algorithm, not the tag
   or the length octets.  This has the advantage that the length of the
   content being authenticated need not be known in advance.  Although
   the encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING tag and length octets are
   not included in the message digest calculation, they are still
   protected by other means.  The length octets are protected by the
   nature of the message digest algorithm since it is computationally
   infeasible to find any two distinct messages of any length that have
   the same message digest.

   The input to the MAC calculation process includes the MAC input data,
   defined above, and an authentication key conveyed in a recipientInfo
   structure.  The details of MAC calculation depend on the MAC
   algorithm employed (e.g., HMAC).  The object identifier, along with
   any parameters, that specifies the MAC algorithm employed by the
   originator is carried in the macAlgorithm field.  The MAC value
   generated by the originator is encoded as an OCTET STRING and carried
   in the mac field.

9.3  MAC Verification

   The input to the MAC verification process includes the input data
   (determined based on the presence or absence of the authAttrs field,
   as defined in 9.2), and the authentication key conveyed in
   recipientInfo.  The details of the MAC verification process depend on
   the MAC algorithm employed.

   The recipient MUST NOT rely on any MAC values or message digest
   values computed by the originator.  The content is authenticated as



Housley                                                        [Page 30]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   described in section 9.2.  If the originator includes authenticated
   attributes, then the content of the authAttrs is authenticated as
   described in section 9.2.  For authentication to succeed, the message
   MAC value calculated by the recipient MUST be the same as the value
   of the mac field.  Similarly, for authentication to succeed when the
   authAttrs field is present, the content message digest value
   calculated by the recipient MUST be the same as the message digest
   value included in the authAttrs message-digest attribute.

   If the AuthenticatedData includes authAttrs, then the content-type
   attribute value MUST match the AuthenticatedData encapContentInfo
   eContentType value.

10  Useful Types

   This section is divided into two parts.  The first part defines
   algorithm identifiers, and the second part defines other useful
   types.

10.1  Algorithm Identifier Types

   All of the algorithm identifiers have the same type:
   AlgorithmIdentifier.  The definition of AlgorithmIdentifier is
   imported from X.509 [X.509-88].

   There are many alternatives for each algorithm type.

10.1.1  DigestAlgorithmIdentifier

   The DigestAlgorithmIdentifier type identifies a message-digest
   algorithm.  Examples include SHA-1, MD2, and MD5.  A message-digest
   algorithm maps an octet string (the message) to another octet string
   (the message digest).

      DigestAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

10.1.2  SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier

   The SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier type identifies a signature
   algorithm.  Examples include RSA, DSA, and ECDSA.  A signature
   algorithm supports signature generation and verification operations.
   The signature generation operation uses the message digest and the
   signer's private key to generate a signature value.  The signature
   verification operation uses the message digest and the signer's
   public key to determine whether or not a signature value is valid.
   Context determines which operation is intended.

      SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier



Housley                                                        [Page 31]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


10.1.3  KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier

   The KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier type identifies a key-encryption
   algorithm used to encrypt a content-encryption key.  The encryption
   operation maps an octet string (the key) to another octet string (the
   encrypted key) under control of a key-encryption key.  The decryption
   operation is the inverse of the encryption operation.  Context
   determines which operation is intended.

   The details of encryption and decryption depend on the key management
   algorithm used.  Key transport, key agreement, previously distributed
   symmetric key-encrypting keys, and symmetric key-encrypting keys
   derived from passwords are supported.

      KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

10.1.4  ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier

   The ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier type identifies a content-
   encryption algorithm.  Examples include Triple-DES and RC2.  A
   content-encryption algorithm supports encryption and decryption
   operations.  The encryption operation maps an octet string (the
   message) to another octet string (the ciphertext) under control of a
   content-encryption key.  The decryption operation is the inverse of
   the encryption operation.  Context determines which operation is
   intended.

      ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

10.1.5  MessageAuthenticationCodeAlgorithm

   The MessageAuthenticationCodeAlgorithm type identifies a message
   authentication code (MAC) algorithm.  Examples include DES-MAC and
   HMAC-SHA-1.  A MAC algorithm supports generation and verification
   operations.  The MAC generation and verification operations use the
   same symmetric key.  Context determines which operation is intended.

      MessageAuthenticationCodeAlgorithm ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

10.1.6  [*** NEW ***] KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier

   The KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier type is specified in RFC <TBD>
   [PWRI].  The KeyDerivationAlgorithmIdentifier definition is repeated
   here for completeness.

   Key derivation algorithms convert a password or shared secret value
   into a key-encryption key.

10.2  Other Useful Types

   This section defines types that are used other places in the
   document.  The types are not listed in any particular order.

10.2.1  CertificateRevocationLists

   The CertificateRevocationLists type gives a set of certificate
   revocation lists (CRLs).  It is intended that the set contain
   information sufficient to determine whether the certificates and
   attribute certificates with which the set is associated are revoked.
   However, there may be more CRLs than necessary or there MAY be fewer
   CRLs than necessary.

   The CertificateList may contain a CRL, an Authority Revocation List
   (ARL), a Delta CRL, or an Attribute Certificate Revocation List.  All
   of these lists share a common syntax.

   CRLs are specified in X.509 [X.509-97], and they are profiled for use
   in the Internet in RFC <TBD> [PROFILE].

   The definition of CertificateList is imported from X.509.

      CertificateRevocationLists ::= SET OF CertificateList

10.2.2  CertificateChoices

   [*** NEW ***] The CertificateChoices type gives either a PKCS #6
   extended certificate [PKCS#6], an X.509 certificate, a version 1
   X.509 attribute certificate (ACv1) [X.509-97], or a version 2 X.509
   attribute certificate (ACv2) [X.509-00].  The PKCS #6 extended
   certificate is obsolete.  The PKCS #6 certificate is included for
   backward compatibility, and PKCS #6 certificates SHOULD NOT be used.
   The ACv1 is also obsolete.  ACv1 is included for backward
   compatibility, and ACv1 SHOULD NOT be used.  The Internet profile of
   X.509 certificates is specified in the "Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure: Certificate and CRL Profile" [PROFILE].  The Internet
   profile of ACv2 is specified in the "An Internet Attribute
   Certificate Profile for Authorization" [ACPROFILE].

   The definition of Certificate is imported from X.509.

   [*** NEW ***] The definitions of AttributeCertificate are imported
   from X.509-1997 and X.509-2000.  The definition from X.509-1997 is
   assigned to AttributeCertificateV1 (see Appendix B), and the
   definition from X.509-2000 is assigned to AttributeCertificateV2.

        v2AttrCert [2] IMPLICIT AttributeCertificateV2 }       -- See X.509

10.2.3  CertificateSet

   The CertificateSet type provides a set of certificates.  It is
   intended that the set be sufficient to contain chains from a
   recognized "root" or "top-level certification authority" to all of
   the sender certificates with which the set is associated.  However,
   there may be more certificates than necessary, or there MAY be fewer
   than necessary.

   The precise meaning of a "chain" is outside the scope of this
   document.  Some applications may impose upper limits on the length of
   a chain; others may enforce certain relationships between the
   subjects and issuers of certificates within a chain.

      CertificateSet ::= SET OF CertificateChoices

10.2.4  IssuerAndSerialNumber

   The IssuerAndSerialNumber type identifies a certificate, and thereby
   an entity and a public key, by the distinguished name of the
   certificate issuer and an issuer-specific certificate serial number.

   The definition of Name is imported from X.501 [X.501-88], and the
   definition of CertificateSerialNumber is imported from X.509
   [X.509-97].

      IssuerAndSerialNumber ::= SEQUENCE {
        issuer Name,
        serialNumber CertificateSerialNumber }

      CertificateSerialNumber ::= INTEGER

10.2.5  CMSVersion

   The CMSVersion type gives a syntax version number, for compatibility
   with future revisions of this specification.

      CMSVersion ::= INTEGER  { v0(0), v1(1), v2(2), v3(3), v4(4) }

10.2.6  UserKeyingMaterial

   The UserKeyingMaterial type gives a syntax for user keying material
   (UKM).  Some key agreement algorithms require UKMs to ensure that a
   different key is generated each time the same two parties generate a
   pairwise key.  The sender provides a UKM for use with a specific key
   agreement algorithm.

      UserKeyingMaterial ::= OCTET STRING

10.2.7  OtherKeyAttribute

   The OtherKeyAttribute type gives a syntax for the inclusion of other
   key attributes that permit the recipient to select the key used by
   the sender.  The attribute object identifier must be registered along
   with the syntax of the attribute itself.  Use of this structure
   should be avoided since it might impede interoperability.

      OtherKeyAttribute ::= SEQUENCE {
        keyAttrId OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        keyAttr ANY DEFINED BY keyAttrId OPTIONAL }

11  Useful Attributes

   This section defines attributes that may be used with signed-data,
   enveloped-data, encrypted-data, or authenticated-data.  The syntax of
   Attribute is compatible with X.501 [X.501-88] and RFC <TBD>
   [PROFILE].  Some of the attributes defined in this section were
   originally defined in PKCS #9 [PKCS#9]; others were originally
   defined in a previous version of this specification [OLDCMS].  The
   attributes are not listed in any particular order.

   Additional attributes are defined in many places, notably the S/MIME
   Version 3 Message Specification [MSG] and the Enhanced Security
   Services for S/MIME [ESS], which also include recommendations on the
   placement of these attributes.

11.1  Content Type

   [*** NEW ***] The content-type attribute type specifies the content
   type of the ContentInfo within signed-data or authenticated-data.
   The content-type attribute type MUST be present whenever signed
   attributes are present in signed-data or authenticated attributes
   present in authenticated-data.  The content-type attribute value MUST
   match the encapContentInfo eContentType value in the signed-data or
   authenticated-data.

   [*** NEW ***] The content-type attribute MUST be a signed attribute



Housley                                                        [Page 35]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   or an authenticated attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute,
   unauthenticated attribute, or unprotected attribute.

   The following object identifier identifies the content-type
   attribute:

      id-contentType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 3 }

   Content-type attribute values have ASN.1 type ContentType:

      ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   Even though the syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue, a
   content-type attribute MUST have a single attribute value; zero or
   multiple instances of AttributeValue are not permitted.

   The SignedAttributes and AuthAttributes syntaxes are each defined as
   a SET OF Attributes.  The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo MUST NOT
   include multiple instances of the content-type attribute.  Similarly,
   the AuthAttributes in an AuthenticatedData MUST NOT include multiple
   instances of the content-type attribute.

11.2  Message Digest

   The message-digest attribute type specifies the message digest of the
   encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING being signed in signed-data
   (see section 5.4) or authenticated in authenticated-data (see section
   9.2).  For signed-data, the message digest is computed using the
   signer's message digest algorithm.  For authenticated-data, the
   message digest is computed using the originator's message digest
   algorithm.

   [*** NEW ***] Within signed-data, the message-digest signed attribute
   type MUST be present when there are any signed attributes present.
   Within authenticated-data, the message-digest authenticated attribute
   type MUST be present when there are any authenticated attributes
   present.

   [*** NEW ***] The message-digest attribute MUST be a signed attribute
   or an authenticated attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute,
   unauthenticated attribute, or unprotected attribute.

   The following object identifier identifies the message-digest
   attribute:

      id-messageDigest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 4 }



Housley                                                        [Page 36]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   Message-digest attribute values have ASN.1 type MessageDigest:

      MessageDigest ::= OCTET STRING

   A message-digest attribute MUST have a single attribute value, even
   though the syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue.  There MUST
   NOT be zero or multiple instances of AttributeValue present.

   The SignedAttributes syntax and AuthAttributes syntax are each
   defined as a SET OF Attributes.  The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo
   MUST include only one instance of the message-digest attribute.
   Similarly, the AuthAttributes in an AuthenticatedData MUST include
   only one instance of the message-digest attribute.

11.3  Signing Time

   The signing-time attribute type specifies the time at which the
   signer (purportedly) performed the signing process.  The signing-time
   attribute type is intended for use in signed-data.

   [*** NEW ***] The signing-time attribute MUST be a signed attribute
   or an authenticated attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute,
   unauthenticated attribute, or unprotected attribute.

   The following object identifier identifies the signing-time
   attribute:

      id-signingTime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 5 }

   Signing-time attribute values have ASN.1 type SigningTime:

      SigningTime ::= Time

      Time ::= CHOICE {
        utcTime          UTCTime,
        generalizedTime  GeneralizedTime }

   Note: The definition of Time matches the one specified in the 1997
   version of X.509 [X.509-97].

   Dates between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 2049 (inclusive) MUST be
   encoded as UTCTime.  Any dates with year values before 1950 or after
   2049 MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime.

   UTCTime values MUST be expressed in Greenwich Mean Time (Zulu) and
   MUST include seconds (i.e., times are YYMMDDHHMMSSZ), even where the
   number of seconds is zero.  Midnight (GMT) MUST be represented as



Housley                                                        [Page 37]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   "YYMMDD000000Z".  Century information is implicit, and the century
   MUST be determined as follows:

      Where YY is greater than or equal to 50, the year MUST be
      interpreted as 19YY; and

      Where YY is less than 50, the year MUST be interpreted as 20YY.

   GeneralizedTime values MUST be expressed in Greenwich Mean Time
   (Zulu) and MUST include seconds (i.e., times are YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ),
   even where the number of seconds is zero.  GeneralizedTime values
   MUST NOT include fractional seconds.

   A signing-time attribute MUST have a single attribute value, even
   though the syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue.  There MUST
   NOT be zero or multiple instances of AttributeValue present.

   The SignedAttributes syntax and the AuthAttributes syntax are each
   defined as a SET OF Attributes.  The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo
   MUST NOT include multiple instances of the signing-time attribute.
   Similarly, the AuthAttributes in an AuthenticatedData MUST NOT
   include multiple instances of the signing-time attribute.

   No requirement is imposed concerning the correctness of the signing
   time, and acceptance of a purported signing time is a matter of a
   recipient's discretion.  It is expected, however, that some signers,
   such as time-stamp servers, will be trusted implicitly.

11.4  Countersignature

   The countersignature attribute type specifies one or more signatures
   on the contents octets of the DER encoding of the signatureValue
   field of a SignerInfo value in signed-data.  Thus, the
   countersignature attribute type countersigns (signs in serial)
   another signature.

   [*** NEW ***] The countersignature attribute MUST be an unsigned
   attribute; it MUST NOT be a signed attribute, an authenticated
   attribute, an unauthenticated attribute, or an unprotected attribute.

   The following object identifier identifies the countersignature
   attribute:

      id-countersignature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 6 }

   Countersignature attribute values have ASN.1 type Countersignature:

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


      Countersignature ::= SignerInfo

   [*** NEW ***] Countersignature values have the same meaning as
   SignerInfo values for ordinary signatures, except that:


      1.  The signedAttributes field MUST NOT contain a content-type
      attribute; there is no content type for countersignatures.

      2.  The signedAttributes field MUST contain a message-digest
      attribute if it contains any other attributes.

      3.  The input to the message-digesting process is the contents
      octets of the DER encoding of the signatureValue field of the
      SignerInfo value with which the attribute is associated.

   A countersignature attribute can have multiple attribute values.  The
   syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue, and there MUST be one
   or more instances of AttributeValue present.

   The UnsignedAttributes syntax is defined as a SET OF Attributes.  The
   UnsignedAttributes in a signerInfo may include multiple instances of
   the countersignature attribute.

   A countersignature, since it has type SignerInfo, can itself contain
   a countersignature attribute.  Thus, it is possible to construct
   arbitrarily long series of countersignatures.

Security Considerations

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax provides a method for digitally
   signing data, digesting data, encrypting data, and authenticating
   data.

   Implementations must protect the signer's private key.  Compromise of
   the signer's private key permits masquerade.

   Implementations must protect the key management private key, the key-
   encryption key, and the content-encryption key.  Compromise of the
   key management private key or the key-encryption key may result in
   the disclosure of all messages protected with that key.  Similarly,
   compromise of the content-encryption key may result in disclosure of
   the associated encrypted content.

   Implementations must protect the key management private key and the
   message-authentication key.  Compromise of the key management private
   key permits masquerade of authenticated data.  Similarly, compromise
   of the message-authentication key may result in undetectable
   modification of the authenticated content.

   [*** NEW ***] The key management technique employed to distribute
   message-authentication keys must itself provide data origin
   authentication, otherwise the message content is delivered with
   integrity from an unknown source.  Neither RSA [PKCS#1, NEWPKCS#1]
   nor Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman [DH-X9.42] provide the necessary
   data origin authentication.  Static-Static Diffie-Hellman [DH-X9.42]
   does provide the necessary data origin authentication when both the
   originator and recipient public keys are bound to appropriate
   identities in X.509 certificates.

   [*** NEW ***] When more than two parties share the same message-
   authentication key, data origin authentication is not provided.  Any
   party that knows the message-authentication key can compute a valid
   MAC, therefore the message could originate from any one of the
   parties.

   Implementations must randomly generate content-encryption keys,
   message-authentication keys, initialization vectors (IVs), and
   padding.  Also, the generation of public/private key pairs relies on
   a random numbers.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number
   generators (PRNGs) to generate cryptographic keys can result in
   little or no security.  An attacker may find it much easier to
   reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys, searching the
   resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute force
   searching the whole key space.  The generation of quality random
   numbers is difficult.  RFC 1750 [RANDOM] offers important guidance in



Housley                                                        [Page 51]

   this area, and Appendix 3 of FIPS Pub 186 [DSS] provides one quality
   PRNG technique.

   When using key agreement algorithms or previously distributed
   symmetric key-encryption keys, a key-encryption key is used to
   encrypt the content-encryption key.  If the key-encryption and
   content-encryption algorithms are different, the effective security
   is determined by the weaker of the two algorithms.  If, for example,
   a message content is encrypted with 168-bit Triple-DES and the
   Triple-DES content-encryption key is wrapped with a 40-bit RC2 key,
   then at most 40 bits of protection is provided.  A trivial search to
   determine the value of the 40-bit RC2 key can recover Triple-DES key,
   and then the Triple-DES key can be used to decrypt the content.
   Therefore, implementers must ensure that key-encryption algorithms
   are as strong or stronger than content-encryption algorithms.

   Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms become
   weaker with time.  As new cryptoanalysis techniques are developed and
   computing performance improves, the work factor to break a particular
   cryptographic algorithm will reduce.  Therefore, cryptographic
   algorithm implementations should be modular allowing new algorithms
   to be readily inserted.  That is, implementers should be prepared for
   the set of mandatory to implement algorithms to change over time.

   The countersignature unsigned attribute includes a digital signature
   that is computed on the content signature value, thus the
   countersigning process need not know the original signed content.
   This structure permits implementation efficiency advantages; however,
   this structure may also permit the countersigning of an inappropriate
   signature value.  Therefore, implementations that perform
   countersignatures should either verify the original signature value
   prior to countersigning it (this verification requires processing of
   the original content), or implementations should perform
   countersigning in a context that ensures that only appropriate
   signature values are countersigned.

   Users of the CMS, particularly those employing the CMS to support
   interactive applications, should be aware that PKCS #1 Version 1.5 as
   specified in RFC 2313 [PKCS#1] is vulnerable to adaptive chosen
   ciphertext attacks when applied for encryption purposes.
   Exploitation of this identified vulnerability, revealing the result
   of a particular RSA decryption, requires access to an oracle which
   will respond to a large number of ciphertexts (based on currently
   available results, hundreds of thousands or more), which are
   constructed adaptively in response to previously-received replies
   providing information on the successes or failures of attempted
   decryption operations.  As a result, the attack appears significantly
   less feasible to perpetrate for store-and-forward S/MIME environments



Housley                                                        [Page 52]

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 2001


   than for directly interactive protocols.  Where the CMS constructs
   are applied as an intermediate encryption layer within an interactive
   request-response communications environment, exploitation could be
   more feasible.

   An updated version of PKCS #1 has been published, PKCS #1 Version 2.0
   [NEWPKCS#1].  This new document will supersede RFC 2313.  PKCS #1
   Version 2.0 preserves support for the encryption padding format
   defined in PKCS #1 Version 1.5 [PKCS#1], and it also defines a new
   alternative.  To resolve the adaptive chosen ciphertext
   vulnerability, the PKCS #1 Version 2.0 specifies and recommends use
   of Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) when RSA encryption
   is used to provide confidentiality.  Designers of protocols and
   systems employing the CMS for interactive environments should either
   consider usage of OAEP, or should ensure that information which could
   reveal the success or failure of attempted PKCS #1 Version 1.5
   decryption operations is not provided.  Support for OAEP will likely
   be added to a future version of this specification.
