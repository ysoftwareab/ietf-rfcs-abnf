    * Added metrics for:

2.  Introduction

    As a step towards improving our methodologies for evaluating
    congestion control mechanisms, in this document we discuss some of
    the metrics to be considered.  We also consider the relationship
    between metrics, e.g., the well-known tradeoff between throughput
    and delay.

    Subsequent documents will discuss the models that are used in
    analysis, simulations, or experiments for the evaluation of
    transport protocols in general, and of congestion control mechanisms
    in particular.  These are intended to become documents in the newly-
    chartered Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG) in the IRTF
    (Internet Research Task Force).

3.  Metrics

    The metrics that we discuss are the following:

    o  Throughput;

    o  Delay;

    o  Packet drop rates;

    o  Response to sudden changes or to transient events;

    o  Minimizing oscillations in throughput or in delay;

    o  Fairness and convergence times;

    o  Robustness for challenging environments;

    o  Robustness to failures and to misbehaving users;

    o  Deployability;

    o  Metrics for specific types of transport.

    We consider each of these below.  Many of the metrics have both
    network-based and user-based interpretations.  For some of the
    metrics, such as fairness between flows, there is not a clear
    agreement in the network community about the desired goals.

3.1.  Throughput, Delay, and Drop Rates

    Because of the clear tradeoffs between throughput, delay, and drop
    rates, it can be useful to consider the three metrics together.

    An alternative would be to consider a separate metric such as power,
    defined in this context as throughput over delay, that combines
    throughput and delay.  However, we do not propose in this document a
    clear target in terms of the tradeoffs between throughput and delay;
    we are simply proposing that the evaluation of transport protocols
    include an exploration of the competing metrics.

3.1.1.  Throughput

    Throughput can be measured both as a router-based metric of
    aggregate link throughput, and as a user metric of per-connection
    transfer times.  It is a clear goal of most congestion control
    mechanisms to maximize throughput, subject to application demand and
    to the constraints of the other metrics.  We note that maximizing
    throughput is of concern in a wide range of environments, from
    highly-congested networks to under-utilized ones.

    In some contexts, it might be sufficient to consider the aggregate
    throughput or the mean per-flow throughput, while in other contexts
    it might be necessary to consider the distribution of per-flow
    throughput.  Some researchers evaluate transport protocols in terms
    of maximizing the aggregate user utility, where a user's utility is
    generally defined as a function of the user's throughput [KMT98].

    Individual applications can have application-specific needs in terms
    of throughput.  For example, real-time video traffic can have highly
    variable bandwidth demands;  VoIP traffic is sensitive to the amount
    of bandwidth received immediately after idle periods.  Thus, user



Floyd                                           Section 3.1.1.  [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: February 2006              August 2005


    metrics for throughput can be more complex than simply the per-
    connection transfer time.

3.1.2.  Delay

    Like throughput, delay can be measured as a router-based metric of
    queueing delay over time, or in terms of per-packet transfer times.
    For reliable transfer, the per-packet transfer time includes the
    possible delay of retransmitting a dropped packet.

    Users of bulk data transfer applications might care about per-packet
    transfer times only in so far as they affect the per-connection
    transfer time.  On the other end of the spectrum, for users of
    streaming media, per-packet delay can be a significant concern.
    Note that in some cases the average delay might not capture the
    metric of interest to the users; for example, some users might care
    about the worst-case delay, or about the tail of the delay
    distribution.

3.1.3.  Packet Drop Rates

    Packet drop rates can be measured as a network-based or as a user-
    based metric.

    Some users might care about packet drop rates only in so far as they
    affect per-connection transfer times, while other users might care
    about packet drop rates directly.  One network-related reason to
    avoid high steady-state packet drop rates is to avoid congestion
    collapse in environments containing paths with multiple congested
    links.  In such environments, high packet drop rates could result in
    congested links wasting scarce bandwidth by carrying packets that
    will only be dropped downstream, before being delivered to the
    receiver.

3.2.  Response Times and Minimizing Oscillations

    In this section we consider response times and oscillations
    together, as there are well-known tradeoffs between improving
    response times and minimizing oscillations.  In addition, the
    scenarios that illustrate the dangers of poor response times are
    often quite different from the scenarios that illustrate the dangers
    of unnecessary oscillations.

3.2.1.  Response to Changes

    One of the key concerns in the design of congestion control
    mechanisms has been the response times to sudden congestion in the
    network.  On the one hand, congestion control mechanisms should



Floyd                                           Section 3.2.1.  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: February 2006              August 2005


    respond reasonably promptly to sudden congestion from routing or
    bandwidth changes, or from a burst of competing traffic.  At the
    same time, congestion control mechanisms should not respond too
    severely to transient changes, e.g., to a sudden increase in delay
    that will dissipate in less than the connection's round-trip time.

    Evaluating the response to sudden or transient changes can be of
    particular concern for slowly-responding congestion control
    mechanisms such as equation-based congestion control [RFC 3448], and
    for AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) or related
    mechanisms using parameters that make them more slowly-responding
    that TCP [BB01, BBFS01].

    In addition to the responsiveness and smoothness of aggregate
    traffic, one can consider the tradeoffs between responsiveness,
    smoothness, and aggressiveness for an individual connection [FHP00].
    In this case smoothness can be defined by the largest reduction in
    the sending rate in one round-trip time, in a deterministic
    environment with a packet drop exactly every 1/p packets.  The
    responsiveness is defined as the number of round-trip times of
    sustained congested required for the sender to halve the sending
    rate, and the aggressiveness is defined as the maximum increase in
    the sending rate in one round-trip time, in packets per second, in
    the absence of congestion.

3.2.2.  Minimizing Oscillations

    One goal is that of stability, in terms of minimizing oscillations
    of queueing delay or of throughput.  Scenarios illustrating
    oscillations are often dominated by long-lived connections, perhaps
    with a small number of changes in the level of congestion.

    An orthogonal goal for some congestion control mechanisms, e.g., for
    equation-based congestion control, is to minimize the oscillations
    in the sending rate for an individual connection, given an
    environment with a fixed, steady-state packet drop rate.  (As is
    well known, TCP congestion control is characterized by a pronounced
    oscillation in the sending rate, with the sender halving the sending
    rate in response to congestion.)  One metric for the level of
    oscillations is the smoothness metric given above.

3.3.  Fairness and Convergence

    Another set of metrics are those of fairness and of convergence
    times.  Fairness can be considered between flows of the same
    protocol, and between flows using different protocols (e.g.,
    fairness between TCP and a new transport protocol).

    There are a number of different fairness measures.  These include
    max-min fairness [HG86], proportional fairness [KMT98, K01], the
    fairness index proposed in [JCH84], and the product measure, a
    variant of network power [BJ81].

    Max-min fairness: In order to satisfy the max-min fairness criteria,
    the smallest throughput rate must be as large as possible. Given
    this condition, the next-smallest throughput rate must be as large
    as possible, and so on.  Thus, the max-min fairness gives absolute
    priority to the smallest flows.

    Epsilon-fairness: A metric related to max-min fairness is epsilon-
    fairness, where a rate allocation is defined as epsilon-fair if

       min_i x_i / max_i x_i >= 1 - epsilon.

    where x_i is the resource allocation to the i-th user.  Epsilon-
    fairness measures the worst-case ratio between any two throughput
    rates [ZKL04].

    Proportional fairness: In contrast, an allocation x is defined as
    proportionally fair if for any other feasible allocation x*, the
    aggregate of proportional changes is zero or negative:

       sum_i (x*_i - x_i)/x_i <= 0.

    "This criterion favours smaller flows, but less emphatically than
    max-min fairness" [K01].

    Jain's fairness index: The fairness index in [JCH84] is

       (( sum_i x_i )^2) / (n * sum_i (x_i)^2 ) ,

    where there are n users.  This fairness index ranges from 0 to 1,
    and is maximum when all users receive the same allocation.  This
    index is k/n when k users equally share the resource, and the other
    n-k users receive zero allocation.

    The product measure: The product measure

       product_i x_i ,

    the product of the throughput of the individual connections, is also
    used as a measure of fairness.  For our purposes, let x_i be the
    throughput for the i-th connection.  (In other contexts x_i is taken
    as the power of the i-th connection, and the product measure is
    referred to as network power.)  The product measure is particularly
    sensitive to segregation; the product measure is zero if any



Floyd                                             Section 3.3.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: February 2006              August 2005


    connection receives zero throughput.  In [MS90] it is shown that for
    a network with many connections and one shared gateway, the product
    measure is maximized when all connections receive the same
    throughput.

    Fairness and the number of congested links: Some of these fairness
    metrics are discussed in more detail in [F91].  We note that there
    is not a clear consensus for the fairness goals, in particular for
    fairness between flows that traverse different numbers of congested
    links [F91].

    Fairness and round-trip times: One goal cited in a number of new
    transport protocols has been that of fairness between flows with
    different round-trip times [KHR02, XHR04]. We note that there is not
    a consensus in the networking community about the desirability of
    this goal, or about the implications and interactions between this
    goal and other metrics [FJ92] (Section 3.3).

    Fairness and packet size: One fairness issue is that of the relative
    fairness for flows with different packet sizes.  Many file transfer
    applications will use the maximum packet size possible;  in
    contrast, low-bandwidth VoIP flows are likely to send small packets,
    sending a new packet every 10 to 40 ms., to limit delay.  Should a
    small-packet VoIP connection receive the same sending rate in bytes
    per second as a large-packet TCP connection in the same environment,
    or should it receive the same sending rate in *packets* per second?
    This fairness issue has been discussed in more detail in [FK04],
    with [FK05] also describing the ways that packet size can effect the
    packet drop rate experienced by a flow.

    Convergence times: Convergence times concern the time for
    convergence to fairness between an existing flow and a newly-
    starting one, and are a special concern for environments with high-
    bandwidth flows.  As with fairness, convergence times can matter
    both between flows of the same protocol, and between flows using
    different protocols [SLFK03].

    One metric used for convergence times is the delta-fair convergence
    time, defined as the time taken for two flows with the same round-
    trip time to go from shares of 100/101-th and 1/101-th of the link
    bandwidth, to having close to fair sharing with shares of
    (1+delta)/2 and (1-delta)/2 of the link bandwidth [BBFS01].  A
    similar metric for convergence times measures the convergence time
    as the number of round-trip times for two flows to reach epsilon-
    fairness, when starting from a maximally-unfair state [ZKL04]. '

3.4.  Robustness for Challenging Environments

    While congestion control mechanisms are generally evaluated first
    over environments with static routing in a network of two-way point-
    to-point links, some environments bring up more challenging problems
    (e.g., corrupted packets, variable bandwidth, mobility) as well as
    new metrics to be considered (e.g., energy consumption).

    Robustness for challenging environments: Robustness needs to be
    explored for paths with reordering, corruption, variable bandwidth,
    asymmetric routing, router configuration changes, mobility, and the
    like.  In general, Internet architecture has valued robustness over
    efficiency, e.g., when there are tradeoffs between robustness and
    the throughput, delay, and fairness metrics described above.

    Energy consumption: In mobile environments the energy consumption
    for the mobile end-node can be a key metric that is affected by the
    transport protocol [TM02].

    Goodput: For wireless networks, goodput can be a useful metric,
    where goodput is defined as the fraction of useful data from all of
    the data delivered.  High goodput indicates an efficient use of the
    radio spectrum and lower interference to other users [GF04].

3.5.  Robustness to Failures and to Misbehaving Users

    One goal is for congestion control mechanisms to be robust to
    misbehaving users, such as receivers that `lie' to data senders
    about the congestion experienced along the path or otherwise attempt
    to bypass the congestion control mechanisms of the sender [SCWA99].
    Another goal is for congestion control mechanisms to be as robust as
    possible to failures, such as failures of routers in using explicit
    feedback to end-nodes or failures of end-nodes to follow the
    prescribed protocols,


3.6.  Deployability

    One metric for congestion control mechanisms is their deployability
    in the current Internet.  Metrics related to deployability include
    the ease of failure diagnosis, and the overhead in terms of packet
    header size or added complexity at end-nodes or routers.


3.7.  Metrics for Specific Types of Transport

    In some cases modified metrics are needed for evaluting transport
    protocols intended for QoS-enabled environments or for below-best-

    effort traffic [VKD02, KK03].

4.  Comments on Methodology

    The types of scenarios that are used to test specific metrics, and
    the range of parameters that it is useful to consider, will be
    discussed in separate documents, e.g., along with specific scenarios
    for use in evaluating congestion control mechanisms.

    We note that it can be important to evaluate metrics over a wide
    range of environments, with a range of link bandwidths, congestion
    levels, and levels of statistical multiplexing.  It is also
    important to evaluate congestion control mechanisms in a range of
    scenarios, including typical ranges of connection sizes and round-
    trip times [FK02]. It is also useful to compare metrics for new or
    modified transport protocols with those of the current standards for
    TCP.

    More general references on methodology include [J91].
