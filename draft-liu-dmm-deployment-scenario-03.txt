1.  Introduction

   Distributed mobility management aims at solving the centralized
   mobility anchor problems of the traditional mobility management
   protocol.  The benefit of DMM solution is that the data plane traffic
   does not need to traverse the centralized anchoring point.  This
   document discusses the potential deployment scenario of DMM.  The
   purpose of this document is to help the group to reach consensus
   regarding the deployment model of DMM and then develop the DMM
   solution based on the deployment model.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   All the general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in
   this document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6
   base specification [RFC6275], in the Proxy mobile IPv6 specification
   [RFC5213], and in Mobility Related Terminology [RFC3753].  These
   terms include the following: mobile node (MN), correspondent node
   (CN), and home agent (HA) as per [RFC6275]; local mobility anchor
   (LMA) and mobile access gateway (MAG) as per [RFC5213], and context
   as per [RFC3753].

   In addition, this draft introduces the following terms.

   Location information (LI) function

      is the logical function that manages and keeps track of the
      internetwork location information of a mobile node which may
      change its IP address as it moves.  The information may associate
      with each session identifier, the IP routing address of the MN, or
      of a node that can forward packets destined to the MN.

   Forwarding management (FM)

      is the logical function that intercepts packets to/from the IP
      address/prefix delegated to a mobile node and forwards them, based
      on internetwork location information, either directly towards
      their destination or to some other network element that knows how
      to forward the packets to their ultimate destination.  With data
      plane and control plane separation, the forwarding management may
      be separated into a data-plane forwarding management (FM-DP)

      function and a control-plane forwarding management (FM-CP)
      function.


3.  Deployment Scenario and Model of DMM

   As discussed in the DMM requirement document, the centralized
   mobility management has several drawbacks.  The main problem of the
   centralized mobility management protocols is that all the traffic
   need to anchor to a centralized anchor point.  This approach does not
   cause any problem in current mobile network deployment but in the
   scenario that will be discussed later in this document, centralized
   mobility management protocols will have many drawbacks and it is
   believed that DMM is more suitable in that scenario.

   The main deployment scenario discussed in this document is divided
   into two types.  The first one is the network function virtualization
   scenario.  In this scenario, the mobile core network's control plane
   function is centralized in the mobile cloud.  Apparently, deploying
   the data plane function also in the same centralized mobile cloud is
   not optimized from the traffic forwarding's perspective.  Another
   deployment scenario is the SIPTO/LIPA scenario which is discussed in
   3GPP.  In this scenario, DMM can provide optimized traffic offloading
   solution.


4.  Network Function Virtualization Scenario

   This section discusses network function virtualization scenario, the
   associated control - data plane separation and the possible mobility
   management functions to support this scenario.

4.1.  Network function virtualization deployment architecture

   The network function virtualization scenario is shown in Figure 1.

   Figure 1: Network function virtualization deployment architecture

   In this architecture, the mobile core network is located in the cloud
   /data center, which can be the operator's private cloud.  The access
   network is connected through an IP transit network.  The mobile core
   network can run in a virtualized platform in the cloud/datacenter.

4.2.  Control and data plane separation

   The cloud based mobile core network architecture implies separation
   of the control and data planes.  The control plane is located in the
   cloud and the data plane should be distributed.  Otherwise, all the
   data traffic will go through the cloud which is obviously not
   optimized for the mobile node to mobile node communication.

   For the mobile node to Internet communication, the Internet access
   point is normally located in the metro IP transit network.  In this
   case, the mobile node to Internet traffic should also go through the
   Internet access point instead of the mobile core in the cloud.

Internet-Draft                cloud mobile                    March 2014


   However, in some deployment scenario, the operator may choose to put
   the mobile core cloud in the convergence layer of IP metro network.
   In this case, the Internet access point may co-located with the
   mobile core cloud.  In this case, the mobile node to Internet traffic
   may go through the mobile core cloud.

4.3.  Mobility management architecture

   Since the control plane and data plane are separated and the data
   plane is distributed, traditional mobility management cannot meet
   this requirement.

   Distributed mobility management or SDN based mobility management may
   be used in this architecture to meet the traffic forwarding
   requirement (e.g.  MN to MN and MN to Internet traffic should not go
   through from the mobile core cloud.).

   The traditional mobility management functions is not separating the
   data plane from the control plane.  Basic mobility management
   functions include location information (LI) function and Forwarding
   management (FM).  The former is a control plane function.  The latter
   can be separated into data plane forwarding management (FM-DP) and
   control plane forwarding management (FM-CP).

   The data plane function is FM-DP, while the control plane functions
   include FM-CP and LI.  Then the control plane functions in the cloud-
   based mobile core includes LI and FM-CP.  They are of cause other
   functions in the control plane such as policy function.  The
   distributed data plane may have multiple instances of FM-DP in the
   network.

   When the control of the access network is separate from that of the
   core, there will be separate controllers as shown in Figure 3.

   networks.


5.  SIPTO deployment scenario

   Another deployment scenario is the SIPTO scenario which is discussed
   in 3GPP.  DMM is believed to be able to provide dynamic anchoring.
   It allows the mobile node to have several anchoring points and to
   change the anchoring point according to the application requirement.
   In SIPTO scenario, the gateway function is located very near to the
   access network and to the user.  If using current centralized
   mobility management, the traffic will need to tunnel back to the
   previous anchor point even when the mobile node has changed the point
   of attachment to a new one.


6.  Conclusion

   This document discusses the deployment scenario of DMM.  Two types of
   deployment scenario is discussed in this document.  Further types of
   deployment scenario can be added to this document according to the
   progress of the group's discussion.
