Abstract

Mobile devices place an importance of geo-location. Based upon a 
user's spatial location, certain applications and servers may differ 
as compared to other locations. This draft attempts to list some 
location service scenarios and their impact upon any architecture 
which serves location based services.

Internet Draft   Some Scenarios for an ISL Architecture  March 10, 2000


1. Introduction

1.1 Scope

This document presents some location service scenarios and their 
implications to an ISL architecture.

The main objectives are to present the need not only for mechanisms 
for IP devices to provide or announce their spatial position to other 
IP devices, to request or lookup the spatial position of other IP 
devices, or to locate IP devices physically located in a certain 
region.

It is as important to be able to locate different services available 
for a certain spatial region or location, where the services can 
reside virtually where ever in the IP network.  

This document builds on the ideas contained in draft-nyckelgard-isl-
arch-00.txt [1] and can serve as a basis for further discussions about 
the need for ISL and its requirements.  

1.2 Terminology

ISL - IP Spatial Location
(Geo-)location (based) service - a service using spatial location
LDS - Location Directory Service
LIS - Location Information Service
Service provider - provider providing location based service
Terminal proxy - a device which acts on-behalf of the user's terminal 
for handling location information requests


2. Some Scenarios and Implications

Here are some scenarios which suggest that all above (in section 1.1) 
mentioned functions should be considered for the ISL architecture. 
These scenarios should be seen as a limited set of examples, as a 
basis for further discussion about the needs for ISL and its 
requirements. 
 
2.1 Retrieval of Local Information or Service

Basic assumption: an IP-capable device is providing geo-location based 
information or service. The device can provide information or service 
for specific regions or locations.

Example A:

User N has a mobile device and when moving around (s)he wants to be 
able to access local information or service (e.g. order taxi, call 

Korkea-aho                                                     [Page 3]

Internet Draft   Some Scenarios for an ISL Architecture  March 10, 2000


hospital, etc.) only by clicking on, e.g. a button or link. No matter 
where (s)he is (e.g. Helsinki or Munich), the user can push the same 
button or link and retrieve the local information or service.

Example B:

User N wants to query for information in a certain region from a web 
(or some other) server with the user's mobile or static device.

Implications:

(1) Possibility to find the device providing service or information 
for the specific spatial region/location. 

Since the information or service can be located/distributed between 
different IP devices and may be provided by different providers, there 
needs to be a way of finding the appropriate place where the 
information or service resides virtually based on the requester's 
current spatial location. This could be achieved with a so-called 
Location Directory Service (LDS).

Depending on the capabilities, and the protocols the different parties 
support; the client terminal, a proxy, or the application server could 
look up the appropriate local information or service from a Location 
Directory Service (LDS) for the user. 

(2) 	Communicating and obtaining position information.

It must be possible for the device providing the service to somehow 
obtain  the position information of the client terminal. 

There are several mechanisms discussed and envisioned for this (see 
also [1]):

 * The client device can provide it
 * The service provider device can request it from the client device
 * A terminal proxy presenting the client device can provide it, or it
   can be requested from it
 * The client device can publish the location e.g. at a Location 
   Information Service, or Location Directory Service 
 * The client can publish the address of the place where the 
   position can be obtained at a Location Information Service
 
However, the devices might still use other proprietary or not IP-based 
mechanisms in the complete or as part of the position information 
acquisition. 

2.2 User Subscribed Services

Basic assumption: There are separate servers by the service that take 
care of sending the user subscribed information. The user can set the 
preferences what kind of messages to receive. 

Example A:

User N is in Adelaide and wants to be notified about sights when 
walking around. User N can select what kind of sights to be notified 
of.

Implications:

(1) The system providing this service must be able to determine the 
position of the user periodically (track the user) and/or to 
determine if the user is still within the range for the 
information to be sent.

Korkea-aho                                                     [Page 4]

Internet Draft   Some Scenarios for an ISL Architecture  March 10, 2000


The position information or information that the client is not anymore 
in the region could be retrieved or acquired periodically from the 
client, terminal proxy, LIS, LDS, or some other instance.

(2) In case a distributed system is in consideration, it might be 
required that the system needs to be able to use certain LDS for 
determining the server to be used in the other region. 

2.3 Broadcasting Information to Devices in a Certain Region

Basic assumption: The user should be able to control what kind of 
broadcast messages to receive.

Example A: 

An authority wants to send out an emergency warning about a severe 
snow blizzard. 

Example B:

Local site needs to broadcast that it is shutting down for 
maintenance.

Implication: 

(1) Possibility to determine if an IP devices is in a certain region.

The architecture should enable an IP device to publish its location 
and for other devices to determine if it is in a certain geographical 
region. This could be done with a Location Information Service (LIS), 
or Location Directory Service (LDS). 

2.4 Locate Someone

Example A: 

User N wants to determine where N forgot N's laptop.  

Example B:

User N wants to know where N's dog is running around (the dog has an 
embedded IP device in his dog collar.)

Implication:

(1) Possibility to acquire position information (periodically).

The position information could be retrieved or acquired periodically 
from the client, terminal proxy, LIS, LDS, or some other instance.  

This may raise certain privacy concerns. If the target to be located 
is not N's property, N needs the permission from the target in order 
to do so.

2.5 Infrastructure Services

2.5.1 Conversion between Position Presentations


Korkea-aho                                                     [Page 5]

Internet Draft   Some Scenarios for an ISL Architecture  March 10, 2000


There are many different ways of presenting location information (E.g. 
different coordinate representations, street address, city, region). 
The information can also be presented in different granularities, e.g. 
on country level, regional level, street level, building level, etc.). 
Different systems may use different presentation formats and 
granularities. Users might prefer a specific format.

In order to be interoperable and user friendly there will be a need 
for being able to convert between different presentation formats.

These conversions can be conducted on a application level, but it can 
be argued that one organization will not be able to cover the whole 
world. A common mechanism for providing conversion services will help 
solving this problem.
  
Implication:

(1) Possibility for parties providing conversion services to publish 
what kind of conversion they can do, and mechanism for locating a 
service that can provide the wanted service. 

Preferably there should be a way to charge for the provided service.

2.5.2 Geographical maps

As the conversion service also maps could be served as a general  
service by different providers. The implications are the same as in 
the previous case (section 2.5.1).


3. Some Considerations of Possible Architecture Elements

When considering an ISL architecture it will be important among others 
to consider existing solutions, what could be (re)used, 
interoperability with other systems and system elements, user needs 
and interests of different players. 

An abstraction of possible elements in the ISL architecture is 
presented here for further discussion.

Where

* Terminal can be an IP device or some other device.
* Network gateway translates for non-IP terminal devices
* Terminal proxy can store terminal spatial location information and 
acts on-behalf of the terminal for handling location information 
requests
* LIS - Resolves between location and address for client devices
* LDS - Resolves where certain location services are available

The picture does not necessarily imply a global network, but can be 
split up according to providers, regions, etc. It is neither implied 
that all presented elements would be necessary or mandatory.


4 Considerations 

When possible existing standards and solution should be used. SLP [2] 
and DNS may be able to solve some parts of the mentioned problems. 
However, there are still a lot of work to be done.
