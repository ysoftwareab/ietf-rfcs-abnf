Abstract

   In CoAP as defined by RFC 7252, responses are always unicast back to
   a client that posed a request.  The present memo describes two forms
   of responses that go beyond that model.  These descriptions are not
   intended as advocacy for adopting these approaches immediately, they
   are provided to point out potential avenues for development that
   would have to be carefully evaluated.

Internet-Draft    CoAP: Non-traditional response forms     February 2022


1.  Introduction

   In CoAP as defined by RFC 7252, responses are always unicast back to
   a client that posed a request.  A server may want to send a response
   to a request that it did not receive, may want to multicast a
   response, or both.

   The descriptions in this specification are not intended as advocacy
   for adopting these approaches immediately, they are provided to point
   out potential avenues for development that would have to be carefully
   evaluated.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

   Terms used in this draft:

   Non-traditional response:  A response that is not the single response
      generated for a request received on the same transport.

   Non-matching response:  A response that has properties (typically
      options) that make it incompatible with the original request, and
      thus in particular unsuitable as a cached response to that request
      (but possibly suitable to populate the cache for a similar
      request).  Options that make a response non-matching need to be
      proxy unsafe.

      For example, a Block2 response with a different value of block
      number × block size than indicated in the request is non-matching.

   Configured request:  A request that reaches the server in another way
      than by transmitting a usual CoAP request on the same
      communication channel a response is expected on.

   Embedded request:  A request that is provided by the server to the
      recipient of its response by embedding it into the response.

2.  Sending non-traditional responses

   Non-traditional responses are sets of responses produced for a single
   request, or responses sent without a transmitted request.

   Where tokens are involved, all non-traditional responses use the
   request's token; in any case, they are bound to the original request
   (e.g. by using the same request_kid/request_piv pair in OSCORE
   [RFC8613]).  Where message IDs are involved, one of the non-
   traditional response (the first sent, not necessarily the first
   received as generally the network might reorder messages) can be sent
   as a piggybacked response in an ACK (thus sharing the request's
   message ID), the others are CON or NON responses.

   Some established responses (observations defined in [RFC7641], and
   multicast responses in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis]) match this
   definition and already follow the guidance set out here for non-
   traditional responses; Appendix A gives details for them.

   A second response differing from the first that can be sent by a non-
   deduplicating server responding to a retransmission of a request is
   not non-traditional because there is a second request -- that is
   probably the last corner case at the line separating traditional from
   non-traditional responses.

2.1.  Preconditions to sending non-traditional responses

   A server may send multiple responses to a request if there is any
   property in the request that indicates the client's intention to
   receive them.  This is typically indicated by a request option, and
   rarely in external properties of the message (in the multicast case,
   the destination address).

   A mechanism for eliciting multiple responses must specify the
   conditions under which a token gets freed, as the traditional arrival
   of the response is insufficient.  It may also specify for which
   requests the token can be reused immediately in follow-up requests.
   On unordered transports, or when it's a client's follow-up request
   and not a response that terminates the token, the client needs to
   wait until no reordered non-traditional responses can be expected
   anymore.

   If a non-traditional response answers the original request, no
   further action is required (this is the case of observation: ordering
   is added on top of that to ensure that only the latest response is
   used).  If the response does not answer the original request, it must
   be non-matching, either by an option introduced with the eliciting
   option or by a generic option like Response-For.

Internet-Draft    CoAP: Non-traditional response forms     February 2022


2.2.  Responses without request

   Endpoints may agree out of band on a token (or other request-matching
   details).  One way to do that is to exchange a "phantom request",
   which is a request that client and server will agree to have sent and
   received, respectively, without it actually being sent between those
   endpoints.

   As tokens are managed by the client, that request needs to be
   generated by the client, or in close collaboration with the client
   (for example by the client allowing a third party to use a subset of
   its token values in order to set up non-traditional responses).

3.  Response with embedded request

   A server can send a response to a request that it did not actually
   receive by embedding the request which the response answers in the
   response.

   The option "Response-For" contains a request packaged as in
   Section 5.3 of [RFC8613].  The response is then intended to serve as
   a response to this request.

    +=====+===+===+===+===+==============+========+========+=========+
    | No. | C | U | N | R | Name         | Format | Length | Default |
    +=====+===+===+===+===+==============+========+========+=========+
    | TBD | C | - | - | - | Response-For | opaque | 0-1023 | (none)  |
    +-----+---+---+---+---+--------------+--------+--------+---------+

                     Table 1: The Response-For Option

   The CoAP Token becomes meaningless for this form of response;
   responses with embedded requests are therefore sent with a zero-
   length Token.  (In essence, the "Response-For" option takes the place
   of the request the Token usually stands for.)

   The congestion control considerations for confirmable and non-
   confirmable messages apply unchanged.

4.  Response for configured request

   A request may reach the server using a different means than that used
   for the response.  For instance, the request may be configured in the
   server.  Without limiting generality, we speak about _configured
   requests_.

   The client MUST be cognizant of that configuration as the request
   uses a token from the token name space it controls.

Internet-Draft    CoAP: Non-traditional response forms     February 2022


4.1.  Examples for configured requests

4.1.1.  Example: Periodic request

   A server may be configured to act on a configured request every day
   at 12:00.

4.1.2.  Example: Event driven request

   A server may be configured to act on a configured request each time
   it reboots.

4.1.3.  Example: Configured observe

   A server may be configured with a GET request from a client that
   includes an Observe option with value 0.  This means that the server
   will send updates to the state of the resource addressed by the GET
   request to the configured address of the client.

   The considerations of Section 4.5 of [RFC7641] apply.  How losing
   interest reflects back into to configuration and whether there is
   some form of error notification to the source of the configuration is
   out of scope of the present specification.

4.2.  Multicast responses

   A server MAY send a response to a multicast address.  (This needs to
   be a response to a configured request as a normal request cannot be
   sent _from_ a multicast address.)

   Note that, as the originator of a multicast response is a unicast
   address, the relaxation of matching rules described in Section 8.2 of
   [RFC7252] does not apply.

   The token space in CoAP is owned by the client, which is identified
   by a transport endpoint (address/port).  Here, the address is a
   multicast address, so the token name space is shared by all nodes
   joined to that multicast address.  The assumption for multicast
   responses is that, for each multicast group, there is some form of
   management for the token space (and the port number) that everyone
   can participate that needs to join that multicast group; the specific
   form of management is out of the scope of this specification.  Note
   that this means that multicast responses MUST NOT be sent to
   unmanaged multicast addresses such as All CoAP Nodes (Section 12.8 of
   [RFC7252]).

Internet-Draft    CoAP: Non-traditional response forms     February 2022


   Multicast responses are always non-confirmable.  The congestion
   control considerations for non-confirmable multicast messages apply
   unchanged.

4.3.  Respond-To option

   What has been called "configured request" here may also be triggered
   by a usual CoAP request that carries the Respond-To option.  (The
   term "configured request" is still appropriate as the server ought to
   be configured to accept this option; see Section 6.)

   If a single client wants to request a server to send the response to
   a specific multicast address, it can include the "Respond-To" option.
   This contains an opaque string with the port number as a 16-bit
   number (in network byte order), followed by the IP address (4-byte
   IPv4 or 16-byte IPv6).

     +=====+===+===+===+===+============+========+========+=========+
     | No. | C | U | N | R | Name       | Format | Length | Default |
     +=====+===+===+===+===+============+========+========+=========+
     | TBD | C | U | - | - | Respond-To | opaque |   6-18 | (none)  |
     +-----+---+---+---+---+------------+--------+--------+---------+

                      Table 2: The Respond-To Option

4.4.  Leisure-For-Responses Option

   This new option indicates a number expressed as a uint.  It allows
   the server to send that number of non-traditional response messages
   in addition to the requested response.  They are to be sent without
   undue delay after the original response.

   +=====+=+=+=+===+=======================+========+========+=========+
   | No. |C|U|N| R | Name                  | Format | Length | Default |
   +=====+=+=+=+===+=======================+========+========+=========+
   | TBD | |U|-|   | Leisure-For-Responses | uint   |    1-4 | 0       |
   +-----+-+-+-+---+-----------------------+--------+--------+---------+

                 Table 3: The Leisure-For-Responses Option

   The option is elective, but unsafe for proxies (as the option would
   otherwise cause multiple responses to a proxy that expects only one
   and that needs to be a matching response).  A proxy that chooses not
   to implement it may forward the request with the Leisure-For-
   Responses option removed.

Internet-Draft    CoAP: Non-traditional response forms     February 2022


   On its own, the option does not indicate which kind of additional
   responses the client would expect (though further elective proxy-safe
   no-cache-key options can be added on top of that to give better
   guidance), and the server may choose not to send any at all.

   Intermediaries may add or remove the option, and use incoming
   responses to populate their cache.  They may serve additional
   responses from their cache, but in most cases the sensible course of
   action is to forward the additional responses the origin server
   sends.

   Use cases for Leisure-For-Responses include sending further blocks in
   a Block2 transfer (which are obviously non-matching and thus don't
   need a Response-For), or serving follow-up documents (a response
   containing a single link can be followed by a representation of the
   linked resource, which needs a Request-For header that indicates the
   URI).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft adds the following option numbers to the CoAP Option
   Numbers registry of [RFC7252]:

              +========+=======================+===========+
              | Number | Name                  | Reference |
              +========+=======================+===========+
              | TBD    | Response-For          | RFCthis   |
              +--------+-----------------------+-----------+
              | TBD    | Respond-To            | RFCthis   |
              +--------+-----------------------+-----------+
              | TBD    | Leisure-For-Responses | RFCthis   |
              +--------+-----------------------+-----------+

                       Table 4: CoAP Option Numbers

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

   (Clearly, multicast responses pose a potential for amplification, in
   particular if unverified sources can cause them via Respond-To.
   Discuss how to mitigate.)

   A Respond-To option can be used to incite a server to send data to a
   third party.  This ought not be done blindly, i.e., only with
   considered application assent.

   The CoAP request/response mechanism allows the client to ascertain a
   level of authentication (not resistant though to on-path attackers
   unless the communication is protected) and freshness of the response:
   The Token echoed in the response shows that the responder had
   knowledge of the (fresh) request (Section 5.3.1 of [RFC7252]).
   Responses with embedded requests can not be authenticated or checked
   for freshness this way.  Their content therefore is less trustworthy
   than normal responses unless authenticated in another way (e.g., via
   [RFC8613]).

Appendix A.  CoAP extensions explained by non-traditional responses

A.1.  Observation

   This section describes the Observe option [RFC7641] in the terms of
   this document, [ so nothing in here should contradict that document
   ].

   When Observe:0 is present in a request, this sets up non-traditional
   responses until either of the following conditions is met:

   *  A follow-up request on the same token carries an Observe:1 option.

      (This is primarily in here because; Observe:1 and No-Response:any
      could be combined; otherwise, the other conditions suffice).

   *  Any response does not carry an Observe option.

   *  Any response has a non-successful status.

   Follow-up requests are limited to extending the request ETag set.
   Responses are obviously non-matching by their Observe option; each
   hop discards the Observe option for the purpose of caching and
   refreshes its cache with the most recent one as per the Observe
   value.

A.2.  Responses to multicast requests

   As with observe, this just phrases the existing mechanism in the
   context of this generalization.

   When the destination address of a CoAP request is a multicast
   address, that token is valid for any member of that group (which, for
   the purpose of the client, is any server at all) on any port.

   (Except for that the implications of having received a multicast
   request still need to be followed, it might be seen as a template for
   creating a phantom request to any endpoint, if that suits the
   reader's mental model.)

   Responses can only be sent for up to the deployment's Leisure time
   (see Section 8.2 of [RFC7252]) plus the application's timeout (in
   proxy situations, this needs to be communicated explicitly in the
   Multicast-Signaling option of [I-D.tiloca-core-groupcomm-proxy]).

A.3.  Triangular responses (Response-To)

   The Response-To option can be viewed as a shorthand notation for
   "Consider this a No-Response:any request, but take a copy of it, make
   it into a CoAP-over-UDP request with that particular address as a
   source and any address of yours as a response, and treat that as a
   phantom request".

   [ It may make sense to add an explicit return token, and include a
   No-Response option; that might allow it to be used even across
   proxies. ]

A.4.  Other current documents

   [I-D.tiloca-core-observe-multicast-notifications] is a
   straightforward application of the phantom requests (the concept was
   developed there); Leisure-For-Responses could help it around the
   topic of joining a multicast group securely through a proxy.

   [I-D.tiloca-core-groupcomm-proxy] seems to fit well with the concepts
   here as well, and might be simplified by it both in terminology and
   by replacing Response-Forwarding with Response-For(Proxy-Scheme, Uri-
   Host).
