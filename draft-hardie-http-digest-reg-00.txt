Abstract

     RFC 3230 sets out a process for registering HTTP Digest algorithm
     values with IANA.  This document registers the tokens "hmac-md5"
     and  "hmac-sha-1".


1. Introduction.

     RFC 3230 [1] sets out a process for registering HTTP digest [2]
     algorithm values with IANA.  This document registers two new
     values in the IANA registry created by RFC 3230.
    
       
2.  Newly registered Digest Algorithms.
   
    The following are to be considered http digest algorithm tokens,
    as per Section 4.1.1. of RFC 3230 [1].

    HMAC-MD5          The HMAC-MD5 algorithm, as specified in RFC 2104 [3].
                      The output of this algorithm is encoded using the
                      base64 encoding [4].

    HMAC-SHA-1        The HMAC-SHA-1 algorithm, as specificed in RFC 2104[3]. 
		     The output of this algorithm is encoded using the
		     base64 encoding [4].

3.  IANA Considerations.

     The IANA is requested to insert the new values into the HTTP digest
     algorithm registry.

    
4. Security Considerations.

    In general, the registration of algorithm names and the association of
    those names with identifiable specifications helps ensure that all parties
    to a communication share a common understanding of the algorithm.
