Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module for configuration of an IPsec
   security policy database (SPD).  The policy-based packet filtering
   and the corresponding execution of actions is of a more general
   nature than for IPsec configuration only, such as for configuration
   of a firewall.  It is possible to extend this MIB module and add
   other packet transforming actions that are performed conditionally on
   an interface's network traffic.

   The IPsec and IKE specific actions as documented in [RFCXXXX] and
   [RFCYYYY] respectively and are not documented in this document.

   Note: RFCXXXX and RFCYYYY should be replaced by the RFC Editor when
   these values are determined.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Relationship to the DMTF Policy Model

   The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) has created an object
   oriented model of IPsec policy information known as the IPsec Policy
   Model White Paper [IPPMWP].  The "IPsec Configuration Policy Model"
   (IPCP) [RFC3585] is based in large part on the DMTF's IPsec policy
   model.  The IPCP document describes a model for configuring IPsec.
   This MIB module is a task specific derivation (i.e. an SMIv2
   instantiation) of the IPCP's IPsec configuration model for use with
   SNMPv3.

   The high-level areas where this MIB module diverges from the IPCP
   model are:

Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


   o  Policies, Groups, Conditions, and some levels of Actions are
      generically named.  In other words, IPsec specific prefixes like
      "SA" (Security Association), or "IPsec" are not used.  This naming
      convention is used because packet classification and the matching
      of conditions to actions is more general than IPsec.  The tables
      in this document can possibly be reused by other packet
      transforming actions which need to conditionally act on packets
      matching filters.

   o  Filters are implemented in a more generic and scalable manner,
      rather than enforcing the condition/filtering pairing of the IPCP
      and its restrictions upon the user.  This MIB module offers a
      compound filter object providing greater flexibility for complex
      filters than the IPCP.


4.  MIB Module Overview

   The MIB module is modularized into several different parts: rules,
   filters, and actions.

   The rules section associates endpoints and groups of rules and
   consists of the spdEndpointToGroupTable, spdGroupContentsTable, and
   the spdRuleDefinitionTable.  Each row of the spdRuleDefinitionTable
   connects a filter to an action.  It should also be noted that by
   referencing the spdCompoundFilterTable, the spdRuleDefinitionTable's
   filter column can indicate a set of filters to be processed.
   Likewise, by referencing the spdCompoundActionTable, the
   spdRuleDefinitionTable's action column can indicate multiple actions
   to be executed.

   This MIB is structured to allow for reuse through the future creation
   of extension tables that provide additional filters and/or actions.
   In fact, the companion documents to this one do just that to define
   IPsec and IKE specific actions to be used within this SPD
   configuration MIB.

   The filter section of the MIB module is composed of the different
   types of filters in the Policy Model.  It is made up of the
   spdTrueFilter, spdCompoundFilterTable, spdSubfiltersTable
   spdIpHeaderFilterTable, spdIpOffsetFilterTable, spdTimeFilterTable,
   spdCompoundFilterTable, spdIpsoHeaderFilterTable.

   The action section of this MIB module contains only the simple static
   actions required for the firewall processing that an IPsec SPD
   implementation requires (e.g. accept, drop, log, ...).  The companion
   documents of this document define the complex actions necessary for
   IPsec and IKE negotiations.

Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


   As may have been noticed above, the MIB uses recursion similarly in
   several different places.  In particular the spdGroupContentsTable,
   the spdCompoundFilterTable / spdSubfiltersTable combination, and the
   spdCompoundActionTable / spdSubactionsTable combination can reference
   themselves.

   In the case of the spdGroupContentsTable, a row can indicate a rule
   (i.e. a row in the spdRuleDefinitionTable) or a group (i.e. another
   set of one or more rows in the spdGroupContentsTable).  This way a
   group can contain a set of rules and sub-groups.  Sub-groups are just
   other groups defined in the spdGroupContentsTable.  There is no
   inherit MIB limit to the nesting of groups.

   The spdCompoundFilterTable / spdSubfiltersTable combination and
   spdCompoundActionTable / spdSubactionsTable combination are designed
   almost identically with one being for filters and the other for
   actions respectively.  The following descriptions for the compound
   filter tables can be directly applied to the compound action tables.

   The combination of the tables spdCompoundFilterTable and
   spdSubfiltersTable allow a user to create a set of filters that can
   be referenced any table as a single filter.  A row in the
   spdCompoundFilterTable has the basic configuration information for
   the compound filter.  It's name (spdCompFiltname) references a set of
   rows in the spdSubfiltersTable.  Each row in spdSubfiltersTable
   points at a row in another filter table.  In this way, a set of
   ordered filters composing the compound filter is created.  Note that
   it is possible for one of the rows in the spdSubfiltersTable to point
   at a row in the spdCompoundFilterTable.  This recursion allows the
   creation of a filter set that include other filter sets within it.
   There is no inherit MIB limit to the nesting of compound filters
   within compound filters.

4.1.  Usage Tutorial

   In order to use the tables contained in this document, a general
   understanding of firewall processing is necessary.  The processing of
   the security policy database involves applying a set of firewall
   rules to an interface on a device.  The given set of rules to apply
   to any given interface is defined within the ipspEndpointToGroupTable
   table.  This table maps a given interface to a group of rules.  In
   this table, the interface itself is specified using its assigned
   address.  There is also one group of rules per direction (ingress and
   egress).

4.1.1.  Notational conventions

   Notes about the following example operations:



Baer, et al.             Expires April 15, 2006                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


   1.  All the example operations in the following section make use of
       default values for all columns not listed.  The operations and
       column values given in the examples are the minimal SNMP Varbinds
       that must be sent to create a row.

   2.  The example operations are formatted such that a row (i.e. the
       table's Entry object) is operated on by using the indexes to that
       row and the column values for the that row.

   3.  Below is a generic example of the notation used in the following
       section's examples of this MIB's usage.  It indicates that the
       columns column1 and column2 in row rowEntry with indexes index1
       and index2 are being set to value1 and value2 respectively.:

       rowEntry(index1     = value1,
                index2     = value2)
             = (column1        = column_value1,
                column2        = column_value2)

   4.  The below is a specific example of the notation used in the
       following section's examples of this MIB's usage.  The below
       shows the status of a row in the IP-MIB::ipAddressTable table
       being changed to. deprecated.  The index values for this row are
       IPv4 and 192.0.2.1.  The example notation would look like the
       following:

       ipAddressEntry(ipAddressAddrType = 1,           -- ipv4
                      ipAddressAddr     = 0xC0000201 ) -- 192.0.2.1
                   = (ipAddressStatus   = 2)           -- deprecated

4.1.2.  Implementing an example SPD policy

   As an example, let us define the following administrative policy: On
   the network interface with IP address 192.0.2.1, all traffic from
   host 192.0.2.6 will be dropped and all other traffic will be
   accepted.

   This policy is enforced by setting the values in the MIB to do the
   following:

   o  create a filter for 192.0.2.6

   o  create a rule that connects the 192.0.2.6 filter to a packet drop
      action

   o  create a rule that always accepts packets





Baer, et al.             Expires April 15, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


   o  group these rules together in the proper order so that the
      192.0.2.6 drop rule is checked first.

   o  connect this group of rules to the 192.0.2.1 interface

   The first step to do this is creating the filter for the IPv4 address
   192.0.2.6:

   SpdIpHeaderFilterEntry(spdIpHeadFiltName = "192.0.2.6")
         = (spdIpHeadFiltType            = 0x80,        -- sourceAddress
            spdIpHeadFiltIPVersion       = 1,           -- IPv4
            spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressBegin = 0xC0000206,  -- 192.0.2.6
            spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressEnd   = 0xC0000206,  -- 192.0.2.6
            spdIpHeadFiltRowStatus       = 4)           -- createAndGo

   Next, a rule is created to connect the above "192.0.2.6" filter to an
   action to "drop" the packet, as follows:

   spdRuleDefinitionEntry(spdRuleDefName = "drop from 192.0.2.6")
         = (spdRuleDefFilter             =
                   spdIpHeadFiltType.9.49.57.50.46.48.46.50.46.54,
            spdRuleDefAction             = spdDropAction.0,
            spdRuleDefRowStatus          = 4)           -- createAndGo

   Next, a rule is created that accepts all packets:

   spdRuleDefinitionEntry(spdRuleDefName = "accept all")
         = (spdRuleDefFilter             = spdTrueFilter.0,
            spdRuleDefAction             = spdAcceptAction.0,
            spdRuleDefRowStatus          = 4)           -- createAndGo

   Next, these two rules are grouped together.  Rule groups attached to
   an interface are processed one row at a time.  The rows are processed
   from lowest to highest spdGroupContPiority value.  Because the row
   that references the "accept all" rule should be processed last, it is
   given the higher spdGroupContPriority value.

   SpdGroupContentsEntry(spdGroupContName     = "ingress",
                         spdGroupContPriority = 65535)
        = (spdGroupContComponentName          = "accept all",
           spdGroupContRowStatus              = 4)      -- createAndGo

   SpdGroupContentsEntry(spdGroupContName     = "ingress",
                         spdGroupContPriority = 1000)
        = (spdGroupContComponentName          = "drop from 192.0.2.6",
           spdGroupContRowStatus              = 4)      -- createAndGo

   Finally, this group of rules is connected to the 192.0.2.1 interface

Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


   as follows:

   SpdEndpointToGroupEntry(spdEndGroupDirection = 1,    -- ingress
                           spdEndGroupIdentType = 4,    -- IPv4
                           spdEndGroupAddress   = 0xC0000001)

        = (spdEndGroupName = "ingress",
           spdEndGroupRowStatus = 4)                    -- createAndGo

   This completes the necessary steps to implement the policy.  Once all
   of these rules have been applied, the policy should take effect.

6.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft         IPsec SPD configuration MIB          October 2005


6.1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module used to configure IPsec policy
   services.  Since IPsec provides network security services, its
   configuration data (e.g. this MIB) should be as secure or more secure
   than any of the security services IPsec provides.  There are two main
   threats you need to protect against when configuring IPsec devices.

   1.  Malicious Configuration: only the official administrators should
       be allowed to configure a device.  In other words,
       administrators' identities should be authenticated and their
       access rights checked before they are allowed to do device
       configuration.  The support for SET operations to the IPSP MIB in
       a non-secure environment, without proper protection, can have a
       negative effect on the security of the network traffic affected
       by the IPSP MIB.

   2.  Disclosure of Configuration: In general, malicious parties should
       not be able to read security configuration data while the data is
       in network transit.  In particular, malicious users should be
       prevented from reading SNMP packets containing this MIB's data.
       Any knowledge about a device's IPsec policy configuration could
       help an unfriendly party compromise that device and/or the
       network(s) it protects.  It is thus important to control even GET
       access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values
       of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not include adequate security.  Even
   if the network itself is secure (e.g. by using IPsec), earlier
   versions of SNMP have virtually no control as to who on the secure
   network is allowed to access (i.e. read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Therefore, when configuring data in the IPSEC-SPD-MIB, you SHOULD use
   SNMP version 3.  The rest of this discussion assumes the use of

   SNMPv3.  This is a real strength, because it allows administrators
   the ability to load new IPsec configuration on a device and keep the
   conversation private and authenticated under the protection of SNMPv3
   before any IPsec protections are available.  Once initial
   establishment of IPsec configuration on a device has been achieved,
   it would be possible to set up IPsec SAs to then also provide
   security and integrity services to the configuration conversation.
   This may seem redundant at first, but will be shown to have a use for
   added privacy protection below.

6.2.  Protecting against in-authentic access

   The current SNMPv3 User Security Model provides for key based user
   authentication.  Typically, keys are derived from passwords (but are
   not required to be), and the keys are then used in HMAC algorithms
   (currently MD5 and SHA-1 HMACs are defined) to authenticate all SNMP
   data.  Each SNMP device keeps a (configured) list of users and keys.
   Under SNMPv3 user keys may be updated as often as an administrator
   cares to have users enter new passwords.  But Perfect Forward Secrecy
   for user keys in SNMPv3 is not yet provided by standards track
   documents, although RFC2786 defines an experimental method of doing
   so.

6.3.  Protecting against involuntary disclosure

   While sending IPsec configuration data to a Policy Enforcement Point
   (PEP), there are a few critical parameters which MUST NOT be observed
   by third parties.  Specifically, except for public keys, keying
   information MUST NOT be allowed to be observed by third parties.
   This include IKE Pre-Shared Keys and possibly the private key of a
   public/private key pair for use in a PKI.  Were either of those
   parameters to be known to a third party, they could then impersonate
   the device to other IKE peers.  Aside from those critical parameters,
   policy administrators have an interest in not divulging any of their
   policy configuration.  Any knowledge about a device's configuration
   could help an unfriendly party compromise that device.  SNMPv3 offers
   privacy security services, but at the time this document was written,
   the only standardized encryption algorithm supported by SNMPv3 is the
   DES encryption algorithm.  Support for other (stronger) cryptographic
   algorithms is in the works and may be done as you read this (e.g.
   AES [RFC3826]).  When configure IPsec policy using this MIB, policy
   administrators SHOULD use a privacy security service that is at least
   as strong as the desired IPsec policy.  E.G., If an administrator
   were to use this MIB to configure an IPsec connection that utilizes a
   3DES algorithms, the SNMP communication configuring the connection
   should be protected by an algorithm as strong or stronger than the
   3DES algorithm.

6.4.  Bootstrapping your configuration

   Most vendors will not ship new products with a default SNMPv3 user/
   password pair, but it is possible.  If a device does ship with a
   default user/password pair, policy administrators SHOULD either
   change the password or configure a new user, deleting the default
   user (or at a minimum, restrict the access of the default user).
   Most SNMPv3 distributions should, hopefully, require an out-of-band
   initialization over a trusted medium, such as a local console
   connection.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Only two IANA considerations exist for this document.  The first is
   just the node number allocation of the IPSEC-SPD-MIB itself.

   The IPSEC-SPD-MIB also allows for extension action MIB's.  Although
   additional actions are not required to use it, the node spdActions is
   allocated for any additional actions that wish to use it.  IANA would
   be responsible for allocating any values under this node.
