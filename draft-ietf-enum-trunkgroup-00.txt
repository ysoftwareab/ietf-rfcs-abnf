Abstract

   This document registers the Enumservice 'trunk' and subtypes 'sip'
   and 'tel' using the URI schemes 'sip:' and 'tel:' as per the IANA
   registration process defined in the ENUM specification RFC 3761
   [RFC7761].

   RFC 4904 [RFC4904] defines a technique for the conveyance of carrying
   trunking information in SIP [RFC3261] and or TEL [RFC3966] URI's.
   This Enumservice provides a mechanism for ENUM databases residing in
   service provider networks a mechanism to query for that data.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2008


1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping), RFC 3761 is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication Number
   Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164) [Recommendation E.164] into domain
   names and then uses the Domain Name System (DNS), RFC 1034 [RFC1034]
   and Naming Authority Pointer Records (NAPTR) records in the Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) RFC 3403 [RFC3403] to query the
   services that are available for a specific domain name.

   This document registers an Enumservice 'trunk' according to the
   guidelines given in RFC 3761, to be used for provisioning a NAPTR
   [RFC3403] resource record to indicate a type of connection associated
   with an end point and/or telephone number.  The registration is
   defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System
   [RFC3401][RFC3402][RFC3403][RFC3404][RFC3405]) hierarchy, for use
   with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC 3761.

   The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 dictate that a 'type' and
   one or more 'subtype' should be specified.  Within this set of
   specifications the convention is assumed that the 'type' (being the
   more generic term) defines the service and at least one of the
   'subtype' may indicate the URI scheme.

   In this document, one type is specified, 'trunk' and two subtypes
   'sip' and 'tel' corresponding to the URI scheme specified.

   RFC 4904 defines the general problem statement as to why sip/tel
   URI's need to covey trunkgroup parameters.

   This Enumservice solves the problem of how SIP proxies or other
   intermediate session routing elements can query for and utilize
   trunkgroup data.

   The design of this Enumservice was influenced by several factors:

   RFC 3761 has become the de facto query-response protocol of for a
   variety of data types associated with E.164 numbering, addressing and
   routing.  RFC 3761 is already being used by service providers to
   query for data that has significant privacy or security issues
   associated with it.  RFC 4769 [RFC4769], for instance, describes an
   Enumservice that associates an E.164 number with a PSTN Local Routing
   Number.  This Enumservice extends that functionality to another form
   of PSTN routing data.

   Communications service providers are concerned with the impact of
   call setup up times on the overall user experience.  There is a
   strong desire to maintain a single query-response mechanism for data

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2008


   involving E.164 phone numbers and not complicate call processing
   applications with multiple protocol mechanisms.  Were the query for
   trunkgroup data to require a secondary protocol mechanism such as
   LDAP or IRIS to retrieve the data, it could significantly impact call
   setup times.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Definition of Trunking Data

   Trunking data is defined in RFC 4904 as specific circuits in the PSTN
   that represent a communications paths connecting two switching
   systems that are used in the establishment of a end to end
   connection.


4.  Distribution of Trunkgroup Data

   The distribution of trunkgroup data is generally restricted to
   internal network operations.  The NAPTR records described herein
   SHOULD not be part of the e164.arpa DNS tree.  Distribution of this
   NAPTR data would be either within a service provider's internal
   network, or on a private basis between one or more parties using a
   variety of security mechanisms to prohibit general public access.


5.  Enumservice 'trunk' Response Examples

   This section documents several examples of how this protocol is used
   for illustrative purposes only.

   From examples given in RFC 4904:

5.1.  Trunk group in a global number, with a number prefix trunk-
      context:

   tel:+16305550100;tgrp=TG-1;trunk-context=+1-630

   Transforming this tel URI to a sip URI yields:

   sip:+16305550100;tgrp=TG-1;trunk-context=+1-630@
   isp.example.net;user=phone



Shockey & Creighton      Expires January 8, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2008


   In an ENUM query-response mechanism this data would be presented as
   follows.

   $ORIGIN 0.0.1.0.5.5.5.0.3.6.1.enum4.network.net

   NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+trunk:tel"
   "!^.*$!tel:+16305550100;tgrp=TG-1;trunk-context=+1-630!".

   NAPTR 10 50 "u" "E2U+trunk:sip" "!^.*$!sip:+16305550100;tgrp=TG-
   1;trunk-context=+1-630@isp.example.net;user=phone!".


6.  Implementation Considerations

   There may be one or more trunkgroups associated with a particular
   E.164 number since there may be multiple terminations strategies
   associated with an end-to-end connection.  Since an ENUM query for
   trunkgroup data may return multiple responses, it is important that
   there be unambiguous information on which group to use or the order
   to which sessions should be attempted.

   Implementations of this Enumservice MUST be able to distinguish
   between the order and preference fields in the NAPTR records.  It is
   recommended that implementers should fix the Order field to a single
   value (such as 100) and use the preference field to rank order the
   selections.


7.  Privacy Considerations

   It is assumed that carriers, service providers, or other
   organizations that originate trunkgroup data will not publish such
   information in a globally visible DNS tree, such as e164.arpa.

   This data is strictly for internal service provider use only in
   highly internally cached ENUM databases, which is only able to be
   queried by trusted elements of their network, such as soft switches
   and SIP proxy servers.


8.  Security Considerations

   The trunkgroup Enumservice defined in this document is assumed to be
   used in an environment where elements are trusted and where attackers
   are not supposed to have access to the protocol messages between
   those elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is
   sometimes achieved by using IPSec and sometimes by physically
   protecting the underlying network.  In any case, it is presumed the

   environment where the enum trunkgroup request-response mechanism will
   be used can ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the 'trunk' Enumservice using the type
   'trunk' and the subtypes 'sip' and 'tel' in the Enumservice registry
   described in the IANA considerations in RFC 3761.

9.1.  IANA Enumservice Registration for "trunk"

   Enumservice Name: "trunk"

   Enumservice Type: "trunk"

   Enumservice Subtype: "tel"

   URI Scheme: 'tel:'

   Functional Specification:

   Authors:

      Richard Shockey (richard.shockey@neustar.biz)

9.2.  ENUM Service Registration for PSTN with Subtype "sip"

   Enumservice Name: "pstn"

   Enumservice Type: "pstn"

   Enumservice Subtype: "sip"

   URI Scheme: 'sip:'

   telecommunication session, which may include two-way voice or other
   communications, to the PSTN.

   systems that utilize private the RFC 3761 [ENUM] databases.
