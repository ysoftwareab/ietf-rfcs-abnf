                  Minimal EDNS compliance requirements
                    draft-spacek-edns-camel-diet-00

Abstract

   DNS responders must either follow RFC 6891 by implementing EDNS or
   respond with RCODE=FORMERR to queries containing OPT record.  Non-
   compliant implementations are not worth talking to.

1.  Introduction

   EDNS version 0 was standardized in 1999, but non-RFC 1035 compliant
   implementations still exist and cause lot of extra queries and
   complicated logic in recursive resolvers.  RFC 6891 clearly states
   that FORMERR is the only acceptable answer for implementations
   without support for EDNS.  The cost of supporting these non-compliant
   implementations keeps increasing.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  The Protocol

   No DNS response message to a repeated DNS query containing EDNS
   extension means that the other side is not a DNS responder and the
   querier MUST NOT retry its query without EDNS.

3.  Security Considerations

   Instruction to follow EDNS standard does not change security
   properties beyond what is written in RFC 6891.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   This has no effect on privacy of DNS.
