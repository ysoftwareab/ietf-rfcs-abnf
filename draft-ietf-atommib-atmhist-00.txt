1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   to record and retrieve ATM performance history data recorded in 15
   minute interval.  The functionality defined in this document is
   intended to satisfy the requirements defined by the ATM Forum in [9].

Internet-Draft        ATM Performance History MIB          November 1996


   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

     the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

     the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1231 [2] - the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

     the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
     accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.


3.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for
   recording and retrieving ATM performance history data recorded in 15
   minute intervals.  The functionality defined in this document is
   intended to meet the requirements defined by the ATM Forum in [9].

   Six tables are provided:

   ATM Cell Layer Current Data (per interface)
   ATM Cell Layer History Data (per interface and time interval)

   VPL UPC/NPC Current Data (per VPL termination point)
   VPL UPC/NPC History Data (per VPL termination point and time interval)

   VCL UPC/NPC Current Data (per VCL termination point)
   VCL UPC/NPC History Data (per VCL termination point and time interval)
