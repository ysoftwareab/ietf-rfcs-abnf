                  Network Service Layer Abstract Model
                        draft-xwu-bmwg-nslam-01

Abstract

   While the networking technologies have evolved over the years, the
   layered approach has been dominant in many network solutions.  Each
   layer may have multiple interchangeable, competing alternatives that
   deliver a similar set of functionality.  In order to provide an
   objective benchmarking data among various implementations, the need
   arises for a common abstract model for each network service layer,
   with a set of required and optional specifications in respective
   layers.  Many overlay and or underlay solutions can be described
   using these models.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides a reference model for common network service
   framework.  The main purpose is to abstract service model for each
   network layer with a small set of key specifications.  This is
   essential to characterize the capability and capacity of a production
   network, a target network design.  A complete service model mainly
   includes

      Infrastructure - devices, links, and other equipment.

      Services - network applications provisioned.  It is often defined
      as device configuration and or resource allocation.

      Capacity - A set of objects dynamically created for both control
      and forwarding planes, such as routes, traffic, subscribers and
      etc.  In some cases, the amount and types of traffic may impact
      control plane objects, such as multicast or ethernet networks.

      Performance Metrics - infrastructure resource utilization.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Purpose of The Document

   Many efforts to YANG model and OpenConfig collaboration are well
   under way.  This document specifies a higher layer abstraction that
   reuses a small subset of YANG keywords for service description
   purpose.  It SHALL NOT be used for production provisioning purpose.
   Instead, it can be adopted for design spec, capacity planning,
   product benchmarking and test setup.

   The specification described in this document SHALL be used for
   outline service requirements from customer perspective, instead of
   network implementation mechanism from operators perspective.

1.3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Descriptive terms can quickly become overloaded.  For consistency,
   the following definitions are used.

   o  Node - The name for an attrubute.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

2.  Network Service Framework

   The network service layer abstract model is illustrated by Figure 1.
   This shows a stack of components to enable end-to-end services.  Not
   all components are required for a given service.  A common use case
   is to pick one component as target service with a detailed profile,
   with the remaining components as supporting technologies using
   default profiles.

2.1.  Node

   A network node or a network device processes and forwards traffic
   based on predefined or dynamically learned policies.  This section
   covers standalone features like the following:

   o  INTF - Network interfaces that provides internal or external
      connectivity to adjacent devices.  Only physical properties of the
      interfaces are of concern in this level.  The interfaces can be
      physical or logical, wired or wireless.

   o  FAB - Fabric capacity.  It provides redundancy and cross connect
      within the same network device among various linecards or
      interfaces

   o  QOS - Quality of Services.  Traffic queuing, buffering, and
      congestion management technologies are used in this level

   o  FW - Firewall filters or access control list.  This commonly
      refers to stateless packet inspection and filtering.  Stateful
      firewall is out of scope of this document.  Number of filters
      daisy chained on a given protocol family, number of terms within
      same filter, and depth of packet inspection can all affect speed
      and latency of traffic forwarding.  It also provides necessary
      security protection of node, where protocol traffic may be
      affected.

   o  GR - Graceful Restart per protocol.  It needs to cooperate with
      adjacent node

   o  CGSS - Controller Graceful / Stateful Switchover.  A network
      device often has two redundant controllers to minimize the
      disruption in event of catastrophic failure on the primary
      controller.  This is accomplished via real time state
      synchronization from the primary to the backup controller.  It,
      however, should be used along with either NSR or NSF to achieve
      optimal redundancy.

   o  NSR - Non-Stop Routing - hitless failover of route processor.  It
      maintains an active copy of route information base (RIB) as well
      as state for protocol exchange so that the protocol adjacency is
      not reset.

   o  NSF - Non-Stop Forwarding for layer 2 traffic, including layer 2
      protocols such as spanning tree state

   o  ISSU - In Service Software Upgrade - Sub-second traffic loss in
      many modern routing platforms.  The demand for this feature
      continues to grow from the field.  Some study shows that the
      downtime due to software upgrade is greater than that caused by
      unplanned outages.

2.2.  Topology

   Placement of network devices and corresponding links plays an
   important role for optimal traffic forwarding.  There are two types
   of topologies:

   o  Physical Topology - Actual physical connectivity via fiber, coax,
      cat5 or even wireless.  That could be a ring, bus, star or matrix
      topology.  Even though all can be modeled using point-to-point
      connections.

   o  Logical Topology - With aggregated ethernet, extended dot1q
      tunneling, or VxLAN, a logical or virtual topology can be easily
      created spanning across geography boundaries.  Recent development
      of multi-chassis, virtual-chassis, node-slicing technologies, and
      multiple logical units within a single physical node have enabled
      logical topology deployment more flexible and agile.

   With various topology, the following functionalities need to be taken
   into consideration for feature design and validation.

   o  Active-Standby - 1:1 or 1:n support.  The liveness detection is
      essential to trigger failover.

   o  M-Home - Multi-homing support.  A customer edge (CE) device can be
      homed to 2 or more Provider Edge (PE) devices at the same time.
      This is a common redundancy design in layer 2 service offering

   o  L/B - Load Balancing - When multiple diverse paths exist for a
      given destination, it is important to achieve load balancing based
      on multiple criteria, such as per packet, or per prefix.
      Sometimes, cascading effect can make issues more complex and
      harder to resolve

   The topology, regardless of physical or virtual, can be better
   depicted using a collection of nodes and point-to-point links.  Some
   broadcast network, or ring topology, can also be abstracted using
   same collection of point-to-point links.  For example, in a wireless
   LAN network, each client is a node with wireless LAN NIC as its
   physical interface.  The access point is the node, at which all WLAN
   cients terminate with airwaves.  The Service Set IDentifier (SSID) on
   this access point can be considered as part of broadcast domain with
   many pseudo-ports taking airwave terminations from clients.

   The default link id can use srcnode-dstnode-linkseq to uniquely
   identify a link in this topology.  If this is a link connecting two
   ports on the same node, it can use link-id of srcnode-srcnode-

   proper placement for auto topology diagram.

3.  Service Models

   A service model is a high level abstraction of network deployment
   from bottom up.  It defines a set of common key characteristics of
   customer traffic profile in both control and forwarding planes.  The
   network itself should be considered as a blackbox and deliver the
   services regardless of types of network equipment vendor or network
   technologies.

   The abstraction removes some details like specific IP address
   assignment, and favors address range and its distribution.  The goal
   is to describe aggregated network behavior instead of granular
   network element configuration.  It is up to implementation to map
   aggregated metrics to actual configuration for the network devices,
   protocol emulator and traffic genrator.

   A single network may be comprised of multiple instances of service
   models defined below.

3.1.  Layer 2 Ethernet Service Model

   The metrics outlined below are for layer 2 network services typically
   within a data center, data center interconnect, metro ethernet, or
   layer 2 domain over WAN or even inter-carrier.

   o  service-type: identityref, ELAN, ELINE, ETREE
   o  sites-per-instance: uint32, an average number of sites a layer 2
      instance may span across
   o  global-mac-count: uint32, Global MAC from all attachment circuits,
      local and remote.  This is probably the most important metric that
      determines the capacity requirements in layer 2 for both control
      and forwarding planes
   o  interface-mac-max: uint32, maximum number of locally learned MAC
      addresses per logical interface, aka attachment circuit
   o  single-home-segments: uint32, number of single homed ethernet
      segments per service instance
   o  multi-home-segments: uint32, number of multi homed ethernet
      segments per layer 2 service instance
   o  service-instance-count: uint32, total number of layer 2 service
      instances.  Typically, one customer is
   o  traffic-type: list, {known-unicast: %, multicast, %, broadcast: %,
      unknown-unicast: %}
   o  traffic-frame-size: list, predefined mixture of traffic frame size
      distribution
   o  traffic-load: speed of traffic being sent towards the network.
      This can be defined as frame per second (fps), or actual speed in
      bps.  This is particular important whenever some component along

      forwarding path is implemented in software, the throughput might
      be affected significantly at high speed
   o  traffic-flow: A distribution of flows.  This may affect efficient
      use of load-balancing techniques and resource consumption.  More
      details discussed in later section of this document.
   o  layer3-gateway-count: uint32, number of layer 2 service instances
      that also provide layer 3 gateway service
   o  arpnp-table-size: uint32.  This is only relevant with presence of
      layer 3 gateway

   Integrated routing and bridging (IRB) and EVPN Type 5 route have
   blurred boundaries between layer 2 and layer 3 services.

3.2.  Layer 3 Service Model

   This section outlines traffic type, layer 3 protocol families, layer
   3 prefixes distribution, layer 3 traffic flow and packet size
   distributions.

3.4.  Node Level Features

   TODO: node level feature set

3.5.  Common Service Specification

   For most network services, regardless of layer 2 or layer 3, protocol
   families, the following needs to be considered when measuring network
   capacity and baseline.

   o  rib-learning-time, uint32 in seconds.  This indicates show quickly
      the route processor learns routing objects either locally and
      remotely
   o  fib-learning-time.  In large routing system, forwarding engine
      residing on separate hardware from controller, takes additional
      time to install all forwarding entries learned by controller.
   o  convergence-time, this is could be as a result of many events,
      such as uplink failure, ae member link failure, fast reroute,
      local repair, upstream node failure and etc
   o  multihome-failover-time, this refers to traffic convergence in a
      topology where a customer edge (CE) device is connected to two or
      more provider edge (PE) devices.

   o  issu-dark-window-size.  Unlike NSR, the goal of ISSU is not zero
      packet loss.  Instead, there will be a few seconds, or in some
      cases, sub-second dark window where it sees both total packet loss
      for both transit and or host bound protocol traffic.
   o  cpu-util, total CPU utilization of the controllers in stead state
   o  cpu-util-peak, Peak CPU utilization on the controller in event of
      failure, and convergence
   o  mem-util, total memory utilization of the controllers in steady
      state
   o  mem-util-peak, total memory utilization on the controller in event
      of failure and convergence
   o  processes, list of top processes running on the controllers with
      their CPU and memory utilization.
   o  lc-cpu-util, top CPU utilization on the line cards
   o  lc-cpu-util-peak, maximum peak CPU utilization among all line
      cards in event of failure and convergence
   o  lc-mem-util, top memory utilization on the line cards
   o  lc-mem-util-peak, maximum peak memory utilization among all line
      cards in event of failure and convergence
   o  throughout, in both pps and bps.  This is measured with zero
      packet loss.  For virtualized environment, throughput is sometimes
      measured with a small loss tolerance given the nature of shared
      resource
   o  traffic performance, in both pps and bps.  It is measured the rate
      of traffic received by pumping oversubscribed traffic at ingress
   o  latency in us. this is more important within a local data center
      environment rather than DCI over wide area network.  Use of
      extensive firewall filter or access control lists may affect
      latency
   o  Out of Order Packet - This can happen in intra-node or over ECMP
      where different paths have large latency/delay variations.

   The list of metrics can be used for network monitoring during network
   resiliency test.  This is to understand how quickly a network service
   can restore during various events and failures

3.6.  Common Network Events

   A list of events is defined to characterize network resiliency.
   These attributes require that the provider networks have diverse
   paths and node redundancy built-in.  They directly affect service
   level agreement and network availability.

3.6.1.  Event Attributes

   Each network or system event may each be defined with the following
   aspects

   o  event-iteration, uint16, event to be repeated
   o  event-interval, unit16, seconds in between consecutive events
   o  event-dist, list, random, equal, or other type of event scheduling
   o  event-timeout, uint16, seconds when a single event is expected to
      complete
   o  event-convergence, uint16, seconds before the network can be
      recovered

3.6.2.  Hardware Related

   Some hardware failures can not easily replicated, or even simulated
   in a lab environment, like the memory errors.  A system or network
   should be equipped to monitor, detect and contain the impact to avoid
   global catastrohpic failure that may proagate beyond a single node or
   the regional network.

   o  hw-mod-yank: hardware module removal and insertion.
   o  hw-interface: Transceiver on/off or any other simulated link
      failures.
   o  hw-storage: storage failure, ether local or network attached.
   o  hw-power: unplanned power failure.
   o  hw-controller: Controller failure
   o  hw-memory: memory errors

3.6.3.  Software Component

   o  sw-daemon-watchdog-loss: Induced CPU hog that trigger watchdog
      failure
   o  sw-daemon-restart-graceful: Graceful software daemon restart.
   o  sw-daemon-restart-kill: The process is killed and the daemon was
      forced to restart
   o  sw-daemon-panic: Sometimes a panic can introduced to trigger a
      coredump of software daemon along with restart.
   o  sw-os-panic: network operating system may panic under various
      situations.  Many network products with a console access support
      OS panic with a special sequence keystroke.  Sometimes it may also
      generate a coredump for further debug
   o  sw-upgrade: In many provider networks, the most downtime actually
      come from scheduled maintenance, especially software or firmware
      upgrade to provide better feature set or as a result of security
      patch.  It is important to understand the downtime requirement for
      a routine software upgrade on a given network device or the
      devices in the network.  This often presents a challenge to the
      access network.

3.6.4.  Protocol Events

   o  protocol-keepalive-loss: Loss of keepalive, such as hellos for
      routing-protocols like OSPF and BGP
   o  oam-keepalive-loss: there are many OAM protocols, such as EOAM,
      MPLS OAM, LACP, one of their main purposes is to detect
      reachability.  This is different from routing protocols keepalive
   o  protocol-adjacency-reset: clear all protocol neighbors and any
      routes or link states learned from the neighbor
   o  protocol-db-purge: remove all database objects learned from a
      particular neighbor, or a group of neighbors, or all neigbors.
      The database maybe original set of state learned from neighbors,
      or the consolidated database.

3.6.5.  Redundancy Failover

   The network protocols and design have a lot of redundancy built-in.
   It is important to benchmark their effectiveness.

   o  ha-lag-links: measure packet loss in milliseconds when member
      link(s) of a link aggregation group is torn down.  In case of
      protected interface, traffic should failover seamlessly to the
      backup interface in event of primary link failure
   o  ha-controller: In a system with redundant controller, measure the
      network recovery time when the primary controller fails.  If the
      advanced non-stop routing/forwarding is enabled, the network
      should only experience zero or sub-second traffic loss.
   o  ha-multihome: in addition to device level redundancy, many
      protocols support network layer redundancy though multihoming such
      as EVPN.
   o  ha-mpls-frr: MPLS RSVP Fast ReRoute provides core network
      redundancy
   o  ha-uplink: the core network is typically designed to provide path
      diversity for edge devices, at either layer 2 and layer 3
      connectivity.  The resiliency of network is measured by how fast
      the system detects the failure and reroute the traffic

4.  Use of Network Service Layer Abstract Model

   The primary goal is to characterize and document a complex network
   using a simplified service model.  While eliminating many details
   such as address assignment, actual route or mac entries, it retains a
   set of key network information, including services, scale, and
   performance profiles.  This can be used to validate how well each
   underlying solution performs when delivering same set of services.

   The model can also be used to build a virtualized topology with both
   static and dynamic scale closely resemble to a real network.  This

   eases network design and benchmarking, and helps capacity planning by
   studying the impact with changes to a specific dimension.
