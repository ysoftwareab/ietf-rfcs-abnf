Abstract

   The use of network security mechanisms such as ingress filtering,
   firewall systems and private address spaces can disrupt normal
   operation of Mobile IP [GuGl97]. This document outlines behavioral
   guidelines for Mobile Nodes, their Home Agents and intervening
   Firewalls.  Compliance with these guidelines allows secure datagram
   exchange between a mobile node and its home agent even across
   firewalls, ingress filtering routers and distinct address spaces. To
   its correspondent nodes, the mobile node appears to be connected to
   its home network even while roaming on the general Internet. It
   enjoys the same connectivity (modulo performance penalities) and, if

   desired, privacy outside its protected domain as on the inside.

   The guidelines described here solve a restricted, but still useful,
   variant of the general firewall traversal problem for Mobile IP.
   They make the following assumptions: (a) All intervening firewalls
   belong to the mobile node's protected home domain and their existence
   and relative placement, with respect to a mobile node's current
   location, is known a priori. (b) Mobile nodes use co-located care-of
   addresses (rather than Foreign Agents) when outside their protected
   home domain. (c) Firewalls implement standard protocols for
   authentication and encryption [RFCs 1825, 1826, 1827] but need not
   understand Mobile IP message formats. (d) When private addresses are
   used inside a Mobile node's home domain, the home agent is able to
   distinguish between private and public addresses.

1. Introduction

   The IETF Mobile IP protocol [Per96a] allows a mobile node (MN) to
   continue sending and receiving IP datagrams using a fixed address,
   its home address, even when it is no longer connected to its home
   subnet. When a mobile node visits a foreign subnet, it obtains a
   care-of address on that network and registers that address with its
   home agent (HA), a special entity residing on its home subnet. The
   home agent, in turn, intercepts datagrams meant for the mobile node
   and tunnels them to the registered care-of address. Tunneling refers
   to the process of enclosing the original datagram, as data, inside
   another datagram with a new IP header [Per96b, Per96c]. The new
   header carries the mobile node's care-of address in the destination
   field. The care-of address may belong to a specially designated node
   -- the foreign agent (FA) -- or may be a temporary address assigned
   to one of the interfaces of the mobile node, e.g. through DHCP or
   PPP. In the latter case, the mobile node is said to have a co-located
   care-of address. This mode of operation obviates the need for
   explicit mobility support, in the form of an FA, on the foreign
   subnet, though local policy may still require a mobile node to
   register through an FA.  The recipient of a tunneled packet recovers
   the original datagram before processing it further.

   Mobile IP assumes that routing of unicast traffic is based solely on
   the destination address. Many Internet routers now include other
   considerations in their forwarding decision, e.g. in an effort to
   guard against IP-spoofing attacks, source-filtering routers drop
   datagrams that arrive on an interface inconsistent with their source
   address [CA9621]. Such a router, if present on the foreign network,
   will block all datagrams generated by a visiting mobile node carrying
   its home address as source. A solution to this problem is to use a
   reverse tunnel directed from the mobile node's care-of address to its
   home agent [Mont97]. Under this arrangement, datagrams sent from MN

INTERNET DRAFT      Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP          March 1997


   to a correspondent node (CN) now carry the care-of address (rather
   than the home address) as source in the outermost IP header and pass
   unchallenged through source-filtering routers to the mobile node's
   home agent. The home agent strips the outer IP header and recovers
   the original packet. From then on, the packet is forwarded as if the
   mobile node were on its home subnet.

   Additionally, many organizations use firewalls to protect their
   networks from the general Internet. These firewalls impose additional
   constraints, e.g. they may drop unsolicited datagrams from untrusted
   external hosts [ChZw95]. Such a policy is enforced by carefully
   screening the source and destination addresses, as well as ports, on
   all transport level packets.  For TCP packets, the firewall may also
   monitor the ACK bit. In this situation, a mobile node's registration
   requests are likely to be dropped by a firewall  protecting its home
   network. Note that source-filtering is not an issue here because
   registration requests arrive with a topologically correct source
   address - namely the current care-of address of the mobile node.

   To complicate matters, organizations often hide the topology of their
   internal network by using private addresses. These addresses are not
   advertised to the general Internet. Such addresses include, but are
   not restricted to, those defined in RFC 1918. The Internet's routing
   fabric is unable to route packets to these addresses (resulting in
   ICMP unreachables). To allow connections from the internal network to
   the general Internet, application relays (also called application
   gateways or proxies) are used. In a typical configuration, the
   internal network is separated from the general Internet by a
   "perimeter network" on which the firewall and proxies are located
   [ChZw95] (see Figure 1). Hosts on the peripheral network use public
   addresses, i.e. their addresses are advertised to the general
   Internet. When a host on the internal network wishes to connect to
   the Internet, two separate connections are set up: one between the
   internal host and the proxy and another between the proxy and the
   outside host. To the external host, the user at the other end appears
   to be on the proxy host.

           Figure 1: Screened-subnet firewall architecture.

   The use of private addresses on firewall-protected networks poses an
   additional challenge. A mobile node belonging to such a network can
   not use its home address (a private address) to communicate directly
   with correspondent nodes when it is outside the protected domain
   since replies from correspondent nodes to the private address will
   likely generate a "host unreachable" ICMP message. If, somehow, a
   reverse tunnel can be established from the mobile node to its home
   agent, the mobile node can continue using its private home address.
   Datagrams generated by the mobile node using its home address will
   appear to emerge from its home network and connections to external
   hosts will still involve an intermediate proxy.

   The presence of intermediate firewall(s) disrupts free flow of
   packets from a mobile node on the outside to its home agent on the
   inside. In its current form, this draft provides a conceptual
   framework for achieving the required connectivity by mutual
   cooperation between mobile nodes, their home agents and intervening
   firewalls.  As proposed IPSEC standards stabilize, later revisions
   will incorporate greater details, e.g. message formats required to
   establish dynamic security associations.

2. Solution Overview

   In a security-conscious environment, there are two main obstacles
   preventing free flow of datagrams between a mobile node and its home
   agent. Both can be countered as described below:

INTERNET DRAFT      Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP          March 1997


   (1) Firewalls: Their main purpose is enforcing controlled access
       to the internal network. Firewalls can use IPSEC authentication
       to establish the true identity of a datagram source. Their
       security policy can be appropriately configured such that
       packets between an authenticated mobile node and its home
       agent are allowed to pass.

       Additionally, IPSEC encryption can be used between the outermost
       (perimeter) firewall and the mobile node to keep untrusted
       hosts, outside the protected domain, from prying on a mobile
       node's traffic.

   (2) Ingress Filtering/private address spaces: We group these together
       because both mechanisms are implemented by filtering routers.
       These routers do not forward any datagram in which either:
        (i) The source address is inconsistent with the interface that
            the datagram arrives on, i.e. the source is topologically
            incorrect. Note that an unknown source addresses can be
            thought of as always being topologically incorrect.

       (ii) The destination address is unknown.

       These routers can be countered by using (possibly multiple levels
       of) tunneling such that on the outermost IP header both the
       source and destination addresses are known to the router and
       the source address is topologically correct.

   There are only two kinds of datagrams that need to pass back and
   forth through these obstacles:

   2.1 Assumptions

   Our solution is based on the following assumptions:

   (a) A mobile node can deduce its current location and the sequence
       of firewalls that must be traversed to reach the home agent. The
       exact mechanism for doing so is unspecified and will primarily
       be decided by the local (home) security policy. It may be based
       on manual pre-configuration, user input or a separate dynamic
       firewall-discovery protocol. Such a discovery protocol is beyond
       the scope of this document. For the rest of this article we label
       the intervening firewalls FW1, FW2, ..FWn. Here, FW1 is the
       perimeter firewall guarding the home domain from the Internet.

          Figure 3: Security framework addressed by this document.

   (b) All firewalls are IPSEC-aware and able to establish security
       associations between themselves.

   (c) FW1 is the only firewall whose address is advertised on the
       general Internet, i.e. routers such as R and R' can route
       packets to FW1 but are not aware of the addresses used
       internally by FW2, ... FWn. In contrast, routers on the inside
       are able to route packets for FW1 through FWn but are unaware
       of any addresses used on the outside Internet.

   (d) Any number of routers may exist between the MN (outside the
       home domain), and HA (inside the home domain), any or all of
       which implement source filtering, i.e. they drop packets on
       which the source address is either unknown or inconsistent
       with the interface on which the datagram is received. All
       routers drop packets meant for unknown destinations.

   (e) The Mobile Node is IPSEC aware and can acquire an appropriate
       security association with each firewall such that packets
       authenticated with that association are allowed to pass through.
       This acquisition may either be based on manual configuration or
       a key management and distribution protocol [MSST96, Orma96].

   (f) When MN is outside the protected domain, there are no firewalls
       between it and FW1.

   (g) Nodes within the protected domain trust each other, so, for
       example, there is no need to encrypt a mobile node's traffic
       on network links inside the protected domain. Note that
       procedures defined in this document do not preclude end-to-end
       or other forms of such encryption, should they be required by
       an organization's security policy.

   (h) A home agent belonging to the protected domain is able to
       distinguish between addresses belonging to the protected domain

INTERNET DRAFT      Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP          March 1997


       and those on the outside. Manual configuration is one option
       (e.g. one could supply a list of "internal addresses" and all
       others will be treated as "external). It is also possible to
       introduce a new MN-HA extension in registration requests that
       identifies the care-of address as being "external". This
       essentially transfers the burden of identification from the HA
       to the MN which may be justified since the latter can consult
       the user if needed.

   Note that assumptions (c) and (d) represent additional constraints
   accommodated by our solution rather than solution requirements.

3. Inbound Datagram Processing

   On realizing that it is outside its protected domain, a mobile node
   first establishes a security association with the perimeter firewall.
   IPSEC compliant key management protocols must allow separation
   between an entity's true identity and its current IP address. This
   distinction is crucial for a mobile node when it must send a packet
   with its current care-of address past a firewall. If necessary, this
   exchange may have to be repeated for each of the other firewalls in
   sequence.  To send an "inbound" packet to its home agent, the mobile
   node prepends a tunnel mode authentication header for each firewall
   starting with FWn.  In addition, transport mode encryption may
   (optionally) be inserted before prepending the authentication header
   corresponding to FW1. If both authentication and encryption are
   desired between the mobile node and FW1, the mobile node may choose a
   single ESP transform that accommodates both.

           Figure 4: An "inbound" packet as it leaves the mobile node.

   The security policy on each firewall should be configured to
   processes packets as follows:

   (a) Look for an authentication header in the datagram (drop packet
       if there isn't one) and look up the security association
       referenced by the included Security Parameter Index [RFC1825,
       1826].

   (b) Verify the authenticator (drop packet if authentication fails).

INTERNET DRAFT      Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP          March 1997


   (c) Decrypt packet if ESP is present to recover a new datagram.
       Note that steps (b) and (c) may need to be performed multiple
       times if there are nested security headers for the same
       destination. This process will eventually yield a datagram to
       be forwarded beyond this firewall.

   (d) If the last exposed datagram is likely to be dropped by filtering
       routers before reaching its destination (e.g. because the source
       address is unknown), then tunnel the packet of item (c) to the
       next destination. Either a tunnel-mode IP Authentication Header
       or plain IPinIP may be used since both are able to hide the
       unknown source address (COA) from internal routers.

   Actions (a)-(c) do not place any additional burden on IPSEC compliant
   hosts. Action (d) is required only if the protected domain uses
   private addresses and internal routers are configured to drop packets
   in which the source or destination address is unknown or the source
   is inconsistent with the interface on which the packet arrives. Even
   so, action (d) may not be required at all firewalls, e.g. FWn can
   skip this step if there are no filtering routers between FWn and HA.

   As a result of these actions, the "inbound" datagram datagram looks

   The home agent recovers the original "inbound" packet (Figure 1) and
   processes it as under normal Mobile IP (in the presence of reverse
   tunneling [Mont97]). Note that depending on the kind of tunneling
   used in step (d) and the placement of filtering routers, HA may need
   to be IPSEC aware.

4. Outbound Datagram Processing

   Since hosts inside the protected domain are trusted, non-perimeter
   firewalls like FW2, ..., FWn may be configured to allow outgoing
   packets to pass without any authentication. In this situation,
   outbound datagram processing is quite simple.

   The home agent creates an outbound packet as part of normal Mobile IP
   operation. If the destination is recognized as being outside the
   protected domain, the packet is explicitly directed at the perimeter
   firewall FW1 either by using IPinIP tunneling or a tunnel mode
   Authentication header.  The former requires that FW1 be able to
   decapsulate IPinIP datagrams while the latter requires HA to be IPSEC
   aware. The resulting packet is shown in Figure 8.

                                ---------->
                  +---------+-------+-----+-------+
                  |   MIP   | s=HA  | AH' | s=HA  |
                  | payload | d=COA |     | d=FW1 |
                  +---------+-------+-----+-------+

      Figure 8: Outbound packet as it leaves HA (the authentication
                header may not be needed).

   Once this packet reaches the perimeter firewall FW1 successfully, the
   original "outbound" datagram is recovered (either after IPSEC
   processing or IPinIP decapsulation).

   The security policy on FW1 must be configured as follows:  If a
   packet is to be forwarded to a destination for which a security
   association exists, appropriate IPSEC headers must be added before
   forwarding.

   As a result of this policy, the "outbound" packet looks as shown in
   Figure 9 as it leaves FW1 for the mobile node.

        Figure 9: "Outbound" packet on its way from FW1 to MN.

   Intermediate routers such as R' and R'' see a topologically correct
   source address and a routable (known) destination address.  Once the
   packet reaches the mobile node, the original "outbound" datagram is
   recovered after IPSEC processing and processed as with normal Mobile
   IP.

   If FW2, ... FWn require source authentication even on outgoing
   packets the process by which the outbound datagram reaches FW1 is no
   longer as simple. In this situation the overall processing is similar
   to that described for inbound datagrams but in the reverse direction.

                    | payload | d=COA |     | d=FW1 |
                    +---------+-------+-----+-------+

        Figure 12: An "outbound" packet on its way from FW2 to FW1.

   Note that intermediate firewalls do not need to prepend additional
   headers before forwarding an outbound packet because already the
   outermost source and destination are known to internal routers and
   the source is topologically correct.

5. Closing Remarks

   The mechanism outlined here allows Mobile IP operation even when a
   mobile node roams outside its firewall-protected domain. This
   functionality is achieved at the cost of introducing sub-optimal
   "quadrangle" routing and additional header overhead. The amount of
   header overhead depends on the number of intervening firewalls. In
   most cases just a single firewall must be traversed. Preliminary
   experiments on a SKIP-based implementation [MoGu96] suggest that the
   performance penalty due to IPSEC processing and additional headers on
   sustained throughput is roughly ten percent. Bursty traffic rates can
   show significant variance because the use of Mobile IP and IPSEC
   tunnels delays Path MTU discovery. Several packets may need to be
   sent before the sender's path MTU estimate becomes small enough to
   account for all intermediate tunnels, e.g. one ftp transfer of a 0.5
   MB file attained a transfer rate of 7KB/s but after the path MTU had
   been cached at the sender, the same file was transferred at a rate of
   270 KB/s.

6. Security Considerations

   This entire document discusses security considerations for mobile
   nodes. Using the procedure outlined in this document, datagrams
   between a mobile node and its home agent can pass freely through
   firewalls protecting its home domain. In this situation, the mobile
   node acts as an extension of the security perimeter surrounding its
   home domain and must, therefore, share in the responsibility of
   protecting it from outsiders. In the absence of user-specific
   keying information, someone who steals the mobile node may also
   gain access to the home network.
