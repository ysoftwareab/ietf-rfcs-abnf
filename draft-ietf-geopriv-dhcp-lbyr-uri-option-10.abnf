Length=XX: The length of this option, counted in bytes - not 
              counting the Code and Length bytes. This is a variable
              length Option, therefore the length value will change 
              based on the length of the URI within the Option.

                 location record where the PIDF-LO resides, which
                 indicates the location of the Location Target. The 
                 LuriValue of  LuriType=1 is always represented in 
                 UTF-8.

LuriType=2 Valid-For - The time, in seconds, this URI is to be 
                 considered Valid for dereferencing. The timer

                 this Option by the client. The LuriValue of LuriType=2
                 is always represented as an integer.
