Internet-Draft                Running Code                    March 2009


1.  Introduction

   One of the motto of the IETF is "We believe in rough consensus and
   running code" [RFC4677].  It is difficult to evaluate a protocol
   under development in a series of Internet-Draft documents without
   been able to verify the existence and conformance of the running code
   developed for this protocol.  This document describes how the
   references to such running code must be documented during the
   lifetime of an Internet-Draft.

   Been able to have access to running code during the development of a
   protocol is important for multiple reasons.  First of all an existing
   implementation proves that the protocol is implementable but because
   code can be considered as a formal description of a protocol, it is
   also useful to detect early any design flaws.

   A second major reason for running code is to assess the interest in
   and validity of a new protocol.  A protocol that will never be
   implemented is a waste of IETF resources.  An Internet-Draft that
   cannot collect at least two independent implementations after few
   iterations should be abandoned if no more interest can be found.

   The "running" part in "running code" means that the code must be
   complete and executable, so a code snippet does not fulfill the
   requirement for running code.  The "code" part must be understood as
   source code, as binary code is useless to evaluate the difficulties
   created when implementing the protocol.  Note that this does not mean
   that the code source must be available under a free or open source
   license.  The minimum rights that should be granted for this source
   code are the right to duplicate it for purpose of reading it and the
   right to execute it or generate the binary code to execute it.  Other
   rights, like the right to integrate it as part of another software or
   distribute modified versions can be useful but are not needed for the
   purpose of evaluating the protocol.

   The development of SIP [RFC3261] provides useful examples and the
   incentive to write this memo.  There is a wealth of published code
   for SIP servers and SIP User Agents and this explains in large part
   the success of SIP.  On the other hand, more complex aspects of SIP
   networks, such as routing between numerous servers and other network
   elements and NAT traversal have not been backed up by public
   available routing code.  This has caused very large numbers of I-D
   revisions and sheer endless discussions between experts in the IETF.
   Some of these discussions have not been concluded as of this writing,
   due to the lack of available code to inspect and the lack of
   measurements to prove the assumptions.

   New protocols that have performance implications or protocol

   extensions aimed at improvements of performance or where competing
   protocols already exist must also be accompanied by a discussion of
   the metrics for performance and measurements that prove the
   performance of the protocol.

   Writing and maintaining running code during the development of a new
   protocol is a difficult task so code authors and eventual sponsors
   must be clearly cited in all the versions of the document as a way to
   recognize their contribution.  Even if the code is no longer
   maintained and compatible with subsequent versions of the document,
   its authors and sponsors must still be acknowledged in the Running
   Code Considerations section for the whole lifetime of the document.

   Note that there is no compatibility guaranteed between two versions
   of an Internet-Draft.  Even with early implementations, Internet-
   Draft authors should not hesitate to break compability if it improves
   the protocol.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Content of the Running Code Considerations Section

   The "Running Code Considerations" section MUST be present in all
   Internet-Draft and SHOULD be inserted after the Security
   Considerations and IANA Considerations sections.  This section MUST
   be present even if the document does not describe an implementable
   protocol and should contain in this case a text explaining why this
   section is irrelevant.  The RFC Editor can remove this "Running Code
   Considerations" section before publication as RFC.

   The "Running Code Considerations" section MUST contain the list of
   all protocol implementations starting with the oldest, with the
   author(s) and eventually sponsor(s) names, the URL to where the
   source code can be retrieved and the version(s) of the document that
   this code implements.  In the case a specific code implements
   multiple versions of the document, the URL MUST point to the latest
   version available but the text MUST contain the complete list of
   versions supported.

4.  Security Considerations

   Adding a Running Code Considerations section does not increase the
   security risks in a protocol but can help to detect security issues
   early in the development cycle of this protocol.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.


6.  Running Code Considerations

      Consideration Section [1].  Marc Petit-Huguenin
      <petithug@acm.org>.  Implements version -00.
