         Service Function Chaining Use Cases in Mobile Networks
                draft-haeffner-sfc-use-case-mobility-00

Abstract

   This document provides some exemplary use cases for service function
   chaining in mobile service provider networks.  The objective of this
   draft is not to cover all conceivable service chains in detail.
   Rather, the intention is to localize and explain the application
   domain of service chaining within mobile networks as far as it is
   required to complement the problem statement and framework statements
   of the working group.

   Service function chains typically reside in a LAN segment which links
   the mobile access network to the actual application platforms located
   in the carrier's datacenters or somewhere else in the Internet.
   Service function chains ensure a fair distribution of network
   resources according to agreed service policies, enhance the
   performance of service delivery, take care of security and privacy or
   support application and business support platforms.  General
   considerations and specific use cases are presented in this document
   to demonstrate the different technical requirements of these goals
   for service function chaining in mobile service provider networks.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Terminology and abbreviations

   Much of the terminology used in this document has been defined by the
   3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which defines standards
   for mobile service provider networks.  Although a few terms are
   defined here for convenience, further terms can be found in
   [RFC6459].

   Device  A physical or virtualized function.

   < payload | IP header >  IP packet.

   UE User equipment like tablets or smartphones.

   S-IP  Source IP address.

   D-IP  Destination IP address.

   IMSI  The International Mobile Subscriber Identity that identifies a
      mobile subscriber.

   SGi, Gi  Egress termination point of the mobile network (SGi in case
      of LTE, Gi in case of UMTS/HSPA).  The internal data structure of
      this interface is not standardized by 3GPP.

   PCRF  3GPP standardized Policy and Charging Rules Function.

1.2.  General scope of mobile service chains

   Mobile access networks terminate at a mobile service creation point
   (Packet Gateway) typically located at the edge of an operator IP
   backbone.  From the user equipment (UE) up to the Packet Gateway
   (P-GW) everything is fully standardized by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP) e.g., in [TS.23.401].  Within the mobile
   network, the user payload is encapsulated in 3GPP specific tunnels
   terminating eventually at the P-GW.  In many cases application-
   specific IP traffic is not directly exchanged between the original
   mobile network, more specific the P-GW, and an application platform,
   but will be forced to pass a set of service functions.  Those
   application platforms are, for instance, a web server environment, a
   video platform, a social platform or some other multimedia platform.
   Network operators use these service functions to differentiate their
   services to their subscribers.  Service function chaining is thus
   integral to the business model of operators.

1.3.  General scope of mobile service chains

   Important use cases classes for service function chains generically
   include:

   1.  functions to protect the carrier network and the privacy of its
       users(IDS, FW, ACL, Encryption, Decryption, etc.),

   2.  functions that ensure the contracted quality of experience using
       e.g., performance enhancement proxies (PEP) like video
       optimizers, TCP optimizers or functions guaranteeing fair service
       delivery based on policy based QoS mechanisms,

   3.  functions like HTTP header enrichment that may be used to
       identify and charge subscribers real time,

   4.  functions like CG-NAT/PAT, which are required solely for
       technical reasons, and

   5.  functions like parental control or malware detection that may be
       a cost option of a service offer.

2.  Mobile Network overview

   For simplicity we only describe service function chaining in the
   context of LTE (Long Term Evolution) networks.  But indeed our
   service chaining model also applies to earlier generations of mobile
   networks.

2.1.  Building blocks of 3GPP mobile networks

   The major functional components of a LTE network are shown in
   Figure 1 and include user equipment (UE) like smartphones or tablets,
   the LTE radio unit named eNB (enhanced NodeB), the serving gateway
   (S-GW) which together with the mobility management entity (MME) takes
   care of mobility and the packet gateway (P-GW), which finally
   terminates the actual mobile service.  These elements are described
   in detail in [TS.23.401].  Other important components are the home
   subscriber system (HSS) and the policy and charging rule function
   (PCRF), which are described in [TS.23.203].  The P-GW interface
   towards the SGi-LAN is called SGi-interface, which is described in
   [TS.29.061] and finally the SGi-LAN is the home of service function
   chains (SFC), which are not standardized by 3GPP.

   End to end context including all major components of a LTE network.
   The actual 3GPP mobile network includes the elements from the user
   equipment [UE] to the packet gateway [P-GW].

   The radio-based IP traffic between the UE and the eNB is encrypted
   according 3GPP standards.  Between eNB, S-GW, P-GW user IP packets as
   well as control plane packets are encapsulated in 3GPP-specific
   tunnels.  In some mobile carrier networks the 3GPP specific tunnels
   between eNB and S-GW are even additionally IPSec-encrypted.  For more
   details see [TS.29.281] and [TS.29.274].

   Service function chains act on user plane IP traffic only.  But the
   way these act on user traffic may depend on subscriber, service or
   network specific control plane metadata.

2.2.  General scope of mobile service chains

   The original user IP packet including the Source-IP-Address (S-IP) of
   the UE and the Destination-IP-Address (D-IP) of the addressed
   application platform and leaves the Packet Gateway away from the
   mobile network via the so-called Gi-interface (3G service, e.g.,
   UMTS) respectively SGi-interface (4G service, e.g., LTE).  Between
   this (S)Gi-interface and the actual application platform the user
   generated upstream IP packets and the corresponding downstream IP
   packets are typically forced to pass an ordered set of service
   functions, loosely called a service function chain (SFC).  The set of
   all available service functions (physical or virtualized) which can
   be used to establish different service chains for different services
   is often called a Gi-LAN for 2G/3G services and SGi-LAN for 4G
   services.

   The (S)Gi-interface towards the (S)Gi-LAN itself is discussed in
   [TS.29.061], but service function chaining is not specified by 3GPP.

   The (S)Gi-LAN service functions may use subscriber and service
   related metadata delivered from mobile control plane functions like
   PCRF to process the flows according to service related policies.

   In short, the (S)Gi-LAN service area is presently used by mobile
   service providers to differentiate their services to their
   subscribers and reflect the business model and of mobile operators.

   For different applications (e.g., Appl. 1,2,3) upstream and
   downstream user plane IP flows will be forced to pass a sequence of
   service functions which is called a service chain specific to a given
   application.  In the simple example sketched in Figure 2 the service
   chains for applications 1,2 and 3 may be just classified by an unique
   interface-ID of the egress P-GW interfaces where the service chains
   for application 1, 2 and 3 are attached.

   Service functions typically observe, alter or even terminate and
   reestablish application session flows between mobile user equipment
   and application platforms.

   Typical service function chain topologies as seen in many of today's
   mobile networks.  Control plane metadata supporting policy based
   traffic handling may be linked to individual service functions SFn.
   Because in this example the P-GW classifies service chains we
   consider the P-GW being a component of the service chaining
   environment.

                 Figure 2: Typical service chain topology.

2.3.  The most common classification scheme

   Mobile user equipment like smartphones, tablets or other mobile
   devices address use Access Point Names (APNs) to address a service
   network or service platform.  APNs are DNS host names and comparable
   to FQDN host names.  While a FQDN refers to an Internet IP address,
   an APN (loosely speaking) specifies a P-GW IP address.  These APNs
   are used to distinguish certain user groups and their traffic, e.g.,
   there can be an APN for a mobile service offered to the general
   public while enterprise customers get their own APN.  For APN details
   see [TS.23.003].

   Operators often associate a designated VLAN-ID with an APN.  A VLAN-
   ID n then may classify the service function chain n (SFC n) related
   to an application platform n (Appl. n).

   More sophisticated classifications are feasible using UE related,
   subscriber and service related, as well as network related metadata.
   Typical metadata and their sources are:

   UE:  terminal type (e.g., HTC one); IMSI (country, carrier, user);

   GTP tunnel endpoint:  eNB-Identifier; time;

   PCRF:  subscriber info; APN (service name); QoS; policy rules.

   Mobile operator defined subscriber, service or network specific
   policies are typically encoded in the 3GPP-based "policy and charging
   rules function" (PCRF), see [TS.23.203].  For instance, a PCRF may
   encode the rules that apply to pre-paid and post-paid users, users
   with a classification of gold, silver, or bronze, or even as detailed
   as describing rules that apply to "gold users, wishing to download a
   video file, while these subscribers are subjected to a fair-usage
   policy".  It is up to the mobile service providers to encode the
   precise mappings between its subscriber classes and the associated
   service chains.

3.  Example use cases specific to mobile networks

   Because HTTP via TCP port 80 (or TCP port 443 for HTTPS) is by far
   the most common Internet traffic class, we discuss two typical
   examples of an associated service function chaining model in some
   more detail.

   The models presented below are simplified compared to real life
   service function chain implementations because we do not discuss
   differentiated traffic handling based on different subscriber-
   specific service level agreements and price plans or even actual
   network load conditions.

3.1.  Service chain model for Internet HTTP services

   With the increase of Internet traffic in mobile networks mobile
   operators have started to introduce Performance Enhancement Proxies
   (PEPs) to optimize network resource utilization.  PEPs are more or
   less integrated platforms that ensure the best possible Quality of
   Experience (QoE).  Their service functions include but are not
   limited to Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), web and video optimizations,
   subscriber and service policy controlled dynamic network adaption,
   analytics and management support.

   A simple service function chain model for mobile Internet upstream
   and downstream traffic is shown in Figure 4 below.  The function
   chain includes Load Balancers (LB), which split HTTP over TCP port 80
   away from the rest of the internet traffic.  Beside basic web
   content, this traffic class includes more and more video.  To act on
   this traffic type we force this traffic to pass Performance
   Enhancement Proxies.  The firewall function (FW) protects the carrier
   network from the outside and Network Address Translation (NAT) maps
   the private IP address space dedicated to user equipment to a public
   IP address.

   The first application in the service chain caches web content to help
   reduce Round Trip Times (RTT) and therefore contribute to improved

   web page load times.  This is generally more important for mobile
   service providers than reducing Internet peering costs.  Similar
   arguments hold for cached video content.  We avoid potential large
   jitter imported from the Internet.

   Service function chain to control, steer and manipulate HTTP traffic
   over TCP port 80.  An example for non HTTP:80 traffic is IPsec
   traffic, which is dedicated to port 10000.  Note that in a real
   environment not only port 80 but for example additional traffic via
   port 8080, 25 for SMTP, 110 for POP3 or 143 for IMAP may be forced to
   pass a service chain.

             |                     |

             +---------------------+

    Figure 4: Service function chain for HTTP traffic over TCP port 80.

   A second application is video optimization.  Video content from the
   Internet may not fit in the size of mobile device displays or simply
   would overload the mobile network when used natively.  Therefore
   mobile operators adapt internet-based video content to ensure the
   best Quality of Experience.

   Video content optimization very often is also an additional premium-
   related component in service offers and price plans.

   Our PEP environment for video optimization consists of three basic
   service functions shown in Figure 5: A steering proxy which is able
   to redirect HTTP traffic, a DPI-based controller which checks for
   video content and an optimizer which transcodes videos to an
   appropriate format on the fly in real time.

   In Figure 6 we show the detailed HTTP flows and their redirection in
   some more detail.  The intention here is to show every elementary
   functional step in a chain as a separate physical or virtualized item

3.1.1.  Weaknesses of current approaches

   This use case model highlights the weakness of current service
   deployments in the areas of traffic selection, reclassification, and
   multi-vendor support.  Traffic is classified after the P-GW and

Internet-Draft          SFC Use Cases in Mobility           January 2014


   separated into separate flows based on whether it is (in this
   example) TCP traffic destined to port 80.  This classification could
   be done initially if the load balancer can classify the traffic and
   initiate service chain selection, or the traffic can be reclassified
   at the load balancer if it is already embedded in a service chain
   (e.g., when combined with other functions such as the TCP
   optimization in the following use case).  Multi-vendor support is
   needed because every element in the use case can be provided by a
   different vendor: load-balancer, http proxy, firewall, and NAT.

3.1.2.  Requirements from use case

   This use case imposes the following requirements on a service
   function chaining (SFC) solution:

   REQ1.  SFC solutions MUST support service functions that
          differentially steer traffic.

   REQ2.  SFC solutions MUST support service functions that terminate or
          originate sessions.

   REQ3.  SFC solutions SHOULD allow traffic to, from, and between
          service functions that are remote to the original service
          chain.

   REQ4.  SFC solutions MUST support service functions that change
          payload and IP header data of traffic.

   REQ5.  SFC solutions SHOULD allow service functions to be members of
          multiple service chains.

   REQ6.  SFC solutions SHOULD allow the dynamic adaptation to changing
          network and computing loads by adding or removing edges in the
          graph.

3.2.  Service chain for TCP optimization

   The essential parameters influencing TCP behavior are latency, packet
   loss and available throughput.

   Content servers are mostly attached to fixed networks.  These are
   characterized by high bandwidth and low latency.  Therefore content
   servers often experience large TCP window sizes.  In fixed networks,
   end-to-end TCP window size mismatches do not have that much negative
   impact on data flows.

   On the other hand, mobile networks show a different behavior.  While
   the (S)Gi-side of the network typically exhibits low latency, low



Haeffner & Napper        Expires August 2, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          SFC Use Cases in Mobility           January 2014


   packet loss, high bandwidth and minimal congestion, the Radio Access
   Network (RAN) tends to have higher latency, packet loss, and
   congestion.  Therefore mobile devices normally experience much
   smaller TCP window sizes.

   One way to mitigate these different environments, i.e., the LAN and
   the mobile wireless part, is to use split TCP.  However, this leads
   to the case that the mobile wireless part can experience a different
   TCP window size than the fixed LAN part.

   In mobile networks, these TCP window size mismatches may result in
   poor end-to-end throughput and bad user experience.

   Therefore mobile operators very often use TCP optimization proxies in
   the data path.  These proxies monitor latency and throughput real-
   time and dynamically optimize TCP parameters for each TCP connection
   to ensure a better transmission behavior.

   A rudimentary service chain setup for TCP optimization is shown in
   Figure 7.  Examples of non TCP flows are UDP/RTP voice or video
   traffic.

3.2.1.  Weaknesses of current approaches

   This use case highlights weaknesses of current service deployments in
   the areas of traffic selection, reclassification, and multi-vendor
   support as in the previous use case presented in 4.1.

3.2.2.  Additional requirements from use case

   This use case imposes the following additional requirements on a
   Service Function Chaining solution.

   REQ7.  SFC solutions MUST support service functions that can adapt
          TCP traffic to the local networking needs.

4.  Remarks on QoS in mobile networks

   As indicated in Figure 2, service functions may be linked to the
   control plane to take care of additional subscriber or service
   related metadata.  In many cases the source of metadata would be the
   PCRF and the link would be a Diameter-based Gx interface.  Diameter
   is specified in [RFC6733] and Gx in [3GPP].

   Service functions within the SGi/Gi-LAN are less focused on the
   explicit QoS steering of the actual mobile wireless network.  QoS in
   mobile networks is based on the 3GPP "Bearer" concept.  A Bearer is
   the essential traffic separation element enabling traffic separation
   according different QoS settings and represents the logical
   transmission path between the User Equipment (UE) and the Packet
   Gateway (P-GW).

5.  Weaknesses of current implementations

   In many operator environments every new service introduction may
   result in a further dedicated (S)Gi-LAN service chain.

5.1.  Granularity of the classification scheme

   Often the coarse grained classification according APNs is not fine
   enough to uniquely select a service function chain or a processing
   scheme within a service function chain required to support the
   typical user-, service- or network- related policies which the
   operator likes to apply to a specific user plane flow.

   It is very likely that an APN, such as shown as example in
   Section 2.3, is carrying an extremely diverse set of user traffic.
   This can range from HTTP web traffic to real-time traffic.

5.2.  Service chain implementations

   In many carrier networks service chain LANs grow incrementally
   according product introductions or product modifications.  This very
   often ends in a mix of static IP links, policy based routing or
   individual VRF implementations etc. to enforce the required sequence
   of service functions.  Major weak points seen in many carrier
   networks are:

   o  Very static service chain instances, hard-wired on network layer
      leads to no flexibility with respect to reusing, adding, removing
      service nodes, and reprogramming service chains.

   o  High complexity to manage or maintain evolutionary grown
      "handcrafted" connectivity models.



Haeffner & Napper        Expires August 2, 2014                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          SFC Use Cases in Mobility           January 2014


   o  Basic implementation paradigm based on APNs (that is service
      types) only and

   o  Granularity down to user/service level by individual injections of
      context-related metadata.

   o  No natural information exchange on network status between services
      and network.  This would be fine to manage finite network
      resources based on subscriber profiles more easily.

   o  Practically impossible to implement automated service provisioning
      and delivery platform.

   o  Scaling up flows or service chains with service or subscriber
      related metadata may not work.

6.  Operator requirements

   Mobile operators use service function chains to enable and optimize
   service delivery, offer network related customer services, optimize
   network behavior or protect networks against attacks and ensure
   privacy.  Service function chains are essential to their business.
   Without these, mobile operators are not able to deliver the necessary
   and contracted Quality of Experience or even certain products to
   their customers.

6.1.  Simplicity of service function chain instantiation

   Because product development cycles are very fast in mobile markets,
   mobile operators are asking for service chaining environments which
   allow them to instantly create or modify service chains in a very
   flexible and very simple way.  The creation of service chains should
   be embedded in the business and operation support layers of the
   company and on an abstract functional level, independent of any
   network underlay.  No knowledge about internetworking technology
   should be required at all.  The mapping of the functional model of a
   service chain onto the actual underlay network should be done by a
   provisioning software package as shown in Figure 8.  Details of the
   architecture and design are subject of forthcoming standards and
   proprietary implementation details.

      Figure 8: Creation and provisioning system for service function
                                  chains.

   Service functions can be physical or virtualized.  In the near future
   the majority of mobile service functions will typically reside in the
   local cloud computing environment of a mobile core location.
   Nevertheless, the architecture and design should allow and support
   also remote service functions if applicable.

6.2.  Extensions

   A service function chain should be generalized by a directed graph
   where the vertices (nodes) represent an elementary service function.
   This model allows branching conditions at the vertices.  Branching in
   a graph could then be triggered by typical 3GPP specified mobile
   metadata (see Section 2.3) and allow for more sophisticated steering
   methods in a service chain.  Typically this data will be injected by
   the mobile control plane, commonly by the PCRF via a Diameter-based
   3GPP Gx interface.

   Service chain behavior and output should additionally depend on
   actual network conditions.  For example, the selection of a video
   compression format could dependent on the actual load of the mobile
   network segment a mobile user is attached to.

   To avoid Diameter signaling storms in the (S)Gi-LAN, individual
   service functions should probably not be attached individually to the

   control plane.  A mechanism where metadata information is carried by
   extensions to the user IP packet may be more appropriate, provided
   these extensions do not increase the original payload size too much.

6.3.  Delimitations

   A clear separation between service chaining functionality and 3GPP
   bearer handling is required.  This may be subject of forthcoming
   studies.
