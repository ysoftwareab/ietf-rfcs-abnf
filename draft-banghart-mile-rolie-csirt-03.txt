                  Definition of ROLIE CSIRT Extension
                   draft-banghart-mile-rolie-csirt-03

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core to add the information type categories and
   related requirements needed to support Computer Security Incident
   Response Team (CSIRT) use cases.  The indicator and incident
   information types are defined as ROLIE extensions.  Additional
   supporting requirements are also defined that describe the use of
   specific formats and link relations pertaining to the new information
   types.

1.  Introduction

   Threats to computer security are evolving ever more rapidly as time
   goes on.  As software increases in complexity, the number of
   vulnerabilities in systems and networks can increase exponentially.
   Threat actors looking to exploit these vulnerabilities are making
   more frequent and more widely distributed attacks across a large
   variety of systems.  The adoption of liberal information sharing
   amongst attackers allows a discovered vulnerability to be shared and
   used to attack a vulnerable system within a narrow window of time.
   As the skills and knowledge required to identify and combat these
   attacks become more and more specialized, even a well established and
   secure system may find itself unable to quickly respond to an
   incident.  Effective identification of and response to a
   sophisticated attack requires open cooperation and collaboration
   between defending operators, software vendors, and end-users.  To
   improve the timeliness of responses, automation must be used to
   acquire, contextualize, and put to use shared computer security
   information.

   CSIRTS share two primary forms of information: incidents and
   indicators.  Using these forms of information, analysts are able to
   perform a wide range of activities both proactive and reactive to
   ensure the security of their systems.

   Incident information describes a cyber security incident.  Such
   information may include attack characteristics, information about the
   attacker, and attack vector data.  Sharing this information helps
   analysts within the sharing community to inoculate their systems
   against similar attacks, providing proactive protection.

   Indicator information describes the symptoms or necessary pre-
   conditions of an attack.  Everything from system vulnerabilities to
   unexpected network traffic can help analysts secure systems and
   prepare for an attack.  Making this information available for sharing
   aids in the proactive defense of systems both within an operating
   unit but also for any CSIRTs that are part of a sharing consortium.

   As a means to bring automation of content discovery and dissemination
   into the CSIRT domain, this specification provides an extension to
   the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) core
   [RFC8322] designed to address CSIRT use cases.  The primary purpose
   of this extension is to define two new information types: incident,
   and indicator, along with formats and link relations that support
   these information-types.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
   terminology used in this document can be found in Section 2 of
   [RFC5070].

3.  Additional Requirements for the Atom Publishing Protocol

   This document specifies the following additional requirements for use
   of the Atom Publishing Protocol.[RFC5023]

3.1.  Use of HTTP requests

   This document defines the following requirements on HTTP request
   behavior:

3.1.1.  / (forward slash) Resource URL

   The forward slash resource URL SHOULD be supported as defined in
   Section 5.5 [RFC8322].  Note that this is a stricter requirement than
   [RFC8322].

4.  Additional Requirements for the Atom Syndication Format

   This document does not specify any additional requirements for the
   Atom Syndication Format.  [RFC4287]

5.  Information-type Extensions

5.1.  The "incident" information type

   The "incident" information type represents any information describing
   or pertaining to a computer security incident.  This document uses
   the definition of incident provided by [RFC4949].  Provided below is
   a non-exhaustive list of information that may be considered to be an
   incident information type.

   o  Timing information: start and end times for the incident and/or
      the response.

   o  Descriptive information: plain text or machine readable data that
      provides some degree of description of the incident itself.

Internet-Draft                 ROLIE CSIRT                    March 2018


   o  Response information: the methods and results of a response to the
      incident.

   o  Meta and contact information: data about the CSIRT that recorded
      the information, or the operator that enacted the response.

   o  Effect and result information: data that describes the effects of
      an incident, or what the final results of the incident are.

   Note again that this list is not exhaustive, any information that in
   is the abstract realm of an incident should be classified under this
   information-type.

5.2.  The "indicator" information type

   The "indicator" information type represents computer security
   indicators or any information surrounding them.  This document uses
   the definition of indicator provided by [RFC4949].  Some examples of
   indicator information is provided below, but note that indicator is
   defined in an abstract sense, to be understood as a flexible and
   widely-applicable definition.

   o  Specific vulnerabilities that indicate a vector for attack.

   o  Signs of malicious reconnaissance.

   o  Definitions of patterns of other indicators.

   o  Events that may indicate an attack and information regarding those
      events.

   o  Meta information about the collecting agent.

   This list is intended to provide examples of the indicator
   information-type, not to define it.

5.3.  Use of the rolie:format element

   This document does not contain any additional requirements for the
   rolie:format element; the formats that follow are provided as
   examples of formats that describe the incident and indicator
   information type.  The formats are in no particular order, and are
   not requirements, nor suggestions by the authors.

5.3.1.  IODEF Format

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is a format
   for representing computer security information commonly exchanged
   between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or other
   operational security teams.

   IODEF conveys indicators, incident reports, response activities, and
   related meta-data in an XML serialization.  This information is
   formally structured in order to support and encourage automated
   machine-to-machine security communication, as well as enhanced
   processing at the endpoint.

   The full IODEF specification provides further high-level discussion
   and technical details.

5.3.2.  STIX Format

   STIX is a structured language for describing a wide range of security
   resources.  STIX approaches the problem with a focus on flexibility,
   automation, readability, and extensibility.

   The use of STIX as the content of an Entry does not impose any
   additional requirements on ROLIE implementations.

6.  rolie:property Extensions

   This document provides new registrations for valid rolie:property
   names.  These properties provide optional exposure point for valuable
   information in the linked content document.  Exposing this
   information in a rolie:property element means that clients do not
   need to download the linked document to determine if it contains the
   information they are looking for.

6.1.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:csirt:ID

   Provides an XML element that can be populated with an identifier from
   the indicator or incident document linked to by an atom:content
   element.  This value SHOULD be a uniquely identifying value for the
   document linked to in this entry's atom:content element.

7.  Use of the atom:link element

   These sections define requirements for atom:link elements in Entries.
   Note that the requirements are determined by the information type
   that appears in either the Entry or in the parent Feed.

8.  Other Extensions

   This document defines additional extensions as follows:

8.1.  Use of atom:category

8.1.1.  Newly registered category values

   This document registers two additional registered atom:category
   names: 'urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:csirt:iodef:purpose' and
   'urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:csirt:iodef:restriction'.  These
   categories IODEF content exposure provides valuable metadata for the
   searching and organization of IODEF documents.

   When the name attribute of the category is
   'urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:csirt:iodef:purpose', the value
   attribute SHOULD be constrained as per section 3.2 of IODEF
   [RFC7970], e.g. traceback, mitigation, reporting, or other.

Internet-Draft                 ROLIE CSIRT                    March 2018


   When the name attribute of the category is
   'urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:csirt:iodef:restriction', the value
   attribute SHOULD be constrained as per section 3.2 of IODEF
   [RFC7970], e.g. public, need-to-know, private, default.

8.1.2.  Expectation and Impact Classes

   It is frequently the case that an organization will need to triage
   their investigation and response activities based upon, e.g., the
   state of the current threat environment, or simply as a result of
   having limited resources.

   In order to enable operators to effectively prioritize their response
   activity, it is RECOMMENDED that feed implementers provide Atom
   categories that correspond to the IODEF Expectation and Impact
   classes.  The availability of these feed categories will enable
   clients to more easily retrieve and prioritize cyber security
   information that has already been identified as having a specific
   potential impact, or having a specific expectation.

   Support for these categories may also enable efficiencies for
   organizations that already have established (or plan to establish)
   operational processes and workflows that are based on these IODEF
   classes.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  information-type registrations

   IANA has added the following entries to the "ROLIE Security Resource
   Information Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type> .

10.  Security Considerations

   This document implies the use of ROLIE in high-security use cases, as
   such, added care should be taken to fortify and secure ROLIE
   repositories and clients using this extension.  The guidance in the
   ROLIE core specification is strongly recommended, and implementers
   should consider adding additional security measures as they see fit.

   When providing a private workspace for closed sharing, it is
   recommended that the ROLIE repository checks user authorization when
   the user sends a GET request to the service document.  If the user is
   not authorized to send any requests to a given workspace or
   collection, that workspace or collection should be truncated from the
   service document in the response.  In this way the existence of
   unauthorized content remains unknown to potential attackers,
   hopefully reducing attack surface.

Appendix A.  Non-Normative Examples

   The following provide examples of some potential use cases of the
   CSIRT ROLIE extension, and provides a showcase for some of its
   benefits over traditional solutions.

   The general non-normative examples provided in the core ROLIE
   document remain an excellent reference resource for typical ROLIE
   usage.

A.1.  Use of Link Relations

   A key benefit of using the RESTful architectural style is the ability
   to enable the client to navigate to related resources through the use
   of hypermedia links.  In the Atom Syndication Format, the type of the
   related resource identified in a <link> element is indicated via the
   "rel" attribute, where the value of this attribute identifies the
   kind of related resource available at the corresponding "href"
   attribute.  Thus, in lieu of a well-known URI template the URI itself
   is effectively opaque to the client, and therefore the client must
   understand the semantic meaning of the "rel" attribute in order to
   successfully navigate.  Broad interoperability may be based upon a
   sharing consortium defining a well-known set of Atom Link Relation
   types.  These Link Relation types may either be registered with IANA,
   or held in a private registry.

   Individual CSIRTs may always define their own link relation types in
   order to support specific use cases, however support for a core set
   of well-known link relation types is encouraged as this will maximize
   interoperability.

   In addition, it may be beneficial to define use case profiles that
   correspond to specific groupings of supported link relationship
   types.  In this way, a CSIRT may unambiguously specify the classes of
   use cases for which a client can expect to find support.

   The following sections provide non-normative examples of link
   relation usage.  Three distinct cyber security information sharing
   use case scenarios are described.  In each use case, the unique
   benefits of adopting a resource-oriented approach to information
   sharing are illustrated.  It is important to note that these use
   cases are intended to be a small representative set and is by no
   means meant to be an exhaustive list.  The intent is to illustrate



Banghart & Field        Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                 ROLIE CSIRT                    March 2018


   how the use of link relationship types will enable this resource-
   oriented approach to cyber security information sharing to
   successfully support the complete range of existing use cases, and
   also to motivate an initial list of well-defined link relationship
   types.

A.1.1.  Use Case: Incident Sharing

   This section provides a non-normative example of an incident sharing
   use case.

   In this use case, a member CSIRT shares incident information with
   another member CSIRT in the same consortium.  The client CSIRT
   retrieves a feed of incidents, and is able to identify one particular
   entry of interest.  The client then does an HTTP GET on that entry,
   and the representation of that resource contains link relationships
   for both the associated "indicators" and the incident "history", and
   so on.  The client CSIRT recognizes that some of the indicator and
   history may be relevant within her local environment, and can respond
   proactively.

   Example HTTP GET response for an incident entry:

A.1.2.  Use Case: Collaborative Investigation

   This section provides a non-normative example of a collaborative
   investigation use case.

   In this use case, two member CSIRTs that belong to a closed sharing
   consortium are collaborating on an incident investigation.  The
   initiating CSIRT performs an HTTP GET to retrieve the service
   document of the peer CSIRT, and determines the collection name to be
   used for creating a new investigation request.  The initiating CSIRT
   then POSTs a new incident entry to the appropriate collection URL.
   The target CSIRT acknowledges the request by responding with an HTTP
   status code 201 Created.

   Example HTTP GET response for the service document:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Length: 934
Content-Type: application/atomsvc+xml;charset="utf-8"

<service xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"

      </collection>
      <!-- ...and so on.... -->
    </workspace>
</service>

   As can be seen in the example response, the Atom <collection>
   elements enable the client to determine the appropriate collection
   URL to request an investigation or a trace.

   The client CSIRT then POSTs a new entry to the appropriate feed
   collection.  Note that the <content> element of the new entry may
   contain a RID message of type "InvestigationRequest" if desired,
   however this would NOT be required.  The entry content itself need

   Consistent with HTTP/1.1 RFC, the location header indicates the URL
   of the newly created InvestigationRequest.  If for some reason the
   request were not authorized, the client would receive an HTTP status
   code 403 Unauthorized.  In this case the HTTP response body may
   contain additional details, if an as appropriate.

A.1.3.  Use Case: Cyber Data Repository

   This section provides a non-normative example of a cyber security
   data repository use case.

   In this use case a client accesses a persistent repository of cyber
   security data via a RESTful usage model.  Retrieving a feed
   collection is analogous to an SQL SELECT statement producing a result
   set.  Retrieving an individual Atom Entry is analogous to a SQL
   SELECT statement based upon a primary key producing a unique record.
   The cyber security data contained in the repository may include
   different data types, including indicators, incidents, benchmarks, or



Banghart & Field        Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 17]

   any other related resources.  In this use case, the repository is
   queried via HTTP GET, and the results that are returned to the client
   may optionally contain URL references to other cyber security
   resources that are known to be related.  These related resources may
   also be persisted locally, or they may exist at another (remote)
   cyber data respository.

   Example HTTP GET request to a persistent repository for any resources
   representing Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks:

   GET /csirt/repository/ddos
   Host: www.example.org
   Accept: application/atom+xml

   The corresponding HTTP response would be an XML document containing
   the DDOS feed.

   Example HTTP GET response for a DDOS feed:

   This feed document has two atom entries, one of which has been
   elided.  The completed entry illustrates an Atom <entry> element that
   provides a summary of essential details about one particular DDOS
   incident.  Based upon this summary information and the provided
   category information, a client may choose to do an HTTP GET operation
   to retrieve the full details of the DDOS incident.  This example
   shows how a persistent repository may provide links to additional
   resources, both local and remote.

   Note that the provider of a persistent repostory is not obligated to
   follow any particular URL template scheme.  The repository available

   at the hypothetical provider "www.example.com" uses a different URL
   pattern than the hypothetical repository available at "www.cyber-
   agency.gov".  When a client de-references a link to resource that is
   located in a remote repository the client may be challenged for
   authentication credentials acceptable to that provider.  If the two
   repository providers choose to support a federated identity scheme or
   some other form of single-sign-on technology, then the user
   experience can be improved for interactive clients (e.g., a human
   user at a browser).  However, this is not required and is an
   implementation choice that is out of scope for this specification.
