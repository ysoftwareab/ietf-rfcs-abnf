Abstract

   After an emerency call is completed it is possible that the need for
   further communication between the call-taker and the emergency caller
   arises.  For example, further assistance may be needed but the
   communication previously got interrupted.  A call-taker may trigger a
   callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information
   provided with the initial emergency call.  This callback would then
   be treated like any other call.  As a consequence, it may get blocked
   by authorization policies configured by the person seeking help or
   may get forwarded to his answering machine.

   The current ECRIT framework document addresses callbacks in a limited
   fashion and thereby covers a few scenarios.  This document discusses
   shortcomings and raises the question whether additional solution
   techniques are needed.

1.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the legacy technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help, which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.

   Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency call itself
   provides enough information to allow the call-taker to initiate a
   call back to the emergency caller in case the call dropped or to
   interact with the emergency caller later in case of questions.  Such
   a call, referred as PSAP callback subsequently in this document, may,
   however, be blocked or forwarded to an answering machine as SIP
   entities (SIP proxies as well as the SIP UA itself) cannot associate
   the potential importantance of the call based on the SIP signaling.

      Note that the authors are, however, not aware of regulatory
      requirements for providing preferential treatment of callbacks
      initiated by the call-taker at the PSAP towards the emergency
      caller nor that these calls have to be treated in any form
      differently from any other call.

   Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] discusses the identifiers
   required for callbacks.  Section 13 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework]
   provides the following guidance regarding callback handling:

      A UA may be able to determine a PSAP call back by examining the
      domain of incoming calls after placing an emergency call and
      comparing that to the domain of the answering PSAP from the
      emergency call.  Any call from the same domain and directed to the
      supplied Contact header or AoR after an emergency call should be
      accepted as a call-back from the PSAP if it occurs within a
      reasonable time after an emergency call was placed.

   This approach mimics a stateful packet filtering firewall and is
   indeed helpful in a number of cases but it may fail in others.
   Below, we discuss a few cases where this approach fails.

1.1.  Multi-Stage Resolution

   Consider the following emergency call routing scenario shown in
   Figure 1 where routing towards the PSAP occurs in several stages.  An
   emergency call uses a SIP UA that does not run LoST on the end point.

   Hence, the call is marked with the 'urn:service:sos' Service URN
   [RFC5031].  The user's VoIP provider receives the emergency call and
   determines where to route it.  Local configuration or a LoST lookup
   might, in our example, reveal that emergency calls are routed via a
   dedicated provider FooBar and targeted to a specific entity, referred
   as esrp1@foobar.com.  FooBar does not handle emergency calls itself
   but performs another resolution step to let calls enter the emergency
   services network and in this case another resolution step takes place
   and esrp-a@esinet.org is determined as the recipient, pointing to an
   edge device at the IP-based emergency services network.  Inside the
   emergency services there might be more sophisticated routing taking
   place somewhat depending on the existing structure of the emergency
   services infrastructure.

1.2.  Call Forwarding

   Imagine the following case where an emergency call enters an
   emergency network (state.org) via an ERSP but then gets forwarded to
   a different emergency services network (in our example to police-
   town.org, fire-town.org or medic-town.org).  The same considerations
   apply when the the police, fire and ambulance networks are part of
   the state.org sub-domains (e.g., police.state.org).

1.3.  PSTN Interworking

   In case an emergency call enters the PSTN, as shown in Figure 3,
   there is no guarantee that the callback some time later does leave
   the same PSTN/VoIP gateway or that the same end point identifier is
   used in the forward as well as in the backward direction making it
   difficult to reliably detect PSAP callbacks.

3.  Requirements

   From the previously presented scenarios, the following generic
   requirements can be crafted:

   Reliable Identification:

      The solution approach MUST offer a way to reliable detect a PSAP
      callback in light of the challenges presented in Section 1.

   Resistance Against Security Vulnerabilities:

      The main possibility of attack involves use of the PSAP callback
      marking to bypass blacklists, ignore call forwarding procedures
      and similar features to interact with users and to raise their
      attention.  For example, using PSAP callback marking devices would
      be able to recognize these types of incoming messages leading to
      the device overriding user interface configurations, such as
      vibrate-only mode.  As such, the requirement is ensure that only
      PSAPs can issue callbacks.  This may require secure identification
      of the calling party.

   Fallback to Normal Call

      When the newly defined extension is not recognized by
      intermediaries or other entities then it MUST NOT lead to a
      failure of the call handling procedure but rather a fall-back to a
      call that did not have any marking provided.

   A further differentiation has to be made with respect to relationship
   between the person who previously received the emergency call and the
   person who triggers the callback.  The choices are:

   o  The callback has to be made using the same UA.

   o  The callback has to made by the same user but potentially with a
      different UA.

   o  A different user from a different UA can make the callback.

   [Editor' Note: A requirement has to be formulated.]

4.  Solution Approaches

   This version of the document does not yet contain any specific
   solution approaches.  An example solution can be found in an earlier
   version of [I-D.patel-ecrit-sos-parameter].  The usage of the In-
   Reply-To header is another one.

   Solution categories can be clustered into three areas:

   1.  Verify that the caller is a PSAP

   2.  Verify that the call is related to an emergency, but not
       necessarily an earlier emergency call.  This might include public
       notification (authority-to-citizen).

   3.  Verify that the call is returning an earlier emergency call.

   These solution differ in their semantics and in the security impact
   or user choice.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides discussions problems of PSAP callbacks and
   lists requirements, some of which illustrate security challenges.
   The current version does not yet provide a specific solution but
   rather starts with overall architectural observations.

   An important aspect from a security point of view is the relationship
   between the emergency services network and the VSP (assuming that the
   emergency call travels via the VSP and not directly between the SIP
   UA and the PSAP).  If there is a strong trust relationship between
   the PSAP operator and the VSP (for example based on a peering
   relationship) without any intermediate VoIP providers then the
   identification of a PSAP call back is less problematic than in the
   case where the two entities have not entered in some form of
   relationship that would allow the VSP to verify whether the marked
   callback message indeed came from a legitimate source.

   We would like to thank members from the ECRIT working group, in
   particular Brian Rosen and Milan Patel, for their discussions around
   PSAP callbacks.
