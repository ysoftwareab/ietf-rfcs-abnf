     BGP Extensions to Support Packet Network Slicing in SR Policy
                  draft-liu-idr-bgp-network-slicing-01

Abstract

   [I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing] defines a unified TN-slice
   identifier, AII(administrative instance identifier), to indicate the
   topology, computing, storage resources of the dedicated virtual
   network for both intra-domain and inter-domain network slicing
   scenarios.  This document defines extensions to BGP in order to
   advertise AII in SR policies.

1.  Introduction

   For a packet network, network slicing requires the underlying network
   to support partitioning of the network resources to provide the
   client with dedicated (private) networking, computing, and storage
   resources drawn from a shared pool.

   [I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing] defines a unified TN-slice
   identifier, AII(administrative instance identifier), to indicate the
   topology, computing, storage resources of the dedicated virtual
   network for both intra-domain and inter-domain network slicing
   scenarios, and how to compute SR-BE or SR-TE path according to TN-
   slice Identifier combined with other creteria.

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] details the concepts of SR
   Policy and steering into an SR
   Policy.[I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] specifies the way to
   use BGP to distribute one or more of the candidate paths of an SR
   Policy to the headend of that policy.

   This document defines extensions to BGP in order to advertise AII in
   SR-TE policies.

2.  SR policy with AII

   To distinguish forwarding behavior of different virtual networks,
   each segment lists in SR policy need to be computed within the scope
   of TN-slice identified by AII.  As AII has global significance, all
   segments of the same segment list can share a single AII.  This
   document defines a new AII sub-TLV in Segment List Sub-TLV to
   indicate which slice this segment list belongs to,

   where:

   o Type: TBD1

   o Length: 6

   o Flags: 1 octet of flags.  None are defined at this stage.  Flags
   SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   o RESERVED: 1 octet of reserved bits.  SHOULD be set to zero on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   o AII: Identifies the TN-slice (AII) information corresponding to the
   segment list.

3.  Operations

   The operations about advertisement and reception of SR policy can
   refer to [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  Typically, a
   controller or a PCE can compute SR path taking acount of AII
   criteria, so that the SR path can be limited in the scope of TN-slice
   identified by AII.  The AII information contained in Segment List
   Sub-TLV can help the headend to translate the segment to AII related
   SID, if the Segment Sub-TLV has not provided optional SID
   information.

   Even if Segment Sub-TLV has provided valid SID information, it is
   also beneficial for the headend to know which slice this path belongs
   to, according to the AII information contained in Segment List Sub-
   TLV.

4.  Security Considerations

   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the security considerations discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].
