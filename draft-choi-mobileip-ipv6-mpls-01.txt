Abstract 
    
   This document discusses how to build the large-scale mobile IPv6   
   network along with the MPLS network. It proposes that CR-LDP/RSVP-TE 
   can be applied to set up the QoS guaranteed Label switched path (LSP) 
   tunnels between an LER of mobile node and an LER of correspondent 
   node. It means that the IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels can be replaced by one 
   or multiple LSPs on the MPLS network. This follows design principles 
   such as idle mobile node consideration and QoS guarantee, smooth 
   handoff, no change of Mobile IPv6 etc.

1. Introduction 
    
   Mobile IPv6 [1] allows a mobile node to be always addressable by its 
   home address, whether it is currently attached to its home link or is 
   away from home. While a mobile node is attached to some foreign link 
   away from home, it is also addressable by one or more care-of 
   addresses, in addition to its home address. A care-of address is an 
   IP address associated   with a mobile node while visiting a 
   particular foreign link.  The subnet prefix of a mobile node's care-
   of address is the subnet prefix  (or one of the subnet prefixes) on 
   the foreign link being visited by the mobile node; if the mobile node 
   is connected to this foreign link while using that care-of address, 
   packets addressed to this care-of-address will be routed to the 
   mobile node in its location away from home. 
    
   The MPLS network provides the backbone solution for high-speed IP 
   forwarding and large scalability. And also the MPLS network support 
   appropriate quality-of-service paths for differentiated mobile IP 
   services. The initial MPLS effort will be focused on IPv4. However, 
   the core technology will be extendible to new network layer protocols 
   (e.g., IPv6).  
    
   If IPv6 employs MPLS technology, variable benefit will be expected. 
   Because MPLS is not confined to certain specific link layer 
   technology, it can work with any media over which Network Layer 
   packets can be passed between network layer entities. This aspect

   will be applicable to guarantee user's required QoS and Traffic 
   Engineering because MPLS is well suited for DiffServ and sort of ATM 
   Traffic Engineering. In addition, secure VPN and IPv6 transition 
   benefit will be expected. 
    
   This document proposes the MPLS network architecture and tunneling 
   procedures to support the mobile IPv6 network. Similar concerns on 
   the integration of MPLS network and Mobile IP network are also 
   investigated in [2][3]. However those documents are lack of Mobile 
   IPv6 consideration. 
    
   In terms of control plane concern, both CR-LDP and RSVP-TE are 
   applicable to set up the QoS guaranteed Label Switched Path (LSP) 
   tunnel between a router of the mobile hosts and a router of the 
   correspondent node. 
    
   When the integration of wired and wireless network is designed, there 
   are thins to consider. For example, idle mobile node, smooth handoff, 
   QoS guarantee, etc. Next part describes those design principles. 
    
2. Benefits from MPLS 
    
   2.1. Independency from lower layer technologies 
    
   The MPLS control component centers around IP functionality, which is 
   similar to proprietary multilayer switching solutions. However, MPLS 
   defines new standard-based IP signaling and label distribution 
   protocols, as well as extensions to existing protocols, to support 
   multivendor interoperability. In this way, MPLS brings significant 
   benefits to a packet-oriented Internet. 
    
   The MPLS forwarding component is based on the label-swapping 
   algorithm. If the Layer 2 technology supports a label field (such as 
   the ATM VPI/VCI or the Frame Relay DLCI fields), the native label 
   field encapsulates the MPLS label. However, if the Layer 2 technology 
   does not support a label field, the MPLS label is encapsulated in a 
   standardized MPLS header that is inserted between the Layer 2 and IP 
   headers. The MPLS header permits any link layer technology to carry 
   an MPLS label so it can benefit from label-swapping across an LSP. 
    
   2.2. IPv4 to IPv6 transition benefit 
    
   The ability of the underlying Internet infrastructure to accommodate 
   architectural improvements has proven to be a significant factor in 
   its overall success. Though IPv6 Transition still has lots of 
   scenarios and burdens simultaneously. MPLS, a forwarding and control 
   plane architecture, is a notable example of this.  
    
   Therefore given the wide-scale backbone adoption of MPLS, it is key 
   that IPv6 integrate with this technology. We believes that both are 
   highly complementary since integrating IPv6 transport services over 
   an MPLS topology requires much less backbone infrastructure upgrades 
   or reconfiguration while also supporting dynamic connectivity between 
  
Choi/Kim/Lee                                                       3 Page
              draft-choi-mobileip-ipv6-mpls-01.txt   Expires August 2001 
 
 
   peripheral IPv6 networks. This results from the fact that with MPLS 
   networks, forwarding is based upon labels rather than the IP header 
   itself. As such, the data plane dependency on being able to support 
   native IPv6 packet forwarding is removed, hence eliminating the need 
   for network core hardware and software upgrades, a likely reality for 
   native end-to-end IPv6 forwarding. 
    
   2.3. Connection-Oriented Switching Paradigm 
    
   As a packet of a connectionless network layer protocol travels from 
   one router to the next, each router makes an independent forwarding 
   decision for that packet. That is, each router analyzes the packet's 
   header, and each router runs a network layer routing algorithm. Each 
   router independently chooses a next hop for the packet, based on its 
   analysis of the packet's header and the results of running the 
   routing algorithm. 
    
   Unlike normal routers MPLS LSRs deliver connection-oriented network 
   service. Rather than determining the path of each packet 
   independently, the LSRs establish a path between the endpoints of a 
   connection in a network and send the packets across that path. That 
   LSP is still a virtual connection, sharing the bandwidth of the 
   physical circuit. In contrast to connectionless routing, the LSRs can 
   define the parameters of the virtual connection, including allowable 
   speed and priority. This is crucial to the LSR's ability to manage 
   bandwidth and QoS. 
    
   These distinct features give network managers the ability to tailor 
   network service to the specific needs of diverse applications with 
   varying classes of service. Demanded LSPs make use of LSR thus 
   deliver the variable features such as Fault tolerance, Prioritization, 
   QoS Classes. 
    
   2.4. Well defined QoS support with DiffServ 
    
   Though IPv6 has QoS consideration, it still has things to be solved 
   such as Flow ID issue. In addition, the MPLS shim header achieves the 
   original goals of the Flow ID field. 
    
   MPLS allows the precedence or class of service to be fully or 
   partially inferred from the label.  In this case, one may say that 
   the label represents the combination of a FEC and a precedence or 
   class of service. 
    
   In a DiffServ domain all the IP packets crossing a link and requiring 
   the same DiffServ behavior are said to constitute a Behavior 
   Aggregate (BA). At the ingress node of the DiffServ domain the 
   packets are classified and marked with a DiffServ Code Point (DSCP), 
   which corresponds to their Behavior Aggregate. At each transit node, 
   the DSCP is used to select the Per Hop Behavior (PHB) that determines 
   the scheduling treatment and, in some cases, drop probability for 
   each packet.

   Recent work [4] allows the MPLS network administrator to select how 
   Diff-Serv Behavior Aggregates (BAs) are mapped onto Label Switched 
   Paths (LSPs) so that he/she can best match the Diff-Serv, Traffic 
   Engineering and protection objectives within his/her particular 
   network. 
    
   2.5. Secure VPN 
    
   The secure VPN, one of major applications of MPLS, is also applicable 
   to IPv6 network. The inherent VPN and Traffic Engineering services 
   available within an MPLS environment could enable IPv6 networks going 
   forward to be combined into virtual private networks or extranets 
   over an infrastructure also supporting IPv4 VPNs and MPLS-TE. 
   Additionally MPLS VPNs offer the same level of security as 
   connection-oriented VPNs. Packets from one VPN do not inadvertently 
   go to another VPN.  
    
   VPN traffic is kept separate. Malicious spoofing is nearly impossible 
   because the packets received from customers are IP packets. These IP 
   packets must be received on a particular interface or subinterface to 
   be uniquely identified with a VPN label. 
    
 
3. Features of Mobile IPv6 with MPLS 
    
   3.1. QoS guaranteed LSP setup 
   It is required to program appropriate QoS support for the MN's 
   packets in the intermediate network domains, so that the performance 
   of QoS-sensitive applications running on the MN is maintained at 
   desired level. To achieve this, our model adopts QoS Object [5] to 
   interoperate with CR-LDP/RSVP-TE. 
    
   3.2. Idle mobile node consideration 
   We imagine that wireless IP communicators will be turned around the 
   clock, ready to receive or initiate services. In fact, the vast 
   majority of subscribers will not be actively communicating most of 
   the time. Rather, wireless IP communicators will be switched on, 
   ready for service, constantly reachable by the wireless Internet. In 
   essence, MN will be in an idle state but passively connected to the 
   network infrastructure. Thus design principle is that only active 
   data are supposed to traverse over QoS guaranteed LSP. This will 
   prevent LSP abusing that can be caused by lots of control packets. 
   Thus an LSP is established only between MN's router and CN's router 
   other than LSP via HA. This would be efficient scheme to save 
   bandwidth on network and to reduce end-to-end delay. 
    
   3.3. Smooth handoff support 
   There are two goals in term of handoff; the first, to reduce the 
   latency or interruption due to handoffs; and second, to reduce the 
   signaling load. Mobile IPv6 is considered as optimal solution for 
   those needs. Use of more than on care-of-address by a MN may be 
   useful to improve smooth handoff when the MN moves from on wireless 
   link to another. Our suggested model supports the smooth handoff 
  
Choi/Kim/Lee                                                       5 Page

   scheme of Mobile IPv6 and gives solution to QoS consideration with 
   providing QoS guaranteed multiple LSP for the number of MN's care-of-
   address. 
    
   3.4. Bi-directional LSP extensible 
   While traditional traffic engineered MPLS are unidirectional, 
   generalized MPLS [6] supports the establishment of bi-directional LSP. 
   Bi-directional LSP has the benefit of lower setup latency and lower 
   number of messages required during setup. It takes only one 
   initiator-eliminator round trip time. The suggested model is possible 
   to be expended to generalized MPLS. 
    
   3.5. No obligation of MPLS signaling on MN 
   Mobile IPv6 embedded MN and CN doesn't need to install CR-LDP/RSVP-TE 
   at all. CR-LDP/RSVP runs on a router or switch of MNs and CNs. This 
   will reduce memory cost and complexity of a MN device. 
    
   3.6. No additional messages on legacy MPLS signaling 
   There is no additional Message or TLV/Object on existing CR-LDP/RSVP-
   TE to setup QoS guaranteed LSP between CN's LER and MN's LER. The 
   suggested model adopts data-driven LSP setup. 
    
4. Description of Operation 
    
   4.1. When MN initiates data transmission 
    
   We assume a MN has already done new default router finding [7], 
   Address auto-configuration [8], Registration, and Biding 
   Acknowledgement reception as Mobile IPv6 procedures.

        LSR: Label Switching Router 
        HA: Home Agent 
        MN: Mobile Node 
        FN: Correspondent Node 
    
         Figure 1. The MPLS Network with Mobile IPv6 Support 
    
   When the MN sends packets to any other correspondent node, it sends 
   packets directly to the destination. The MN sets the source address 
   of this packet to the care-of-address and includes a 'Home Address'
   destination option. Then the correspondent node must process the 
   option in a manner consistent with exchanging the Home Address field 
   from the Home Address option into the IPv6 header. Since the home 
   address is static (in contrast to the care-of-address), this allows 
   every correspondent node the transparent use of the care-of-address 
   for layers above the Mobile IPv6 support. Higher layers including 
   applications do not recognize the care-of-address. They only notice 
   the home address. Then the packets from the correspondent node are 
   routed to the HA and tunneled to MN by IPv6-in-IPv6. This routing is 
   called Triangle Routing.  
    
   To avoid triangle routing a MN sends Binding Update that may be 
   together with QoS Object to correspondent node. The MN's LER 
   receiving the Binding Update message should determine whether to 
   initiate REQUEST/PATH message or not. If the Binding Update message 
   has zero H bit, the LER initiates REQUEST/PATH for a destination 
   address (FEC). Now the correspondent IPv6 node receiving the Binding 
   Update message is able to send packets to MN directly. Newly 
   established QoS guaranteed LSP provides tunnel for packets to 
   traverse.

   4.2. When CN initiates data transmission 
    
   We assume a MN has already done new default router finding, Address 
   auto-configuration, Registration, and Biding Acknowledgement 
   reception as Mobile IPv6 procedures. 
    
   Before a CN sends any packet to the MN, the CN should examine its 
   Binding Cache for an entry for an entry for the destination address 
   (Home address) to which the packet is being sent. If the CN has a 
   Binding Cache entry for this address, the CN should use a Routing 
   header to route the packet to the MN by way of the care-of-address in 
   the binding recorded in that Binding Cache entry. We assume that a CN 
   has no Binding Cache entry for the MN in this part. The packet sent 
   by the CN will be intercepted by the MN's HA and tunneled (using 
   IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation) to the MN's current primary care-of-
   address. 
    
   To avoid triangle routing a MN sends Binding Update that may be 
   together with QoS Object to correspondent node. The MN's LER 
   receiving the Binding Update message should determine whether to 
   initiate REQUEST/PATH or not. If the Binding Update message has zero 
   H bit, the LER initiates REQUEST/PATH for a destination address (FEC). 
   Now the correspondent IPv6 node receiving the Binding Update message 
   is able to send packets to MN directly. Newly established QoS 
   guaranteed LSP provides tunnel for packets to traverse.

   4.3. Smooth Handoff 
    
   Use of more than on care-of-address by a MN may be useful to improve 
   smooth handoff when the MN moves from on wireless link to another. If 
   each of these wireless links is connected to the Internet through a 
   separate base station, such that the wireless transmission range from 
   the two base stations overlap, the mobile node may be able to remain

   connected to both links while in the area of overlap. In this case, 
   the MN could acquire a new care-of-address on the new link before 
   moving out of transmission range and disconnecting from the old link. 
   The MN may thus still accept packets at its old care-of-address while 
   it works to update its HA and CNs, notifying them of its new CoA on 
   the new link. 
    
   When a MN acquires new CoA while communicating with CN over legacy 
   LSP, The MN sends Binding Update along with QoS Object to the CN for 
   Route Optimization. The MN's LER receiving the Binding Update message 
   will initiates REQUEST/PATH. Now the correspondent IPv6 node 
   receiving the Binding Update message is able to send packets to MN 
   directly while previous flow have been traversed over the legacy LSP. 
   Which supports smooth handoff scheme over both legacy LSP and newly 
   established QoS guaranteed LSP. The old LSP will be released 
   automatically as time goes by because no more data transmitted over 
   the LSP.

                   Figure 4. Smooth handoff 
    
   There are still lots of discussion to adopt appropriate handoff 
   scheme[9][10]. Our document keeps an eye on those emerging handoff 
   algorithm and will adopt some of them to establish LSP between CN's
   LSR and MN's one. Thus above handoff support LSP scheme may change. 
   For example, If a Handoff scheme use tunnel method between Old Access 
   Router (AR) and New AR, Our scheme may evolve to setup extended LSP 
   between Old AR and New AR. In this case MN can receive data through 
   old LSP and extended LSP as well as newly established LSP associated 
   new CoA. 
    
    
    4.4. QoS supported LSP 
    
   The composition of a QoS OBJECT is shown in Figure 5. A QoS OBJECT is 
   an extension of RSVP QoS and FILTER_SPEC objects. This is originally 
   from [5].

                   Figure 4: Composition of a QoS OBJECT 
    
   o QoS Requirement: This field describes the QoS requirement of the 
   MN's packet stream in terms of traffic class. An example is 
   specification in terms of DiffServ PHB classes such as EF or AF. 
   IntServ classes such as guaranteed service or controlled load service 
   and UMTS QoS class [11] such as delay sensitivity, interactive-delay 
   sensitive, non-interactive delay sensitive or delay insensitive are 
   also supported. 
    
   Some examples are, 
    
        00000xxx: DiffServ EF PHB 
        00001xxx: DiffServ AF PHB 
    
   After some sort of authentication, which is beyond the scope of this 
   document, MN's LSR can send Label REQUEST/PATH message with DiffServ 
   TLV/DiffServ Object to establish E-LSP or L-LSP. 
    
5. Required messages and TLVs 
    
   There are no additional messages and TLVs to existing Mobile IPv6 [1], 
   CR-LDP/RSVP-TE, and Generalized MPLS [6] to operate the suggested 
   model. In order to support QoS guaranteed communication in Mobile 
   IPv6, QoS object described in [5] is required. 
    
6. Conclusion 
    
   We have proposed a scheme to integrate Mobile IPv6 and MPLS. This 
   scheme eliminates usages of IP-in-IP tunneling in the data forwarding. 
  
Choi/Kim/Lee                                                      10 Page
              draft-choi-mobileip-ipv6-mpls-01.txt   Expires August 2001 
 
 
   Switching is much faster than hop-by-hop IP   forwarding, so the 
   transmission delay and packet processing overhead is reduced. We have 
   designed principles such as No change to Mobile IPv6, Idle node 
   consideration, smooth handoff, bi-directional LSP, and QoS guaranteed 
   service. This document will be divided by RSVP-TE centered memo and 
   CR-LDP centered one. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
 
   The Mobile IPv6 and MPLS scheme described in this document is   
   subject to the same security considerations that apply to draft-ietf-
   mobileip-ipv6-13.txt[1], RFC3036[11], RFC3031[12].
