          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB          October 1991



          1. Status of this Memo

          This document is a draft of an experimental portion of the MIB
          containing objects for managing the operation of the Integrated
          IS-IS routing protocol (defined in RFC 1195 [1]).


          2. Abstract

          This document defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols
          in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for
          managing the operation of the Integrated IS-IS routing protocol
          (defined in RFC 1195 [1]).


          3. Introduction

          The Integrated IS-IS routing protocol is an extension of the ISO
          Intra-Domain Routeing Protocol defined in ISO 10589 [2]. The
          extension provides the ability for the protocol to include IP
          reachability information together with OSI reachability
          information.

          This document defines an experimental portion of the MIB
          containing objects for managing the operation of the Integrated
          IS-IS protocol. The objects are mainly derived from the GDMO
          definitions in ISO 10589. There are also additional objects to
          manage the IP-specific functionality of Integrated IS-IS
          operation.


          4. Overview of Objects

          The object definitions are fully contained in Section 5.

          Objects are split into a number of groups. Some of these groups
          are optional either because implementations may choose to omit
          certain pieces of optional functionality or because the
          implementation in a system does not enable some piece of
          functionality. For example, a router which does not implement
          the authentication procedures need not implement the
          authentication group.

          In order to keep the number of groups and tables defined in this
          MIB reasonably small, some tables contain objects which will not
          always be relevant in each entry in the table. For example, the
          system table (isisSysTable) contains objects for both level 1
          and level 2 operation of the protocol, but a specific instance
          of the protocol may be level 1 only. In this cases the level 2
          objects which are irrelevant must still exist in the table entry
          (following the standard MIB conformance requirement) but their
          values are undefined.



          Gunner                                                  [Page 3]




          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB          October 1991



          The defined groups are:

          - System
          - Level 2 IP
          - Authentication
          - Partition Repair
          - Circuit
          - Circuit Authentication
          - IS Adjacency
          - IS Adjacency IP
          - ES Adjacency
          - Reachable Address
          - IP Reachable Address
          - CLNP Destination
          - IP Destination

          The object definitions in general follow the dynamic model of
          creation that is a property of the managed objects defined in
          ISO 10589. This means, for example, that most tables allow
          dynamic creation and deletion of entries (rows) and that many
          other objects have read-write access. However, these operations
          are often restricted according to various states of the system
          as described by the BEHAVIOUR clauses in the ISO 10589 GDMO
          descriptions of the managed objects from which they are derived.
          For example, some objects may only be written when Integrated
          IS-IS operation is disabled. These restrictions are explained in
          line with the object definitions in section 5 together with
          references to general behaviour definitions defined below.

          The MIB provides for multiple instances of the Integrated IS-IS
          protocol to exist on the same system. This is accomplished by
          providing multiple table entries in the system table and, in
          general, by adding an instance index object to all other tables.


          4.1. General Behaviour Definitions


          4.1.1. ResettingTimer behaviour definition

          "This object specifies the interval between certain events in
          the operation of the protocol state machine. If the value of
          this object is set to a new value while the protocol state
          machine is in operation, the implementation shall take the
          necessary steps to ensure that for any time interval which was
          in progress when the value of the corresponding object was
          changed, the next expiration of that interval takes place the
          specified time after the original start of that interval, or
          immediately, whichever is later. The precision with which this
          time shall be implemented shall be the same as that associated
          with the basic operation of the timer object."





          Gunner                                                  [Page 4]




          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB          October 1991



          4.1.2. resourceLimiting behaviour definition

          "This object places limits on some "resource". In general,
          implementations may allocate resources up to this limit when the
          object is enabled and it may be impossible to change the
          allocation without first disabling and subsequently re-enabling
          the object (here disabling and enabling the object means that
          the operational state object associated with the resource
          limiting object is set to off and on respectively). It is only
          required that the value of the object be settable when the
          object is disabled. However, some implementations may be able to
          change the allocation of the resource while the object is
          enabled. In this case it is always permitted to increase the
          value of the object at any time, but it shall not be decreased
          below the currently "used" value of the resource."


          4.1.3. ExistenceState behaviour definition

          "This object controls the creation and deletion of the
          corresponding table row. Setting this object to the value off
          has the effect of invalidating the corresponding row. It is an
          implementation-specific matter whether the agent removes an
          invalidated row from a table. Accordingly, management stations
          must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that
          corresponds to rows not currently valid. Setting the value of
          this object to the same value as its current value has no
          effect. If the table entry also contains an object controlling
          the operational state of a row (which follows the
          operationalState behaviour) then the object following the
          existenceState behaviour shall not be set to off when the object
          following the operationalState behaviour has value on. An
          attempt to do so is rejected."


          4.1.4. OperationalState behaviour definition

          "This object controls the enabling and disabling of the
          corresponding table row. Setting this object to the value off
          has the effect of disabling the corresponding row. Setting this
          object to the value on has the effect of enabling the
          corresponding row. Setting the value of this object to the same
          value as its current value has no effect. If the table entry
          also contains an object controlling the existence state of a row
          (which follows the existenceState behaviour) then the object
          following the operationalState behaviour shall not be set to on
          when the object following the existenceState behaviour has value
          off. An attempt to do so is rejected.


          4.1.5. ReplaceOnlyWhileDisabled behaviour definition

          "This object shall only be set when the corresponding row is



          Gunner                                                  [Page 5]

          disabled (has the value off for the corresponding operational
          state object)."


          4.2. Row creation and deletion

          Row creation in the tables defined in this MIB may be
          accomplished according to the mechanisms outlined in [3]. An
          agent is permitted to follow any of the mechanims defined in
          [3]. If the agent does permit row creation then the following
          description shows one method by which this can be done.

          Row creation may be actioned when an SNMP Set PDU is received
          which sets the value of one or more objects in a non-existant
          row in a table. The agent may then create a new row for the
          table setting the values of the objects appearing in the Set PDU
          and those index objects whose values are implicitly set by the
          OIDs for the objects in the PDU. The xxxExistState object for
          the row should be set to the value on by the agent; the
          xxxOperState object for the row should be set to off if not
          explicitly set; and all objects not explicitly set but which
          have a default value defined may have their values set to the
          default. At this stage, there may be objects in the row which
          still have no defined value because they do not have a default
          value defined and because they were not explicitly set by the
          Set PDU. Before the xxxOperState object can be set to on, such
          objects should have their values set by further Set PDUs.

          An agent may impose a time limit on the creation of a row so
          that incompletely created rows (those created by a Set PDU but
          which still have some objects with undefined values) may be
          garbage-collected should the initiating management station fail
          to complete the row creation.

          Row deletion is accomplished by setting the value of a single
          object, generally named "xxxExistState" in the row defined to
          have that semantic. Agents may optionally remove the complete
          row from the MIB or leave it present. The semantics of a row
          which is left present but which has been "deleted" are that it
          appears in Get Response PDUs but that it is treated as
          non-existant for all other purposes including row creation.


          4.3. Events and Traps

          No attempt has been made in this MIB to define SNMP traps
          equivalent to the Notifications defined in DIS 10589.


          4.4. Format of Definitions

          The object definitions in Section 5 use the OBJECT-TYPE macro
          defined in [3] These definitions are self-describing.



          Gunner                                                  [Page 6]




          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB          October 1991



          The definitions make use of the new type OSINSAddress in some
          INDEX clauses of the OBJECT-TYPE macro. In forming the
          instance-identifier associated with such an INDEX clause usage,
          the OSINSAddress is treated as a variable length OCTET STRING so
          that it forms n+1 sub-identifiers, where n is the length of the
          OCTET STRING (the first sub-identifier is n itself, following
          this, each octet of the OCTET STRING is encoded in a separate
          sub-identifier).

                 type are defined:

                    none: The mapping is null because the neighbor SNPA is
                    implicit by nature of the subnetwork (e.g. a
                    point-to-point linkage).

                    explicit: The subnetwork addresses in the object
                    isisRASNPAAddress is to be used.

                    extractIDI: The SNPA is embedded in the IDI of the
                    destination NSAP Address. The mapping algorithm
                    extracts the SNPA to be used according to the format
                    and encoding rules of ISO8473/Add2. This SNPA

                    embedded in the DSP of the destination address. This
                    SNPA extraction algorithm extracts the embedded

                    logical AND of the isisRASNPAMask object value with
                    the destination address. The part of the SNPA
                    extracted from the destination NSAP is appended to the
