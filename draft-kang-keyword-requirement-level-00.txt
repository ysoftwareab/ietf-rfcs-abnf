Status of this Memo
   
     This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
     documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its
     areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also
     distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

     Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
     months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other

Abstract

   In many IETF documents several key words are used to signify the   
   requirements in the spefcification. This document defines the 
   requirement levels imposed by these words as they should be     
   interpreted in IETF documments. The requirement levels are basically 
   equivalent to the ones proposed by RFC 2119[1]. But easier to          
   understand the strength of key words and to introduce new key words 
   to the hierarchy of requirement levels if ever there's a need. 

1. Introduction

   RFC 2119 addresses the use of  frequently used Key words in Internet 
   standard track  documents such as MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD    
   NOT, REQURIED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, and   RECOMMENDED. It makes a very 
   good guide to Internet standards developers and Implementers in that 
   it leads more consistent interpretation of RFCs and Drafts than     
   without it resulting into more interoperable implementations.

   However, note that most of statements in Standards documents have no 
   key word at all. More consistent interpretation of standards track  
   documents will be possible if we agree on the interpretation of 'no 
   key word'.

   In this document, the requirement level is classified into three    
   levels which are basically equivalent to the ones proposed by RFC   
   2119[1]. But easier to understand the strength of key words and to  
   introduce new key words to the hierarchy of requirement levels if   
   ever there's a need. In fact, three new key words, NEVER, CAN and   
   CANNOT are introduced in this memo as well as 'no key word'.

   Note that the force of key words defined in this document is       
   modified by the requirement level of the document in which they are 
   used. 

   Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase  
   near the beginning of their document.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL  
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOUD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", "MAY NOT",  
        "CAN", "CANNOT", and the absence of these key words in this            
        document are to be interpreted as described in        
        <draft-keyword-requirement-level-00.txt>.


2. Requirement Levels

   Requirement and Prohibition are simply referred to as Requirement in 
   this document. For instance, MUST and SHALL NOT indicate the same   
   requirement level.

   Requirement levels are classified into three levels Level 1, 2 and
   3 as follows:

   - Level 1: Absolute requirements of the specification
      * The requirements shall be satisfied without exception
      * Key words: MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT, NEVER, CANNOT
   - Level 2: Recommended requirements of the specification
      * There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to   
        ignore a particular item. But the full implications must be    
        understood and carefully inspected before choosing a different
        course.
      * Key words: RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, 'No key word'
  - Level 3: Optional Requirements
      * The indicated requirement may be implemented or not depending  
        on the flavor of vendors. An implementation which does not     
        include a particular option must be prepared to interoperate   
        with another implementation which does include the option,     
        though perhaps with reduced functionality and vice versa.
      * Key words: OPTIONAL, CAN, MAY, MAY NOT
