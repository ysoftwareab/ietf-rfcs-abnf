Abstract

   A SIP UA does not always trust all proxy servers in a request path to
   decide whether to inspect the message bodies and/or headers contained
   in a message. The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/or
   headers from proxy servers excluding the particular proxy that
   provides some features based on reading them.  This situation
   requires a mechanism for securing information passed between the UA
   and an intermediary proxy, also called  "end-to-middle security",
   which can work with end-to-end security. This document defines a set
   of requirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.

Internet-Draft    End-to-middle Security Requirements       October 2003


1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] supports hop-by-hop
   security using TLS [3] and end-to-end security using S/MIME [4].
   This assumes that a SIP UA trusts all proxy servers in a request path
   to decide whether or not to inspect the message bodies contained in a
   message.

   However, there is a model where trusted and partially-trusted proxy
   servers are mixed along a message path. The partially-trusted proxy
   servers are only trusted in terms of the SIP routing. Hop-by-hop
   confidentiality services using TLS are not suitable for this model.
   End-to-end confidentiality services using S/MIME are also not
   suitable when the intermediaries provide features based on reading
   the message bodies and/or headers. This problem is described in
   Section 23 of [2].

   One example of such features is firewall traversal.  A firewall
   entity that supports SIP protocol or a midcom [5] agent co-located
   with a proxy server controls a firewall based on certain SDP
   attributes in a SIP transaction.

   Another example is transcoding [6]. A transcoder related to a SIP
   proxy transfers coding based on certain SDP attributes in a SIP
   transaction or transfers text-to-speech based on a message body in
   the MESSAGE [7] method.

   A third example is the archiving of instant messaging traffic, where
   the archiving function co-located with a proxy server logs the
   message bodies in the MESSAGE method. This feature is deployed for
   financial or health care applications.

   In these cases, a UA might want to protect the message bodies and/or
   headers from proxy servers excluding the particular proxy that
   provides these features. Conversely, a proxy might want to view the
   message bodies and/or headers to provide these features. Such a proxy
   is not always the first hop for the UA. These situations require
   security between the UA and the intermediary proxy for the message
   bodies and/or message headers. We call this "end-to-middle security".

   End-to-middle security consists of authentication, message integrity,
   and message confidentiality. As for authentication, HTTP digest
   authentication described in [2] is used for user-to-proxy and
   proxy-to-user authentication. The authenticating proxy is not limited
   to the first hop for the UA. Thus, HTTP digest authentication can be
   used for end-to-middle security. Digital signatures in a Public Key
   Infrastructure, that is S/MIME CMS [8] SignedData body with
   certificate, can also be used for authentication. As for message

Internet-Draft    End-to-middle Security Requirements       October 2003


   integrity, S/MIME CMS SignedData body can be used. S/MIME CMS
   SignedData body is created with the original data and the
   originator's private key, and anyone can verify the integrity using
   the originator's public key and the certificate. Thus, S/MIME CMS
   SignedData body can be used for end-to-middle security at the same
   time as end-to-end security. However, proxy servers usually transfer
   SIP messages without interpreting the S/MIME bodies.

   This document mainly discusses requirements for the message
   confidentiality and integrity of end-to-middle security. Proposed
   mechanisms are discussed in [9].

2. Problems with the Existing Situations

   We describe here examples of models in which trusted and
   partially-trusted proxy servers are mixed along a message path. These
   situations demonstrate the reasons for requiring end-to-middle
   security.

   The following example is that User#1 does not know the features or
   security policy on Proxy #1. User#1 sends an INVITE request including
   encrypted SDP for end-to-end security as shown in Figure 1. Proxy #1
   may reject the request because of the impossibility of offering a
   firewall traversal feature. Or Proxy#1 may drop the encrypted data
   based on a security policy that prevents the sending of unknown data.
   Thus, there is a problem of discovering an intermediary's feature or
   security policy that may conflict with end-to-end confidentiality.

   User#1------| | C   |-----| *   |-----| *   |-----| C   |-- User#2

               | UA#1        Proxy#1 |   Proxy#2     UA#2
               +---------------------+

   C: Content that UA#1 allows the entity to inspect
   *: Content that UA#1 prevent the entity from inspecting

                     Figure 1: Deployment example#1

   In the second example, Proxy server#1 (Proxy#1) is the home proxy
   server of User#1 using UA#1.  User#1 communicates with User#2 through
   Proxy#1 and Proxy#2 as shown in Figure 2.   UA#1 already knows the
   public key certificate of Proxy#1, and it allows Proxy#1 to inspect
   the message bodies in a request for some purpose.  However, User#1
   does not know whether Proxy#2 is trustworthy, and thus wants to
   protect the message bodies in the request.  Thus, there is the
   problem of granting a trusted intermediary permission to inspect
   message bodies while preserving their confidentiality with respect to
   other intermediaries.

   Even if UA#1's request message authorizes a selected proxy (Proxy#1)
   to see the message body, UA#1 is unable to authorize the same proxy
   to see the message body in the response from UA#2. Thus, there is the
   problem of designating and sharing a key that can be reused as a CEK
   for bidirectional exchanges of S/MIME-secured messages within SIP.

   C: Content that UA#1 needs to disclose
   *: Content that UA#1 needs to protect

                     Figure 2: Deployment example#2

   In the third example, User#1 connects UA#1 to a proxy server in a
   visited network, e.g. a hotspot service or a roaming service. Since
   User#1 wants to utilize certain home network services, UA#1 connects
   to a home proxy server, Proxy#1.  However, UA#1 must connect to
   Proxy#1 via the proxy server of the visited network (Proxy A),
   because User#1 must follow the policy of that network. Proxy A may
   perform access control based on the destination addresses of calls.
   As shown in Figure 3, User#1 trusts Proxy A to route requests, but
   not to inspect the message bodies they contain. User#1 trusts Proxy#1
   both to route requests and to inspect the message bodies for some
   purpose.

   The same problems as in the second example exist.

              Visited network

Internet-Draft    End-to-middle Security Requirements       October 2003


3. Requirements for a Solution

   We describe here requirements for a solution. The requirements are
   mainly applied for the phase of a dialog creation or sending MESSAGE
   method.

3.1 Requirements from UA's Perspective

   1.  The solution MUST work even with SIP end-to-end encryption for
       confidentiality service enabled.

   2.  It SHOULD work even with SIP end-to-end integrity service
       enabled.

   3.  It SHOULD have little impact on the way of a UA handles messages
       with S/MIME bodies.

   4.  It SHOULD allow a UA to discover which proxy needs to view some
       data in a request/response for a certain feature.

          This requirement is for the case that the UA does not know the
          proxy or domain that provides the feature in advance.

   5.  It SHOULD allow a UA to discover what data in a request/response
       the proxy needs to view in order to provide the feature.

          This requirement is for the above case.

   6.  It MUST allow a UA to request selected proxy servers to view
       selected message bodies. The request itself SHOULD be secure.

   7.  It SHOULD allow a UA to request the UA on the opposite-side to
       impose the same type of data on the same proxy server. The
       request itself SHOULD be secure.

          It is not appropriate for the UA on the opposite-side to have
          knowledge of the public key certificate of the proxy server on
          the originating network. This last requirement can be modified
          into the following:

          +  The solution SHOULD allow a UA to request the opposite-side
             UA to reuse a content-encryption-key in subsequent messages
             during a dialog.

          +  It SHOULD allow a UA to request a selected proxy server to
             keep a content-encryption-key in a message during a dialog.
             The requests themselves SHOULD be secure.

Internet-Draft    End-to-middle Security Requirements       October 2003


   8.  It MAY allow a UA to notify the opposite-side UA which proxy
       needs to view some data in a request/response for the services.

   9.  It MAY allow a UA to notify the opposite-side UA what data the
       proxy is permitted to view in a request/response for the
       services.

          These last two requirements might be applied for a
          registration phase.


3.2 Requirements from Proxy's Perspective

   1.  It SHOULD have no impact on proxy servers that do not provide
       features based on S/MIME bodies in terms of handling the existing
       SIP headers.

   2.  It SHOULD have little impact on standardized mechanism of proxy
       servers that provide features based on S/MIME bodies.

          When a proxy server receives an S/MIME message, it should be
          able to quickly and easily determine the need to investigate
          the S/MIME body. This last requirement can be modified into
          the following:

          +  It SHOULD allow proxy servers to quickly and easily
             determine whether to handle S/MIME bodies and, if so, how
             and which ones.

   3.  It SHOULD allow a proxy to notify a UA its own security policy
       for a request/response.

   4.  It SHOULD allow a proxy to notify a UA what data in a request/
       response is needed in order to provide a feature.
