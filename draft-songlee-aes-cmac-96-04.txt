   specified the Cipher based MAC (CMAC) which is equivalent to the
   One-Key CBC-MAC1 (OMAC1) algorithm submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.
   OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key size of Extended Cipher Block 
   Chaining mode (XCBC). This memo specifies the use of CMAC mode on
   authentication mechanism of IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload

1. Introduction

   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has newly 
   specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC). 
   CMAC [NIST-CMAC] is a message authentication code that is based on
   a symmetric key block cipher such as the Advanced Encryption 
   Standard [NIST-AES]. CMAC is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1
   (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa [OMAC1a, OMAC1b]. OMAC1
   is an improvement of the eXtended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC)
   submitted by Black and Rogaway [XCBCa, XCBCb], which itself is an
   improvement of the basic CBC-MAC. XCBC efficiently addresses the 
   security deficiencies of CBC-MAC, and OMAC1 efficiently reduces the
   key size of XCBC.

   This memo specifies the usage of CMAC on authentication mechanism 
   of IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [ESP] and the 
   Authentication Header (AH) protocols. This new algorithm is named 
   AES-CMAC-96. For further information on AH and ESP, refer to [AH] 
   and [ROADMAP].

   Truncated T     The truncated output of AES-CMAC-128 in MSB first
                   order.

   AES-CMAC        CMAC generation function based on AES block cipher

   AES-CMAC-96     IPsec AH and ESP MAC generation function based on 
                   AES-CMAC which truncates MSB 96 bits of 128 bits
		   output


3. AES-CMAC

   The core of AES-CMAC-96 is the AES-CMAC [AES-CMAC]. The underlying
   algorithm for AES-CMAC are Advanced Encryption Standard cipher block
   [AES] and recently defined CMAC mode of operation [NIST-CMAC].
   AES-CMAC provides stronger assurance of data integrity than a 
   checksum or an error detecting code. The verification of a checksum
   or an error detecting code detects only accidental modifications of
   the data, while CMAC is designed to detect intentional, unauthorized
   modifications of the data, as well as accidental modifications. The
   output of AES-CMAC can validate the input message.  Validating the
   message provide assurance of the integrity and authenticity over the
   message from the source.  According to [NIST-CMAC] at least 64-bits
   should be used for against guessing attack.  AES-CMAC achieves the
   similar security goal of HMAC [RFC-HMAC].  Since AES-CMAC is based
   on a symmetric key block cipher, AES, while HMAC is based on a hash
   function, such as SHA-1, AES-CMAC is appropriate for information 
   systems in which AES is more readily available than a hash function.
   For detail information about AES-CMAC is available in [AES-CMAC] and
   [NIST-CMAC].

4. AES-CMAC-96
   
   For use in IPsec message authentication on AH and ESP, AES-CMAC-96
   should be used. AES-CMAC-96 is a AES-CMAC with 96-bit-long truncated
   output in most significant bit first order. The output of 96 bits 
   MAC that will meet the default authenticator length as specified 
   in [AH].  The result of truncation is taken in most significant bits
   first order. For further information on AES-CMAC, refer to 
   [AES-CMAC] and [NIST-CMAC].

   Figure 1 describes AES-CMAC-96 algorithm:

   In step 1, AES-CMAC is applied to the message 'M' in length 'len'
   with key 'K' 

   In step 2, Truncate output block, T with 12 octets in 
   msb-first-order and return TT.
