Internet-Draft                   JSONenc                       June 2010


1.  JSON Encryption Envelope

   JSON Encryption Envelope comprises a message bundled along with
   encryption parameters for that message, expressed as a series of
   parameters, and serialized as JSON in RFC 4627 [RFC4627].  The
   envelope specifies the data that was encrypted, the MIME type of the
   data, the transfer encoding, and the encryption parameters.

1.1.  Envelope Parameters

   o  object_type

         Value: "http://jsonenc.info/json-encryption/"

   o  data_type

         Value: The MIME type OR the Type URL of the payload prior to
         encoding

   o  enc_data

         Value: The JSON Form OpenID assertion that is encrypted and
         Base64url encoded as in [magic_signatures] .

   o  enc_key

         Value: The symmetric encryption key that was used for the
         encryption of the payload encrypted with the algorithm
         specified in 'enc_type_asy' by the Public specified by the RP
         then Base64url encoded.

   o  enc_iv

         Value: (Optional) Base64 encoded initialization vector.  It
         SHOULD be different for each encryption.  The default IV is
         null, however, using null as the IV is strongly discouraged.

   o  enc_type_asy

         Value: (Optional) Asymmetric cypher type expressed in the Type
         URL from XML Encryption [xml_enc]



         +  (Default) RSA-v1.5 http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-1_5
            : RSA Encryption with PKCS1_PADDING.

Internet-Draft                   JSONenc                       June 2010


         +  RSA-OAEP http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p :
            RSA Encryption with PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING.

         One MAY use other Type URLs if so desired.

   o  enc_type

         Value: (Optional) String expressing the encryption type.
         Default is "AES-128-CBC".  Possible values are:



         +  "PLAIN" No encryption base64 encoding only

         +  "AES-128-CBC" 128 bit AES encryption in CBC mode (default) .
            Short hand for
            "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc".

         +  "AES-256-CBC" 256 bit AES encryption in CBC mode.  Short
            hand for "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-cbc"

         One MAY define other Type URL if so desired.

   o  enc_ref

         Value: (Optional) URI of the PEM format X.509 Certificate that
         corresponds to the public key encryption of the symmetric key.

   o  enc_pem

         Value: (Optional) Base64url encoded PEM format X.509
         Certificate that corresponds to the public key encryption of
         the symmetric key.

   o  enc_thumbprint

         Value: (Optional) A SHA1 of the DER encoded certificate.

         Note: One may calculate this value as in the follwoing non-
         normative example from a PEM encoded certificate:


openssl x509 -in cer.cert -text | perl -ne 'print if /BEGIN/../END/' | openssl base64 -d | openssl sha1 -hex

1.2.  The JSON Serialization

   JSON Encryption Envelope MUST be well formed JSON as defined in
   [RFC4627].  The parameters are serialized into a JSON object as a
   sequence of name/value pairs for the parameter described in
   Section 1.1.

   Additional name/value pairs MAY appear within the JSON object and
   processors MUST ignore elements they do not understand.

   Example:


   {
       "object_type":"http://jsonenc.info/json-encryption/",
       "enc_data":"b5guwzFgvrIUd7XcXI0bAFrg-....O69VKhY",
       "enc_key":"mHM2ongmZlPVexe....2lsBNdw",
       "enc_iv":"_b4INfYIRwLPZdxB2L7wJg",
       "enc_type":"AES-128-CBC',
       "enc_ref":"https://rp.example.com/rpf_ax.json"
   }




2.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


3.  Security Considerations

   The symmetric encryption key should be generated with a reliable
   pseudo-random number generator to achieve high entropy.

   The initialization vector should be generated with a reliable pseudo-
   random number generator to achieve high entropy.
