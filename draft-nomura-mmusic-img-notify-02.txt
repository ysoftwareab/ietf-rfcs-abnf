Internet Draft                IMG Notify             December 26, 2005


1 Introduction

   Internet Media Guides (IMGs) [2] [3] provide and deliver structured
   collections of multimedia descriptions expressed using SDP [4],
   SDPng [5] or other description formats. They are used to describe
   sets of multimedia services (e.g. television program schedules,
   content delivery schedules) and refer to other networked resources
   including web pages. 

   IMG metadata may be delivered to a potentially large audience, who
   use it to join a subset of the sessions described, and who may need
   to be notified of changes to the IMG metadata.  Since content and
   its structure described by IMG metadata changes as time elapses, an
   IMG receiver needs to be notified of changes so that IMG metadata
   and content do not become stale.

   This document defines an update notification protocol for IMGs 
   using SIP Event Notification framework [6], which satisfies
   the IMG framework [2] and matches the IMG requirements [3].

   The authors assume that SIP event is not a mechanism just for
   a presence service, but applicable for many services such as IMGs.
   As the IMG framework defines the IMG operations, an update
   notification mechanism is necessary for scalable delivery. In
   addition, SIP event satisfies IMG requirements with minimum
   implementation cost for an unicast transport protocol, thus it
   provides necessary and sufficient mechanism for the IMG update
   notification.

2 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

        Internet Media Guide (IMG): IMG is a generic term to describe
             the formation, delivery and use of IMG metadata. The
             definition of the IMG is intentionally left imprecise [3].

        IMG Element: The smallest atomic element of metadata that can be
             transmitted separately by IMG operations and referenced
             individually from other IMG elements [3].

        IMG Metadata: A set of metadata consisting of one or more IMG
             elements. IMG metadata describes the features of multimedia
             content used to enable selection of and access to media
             sessions containing content. For example, metadata may
             consist of the URI, title, airtime, bandwidth needed, file
             size, text summary, genre and access restrictions [3].

Internet Draft                IMG Notify             December 26, 2005


        IMG Delivery: The process of exchanging IMG metadata both in
             terms of large scale and atomic data transfers [3].

        IMG Transport Session: An association between an IMG sender and
             one or more IMG receivers within the scope of an IMG
             transport protocol. An IMG transport session involves a
             time bound series of IMG transport protocol interactions
             that provide delivery of IMG metadata from the IMG sender
             to the IMG receiver(s) [3].

        IMG Sender: An IMG sender is a logical entity that sends IMG
             metadata to one or more IMG receivers [3].

        IMG Receiver: An IMG receiver is a logical entity that receives
             IMG metadata from an IMG sender [3].

3 Overview of Protocol Operations

   The IMG framework [2] defines two abstract operations, the IMG
   SUBSCRIBE and IMG NOTIFY, to notify updates of IMG metadata from an
   IMG sender to an IMG receiver. Thus, the IMG sender has an logical
   entity, IMG notifier, and the IMG receiver has a IMG subscriber.
   Both the IMG sender and IMG receiver need a bi-directional transport
   to fulfill the operation.

   The IMG subscriber initiates an IMG transport session to an IMG
   notifier by sending an IMG SUBSCRIBE message. When IMG notifier
   receiving the IMG SUBSCRIBE message, it will reply an IMG NOTIFY
   for the IMG SUBSCRIBE. The IMG notifier sends the IMG NOTIFY
   message when IMG metadata is stale and should be updated
   in the IMG subscriber.

   Figure 1 shows the protocol operations between the IMG subscriber
   and IMG notifier.

           Figure 1: Update Notification Sequence Example


3.1 Mapping of IMG Operations to SIP Event Notification

   There are simple mapping rules between IMG operations and SIP Event
   Notification mechanisms. A SIP SUBSCRIBE is an instance of the IMG
   SUBSCRIBE and a SIP NOTIFY is an instance of the IMG NOTIFY. 


3.2 SIP Event Notification

   SIP [7] is a text-based request/response protocol. A SIP request
   consists of a request-line, header field and message body like HTTP.
   A SIP response also consists of a status-line, header field and body.

   SIP Event has the same feature as SIP but SIP Event needs only two
   messages, SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, to notify an event to subscribers.
   Since the protocol intends to do this, it does not require SIP
   messages to establish a session.

   Fig. 2 shows basic protocol operations in SIP Event.
   Protocol details are shown in section 4.

            |--------200------->|



         Fig. 2 SIP Event Notification Sequence


3.3 IMG to SIP URI Mapping

   An IMG envelope may include an IMG URN [8] which can be used to
   initiate an IMG transport session for the update notification. If the
   IMG URN can be used to the SIP URI for the update notification, the
   IMG receiver may try to resolve the IMG URN to the SIP URI. This
   mechanism will define in another document.

   In other case, the IMG subscriber may obtain the SIP URI by the IMG
   notifier given some a priori knowledge.

   This IMG URN may also indicate the URI for a original IMG
   metadata which provides a self-contained set of metadata for one
   media object or service, i.e., it does not need additional
   information from any other IMG metadata. 

   In general, the SIP URI has the following format.

   sip:initial-version@host

   "initial-version" indicates the original IMG metadata which is used
   to an initial version of IMG metadata in the succeeding update
   notification session. The IMG notifier provides this parameter
   to identify which version of IMG metadata the IMG subscriber has.

   "host" means the location of the IMG notifier.

4 Protocol Details

4.1 Initialize

   An IMG receiver MUST send a SUBSCRIBE request to an IMG sender in
   order to prepare to receive a subsequent update notification from
   the IMG sender.




Y. Nomura et. al.                                             [Page 6]

Internet Draft                IMG Notify             December 26, 2005


   The SUBSCRIBE request includes identity information in its headers
   defined by SIP Events framework. As defined in SIP, To, From, Call-
   ID, Event and Contact header can be used to identify a session
   between an IMG receiver and sender. Each parameter in the headers
   depends on the implementations.

   In this phase, the SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain a body indicating
   what metadata status will be subscribed.

   The name of this package is "img". This header also appears in
   NOTIFY requests.

   If the SUBSCRIBE request is not related to existing sessions and the
   IMG sender can authenticate the request successfully, the IMG sender
   sends a 200 (OK) response to the IMG receiver. If the IMG sender
   can't authenticate or accept the request, the IMG sender sends a 4xx
   response and does not send a NOTIFY request.

   An IMG sender MUST authenticate all subscription requests. This
   authentication can be done using any of the mechanisms defined in SIP
   and SIP Events.

   After sending the SUBSCRIBE response, the IMG sender sends a NOTIFY
   request immediately to the same IMG receiver. The request contains an
   URI indicating a metadata location or metadata. Metadata indicated by
   URI or contained in the body MUST describe the latest full state when
   the NOTIFY request is sent. "Content-Type:" header in the NOTIFY
   request MUST indicate a data type of the body.

   The body in NOTIFY request MUST contains a version number and a
   timestamp. The version number increases by exactly one for each
   NOTIFY message as defined in SIP Event. The time stamp indicates
   latest modified time of metadata status.

   When the IMG receiver receives the request, the IMG receiver tries to
   retrieve IMG metadata specified in the body. If the IMG receiver gets
   it successfully, it sends 200 (OK) response to the IMG sender. If
   not, the IMG receiver sends 4xx response.

4.2 Update Notification

   When metadata changes and it affects an existing subscription,
   IMG sender sends a NOTIFY request on a session related to the
   metadata status. The request body SHOULD contain metadata delta
   location or metadata delta. The format of metadata delta is
   discussed in section 6.

   When the IMG receiver receives the request, the IMG receiver tries to



Y. Nomura et. al.                                             [Page 7]

Internet Draft                IMG Notify             December 26, 2005


   obtain delta information specified in the body. If the IMG receiver
   successfully gets it and updates metadata, it sends 200 (OK) response
   to the IMG sender. If not, the IMG receiver sends 4xx response.

4.3 Session Keep Alive

   At any time before a subscription expires, the IMG receiver may send
   a SUBSCRIBE request to the IMG sender. The IMG sender sends a
   SUBSCRIBE response and a NOTIFY request with delta information to
   communicate up-to-date metadata status.

   If the IMG receiver receives the NOTIFY message which includes the
   same timestamp as the previous NOTIFY message, the IMG receiver does
   not have to obtain delta information. In this case, an IMG sender
   sends it just for a confirmation of the metadata status as an
   immediate response for a SUBSCRIBE request.

   If the timestamp is updated, the IMG receiver MUST obtain new delta
   in the same way as receiving an update notification.

   This mechanism can be applicable not only to refresh the timer but
   also to confirm the current metadata status.

4.4 Polling metadata status

   If an IMG receiver does not want to receive an update notification,
   an IMG receiver may poll metadata status to send a SUBSCRIBE with an
   "Expires" of 0.

4.5 Confirming the status of IMG receiver

   If an IMG sender needs to confirm the current status of an IMG
   receiver which subscribes IMG metadata status, it may send the NOTIFY
   request including a body which indicates a current delta information
   and wait a NOTIFY response from the IMG receiver. When the IMG sender
   receives the response with 200 (OK), the IMG sender confirms that
   the IMG receiver's status is up-to-date. If not, the IMG sender can
   decide that the IMG receiver has stale metadata.

4.6 Timer Expiration

   Expiration time depends on the system. If the system requires short
   duration to guarantee metadata coherency, it should be a small value.
   In some system, a connection between an IMG receiver and IMG sender
   is not persistent but sporadic. In this case, IMG receiver may
   require the long expiration time such as 1 day or 1 week.

   If an IMG receiver receives NOTIFY request on the session which



Y. Nomura et. al.                                             [Page 8]

Internet Draft                IMG Notify             December 26, 2005


   already has been terminated because the timer has expired, the IMG
   receiver SHOULD try to subscribe it again.

4.7 Invalid update notification

   If an IMG receiver receives invalid NOTIFY message such as a
   discontinuous version number or CSeq, the IMG receiver SHOULD close
   the session and restart the session from Initialize step. As a
   result, the IMG receiver can obtain latest full metadata states.

5 IMG Envelope

   The IMG envelope would reference or carry some application-specific
   metadata, and the envelope would support the maintenance of the
   application-specific metadata, which may also serve the metadata
   relationships determined by the data model(s) used. The IMG
   envelope is independent from the IMG transport protocol.

   There is no standard format for the IMG envelope yet. However, XML
   based format [9] and MIME based format are candidates for it. [9]
   defines essential description format for IMG envelope parameters
   such as version, reference, and validation using XML.

   On the other hand, the MIME based format has to be defined to
   support these parameters to meet the IMG requirements. When it will
   successfully reuse the existing MIME headers or define new headers,
   the cost to implement the IMG envelope may be less than xml based
   format.

   In either case, the IMG envelope will be independent from an IMG 
   transport protocol. Therefore, this document does not assume any
   non-standard IMG envelope format. 

6 Example Message Flow

6.1 Example MIME Header

   This section uses example MIME based description for IMG envelope
   in order to explain how the protocol works. As mentioned in Section
   5, the standard IMG envelope format is still developing. 
   Consequently, this example does not mean this protocol is subject
   to the MIME based IMG envelope.

   This section introduces four example MIME headers.

      Content-Type: application/xml

        Content-Type indicates a format of the IMG metadata
        description.  If IMG metadata is described by an xml based
        format, application/xml is used. If SDP describes IMG



Y. Nomura et. al.                                             [Page 9]

Internet Draft                IMG Notify             December 26, 2005


        metadata, application/sdp is appropriate.


      Content-ID: major.minor

        The IMG Envelope supports delta information between initial
        IMG metadata and update IMG metadata. Initial IMG metadata has
        certain version number described by "major" number. Update IMG
        metadata is also described by "minor" number.


      Expires: "valid until"

        IMG metadata may have period of validity. The MIME "Expires"
        header can be applicable to this purpose. IMG metadata may
        require "valid from" information. In this case, new MIME
        header will be defined to support this period. This example
        just uses "Expires" header. This example assume that this
        field value is defined by the RFC 1123[10]-date format.


      Content-Location: "metadata URI"

        "Metadata URI" identifies original IMG metadata. For instance,
        it may be URN as a name space or URL providing IMG metadata.

6.2 Example Flows

   When an IMG receiver needs to subscribe IMG metadata, it sends
   subscribe message to an IMG Sender (F1). If the sender accept this
   request, it sends the reply message (F2). After that message, the
   sender sends initial IMG metadata to the receiver (F3) and the
   receiver acknowledges the initial IMG metadata (F4).

   After a while, when metadata changes, the sender notifies this to
   the receiver (F5) and the receiver acknowledges it (F6).
