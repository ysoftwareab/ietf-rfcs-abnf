1. Introduction

   The rapid growth of Internet traffic and the emerging applications
   such as cloud computing, datacenter interconnection, IP and optical
   integration, LTE backhauling, are driving the transport network to
   provide dynamic service provisioning based on the customer
   requirement and high quality services with guaranteed performance.

   For datacenter interconnection services, IP network transit links,
   LTE backhauling services or some business customer services, the
   traffic vary over time. However, traditional optical network could
   only provide connection based on the maximum bandwidth needed. Based
   on flow traffic monitoring, it is possible to adjust the connection
   bandwidth according to the real bandwidth needed, create new
   connections or increase bandwidth when network traffic exceeds some
   certain threshold or reduce connection bandwidth when traffic drops
   down, thus helping the customers to save cost.

   On the other hand, customers have different SLA requirements. Some
   customers such as financial service companies need ultra-low-latency
   transmission, some other customers has strict requirements on bit
   error rate (BER). In order to provide high quality services
   according to customer SLA, network provider needs to measure the
   service performance, and dynamically provision and optimize services
   based on the performance monitoring result.

   The optical transport networks support various performance
   monitoring mechanisms, such as traffic flow statistics, packet
   delay, delay variation, throughput and packet-loss rate for MPLS-TP
   and packet OTN networks, BER, FEC error correction counters for OTN
   and DWDM networks, etc. These mechanisms can be used to support
   dynamic service control based on performance monitoring.

   The Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) described
   in [ACTN-FWK] provides a centralized control architecture and open
   interfaces that can transmit the customer requirements and policies
   to the network, and provide customers with the network status to
   make a decision. This draft mainly discusses the use cases and
   requirements of dynamic service control based on performance
   monitoring in ACTN architecture, the requirements for southbound and
   northbound interface are also discussed.

2. Use Cases and Requirements for Dynamic Service Control based on
   Performance Monitoring

2.1. Dynamic Service Control based on Traffic Monitoring

   For LTE backhauling based on MPLS-TP packet transport networks(PTN)
   or packet OTN, it is required that real time or semi-real time


<Xu>                   Expires October 27,2015                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft      actn-perf-dynamic-service-control         April 2015
   traffic monitoring of the network should be conducted so as to
   resize or optimize traffic and do load balance. In IP and optical
   network integration scenario, the optical network can bypass IP
   transit traffic as far as the transit traffic bandwidth is large
   enough to occupy the granularity of an ODUk. Network traffic
   monitoring is important to facilitate automatic discovery of the
   imbalance of network traffic, and initiate the network optimization,
   thus helping the network operator or the virtual network service
   provider to use the network more efficiently and save CAPEX/OPEX.

   For datacenter interconnection or enterprise leased line services,
   the traffic may vary over time and the customer want to pay for the
   bandwidth they really used. Therefore, it is important to provide
   some mechanism to monitor the network traffic, adjust and optimize
   the services dynamically to help the customers save expenses.
   In order to support these scenarios, the customers or client layer
   network controllers need to send traffic monitoring and control
   policies to the network, while the transport network should report
   the traffic monitoring results and dynamically control and adjust
   network connections based on the traffic optimization policy. The
   service adjustment or network optimization operations normally
   should be initiated with the decision of the customer.



2.2. Dynamic Service Control based on SLA monitoring

   Customer services have various SLA requirements, such as service
   availability, latency, latency jitter, packet loss rate, BER, etc.
   The transport network can satisfy service availability and BER
   requirements by providing different protection and restoration
   mechanisms. However, for other performance parameters, there are no
   such mechanisms.

   In order to provide high quality services according to customer SLA,
   one possible solution is to measure the service SLA related
   performance parameters, and dynamically provision and optimize
   services based on the performance monitoring results.

   When the network performance deterioration that violates the SLA is
   detected, service optimization operations such as service rerouting,
   creation of new connections could be automatically started.

   In order to support this requirement, the customer should be able to
   send its SLA information to the network, and the transport network
   should determine which performance parameters need to be monitored
   and the strategy of service optimization. When the service
   performance degradation is detected, the transport network can

Internet-Draft      actn-perf-dynamic-service-control         April 2015
   notify the customer and immediately start the service optimization
   procedure, so as to reduce the impact on the service.

3. Workflows of ACTN Control Modules

   In the ACTN architecture [ACTN-FWK], centralized controllers
   including Physical Network Controller (PNC), Multi Domain Service
   Coordinator (MDSC), Customer Network Controller(CNC), and the
   interfaces between them have been defined.

   For different use cases and scenarios, the workflows across the
   customer controller, MDSC and PNC are different.

3.1. Workflows for Traffic Monitoring based Dynamic Service Control

   Figure 1 shows the workflows for dynamic service control based on
   traffic monitoring.

   In order to realize dynamic service creation, adjustment and
   optimization based on traffic monitoring, the customer controller
   should send traffic monitoring and traffic optimization strategies
   to MDSC. MDSC sends the corresponding path traffic monitoring
   request to PNC. Traffic monitoring parameters and monitoring cycle
   need to be carried in this request.

   PNC gets the traffic monitoring results from the underlying physical
   networks, translates the monitoring results of the physical topology
   to the performance information of the abstract topology, and then
   reports to MDSC. According to the traffic optimization strategy
   obtained from the customer controller, MDSC determines whether the
   service needs to be adjusted, or a new connection should be created.
   If it needs to, then MDSC send the traffic monitoring results to the
   customer controller, indicating that the service needs adjustment.

   Customer Network Controller confirms whether the service can be
   optimized then sends a service adjustment request to MDSC. MDSC will
   convert it into path modification or creation request, and send it
   to PNC to complete the service optimization. Then, PNC returns the
   optimization results to MDSC, and MDSC   passes the results to the
   customer controller.

3.2. Workflows for SLA monitoring based Dynamic Service control

   Figure 2 shows the workflows for dynamic service control based on
   SLA related performance monitoring.

   Customer controller sends the customer service SLA information and
   the performance based optimization strategy to MDSC.

   MDSC will convert the SLA information to path performance monitoring
   request, which carries the performance monitoring parameters such as
   delay, jitter, packet loss, bit error rate and monitoring cycle, and
   then send it to the PNC.

   PNC starts the performance monitoring in the underlying physical
   networks, collects the results of related path, translates the
   performance results of the physical topology to the performance
   information of the abstract topology, and reports to MDSC. MDSC

   determines whether the relevant performance parameters can satisfy
   the SLA agreements. If the performance degradation seriously
   influences the service, such as service packet delay exceeds the
   performance threshold, MDSC will immediately start the optimization
   and adjustment. Then the performance monitoring results as well as
   the optimizing or adjusting results will be send to the Customer
   Network Controller.

4. Requirement for ACTN Interface

   ACTN Interfaces defined [ACTN-FWK] includes the following:

   o   CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI): an interface between a Customer Network
       Controller and a Multi Service Domain Controller.

   o   MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI): an interface between a Multi Service
       Domain Controller and a physical network controller.

4.1. Interface Requirements for Dynamic Service Control Based on
   Traffic Monitoring

   According to the work flow of dynamic service control based on
   performance monitoring, the information carried in CMI interface
   mainly relates to the traffic monitoring and control strategy, while
   the MPI interface mainly relates to transports path related traffic
   monitoring parameters and results.

   1. CMI Interface

   The following information is used by the customer network controller
   to send to MDSC through the CMI interface.

   o   Customer service performance monitoring strategy, including the
       traffic monitoring object (the service need to be monitored),
       monitoring parameters (e.g., transmitted and received bytes per
       unit time), traffic monitoring cycle (e.g., 15 minutes, 24 hours),
       threshold of traffic monitoring (e.g., high and low threshold),
       etc.

   o   Customer service optimization strategy, such as enabling service
       creation or modification when traffic exceeds the threshold.

   The following information is used for MDSC to send to the customer
   network controller through MPI interface.

   o   Traffic monitoring results, to indicate if the traffic exceeds
       the bandwidth threshold.

   o Traffic monitoring results. These results must be translated from
      the physical topology to abstract topology by the Abstract
      Topology Generalization module firstly.

4.2. Interface Requirements of Dynamic Service Control based on SLA
   monitoring

   According to the work flow of dynamic service control based on SLA
