   Abstract 
    
      The AAA Working Group has completed a document that itemizes their 
      requirements for Network Access Applications (NASREQ, Mobile IP, and 
      ROAMOPS). This specification compares the COPS protocol against 
      the requirements, and is provided to the AAA Working Group as an 
      official submission for an AAA protocol. 
    
    
   1.0  Introduction 
    
      The AAA Working Group has completed a document that itemizes their 
      requirements for Network Access Applications (NASREQ, Mobile IP, and 
      ROAMOPS). This specification compares the COPS protocol against 
      the requirements, and is provided to the AAA Working Group as an 
      official submission for an AAA protocol.

   1.1  Requirements language 
    
      In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT", 
      "optional", "recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be 
      interpreted as described in [1]. 
    
      Please note that the requirements specified in this document are to 
      be used in evaluating AAA protocol submissions.  As such, the 
      requirements language refers to capabilities of these protocols; the 
      protocol documents will specify whether these features are required, 
      recommended, or optional.  For example, requiring that a protocol 
      support confidentiality is NOT the same thing as requiring that all 
      protocol traffic be encrypted. 
    
      A protocol submission is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or 
      more of the MUST or MUST NOT requirements for the capabilities that 
      it implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies all the MUST, 
      MUST NOT, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements for its capabilities is 
      said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the 
      MUST and MUST NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT 
      requirements for its protocols is said to be "conditionally 
      compliant." 
    
   2.0  Requirements Summary 
    
      This section contains the same four sections as found in the AAA 
      Network Access requirements. Each section contains a new column, 
      named COPS. For each requirement, it is noted whether the 
      COPS protocol meets (T), Partially meets (P), or does not meet 
      (F) the stated requirement. Furthermore, each requirement has a 
      footnote, which contains additional justification. 
    
    
    
   2.1  General requirements 
    
      These requirements apply to all aspects of AAA and thus are 
      considered general requirements.

      Clarifications 
    
      [a]  The COPS protocol provides the following features that help  
           scaling: 
    
           [1]  supports very large number of pending requests  
                since the request handle is unbounded 
    
           [2]  support for message forwarding and redirect servers 
    
           [3]  can create COPS server hierarchies that will help 
                increase scalability 
    
      [b]  The COPS Protocol [3] defines the failover and synchronization 
           mechanisms that can be used in event of failure of the primary  
           COPS server to switch to the secondary or backup server. 
    
      [c]  The COP Protocol [3] defines three different authenti- 
           cation mechanisms: 
    
           [1]  None - When the local policy demands that no security is  
                needed or when an underlying security service is used. 
    
           [2]  Hop-by-Hop - The COPS Protocol [3] provides a security  
                mechanism using the Integrity Object to provide  
                authentication, replay protection, and message integrity. 
    
           [3]  End-to-End - COPS object-level integrity using CMS.

      [d]  The COPS Protocol [3] provides message authentication, 
           integrity and confidentiality using the security mechanism 
           defined in the protocol or uses other underlying mechanisms such  
           as IPSec and TLS. 
    
      [e]  COPS uses CMS [5] to provide object level confidentiality. 
           See COPS Usage for AAA [6] for details and See RFC 2797. 
    
      [f]  COPS uses CMS[5] to provide object level integrity. COPS uses  
           RFC 1510 Certificate Management Messages over CMS to provide  
           object level integrity. See COPS Usage for AAA [6] for details. 
    
      [g]  This MUST be part of the Information Model that is carried 
           with the COPS messages. 
    
      [h]  The COPS Protocol [3] runs over TCP which provides 
           reliable transport and addresses the AAA requirements. 
    
      [i]  The COPS Protocol [3] has no reliance on the underlying 
           IP version, and is capable of running over IPv4. 
    
      [j]  The COPS Protocol [3] has no reliance on the underlying 
           IP version, and is capable of running over IPv6. 
    
      [k]  The COPS Protocol supports proxies and brokers in 
           both transparent forwarding, as well as in the redirect mode. 
           See COPS Usage for AAA [6] for details. 
            
      [l]  The Information Model such as a History PIB MUST be used to 
           carry information about how the COPS messages are audited 
           by proxies/brokers as they travel from the home server to  
           the network device. 
    
      [m]  All COPS security mechanisms are based on local policies and 
           only used as required. 
    
      [n]  The COPS Protocol [3] is highly extensible in two ways,  
           it supports new Client Types which can define Client Specific  
           Info. objects and COPS-PR [4] separates the Information Model from  
           the protocol allowing third parties to define service-specific  
           Data (a.k.a. PIBs), that are carried over the protocol.

      [a]  The Information Model MUST define NAI attributes which are then  
           carried in the COPS messages. Note that when using certificate 
           based authentication, the naming scheme MUST conform to RFC 2459  
           naming conventions for subjectAltName and/or Subject name. This  
           is more restrictive than NAI.

      [b]  The Information Model MUST define CHAP attributes which are 
           then carried in the COPS messages. 
    
      [c]  The Information Model MUST define EAP attributes which are then  
           carried in the COPS messages. 
    
      [d]  The Information Model MUST define PAP which are then  
           carried in the COPS messages. 
    
      [e]  The COPS Protocol being Stateful supports unsolicited Decision 
           and Request messages that can be used to trigger re-authentica- 
           tion. The Authentication time limit MUST be specified in the  
           Information Model. 
    
      [f]  The COPS protocol allows the authentication and authorization  
           information to be carried in separate Request messages. There- 
           fore, it is possible to send a request for authorization only.  
           Please note: with existing algorithms, any authorization scheme  
           not based on a prior authentication is meaningless.

      Clarifications 
    
      [a]  The Information Model MUST define the static & dynamic addresses 
           which can be carried in the COPS messages during the authorization 
           phase. 
    
      [b]  The Information Model can define 
           RADIUS attributes which can be carried in the COPS messages  
           and used for protocol compatibility. Additionally, COPS can carry 
           RADIUS AVPs directly without modification using its Client  
           Specific Information object.  
    
      [c]  A forwarding agent, be it a Proxy or Broker, MAY reject a 
           COPS Request by sending a Decision message with the appropriate 
           Error Object.  
    
      [d]  The COPS information model MUST define support for L2TP  
           configuration. 
    
      [e]  The COPS Protocol being Stateful supports unsolicited Decision 
           and Request messages that can be used to trigger re-authoriza-

           tion. The Authorization time limit MUST be specified in the  
           Authorization Information Model.  
    
      [f]  The Data/Information Model like the PIB MUST define the Access  
           Rules and Filters that are carried in the COPS messages. 
            
      [g]  The AAA network access requirements describe State Reconcilia- 
           tion as requiring: 
    
           [1]  Re-authorization capabilities - This is described in 2.2[e]. 
    
           [2] Session disconnect message - The COPS Client Handle is used to  
                maintain the session state. The Client can remove the session  
                state by sending COPS Delete Request with the same Client  
                Handle. This message thus acts as a session disconnect 
                message. The COPS connection can also be closed. 
    
           [3]  Transport and application-layer reliability - COPS uses TCP  
                which satisfies this requirement as well as its own session 
                Keep-Alive mechanism. 
    
           [4]  An interim message - The COPS protocol supports unsolicited  
                Report messages that can be used for this purpose. The  
                Accounting Timer is used to set the interval for the  
                accounting Reports or interim messages. 
    
           [5]  A mechanism for the AAA server to retrieve state informa- 
                tion from the NAS. This mechanism will provide timely 
                information though a complete state dump may not be immedi- 
                ately available. - The COPS failover and synchronization  
                mechanism can be used for this purpose.  
    
           [6]  A NAS reboot message - This MUST be part of the Information  
                Model. 
    
           [7]  Accounting On/Off messages - This MUST be part of the  
                Information Model. (The COPS Accounting Timer can also be  
                used for this purpose.) 
    
      [h]  The COPS Base Protocol defines the Client Close message that can 
           be used by either the COPS client or server to terminate the  
           session. If the state is a subset of the TCP connection, then  
           this could also be part of the Client-Handle signaling (Decision  
           message and Delete Handle message).

      Clarifications 
    
      [a]  The COPS Protocol has provisions for sending unsolicited  
           Report messages that can be used to send real-time accounting 
           data.

Internet Draft Comparison of COPS and AAA Requirements       May 2000 
 
 
      [b]  The COPS-PR ClientSI objects can be used to carry ADIF   
           records directly. The AAA Accounting Record and Attributes   
           specification states "[ROAM-ADIF] 
           proposes a standard accounting record format, the Accounting 
           Data Interchange Format (ADIF), which is designed to compactly 
           represent accounting data in a protocol-independent manner." 
           Likewise, this format can also be stored within a PIB structure. 
    
      [c]  The ADIF  Accounting Data Format MAY be extended by assign- 
           ing new keywords for new accounting data objects by IANA.  
           Likewise, 
           new PIBs (which are fully described data structures) can be  
           easily developed to represent future accounting records. 
    
      [d]  In COPS, the Report messages are used to carry Accounting data.  
           The Accounting Timer object can be used to set the interval 
           at which periodic accounting updates are sent to the COPS server. 
    
      [e]  COPS runs over TCP that provides guaranteed delivery at the  
           application layer. The application layer can acknowledge Reports 
           using a COPS Decision message if needed (all acknowledged  
           accounting records on the client can be marked as acknowledged  
           by the server). 
    
      [f]  This MUST be defined as an attribute in the Accounting Data Model  
           (a.k.a. PIB) that will be carried in the COPS Report messages. 
    
      [g]  The COPS-PR uses PIBs which use the PRID to identify separate  
           instances of the same data structure for a single session.

      Clarifications 
    
      [a]  The Information/Data Model or PIB like structure MUST be  
           defined for Mobile IP Registration messages, which can be  
           used to carry the Registration messages over COPS. 
    
      [b]  The COPS Protocol [3] runs over TCP and uses a fixed port  
           number defined by IANA, which is why it is considered      
           firewall friendly. Additionally, COPS proxy servers can  
           easily be supported.  
    
      [c]  This MUST be part of the Information Model which can be  
           extended to support a Mobile IP Home Agent on any platform. 
    
    
   3.0  Conclusion 
    
      The COPS Protocol [3], when used with the appropriate Information 
      Model, is unconditionally compliant with the AAA Network Access 
      requirements [2].
