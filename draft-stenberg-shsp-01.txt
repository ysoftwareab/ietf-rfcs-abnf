                      Simple Home Status Protocol
                         draft-stenberg-shsp-01

Abstract

   In reasonable home networks there are no cloud services; just a set
   of local nodes sharing state, and possibly invoking operations either
   automatically or on behalf of the home user.  This document describes
   a key-value database that can be used to do both; published
   key=values represent the current state of the system, and by setting
   a key published by some other node to a different value a node can
   indicate the desire for changing of state.

1.  Introduction

   In spirit of House Arkko Toaster/Laundry/et al, House Stenberg also
   has needs, although they are mostly related to various sensors,
   control of lights and various appliances.  This leads to a a number
   of devices that need to discover each other, and share state and code
   (ideally) without central authorities, in fault tolerant fashion.
   And obviously it is also nice to have a log of what has occurred, and
   maintain software state in a distributed fashion.  There are also
   some security needs; control of appliances can be a serious hazard if
   security is not addressed appropriately.  SHSP is an attempt to
   produce a solution to address these needs.

   This document describes yet another DNCP-based protocol, which uses
   HNCP-style transport, yet intentionally is incompatible with it so
   that TLVs of SHSP and HNCP can be handled using same transport
   channel and de/encoders, but individual implementations of the
   different protocols can ignore each other unless they support both
   protocols.

   TBD: The long form of the acronym is actually misleading, as it is
   more about independent agents rampaging in home network, sharing
   state as they go.  Figure a better name?

2.  Requirements language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  DNCP Profile

   Hard work of SHSP is handled by DNCP [I-D.ietf-homenet-dncp].  DNCP
   profile of HNCP [I-D.ietf-homenet-hncp] is used as is.  Arguably TCP-
   based solution would be better, but compatibility with existing
   implementations of HNCP to transfer state, and eventual port- and
   multicast address reservations of HNCP make it more attractive.
   Despite the reuse of the transport and DNCP core logic, NONE of the
   HNCP TLVs are part of SHSP.

   SHSP nodes MAY choose to use the DTLS method(s) specified in the DNCP
   document, but in practice if authentication is desirable, something
   more lightweight using simple PSKs + sha256 authentication may be
   used.  To prevent providing a bad example, a concrete example is
   omitted.

4.  Overview

   SHSP provides a distributed key-value store, with each node having
   consistent view of the whole database.  Essentially, the database
   provides view of ((int) node identifier, (string) key, (json-
   encodable) value, (UTC second)last changed at) pairs for any
   participant interested in viewing it.

   If we assume that keys in and of themselves are unique, then we can
   assume that someone else than the node responsible for particular
   resource belonging to that key publishing a key=value for it desires
   a state change, e.g. turning on a light.

5.  Device Data

   SHSP devices typically provide either boolean input/output, or some
   numeric output value for other nodes to use.  Whatever can be
   transmitted inside JSON (particular key = particular value) is fine,
   but for example, in House Stenberg there are currently:

   o  Light sensor: numeric value (in lux)
      .kh.light_sensor.(name)/value=(int).

   o  Philips Hue lights: boolean with key .kh.hue.(name)/on.  (TBD:
      this could be also active color value)

Internet-Draft         Simple Home Status Protocol          October 2015


   o  Motion sensor: boolean with key .kh.motion_sensor.(name)/on.

   o  Wifi device presence detection: boolean key with
      .kh.wifi.(name)/on.

   o  Process activity monitor: boolean key with .kh.process.(name)/on.

   o  (Computer) user activity monitor: boolean key with
      .kh.user_active.(name)/on.

   Very cut down example of what the state actually looks like in the
   whole network of devices, that is determined by looking at the whole
   DNCP network state, not just that of the local node, looks like this
   at the time of the writing of the document:

   mstenber@poro ~>khtool -v
   .kh.hue.Entry/on=False (-38)
   .kh.light_sensor.corridor/value=86 (-37)
   .kh.motion_sensor.corridor/on=False (-49)
   .kh.process.kodi/on=False (-67807)
   .kh.user_active.poro/on=True (-41)
   .kh.wifi.iphone6/on=True (-5718)
   ...

   The numbers in parentheses identify second delta to current time when
   the state last changed.  For example, apparently Kodi process was
   last running on the machine it is monitored on ~20 hours ago, and the
   light called Entry was turned off 38 seconds ago.

6.  Type-Length-Value Objects

   SHSP requires only one TLV for its own use:

6.1.  SHSP Key-Value State TLV

   TBD: ASCII art

   o  T=789 (TBD)

   o  V= JSON-encoded string, containing a dictionary with:

      *  ts: (timestamp) when was the value most recently changed;
         number, expressed in seconds, UTC since UNIX epoch

      *  k: which key the value applies for

      *  v: the value of the key (any acceptable Json)

Internet-Draft         Simple Home Status Protocol          October 2015


   For example, the value of the TLV describing Kodi state noted in the
   above example looks as follows: {"k": ".kh.process.kodi/on", "v":
   false, "ts": 1444598358.729439}

7.  Security Considerations

   N/A

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA as it is informational for fun
   document, not really aimed for standards track.

Appendix A.  Changelog

   draft-stenberg-shsp-01:

   o  Got rid of the Python agent section - while it is planned at some
      point, not implemented yet and I am mostly interested in
      documenting the current production scheme.

   o  Added concrete examples of sensors and current system output.

Appendix B.  Draft source

   As usual, this draft is available at https://github.com/fingon/ietf-
   drafts/ in source format (with nice Makefile too).  Feel free to send
   comments and/or pull requests if and when you have changes to it!
