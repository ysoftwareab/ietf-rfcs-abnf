Abstract 
   
  This document presents a set of requirements of the Network State 
  Information Database (NSID) for Traffic Engineering over Generalized 
  Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) in the view of service 
  providers. The Network State Information Database is required to 
  implement the network architecture for network models that introduce 
  the control element of IP and to optimize the utilization of network 
  resources. And this document includes discussion about the 
  considerations and necessity of the several attributes to construct 
  NSID for Traffic Engineering over GMPLS that are extended from the 
  requirement for Traffic Engineering over MPLS [4]. These attributes 
  can be used to maximize the utilization of network resources and to 
  enhance resource oriented Traffic Engineering techniques.

1. Introduction  
    
   According to the recent rapidly increasing of IP traffic, Wavelength 
   Division  Multiplexing  (WDM)  technology  is  rapidly  becoming  a 
   technology-of-choice to meet the tremendous bandwidth demand of IP 
   traffic. 
   Traffic  Engineering  (TE)  of  an  IP  network  is  concerned  with 
   performance optimization of operational networks and mapping the flow 
   of traffic to present a physical topology of network. A major goal of 
   Internet Traffic Engineering is to facilitate efficient and reliable 
   network operations while simultaneously optimizing network resource 
   utilization and traffic performance [5]. 
   But because the attributes of present IP routing protocols have been 
   poor, the supplementary means for traffic engineering over GMPLS must 
   be prepared. 
   To overcome this problem, two schemes of the researches for traffic 
   engineering in IP networks have been introduced – one scheme is to 
   control explicitly the data path and other scheme is the adaptive 
   load balancing of usable path – the results of these research came to 
   produce the MPLS technology for traffic engineering in IP networks 
   and a GMPLS technology added the control plane of IP for introducing 
   the traffic engineering over MPLS in WDM networks. For introducing 
   the traffic engineering over GMPLS, we can consider two schemes, one 
   is the extended routing protocol for traffic engineering and the 
   other scheme is the allocation of traffic through a network resource 
   database for the efficient utilization of network resources. 
   This document describes the latter scheme that allocates the traffic 
   to the network resources through the construction of the network 
   state information database (NSID). 
    
1.1. Terminology 
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the GMPLS terminology as 
   defined in [3]. 
   The Network State Information Database is defined as the information 
   of characteristics and its control values related to the optical 
   resources that can be adopted as the control element in IP over 
   optical network. 
    
1.2. The Network State Information Database 
    
   In this document we define the network state information database 
   (NSID) that support the traffic engineering database (TED) for the 
   function of the traffic engineering and the management information 
   base (MIB) for the function of network maintenance. The main function 
   of the network state information database (NSID) is the control and 
   the management of network state information data. 
    
   The Network State Information Database can be classified as an 
   essential element to implement the functions of the traffic

   engineering in optical network. It is different from the MIB that is 
   configured to control individually each device dependent on the 
   characteristics of a system.  
   The Network State Information Database can be implemented by using 
   the extension of the routing protocols and the signaling protocols. 
   In the present MPLS router architecture, the information distribution 
   module establishes the database of traffic engineering that is used 
   to store the information of topology, the resource utilization, and 
   the metrics etc. 
   Therefore, the concept of network state information database is 
   required to extend and implement the database of traffic engineering 
   in the optical network. 
   In the overlay model, the information of the resource characteristics 
   and the resource controls should be established to exchange the 
   information between the traffic engineering database (TED) of LSR 
   (Label Switched Router) in MPLS and the Network State Information 
   Database of WXC (Wavelength Crossconnect) in optical system. 
   In the integrated model, the traffic engineering database in MPLS and 
   the Network State Information Database in optic network need be 
   integrated for the unified management. 
    
1.3. Document organization  
    
   The reminder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2 
   provides the Traffic Engineering over GMPLS and section 3 presents 
   the GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering. Sectin4,5 present the 
   overview of the characteristics and the requirements of GMPLS 
   architecture required for an extended overlay and integrated model. 
   Section 6 describes the necessity and the structural elements of a 
   network state information database (NSID). Finally, Section 7 
   contains and the implementation of NSID. 
    
    
2. Traffic Engineering over GMPLS 
    
   This section describes the Traffic Engineering objectives in GMPLS 
   and when traffic engineering of MPLS is extended to optical network, 
   the correlation of optical resources and the requirements in traffic 
   mapping are presented. 
    
    
2.1. Traffic Engineering Performance Objectives in GMPLS 
    
   The key performance objectives associated with traffic engineering in 
   GMPLS can be classified as being either in MPLS [4]:  
    
   - traffic oriented or 
   - resource oriented

   Traffic oriented performance objectives include the aspects that 
   enhance the QoS traffic streams. In the present Internet network 
   providing best effort service, the key traffic oriented performance 
   objectives can include: minimization of packet loss, minimization of 
   delay, maximization of throughput, and enforcement of service level 
   agreement. These elements are used in optical networks as well as in 
   the IP network. 
   Resource oriented performance objectives include the aspects 
   pertaining to the optimization of resource utilization. Efficient 
   management of network resources, such that subsets of network 
   resources do not become over utilized and congested while other 
   subnets along the alternate feasible paths remain underutilized, is 
   the vehicle for the attainment of resource oriented performance 
   objectives. Bandwidth is a crucial resource in contemporary networks, 
   but in the consideration of optical networks the key resources 
   oriented performance objectives can include: the number of 
   wavelengths, the number of Optical Crossconnects (OXC), the number of 
   fibers, and the number of optical transceivers. 
   For the enhancement of the resource oriented performance the 
   congestion control and the load balancing can be chosen. The 
   objective of load balancing is to minimize the maximum congestion or 
   alternatively to minimize the maximum resource utilization, through 
   the efficient resource allocation. Also for the maximization of 
   resource performance the resource management is needed. For the 
   resource management it is necessary to construct the resource control 
   signaling and the network state information database that is able to 
   manage the network resource through the control signaling. 
   Some key extensions brought by GMPLS to MPLS TE are highlighted in 
   the following [3]. 
    
   1) In MPLS-TE, links traversed by a Label Switched Path (LSP) can 
   include an intermix of links with heterogeneous label encoding (e.g. 
   links between routers, links between routers and ATM-LSRs, and links 
   between ATM-LSRs). GMPLS extended this by including links where the 
   label is encoded as a timeslot, or wavelength, or fiber. 
   In MPLS-TE, an LSP that carries IP has to start and end on a router. 
   GMPLS extends this by requiring LSP to start and end on several types 
   of Label Switching Routers (LSR) capable of several kinds of labels. 
   Therefore the type of a payload that can be carried in GMPLS by LSP 
   is extended to allow such payloads as SONET/SDH, G.709, 1GbE or 10GbE, 
   etc. 
   The use of Forwarding Adjacencies (FA) that can improve bandwidth 
   utilization is considered. When the bandwidth allocation can be 
   performed only in discrete units, FA allows the number of required 
   labels to be reduced. 
   GMPLS allows for a label to be suggested by an upstream node to 
   reduce the setup latency and to limit the range of labels that is 
   selected by the downstream node. This feature is useful in photonic 
   networks where wavelength conversion may not be available. 
   While traditional TE-based (and even LDP-based) LSPs are 
   unidirectional, GMPLS supports the bi-directional LSPs. This feature 
   will be useful in resource management.

   GMPLS supports the termination of LSP on a specific egress port, i.e. 
   the port selection at the destination node. 
   For TDM, Label Switching Capable (LSC) and Fiber Switching Capable 
   (FSC) interfaces in GMPLS, the bandwidth allocation for an LSP can be 
   performed only in indiscrete units. 
   There are much fewer labels on TDM, LSC, and FSC than on PSC or L2SC 
   links, because the former are physical labels instead of logical 
   labels. Therefore the resource oriented traffic engineering is needed. 
   There are basically three fundamental problems of traffic mapping in 
   MPLS: mapping packets onto forwarding equivalent classes (FEC), 
   mapping forwarding equivalent classes onto traffic trunks, and 
   mapping traffic trunks onto the physical network topology through LSP. 
   But in GMPLS including optical resources there are some problems of 
   the hierarchical LSP with how to map traffic trunks onto lambda, and 
   mapping lambda onto LSP, mapping lambda LSP onto waveband LSP, and 
   mapping waveband LSP onto fiber LSP. The hierarchical mapping stages 
   to optical switching are depicted in Figure 1.

3. GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering 
    
   In this section, the basic frameworks for the proposed traffic 
   engineering that can allocate the optical resources on demand, the 
   wavelength assignment, and the network reconfiguration are focused. 
   Main functions of these frameworks consist of the following stages in 
   shown in Figure 2.

                [FIGURE 2] The Framework for Traffic Engineering 
    
    
3.1. Network State Monitoring and Analysis Stage 
    
   This stage is responsible for collecting the traffic statistics from 
   the network elements. Then the statistics are analyzed for the 
   traffic engineering and the network reconfiguration related decision-
   making. 
    
    
3.2. Required Resource Estimation Stage 
    
   This stage estimates the resources, i.e. wavelength, the bandwidth of 
   each wavelength, in the near future based on the measurement, the 
   collection and the analysis of the past and present traffic 
   characteristics. 
    
    
3.3. Reconfiguration Decision Stage 
    
   This stage consists of a series of operations that decides when a 
   network level reconfiguration is performed for the resource 
   allocation from the resource estimation stage. This decision element 
   is based on traffic conditions, the number of network resources, and 
   other operational issues, e.g., suppressing the influence of 
   transitional factors and reserving the adequate time for network to 
   converge. 
   Network reconfiguration can be triggered when any element value 
   exceeds the thresholds.

               draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-01.txt          October 2002 
 
3.4. Logical Topology Design and Modification Stage 
    
   This stage computes a network topology based on the measurement and 
   predictions about the traffic state and the network resource. This 
   can be considered as optimizing a layered graph (i.e. IP routers 
   connected by lights in the WDM layers) for specific objectives (e.g. 
   minimum hops and maximizing throughput), subject to certain 
   constraints (e.g. nodal degree, interface capacity), for a given load 
   matrix (i.e. traffic load applied to the network), which in general 
   is a NP-complete problem. 
   Since the network reconfiguration can be triggered by periodically 
   changing traffic pattern, a practical approach is to develop methods 
   that focus on cost-effective, fast convergence, and/or minimal 
   impacts on ongoing traffic in the view of global optimality. There 
   are two methods considered. One method is that sub-TLV that can 
   become aware of the optical characteristics is added to the present 
   IP routing protocol and the other method is that signaling protocol 
   of IP network is introduced to the optical network so that network 
   topology is changed. 
    
    
3.5. Network Topology Migration Stage 
    
   This stage consists of algorithms to schedule the network migration 
   from old topology to a new topology. Even if WDM layer resources are 
   sufficient to support the allocation of resource and the change of 
   network resource, there are still other issues concerning the 
   migration. For example, as WDM reconfiguration deals with large-
   capacity channels, changing allocation of resources in this coarse 
   granularity has significant effects on a large number of end user 
   traffic. The procedure of reconfiguration resource for topology 
   migrations is rising to critical issues. In general a migration 
   procedure consists of a sequence of establishing and taking down 
   individual WDM light paths. Traffic flows have to adapt to the 
   changes of the light path during and after each migration stage. The 
   algorithm is needed so that the network configuration gives minimal 
   change on present network state. 
    
    
4. GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering in Overlay Model  
    
   In the overlay model traffic engineering over MPLS is extended to 
   GMPLS using the system architecture based IP control. 
    
   In the GMPLS network, the router is required to add the sub-TLV 
   related optical attributes to traditional IGP routing protocol to 
   perceive and control the state of optical resources. The Network 
   State Information Database (NSID) is required to control and manage 
   the information of network topology and resources in the optical 
   network. The update routing protocol manages the whole state of IP 
   and optical networks and passes the change of state information to 
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) of MPLS.

  [FIGURE 3] The Architecture of traffic Engineering in Overlay Model 
    
    
   According to the architecture of GMPLS in the overlay model as shown 
   in Figure 3, the optical crossconnect (OXC) in GMPLS network consists 
   of four modules as followings:  
    
   - The WDM Network Control and Management Module informs the state of 
    the optical network to the routing protocol of GMPLS and manages 
    the optical network by using the control signaling.

   - The Resource Control Module manages the optical resources and the 
    topology information for traffic engineering.  
    
   - The Light Path Connection Module establishes and releases the light 
    path, selects the optical fiber. 
    
   - The Protection and Restoration Module provides the fast restoration 
    through the protection and restoration algorithms. 
    
    And the Resource Control Module has the function of managing the 
   limited resources attributes and the network topology by using the 
   network state information database that is created by the Routing and 
   Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithm, the control signaling, and the 
   function of informing the change of optical resources to the MPLS 
   domain through the WDM Network Control and Management Module. Also 
   the Resource Control Module informs the available optical resources 
   to the Light Path Connection Module so that the table of light path 
   can be maintained. 
    
   In the optical domain the WDM Network Control and Management Module 
   takes charge of establishing and releasing the light path from the 
   Light Path Connection Module by using the control signaling and 
   informs the values of change related to the resource information to 
   the Resource Control Module. The WDM Network Control and Management 
   Module reports the faults to the Protection and Restoration Module so 
   that the restoration algorithm is active and the Protection and 
   Restoration Module reports the fault information to the Resource 
   Control Module so that new resources are allocated. 
    
5. GMPLS Architecture for Traffic Engineering in Integrated Model 
    
   The architecture of an integrated GMPLS model has an IP addressed 
   system for traffic engineering and a lambda router is needed to 
   completely support the network control and traffic management of the 
   MPLS and optical network. Also it is necessary to introduce the 
   wavelength-MIB to consist of the information about not only fibers 
   but also wavelength and the wavelength continuity/interchange 
   constraints of each node. And for the wavelength-MIB network control 
   consists of three modules: wavelength routing, wavelength signaling, 
   and wavelength access control. The wavelength routing module needs an 
   update link-state protocol with the suitable optical layer extensions. 
   The wavelength signaling module fulfills the wavelength routing 
   decisions achieved by the wavelength routing module to perform the 
   wavelength assignment, the setup/teardown optical light path, the 
   priority arbitration with preemption, and the adaptive QoS with QoS 
   negotiation. The implementation approach of wavelength routing needs 
   to be in optical layer extended RSVP or CR-LDP. The wavelength access 
   control module manages the physical connection between the MPLS 
   router and lambda router, and maps MPLS label to wavelength. For 
   traffic engineering, each system needs to be equipped with migration 
   scheduling of the network topology, reconfiguration algorithm, and 
   statistics collection and analysis. Also the network state

               draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-01.txt          October 2002 
 
   information database should be constructed to manage the integrated 
   domain of IP and WDM for maintenance of resources change. For traffic 
   engineering in the integrated model, the construction of centralized 
   traffic engineering needs to manage wavelength-MIB in the optical 
   layer and IP-MIB in the IP layer to strictly manage traffic and 
   network control. 
    
6. Network State Information Database for GMPLS 
    
   The network state information database is needed for the control and 
   management of the MPLS and optical network. The network state 
   information database is constructed and maintained based on the 
   traffic-engineering model and application method described in section 
   4 and 5. For example, in the integrated model an entire integrated 
   network state information database is collected from each site and is 
   centralized; in the overlay model the MPLS traffic engineering 
   database and optical network state information database are stored, 
   maintained, and managed separately. 
   The network state information database is involved with two aspects: 
   resources and their usage. Conventional representation of network 
   resources can be simply just the topological information. However, 
   traffic engineering requires more information, e.g. total bandwidth, 
   and current usage on each link. 
   Traffic engineering in an optical layer is interested in not only the 
   utilization status of network resources but also the optical 
   characteristics of wavelength connections and optical signal quality. 
   When overlay traffic engineering is attempted, the objectives 
   functions at different layers may even be different. In the case of 
   integrated traffic engineering, traffic control and resource 
   allocation are considered together so that optimization objectives 
   must be coordinated. 
   Although different traffic engineering models require different 
   design and implementation of network state information database, many 
   common attributes are shared in both cases as discussed in this 
   section. The attributes of MPLS traffic engineering are extended to 
   include the attributes of an optical network. Requirements of common 
   attributes and extended attributes are classified and elements of 
   each attribute and application scheme are observed. 
    
6.1. Resource Attribute 
    
   When the resource attribute for state information of network topology 
   is extended to the optical network, optical resources can be included 
   in this attribute as followings: 
    
   -  the number of fiber, wavebands and wavelengths per link 
   -  the number of LSP, traffic trunk per wavelength 
   -  wavelength, LSP coloring 
   -  bandwidth of link, wavelength, and LSP and their usage 
   -  min, max of current usage related to link, wavelength, LSP 
   -  the number of optical transceivers in optical system

               draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-01.txt          October 2002 
 
   In the view of traffic engineering, the optimal allocation of 
   physical and logical optical resources is an important element in 
   determining the performance of the network and this information about 
   resources is fundamental to the network state information database. 
   Also resource class attributes can be used to specify the class of 
   resources and depend on the quality of the optical resources – for 
   example, the quality of the light path, end-to-end BER attributes can 
   be an element to determine the quality of optical resources- which 
   become an important requirement for differentiated services and these 
   are applied differently according to policy attributes. 
    
6.2. Policy Attribute 
    
   The policy attribute provides differentiated services and this 
   attribute uses a resource class attribute. The policy attribute can 
   have the following attributes. 
    
   -  allowable end to end hops 
   -  the number of resources offered 
   -  protection and restoration mechanism for network survivability 
   -  optical signal noise ratio (OSNR), bit error rate (BER) 
   -  network provisioning 
    
   For example, if the ranges of services according to resource grade 
   present Si, Tj, Uk, those ranges can be presented in the expressions 
   below:  
    
   S = { S1, S2, S3, ... Si} 
   T = { T1, T2, T3, ... Tj} 
   U = { U1, U2, U3, ... Uk} 
    
   Ranges of services and same grade of services offered are classified 
   according to the expressions listed above and differentiated services 
   can be provided according to the network policy and optical 
   characteristics.  
    
   For example, through the limitation of end-to-end hops network 
   management can be done. Services included in Si can allow a maximum 
   of 30 hops; Services in Tj can allow a maximum of 20 hops so that the 
   limitation of hops can be operated as an element of network 
   management. The number of available wavelengths per link is applied 
   for network management. For example, the number of wavelengths per 
   link included in Si can be 10; the number of wavelengths per link 
   included in Tj can be 4. According to the range of services, the 
   finite number of wavelengths can be limited and applied to the 
   network management. This scheme that the service range depends on 
   service grade establishes the parameter for traffic engineering and 
   is capable of implementation. As the provisioning that depends on the 
   service range can construct the optical system, the differentiated 
   services can be provided according to the resource grade attribute of 
   the optical network.

               draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-01.txt          October 2002 
 
 6.3. Traffic Attribute 
    
   The Traffic Attribute is the element that captures the 
   characteristics of the traffic streams. In MPLS the bandwidth of LSP, 
   the maximum throughput allowed, and the minimum data rate guaranteed 
   are included in the classification of attributes [4]. If this 
   definition is extended to the optical network, traffic attributes can 
   be extended to physical and logical values of wavelength, waveband, 
   and fiber. There are important traffic attributes as follows: 
    
    - end to end BER 
    - the optical characteristics of fiber: optical frequency, optical 
      signal power, optical signal-to-noise ratio 
    - the number of wavelengths per fiber 
    - the number of wavelength channels in a waveband 
    - the bandwidth of a wavelength channel 
    - the maximum or minimum of data rate 
     
   These traffic attributes include common elements of resource 
   attributes and utilize the characteristics of resources. 
    
 6.4. Adaptivity Attribute 
    
   The states and resources of network change over time. These changes 
   result from the availability of new resources and reactivation of 
   failed resources, and de-allocation of allocated resources. In the 
   view of traffic engineering, an administrative function that can 
   control the resources is required because of this dynamism of network. 
   An adaptivity attribute is a part of the path maintenance parameters 
   and can be presented as re-optimization.  According to this 
   adaptivity attribute, the execution of an optimization algorithm 
   depends on the network state in considering stability. This 
   adaptivity attribute is the necessary attribute at the stage of 
   Network Topology Migration described in section 3.5. The adaptive 
   algorithm that has a minimum effect on the network state should 
   support this adaptivity attribute and can provide provisioning at the 
   time of implementation and control the network state. 
    
6.5. Priority Attribute 
    
   Priority attribute gives priority to the emergency data and real time 
   data and should be considered with the above resource class attribute 
   and policy attribute. For the implementation of the priority 
   attribute optical resources with excellent quality characteristics- 
   for example the resource that its end-to-end BER is lower is 
   allocated or the backup path leased for restoration is allocated- are 
   allocated to high priority. And the routing and signaling protocol 
   that are updated to occupy optical characteristics can be considered 
   to include the function that can allocate and control the priority. 
   Also for the priority services the preemption that depends on 
   priority should be allowed.

               draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-01.txt          October 2002 
 
 6.6. Preemption Attribute 
    
   The preemption attribute should be considered with the priority 
   attribute and resilience attribute and it is the function that can 
   give itself using resources to high priority data according to 
   network priority. This function is useful for the efficiency of 
   resources and costs and especially for the implementation of various 
   prioritized restoration policies. However low priority traffic should 
   be used for the optical link and path with preemption attribute, and 
   the provisioning function should be able to control the preemption 
   attribute. 
    
 6.7. Resilience attribute 
    
   The resilience attribute for network stability can be defined as a 
   function that when a fault of link or node occurs, a used traffic 
   stream is transferred to a new path through an alternate path and the 
   path generation algorithm. The type of recovery mechanism of the link 
   can be classified as below according to the time of capacity 
   allocation and the decision about backup capacity [6]. 
    
  1) Dedicated protection is that the capacity allocation and the 
     decision of backup path that are concluded before a fault occurs. 
     For example, a 1+1 recovery scheme gives a dedicated protection 
     path for a link or wavelength. The advantages of this scheme are 
     the simple implementation and the fast recovery, but its 
     disadvantage is the poor utilization of resources. 
   2) Preplanned restoration is that the backup capacity is decided 
      before a failure but the allocation of backup capacity is decided 
      after a failure. For example, when high priority traffic and low 
      priority traffic are used together and high priority traffic has 
      failed, low priority traffic is removed. A 1:1 recovery scheme is 
      a link of low priority traffic that is given to high priority 
      traffic. And 1:N recovery scheme is the other example that 
      recovery depends on priority traffic and one backup path is 
      established for the N link through the control signal assuming 
      that a failure in all links does not occur simultaneously. This 
      scheme is achieved by signaling so that recovery time is slower 
      than dedicated recovery and more complex but is excellent in 
      resource utilization 
    
  3) Dynamic restoration is that the backup capacity and decision are 
     executed after failure and is most excellent but has the 
     disadvantage of having recovery time is low and the implementation 
     is complex. In the optical network fast recovery is required and 
     therefore a fast path generation algorithm is required for 
     introducing dynamic restoration into the optical network. 
   
   Also the concept of Protection Link Group (PLG) is required for 
   providing the differentiated services of protection according to the 
   priority of the link or data in optical network. The Protection Link 
   Group provides differentiated recovery time when the priority link 
 
 
Kim et al    Expires - April 2003                           [Page  14] 

               draft-kim-ccamp-gmpls-nsid-01.txt          October 2002 
 
   and its backup path are established by using the three recovery 
   mechanisms above. This PLG scheme can provide differentiated services 
   in the view of the resource utilization and the network policy 
   because the 1:N or M:N protection group based on the traffic priority 
   can be created in optical network. 
    
   Therefore, PLG is defined as the management of link group to provide 
   differentiated recovery schemes by allocating optical information of 
   each light path to the cost of each path and maintain the consistent 
   recovery ratio. 
    
   For example, we can provide the differentiated service of data 
   traffic classified by three classes, such as mission-critical, best-
   effort, and low-priority flows in optical network. The priority of 
   these Optical LSPs (O-LSPs) can be allocated as high, medium, and low 
   priority respectively. 
    
   Through the allocation of these priorities, each light path has the 
   different recovery scheme according to its priority. 
   Namely, the light paths with high priority have the dedicated 
   protection mechanism, the light paths with medium priority have the 
   preplanned restoration mechanism, and the light paths of low priority 
   have the dynamic restoration mechanism. 
   These priority based recovery mechanisms can provide the 
   differentiated recovery speed and the resource utilization according 
   to the characteristics of each recovery mechanism illustrated 
   previously. Each light path has the information of fiber segments 
   that belong to its own light path and this information can be stored 
   network state information database to compose of PLG for the purpose 
   of network management. 
   The concept of PLG in mesh optical network is shown in Figure 4.

   [FIGURE 4] The concept of Protection Link Group (PLG) in mesh optical 
                                  network 
    
    
   The fiber ID {1,2} includes the primary light path P1 with the high 
   priority and the fiber ID {7,8} includes the backup light path B for 
   the purpose of backup of primary light path P1. 
    
   The fiber ID {3,4} includes the primary light path P2 with the 
   medium priority and fiber ID {5,6} includes the primary light path 
   P3 with low priority. All these fiber ID is established as one 
   Protection Link Group (PLG) to maintain the consistent recovery 
   ratio in the case of occurring the fault of light path. 
 
   If the fault of light path is occurred, each recovery mechanism uses 
   this PGL and the new recovery backup path is made by control 
   signaling for the purpose of consistent recovery ratio within the PLG. 
   Then the failed light path and the newly generated light path are 
   updated this PLG to maintain the consistent PLG ratio. 
    
   The differentiated recovery scheme according to three priority uses 
   these light path lists included PLG. 
   The scheme of Protection Link Group has some advantage. 
    
  - It can improve the resource utilization of network compare with 
    legacy recovery schemes

  - It can provide differentiated recovery speed according to the 
    traffic characteristics of light paths. 
    
    
7. Implementation Considerations 
    
   In considering the construction of the GMPLS network based on these 
   attributes in IP and WDM domain, the following requirements of each 
   layer should be considered. 
    
   1) IP layer 
    - information about virtual topology (set of light path connected 
      between routers) of IP network 
    - information about link state of IP network 
      
   2) WDM layer 
    - information about physical topology (set of fiber connected 
      between WDM devices) 
    - information about the continuity of wavelength allocated to each 
      link, e.g. wavelength converter is equipped or not 
    - information about switching capability and port usage 
      (information of capability of fiber, waveband, and wavelength   
      switching for each port) 
    - information about fiber, the physical link, for example the 
      number of available wavelengths per fiber, directionality, 
      optical SNR of wavelength, BER 
    - information about the light path, for example, the identity (ID) 
     of the component at the destination network, port ID of adding 
     light path, port ID of dropping, directionality, Fiber ID, 
     throughput per wavelength, end-to-end SNR, Protection Link Group 
     (PLG) ID etc. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce new security issues beyond those 
   inherent in GMPLS. It is, however, possible that using the suggested 
   network management attributes provisioning can be done as 
   administrative usage.
