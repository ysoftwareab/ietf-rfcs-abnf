Internet-Draft    Problem Statement in IPv6 over WiBro         June 2005


1.  Introduction

   WiBro is deeply related with IEEE 802.16 specification.  Some parts
   of WiBro technology are developed by Korea.  The other parts comply
   with IEEE 802.16 specification.

   This document deals with two issues.  One is about payload header
   suppression (PHS).  In WiBro, downlink and uplink bandwidth is
   approximately 18Mbps and 6Mbps respectively.  Limited bandwidth is
   one of the problems for quality in the IEEE 802.16 wireless network
   both fixed and mobile environment.  In most cases, bandwidth for a
   user could be not enough because many subscriber stations (SS) share
   the bandwidth.  Therefore using wireless bandwidth efficiently is
   important.

   One of the ways to increase radio bandwidth is reducing size of media
   access control (MAC) frames.  The PHS is one of the methods that can
   achieve such goal effectively.  The PHS is defined in the IEEE 802.16
   specification.  This document focuses on PHS rules for IPv6.  For
   now, IPv6 PHS rules have not been specified.  This draft would like
   to describe the needs for setting PHS rules to clarify the reason why
   v6ops should do it.

   The other issue is how to transmit IP multicast when a SS performs
   IPv6 address auto-configuration in 802.16 wireless environments.  RFC
   3041 about auto-configuration is made for fixed IPv6 networks.
   However, it is not applied in 802.16 wireless environments.  Unlike
   fixed network such as IEEE 802.3 and 802.16, wireless networks have
   downsides such as limited bandwidth, expose to hacking and packet
   loss.

   This document proposes that v6ops working group needs to consider
   ways to transmit IP multicast from SS to base station (BS).

   various CSs, through the MAC SAP, classified to particular MAC
   connections.

   Classifier: a set of matching criteria applied to each packet
   entering the IEEE Std 802.16 network.  It consists of some protocol-
   specific packet matching criteria (destination IP address, for
   example), a classifier priority, and a reference to a CID.  If a
   packet matches the specified packet matching criteria, it is then
   delivered to the SAP for delivery on the connection defined by the
   CID.

   Payload header suppression index (PHSI): An 8-bit mask that indicates
   which bytes in the Payload Header Suppression Field (PHSF) to
   suppress and which bytes not to be suppressed

3.  PHS rules for IPv6 packets

3.1  PHS in the IEEE 802.16

   While PHS rules can be applied in various cases such as IPv4, IPv6,
   etc., this draft focuses on setting PHS rules for IPv6 packets.  The
   IEEE 802.16 physical and MAC layer can transmit IPv6 packets from/to
   BS to/from SS.  Convergence Sublayer (CS), positioned in 802.16e MAC
   layer, assembles or dissembles incoming/outgoing IPv6 packets.

   Then, the classifier in CS extracts information for transmission from
   IPv6 packet header and transforms incoming IPv6 packets into MAC
   protocol data unit (PDU) that can be processed in the IEEE 802.16 MAC
   CPS.  The classifier in CS performs PHS for IPv6 during the
   transformation.  The PHS for IPv6 is the process of suppressing the
   repetitive portion of IPv6 packet headers at the sender and restoring
   the headers at the receiver.

   IPv6 PHS is defined as optional in IEEE 802.16.  PHS has a Payload
   Header Suppression Valid (PHSV) option to verify or not verify the
   payload header before suppressing it.  PHS has also a Payload Header
   Suppression Mask (PHSM) option to allow select bytes not to be
   suppressed.  More information is available in the 5.2.3 of IEEE Std
   802.16-2004 specification.

3.2  Header considerations

   To setting IPv6 PHS efficiently, v6ops working group should consider
   each header described as below.

Internet-Draft    Problem Statement in IPv6 over WiBro         June 2005


   3.4.1 IPv6 header

      - Traffic class

      - Flow label

      - Payload length

      - Next header

      - Hop Limit

      - Source address and Destination address. etc

   3.4.2 IPv6 Option header

      - Destination Option Header

      - Routing header

      - Fragment header

      - Authentication Header

      - Encapsulating Security Payload header

      - Destination Option header. etc


3.3  v6ops considerations

   Considering limited bandwidth and instability in 802.16 wireless
   environments, the probability to transmit IPv6 packet to PSS is lower
   than fixed networks.  Reducing the length of IPv6 packets by setting
   PHS rules is a way to overcome wireless networks limitations.  If
   IPv6 PHS is applied to Ipv6 option headers, more IPv6 packets can be
   transmitted.

   IPv6 PHS is effective when a lot of IPv6 packets are transmitted,
   which have many repetitive parts in IPv6 header.  Setting the detail
   of IPv6 PHS is more related with IP layer than MAC layer because IPv6
   header is used in IP layer.  Only IP layer can decide which parts of
   IPv6 header can be suppressed when applying PHS rules.  Therefore,
   V6ops working group should pay attention to setting PHS rules for
   IPv6.

4.  IPv6 address Auto-Configuration over IEEE 802.16

4.1  Modes affecting IPv6 multicast

   IEEE 802.16 defines two transmission modes with which a BS and a SS
   (or a SS and a SS) communicate.  One is the PMP (point-to-multipoint)
   mode, the other is the mesh mode.  In WiBro specification, only PMP
   mode is considered.

   4.1.1 PMP mode

      A BS broadcasts IEEE 802.16 MAC frames periodically to its area
      when transmitting data from the BS to SSs.  Therefore, each frame
      can be shared by SSs.  On the contrary, SSs share the uplink to
      the BS on a demand basis.  In other words, SSs cannot communicate
      each other without BS.  The MAC scheduler located in the BS,
      controls uplink/downlink in IEEE 802.16 environments.

   4.1.2 Mesh mode

      In the Mesh mode, IEEE 802.16 MAC frames can be transmitted using
      other SSs.  In some cases, direct communication between SSs is
      possible.  Therefore, SSs can send SS-initiated IPv6 multicast
      messages to BS and other SSs.  More information is available in
      6.2 of IEEE Std 802.16-2004 specification.


4.2  v6op Considerations

   Both in PMP and mesh mode, IEEE 802.16 specification can be changed
   in order to send SS-initiated Ipv6 multicast for IPv6 address Auto-
   configuration.  For example, a certain SS in a BS and other SS in
   other BS can have same IP address because groups of BSs can have
   different IP allocation policies and IP management policies which has
   not specified in the IEEE 802.16 specification.  Therefore, v6ops
   needs to consider both MAC layer and IP layer in order that a SS-
   initiated multicast to all SSs can be transmitted.

   6.1.1 PHS for IPv6

      When PHS rule is applied to IPv6 packets, BS and SS should be
      authorized and authenticated in WiBro.

   6.1.2 IPv6 multicast transmission in IEEE 802.16

      When IPv6 multicast transmission in IEEE 802.16 is applied to IPv6
      packets, BS and SS should be authorized and authenticated in
      WiBro.
