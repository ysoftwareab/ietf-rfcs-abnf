ABORTED=20
         The transaction has aborted; the connection enters Idle=20
         state.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
         The connection enters the Error state.

NOTBEGUN=20
         A new transaction could not be begun; the connection=20
         remains in Idle state.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
ABORTED=20
         This response is possible only from the Begun and Enlisted=20
         states. It indicates that some party has vetoed the commitment
         of the transaction, so it has been aborted instead of=20
         committing. The connection enters the Idle state.

COMMITTED=20
         This response indicates that the transaction has been
         committed, and that the primary no longer has any
         responsibilities to the secondary with respect to the
         transaction. The connection enters the Idle state.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
ERROR=20

      This command is valid in any state; it informs the secondary that
      a previous response was not recognized or was badly formed.  A
      secondary should not respond to this command. The connection
      enters Error state.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
         This response also occurs if the accepting party does not
         support any version of the protocol in the range supported
         by the initiator. The connection enters the Error state. The
         initiator should close the connection.

PREPARE=20

      This command is valid only in the Enlisted state; it requests=20
      the secondary to prepare the transaction for commitment (phase
      one of two-phase commit). Possible responses are:

PREPARED=20
         The subordinate has prepared the transaction; the connection
ABORTED=20
         The subordinate has vetoed committing the transaction. The
         connection enters the Idle state.  After this response, the=20
         superior has no responsibilities to the subordinate with=20
         respect to the transaction.

READONLY=20
         The subordinate no longer cares whether the transaction
         commits or aborts. The connection enters the Idle state. After
         this response, the superior has no responsibilities to the=20
         subordinate with respect to the transaction.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
PULLED=20
         The relationship has been established.  Upon receipt of this
NOTPULLED=20
         The relationship has not been established (possibly, because
ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
NOTPUSHED=20
         The relationship could not be established. The connection
         remains in the Idle state.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
         The connection enters Error state.

QUERIEDEXISTS=20
         The transaction still exists.  The connection remains in the=20
         Idle state.

QUERIEDNOTFOUND=20
         The transaction no longer exists.  The connection remains in
         the Idle state.

RECONNECTED=20
         The subordinate accepts the reconnection. The connection enters
         Prepared state.

NOTRECONNECTED=20
         The subordinate no longer knows about the transaction. The=20
         connection remains in Idle state.

ERROR=20
         The command was issued in the wrong state, or was malformed.
Abstract=20

   TMP provides a simple mechanism for creating multiple lightweight=20
   connections over a single TCP connection. Several such lightweight
   connections can be active simultaneously. TMP provides a byte=20
   oriented service, but allows message boundaries to be marked.=20
