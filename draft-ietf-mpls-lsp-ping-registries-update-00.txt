1.  Introduction

   When RFC 8029 [RFC8029] was published it contained among other things
   updates to the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" IANA name space [IANA-LSP-PING].

   RFC 8611 [RFC8611] updated the LSP Ping IANA registries to match RFC
   8029, but the registrations can be further clarified and their
   definitions more precise.

   This document updates RFC 8029 [[RFC8029] and RFC 8611 [RFC8611] by
   updating two groups of registries.

   First the registries for Message Types [IANA-MT], Reply Modes
   [IANA-RM] and Return Codes [IANA-RC].  The changes to these
   registries are minor.

   Second, this document updates the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  TLVs [IANA-TLV-reg]

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries              October 2019


   o  Sub-TLVs for TLVs 1, 16 and 21 [IANA-Sub-1-16-21]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 6 [IANA-Sub-6]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 11 [IANA-Sub-11]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 20 [IANA-Sub-20]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 23 [IANA-Sub-23]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 27 [IANA-Sub-27]

   The registry for sub-TLVs for TLV 9 [IANA-Sub-9] is not updated.

1.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updating the Message Types, Reply Mode and Return Codes Registries

   The following changes are made to the Message Types, Reply Modes and
   Return Codes [IANA-MT] registries.

   o  a small set of code points (4 code points) for experimental use is
      added, actually they are take from the range for "Private Use".

   o  the registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed

   o  In the listing of assignments the term "Vendor Private Use" is
      changed to "Private Use"

   o  the registration procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"
      are added to the table of registration procedures

   o  A note "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"

   o  In the list that capture the assignment status, the fields that
      are reserved, i.e.  0, Private Use and Experimental Use are
      clearly marked.

      *  In the Return Codes [IANA-RC] registry the code point "0"
         already been assigned.  This assignment is not changed and this
         registry will not have the "0" value "Reserved".

   The new Registration Procedures layout and the new assignments for
   these registries will be found in Section 5.1.

3.  Updating the TLV and sub-TLV registries

   When a new LSP Ping sub-TLV registry were created by RFC 8611
   [RFC8611] this registry "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" [IANA-Sub-6] was
   set up following the intentions of RFC 8029.

   The registry for "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" will serve as a model to
   change/update the rest of the TLV and sub-TLV registries in this name
   space.

   The registration procedures in the current registry for "Sub-TLVs for
   TLV Type 6" looks like this (2019-06-20).  This will be used as a
   base-line and some additions/changes will be made as captured in the
   Appendixes:

   +-------------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Range       | Registration      | Note                            |
   |             | Procedures        |                                 |

   |             |                   | require an error message if not |
   |             |                   | recognized.                     |

   |             |                   | require an error message if not |
   |             |                   | recognized.                     |

   |             |                   | not recognized.                 |
   | 49162-64511 | RFC Required      | This range is for optional TLVs |
   |             |                   | that can be silently dropped if |
   |             |                   | not recognized.                 |

              Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6 Registration Procedures

   This document adds small ranges of code points for Experimental Use
   to this registry and to registries listed in Section 5.2.

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries              October 2019


   All registries will be changed to reflect the same model.

3.1.  General principles the LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV registries

   The following principles are valid for all the LSP Ping TLV and sub-
   TLV IANA registries

   o  all mandatory TLVs and sub-TLVs requires a response if the are not
      recognized

   o  some optional TLVs and sub-TLVs requires a response if the are not
      recognized

   o  some optional TLVs and sub-TLVs may be silently dropped if the are
      not recognized

   The range of each TLV and sub-TLV registry is divided into to blocks,
   one with a range from 0 to 49161 for TLVs and sub-TLVs that require a
   response if not recognized.  Another block in the range from 49161 to
   65535, this block is for TLVs and sub-TLVs that may be silently
   dropped if not recognized.

   Each of the blocks have code point spaces with the following
   registration procedures:

   o  Standards Action

   o  RFC Required

   o  Experimental Use

   o  Private Use

   The exact defintion of registration procedures for IANA registries
   are found in [RFC8126]

3.1.1.  Unrecognized Experimental and Private TLVs and sub-TLVs

   Unrecognized TLVs and sub-TLVs for Expereimetal USe and Privagte Use
   are handled as any other unrecognised TLV or sub-TLV.

   o  If the unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV is from the Experimental Use
      range (37144-37147) or from the Private Use range (31748-32767) a
      the Return Code of 2 ("One or more of the TLVs was not
      understood") will be sent in the echo response.

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries              October 2019


   o  If the unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV is from the Experimental Use
      range (64512-64515) or from the Private Use range (64515-65535)
      the TLVs SHOULD be silently ignored.

   IETF does not prescribe how recognized or unrecognized Experimental
   Use and Private Use TLVs and sub-TLVs are handled in experimental or
   private networks, that is up to the agency running the experiment or
   the private network.  The statement above relates to how standard
   compliant implementations will treat the unrecognized TLVs and sub-
   TLVs from these ranges.

3.2.  Changes to the LSP Ping registries

   This section lists the changes to each MPLS LSP Ping Registry, in
   Section 5.1, Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 the changes are detailed and
   it is shown what the IANA registry version of the registration
   procedures and assignments would look like.

3.2.1.  Common changes to the TLV and sub-TLV registries

   The following changes are made to the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  two small set of code points (2 times 4 code points) for
      experimental use is added, actually they are take from the range
      for "Private Use".

   o  the registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed

   o  In the listing of assignements the term "Vendor Private Use" is
      changed to "Private Use"

   o  In the listing of assignments the range for "Experimental Use" is
      added

   o  the registration procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"
      are added to the table of registration procedures

   o  A note "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Experimental Use" and "Private Use"

   o  In the list that capture assignment status, the fields that are
      reserved, i.e.  0, Experimental Use and Private Use are clearly
      marked.

   The new Registration Procedures description and the new assignments
   for these registries will be found in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3.
