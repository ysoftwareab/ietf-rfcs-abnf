Abstract 
 
   Conventional deployments store keys on PC hard disks, application- 
   server hard disks, or in tokens, and also introduce complications  
   for user enrollment and management.  User and administrator  
   frustration with the conventional approach has cramped development  
   of a market for PKI.  As a result, PKI has not reached its  
   utilization potential and is far from becoming ubiquitous. 
 
   This document describes architecture for deployment of secure and  
   efficient digital signature capabilities based on a centralized key- 
   management approach and emphasizes the importance of not disrupting  
   existing identity and authentication management and application  
   infrastructure.  An alternative architecture is documented here so  
   that PKI deployments will lower their associated administrative  
   burdens and deliver improved scalability.

Internet-Draft   Digital Signature System Deployment  30 September 2008 
 
 
1.  Introduction. 
 
   This document presents an approach to deploying digital signature  
   solutions, but does not mandate use of a solution-specific or PKI- 
   specific identity proofing policy, procedure, enrollment software,  
   or PKI-specific authentication scheme.  The approach leverages an  
   organization's pre-established user and authentication  
   infrastructure to drive the management of end-user signature  
   credentials i.e., management of signature keys and certificates.   
   The described architecture results in minimum impact by the  
   signature PKI on business operations. 
 
   While the architecture mandates use of PKI and digital signature  
   standards, it also allows deployment of several optional security  
   and middleware components that can be used to meet requirements of  
   a broad diversity of security policies, applications, and business  
   processes, and include: 
 
      o  FIPS-140 [REF] evaluated hardware options to provide extra  
         physical and programmatic access control and integrity  
         protection for private keys and digital-signature operations; 
 
      o  SHS [REF] is mandated and provides integrity protection of  
         signed objects (documents or data); 
 
      o  Triple-DES [REF] and AES [REF] are symmetric-cryptographic  
         options that provide confidentiality and integrity protection  
         of signature private keys; 
 
      o  X.509 v3 certificates and X.509 v2 CRLs [REF] are mandatory to  
         ensure signature verification and support non-repudiation  
         under off the shelf applications; 
 
      o  RSA (1024 to 4096-bit) [REF] and ECDSA [REF] are options that  
         provide integrity and non-repudiation protection of digital  
         signatures on user-signed data, certificates and CRLs; 
 
      o  SSL/TLS [REF] options provide confidentiality and integrity  
         protection of signature object hash values and signature  
         blocks sent between the application and key server; 
 
      o  PKCS#1 [REF] and PKCS#7 [REF] are used to enable signature  
         verification by off the shelf applications; 
 
      o  PKCS#10 [REF] is used for public-key certification requests to  
         enable key certification operations; 
 
      o  PKCS#11 [REF], OASIS DSS [REF], CAPI [REF], and ASSP [REF] are  
         middleware-interface options to allow a diversity of  
         applications access to signature services.

     Standard Operating Procedure               Protocol 
 
  Figure 1.  Example of Enrollment, Key and Certificate Management 
 
 
2.1.1. Identity Proofing.  Most organizations have an established,  
   documented and standard operating procedure for identity proofing  
   that requires in-person verification.  These procedures are  
   typically under the control of screening departments such as human- 
   resources, or those that screen suppliers and/or customers.  When  
   a person's identity is verified (proofed) that person is enrolled in  
   the organization's established user/supplier/customer database,  
   typically an LDAP-enabled directory or database, and an identity  
   credential is issued.  The PKI or digital-signature system  
   deployed must not disrupt these established identity and  
   authentication management(IAM) policies, procedures and  
   infrastructure, rather the signature PKI must be driven by the  
   established infrastructure. 
 
2.1.2. Signature-User Enrollment.  The deployment virtualizes an  
   organization's established identity-directory (or database) services  
   as the registration authority (RA) (i.e., RA proxy) for the  
   signature PKI.  [Note the deployment described here may leverage a  
   range of pre-existing identity-credentialing systems to authenticate  
   users and manage their digital-signature credentials, i.e.,  
   signature key pair and signature certificate].  All signature-key  
   and signature-certificate provisioning and management functions must  
   be performed transparently and securely for the end user and systems  
   administrator (see next section).

Internet-Draft   Digital Signature System Deployment  30 September 2008 
 
 
2.1.3. Registration Authority (RA) Proxy.  The key and certificate  
   server must listen to a set of events on the user directory (e.g.,  
   new user, remove user, change user details, etc.) and translate  
   these routine administrative operations into signature-key and  
   certificate-management events (e.g., generate key pair, revoke  
   private key, issue/revoke certificate, etc.), without the need for  
   additional PKI-specific administrator intervention. 
 
2.1.4. Key and Certificate Management.  The deployment provides a  
   network-attached multi-user server for key and certificate  
   generation and storage, and for private-key operations.  Such a  
   server can be any basic hardware server, or one that has undergone  
   FIPS-140 evaluation for higher assurance in key protection.   
   Signature keys and certificates are generated, stored and managed  
   inside the server, and private keys are never exposed outside this  
   server.  If such a server has also been evaluated for FIPS 140  
   security, it can provide hardware security without the need  
   for personal-hardware tokens.  In fact some servers, depending on  
   FIPS level (FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named  
   "Level 1" to "Level 4"), can be viewed as a large network-attached  
   smart card that generates and stores all users' signature  
   credentials, and executes all signature (private-key) operations.   
   Furthermore, user (and administrator) can only use and access their  
   own signature key(s), and have access to none other.  Access for key  
   usage is controlled by the authentication scheme chosen by the  
   organization, [see sec 2.2.3], and the specific server's protection  
   profile. 
    
   The operational impact is an elimination of the high burden in  
   logistics, cost, help-desk support, and lack of user acceptance,  
   associated with the purchase, provisioning, distribution, and  
   management of individual public-key hardware or software tokens. 
 
2.1.5. Certificate Management Options.  Certificate management can be  
   provided either by an embedded Certification Authority (CA) in the  
   key and certificate server (the server), or by one of two optional  
   middleware (or procedural) interfaces between the server and an  
   external CA:  
      (i)  a middleware interface that allows the server to act as an  
           RA Proxy between the organization's user management  
           infrastructure and the external CA by making PKCS#10 key- 
           certification requests from the server on behalf of each  
           user directly to the external CA; 
      (ii) a middleware (or procedure) can allow the embedded CA to be  
           established as a subordinate to a Root CA by exporting its  
           public key (e.g., subject = subordinate CA xyz) and  
           submitting a PKCS#10 key-certification request to an  
           external Root CA.

Internet-Draft   Digital Signature System Deployment  30 September 2008 
 
 
   Organizations can then have the option to securely and transparently  
   manage and control their own CA or get certificate-management  
   services from an independent third party CA.  Furthermore, the  
   systems administrator and users have no training obstacles or added  
   burdens related to PKI-service management and use, regardless of the  
   chosen CA option. 
 
   Under this approach (RA Proxy), the organization need not change  
   their current policies, procedures, and systems for (a) identity  
   proofing and management, and (b) user enrollment/revocation.  Thus  
   the deployment of the digital-signature system and PKI does not  
   negatively impact established policy and infrastructure, nor end- 
   user and administrator routines or business operations. 
 
2.1.6. Revocation, CRLs and OCSP.  This approach mandates a user is  
   revoked by revoking his/her private key, i.e., the private key is  
   immediately deleted by the server.  Therefore, at the time of  
   revocation the user no longer has a capability to make even one more  
   signature.  Hence, all signatures that verify with that user's  
   certificate have been made when the user had valid  
   signature privileges, and not after.  At the time the private key is  
   revoked the user's certificate is also revoked and placed on the CRL.   
   However, the need to manage and reconcile CRLs under this approach  
   is less important resulting in a savings of processing,  
   administrative, and CRL-distribution overhead.  Furthermore, if all  
   key management in the PKI followed a centralized approach the need  
   for OCSP responders might be eliminated, resulting in an added  
   efficiency in signature verification, i.e., those examining  
   signatures need not be online to verify signatures (see section  
   2.2.2. below).  In any event, as long as the conventional approach  
   is used there will be a need for CRLs and OCSP. 
 
2.1.7 Automatic Refresh: Keys and/or Certificates.  Since keys and  
   certificates are managed centrally, the key-certificate server can  
   automatically refresh keys (i.e., generate new and revoke old  
   certificates (i.e., issue new certificate with new validity period)  
   upon expiration without the delays or logistics issues associated  
   with private keys and certificates managed on computer hard drives  
   or personal hardware tokens such as smart cards and USB sticks . 
 
2.1.8. Re-keying.  As security policies evolve, it may become necessary  
   to migrate from 1024-bit RSA to 2048-bit RSA, or from RSA to ECDSA. 
   Conventional deployment approaches mandate the provisioning and  
   distribution of physical personal signature-key media, either  
   software or hardware tokens.  These deployments leave the  
   administrator with a serious logistical burden for re-keying.  Under  
   such conventional deployments, the administrator first needs to  
   provision new key tokens for each user, and then carefully manage  
   the timing of their activation and swapping with tokens already in  
   the hands of the end users.

Internet-Draft   Digital Signature System Deployment  30 September 2008 
 
 
   In the event that re-keying is required for signature keys, the  
   centralized approach offers an efficient method to re-keying the  
   user community.  Since no personal signature-key media has been  
   distributed (see section 2.2.1. below), all users can be re-keyed at  
   once from the central network-attached key server without delay or  
   logistical issues.

   "appears" either as a local key media (e.g., USB stick or smart  
   card) to desktop applications, or as a Web-service key media to any  
   Web application. 
 
   The server must present itself to the application as a standard key  
   media using middleware that is compatible with the application.   
   Such middleware is typically based on either a PKCS#11, CAPI,  
   OASIS DSS Web Service, or other Web service interface like ASSP. 
 
 
 
 
Marchioni & Itzhaki             Informational                  [Page 6] 
 
Internet-Draft   Digital Signature System Deployment  30 September 2008 
 
 
   The functions normally provided by a software token, public-key  
   smart card or USB stick, (i.e., secure key generation, key storage,  
   signature operation, certificate storage, etc.) are provided by  
   the network-attached server via the middleware interfaces indicated  
   above. 
 
2.2.2. Signature and Verification Process.  Documents (or data) can be  
   hashed on the user's computer, this results in significant  
   savings of network bandwidth as compared to sending entire documents  
   to the server to be hashed.  At the initiation of a signature  
   operation, an authenticated SSL/TLS session is established between  
   the user's computer and the server.  A SSL/TLS session is  
   established only after the user (i.e., the signer) has been  
   authenticated by answering an identity challenge.  The secure  
   session provides confidentiality and integrity for the hash sent to  
   the server, and for the signature block and certificate returned to  
   the user's application.  The signature block and certificate are  
   then embedded in the document.  When the signature needs to be  
   validated all that is needed is the signed document and the  
   application software to calculate signature verification. 
 
2.2.3. User Authentication.  A number of options for identity challenge  
   may be considered.  To avoid disruption in pre-existing user  
   authentication policy and infrastructure, the options include:  
   (a) Kerberos SSO,(b) simple username/password-PIN, and (c) the  
   following two-factor authentication options: (i) RADIUS [REF] or  
   DIAMETER [REF] protocol with one-time password token, (ii)  
   challenge-response protocol with identity smart card, and (iii)  
   biometrics.  Therefore, the organization can choose a level of user- 
   authentication security that matches the requirements of their  
   application, but nothing less secure than what is needed is made  
   available under the deployment. 
 
2.2.4. Middleware and Programmatic Interfaces.  Standard  
   interfaces allow deployments to cost-effectively dovetail  
   digital signature capabilities into pre-existing as well as new  
   applications, and identity-management infrastructures.  Another  
   advantage of standard interfaces is allowing for one vendor's  
   solution to be replaced by a solution from another vendor with less  
   disruption, eliminating vendor lock. 
 
   The deployment also considers what is familiar to end-users in  
   terms of visual indication of a signature.  Therefore, there is  
   consideration for a one-time capture and centrally stored  
   handwritten graphical signature image (e.g., from an electronic- 
   signature-pad or ePen interface, or by loading the image from  
   a .jpg or .bmp file) for placement with every digital signature.   
   This approach provides an added visual convenience to end users, and  
   encourages user adoption and routine use of standard digital  
   signatures.

Internet-Draft   Digital Signature System Deployment  30 September 2008 
 
 
   When needed, middleware with standard and application-compatible  
   APIs and Web services can provide the following functions for  
   customized signature-enabled application development: 
 
      o Sign/validate signatures in application-specific document  
        types;  
      o Sign/validate a single file or data buffer;  
      o Check certificate validity;  
      o Enumerate/manage certificates;  
      o Manage graphical electronic signatures;  
      o Manage users. 
 
 
3.  Security Considerations. 
 
   The overall risk to a business process must be assessed and balanced  
   with scalability objectives before defining procedures or choosing  
   security-technology mechanisms.  The goal is to deliver the needed  
   level of security from a business-needs perspective, but not less  
   (i.e., lowering security), or more (i.e., driving up costs),  
   resulting in a deployment that matches what is required. 
 
   The trust or security of any deployment is based first and foremost  
   on a documented operating procedure for user enrollment, identity,  
   and authentication management.  An equally important security  
   consideration is the proper training of the stakeholders (e.g.,  
   systems administrators, security officers, and users).  If a  
   stakeholder deviates from established procedure either because  
   he/she is poorly trained or does so intentionally, they may defeat  
   many security-technology countermeasures. 
 
   Time sources for document and certificate signing are provided  
   by the internal domain or an external source.  Some external time  
   sources provide a higher reliability and level of trust, however,  
   they carry a cost overhead that may not be tolerable for all  
   businesses.  Trust in internal-domain time sources can be increased  
   through management policy and security mechanisms.  Policy and  
   security mechanisms can prohibit the use of PCs as time sources,  
   and prevent tampering with clocks.  An effective option for raising  
   confidence in internal-domain time source is the clock of a FIPS- 
   evaluated secure key server.  Since keys are securely accessed for  
   signature operations, time stamps can be provided from this  
   protected source from within the domain. 
 
   Concerning user authentication, simple user name and password  
   schemes provide less security than two-factor schemes like one-time  
   password tokens, identity smart cards, or biometrics.  Furthermore,  
   server-based user authentication is generally viewed as more secure  
   because servers can be less vulnerable to trojan-horse or virus  
   software than the typical user's PC.

   Hardware protection for keys can be provided at various levels  
   depending on the requirements of the business or the value of its  
   transactions.  For example, key servers that have been evaluated for  
   FIPS 140-2 level 3 and smart cards provide hardware protection  
   for keys.  The designers of such hardware consider such scenarios  
   in which hardware might fall into the hands of an attacker, or user  
   keys might be exposed to a systems administrator.  As a precaution  
   countermeasures are built into their respective key-protection  
   hardware. 
 
 
4.  Conclusion. 
 
   Affordable and scalable PKI deployment strategies are needed.  This  
   alternative approach emphasizes consideration for pre-existing user- 
   management, authentication, and application infrastructures and  
   offers more access to PKI than conventional methods.
