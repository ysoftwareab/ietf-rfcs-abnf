Abstract

   This document describes the NIS service type. NIS is a naming
   service which serves as a repository for UNIX-style system
   information. This service type can be used to dynamically discover
   NIS servers.

1. Introduction

   NIS stands for Network Information Service, and was formerly known as
   YP. It uses ONC RPC [1] as its transport mechanism. This document
   describes a template providing a service: URL and attributes useful
   for dynamically discovering NIS+ servers; this type can be used with
   SLP [2]. Service templates and service: schemes are defined in [3].

   This type is intended to be used as a concrete portion of the
   abstract naming-directory type defined in [4]. The NIS type
   includes all attributes from the naming-directory abstract type.

   For usage examples, refer to [4].

Names of submitters: Jonathan Wood <jonathan.wood@eng.sun.com>
                     Roberto Tam <roberto.tam@eng.sun.com>
Language of service template: en
Security Considerations:
  This NIS service type inherits the security considerations from the
  naming-directory service type [4].

Template text:
-------------------------template begins here-----------------------
template-type=naming-directory:nis

template-version=0.0

template-description=
  This is a concrete type; the abstract type for this service
  is naming-directory (described in [4]). This type is used by
  NIS+ servers to advertise their services and NIS+ clients
  which wish to discover NIS+ servers.

template-url-syntax=
  url-path      = "nis://" addr "/" domain
  addr          = ipv4-addr
  domain        = string / string "." domain
  ipv4-addr     = 1*3DIGIT 3( "." 1*3DIGIT )
  string        = ISO Latin 1 character set except the
                  character '/' (slash). The initial character
                  may not be a terminal character or the
                  characters '@' (at), '+' (plus), or (`-')
                  hyphen.
