3.  Abstract

This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS accounting
server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Management
Information  Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based management stations
can manage RADIUS accounting servers.

4.  Introduction

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in  the  Internet  community.   In
particular,  it  describes  managed  objects  used  for  managing RADIUS
accounting servers.

RADIUS accounting servers are today widely deployed by  dialup  Internet
Service Providers, in order to provide accounting services. As a result,
the effective management of RADIUS accounting servers is of considerable
importance.


5.  The SNMP Management Framework

The   SNMP   Management  Framework  presently  consists  of  five  major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for  the
        purpose  of  management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1  and  described  in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message  protocols  for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1  and
        described  in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol,  is
        called  SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called  SNMPv3  and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol  operations  for  accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU  formats  is
        described  in  RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the  view-based  access  control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management  Information  Base  or  MIB.   Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

INTERNET-DRAFT        RADIUS Accounting Server MIB       2 February 1999


This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A  MIB
conforming  to  the  SMIv1  can  be  produced  through  the  appropriate
translations.  The  resulting  translated  MIB  must   be   semantically
equivalent,  except  where  objects  or  events  are  omitted because no
translation is  possible  (use  of  Counter64).  Some  machine  readable
information  in  SMIv2  will  be  converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However,  this  loss  of  machine
readable  information  is  not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


6.  Overview

The RADIUS accounting protocol, described in [16], distinguishes between
the  client  function  and  the  server  function. In RADIUS accounting,
clients send Accounting-Requests, and  servers  reply  with  Accounting-
Responses.   Typically  NAS  devices  implement the client function, and
thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS  accounting  client  MIB,
while  RADIUS accounting servers implement the server function, and thus
would be expected to implement the RADIUS accounting server MIB.

However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to  perform  both
client  and  server  functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a
server to one or more RADIUS accounting  clients,  while  simultaneously
acting  as  an  accounting client to one or more accounting servers.  In
such situations, it is expected that RADIUS  entities  combining  client
and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.


6.1.  Selected objects

This MIB module contains thirteen scalars as well as a single table:

(1)  the RADIUS Accounting Client Table contains one row for each
     RADIUS accounting client that the server shares a secret with.

Each entry in the RADIUS Accounting Client Table includes eleven columns
presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS accounting server.

9.  Security considerations

There  are management objects (radiusAccServConfigReset) defined in this
MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS  clause  of  read-write  and/or  read-create.
Such  objects  may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments.   The  support  for  SET  operations   in   a   non-secure
environment  without  proper  protection  can  have a negative effect on
network operations.

There are a number of managed objects  in  this  MIB  that  may  contain
sensitive information. These are:




Zorn & Aboba                  Informational                    [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT        RADIUS Accounting Server MIB       2 February 1999


radiusAccClientAddress
          This  can  be  used  to  determine  the  address of the RADIUS
          accounting client with  which  the  server  is  communicating.
          This  information could be useful in impersonating the client.

radiusAccClientID
          This can be used to determine the client ID for the accounting
          client   with   which   the   server  is  communicating.  This
          information could be useful in impersonating the client.

It is thus important to control even GET access  to  these  objects  and
possibly  to  even  encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of  SNMP  provide  features
for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network itself
is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on
the    secure    network    is    allowed    to   access   and   GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the  security  features
as  provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and  the  View-based  Access  Control
Model  RFC  2275  [15]  is  recommended.  Using these security features,
customer/users can give access to the objects only to  those  principals
(users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete)
them.
