Abstract

   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a signaling protocol which adds a
   new layer between the traditional Transport and Network layer.  HIP
   is an end-to-end authentication and key exchange protocol, which
   supports security and mobility in a commendable manner.  The HIP base
   specification is genralized and purported to support different key

   exchange mechanisms in order to provide confidentiality protection
   for the subsequent data traffic.  In some cases it might not be
   desirable to establish IPsec security associations for protection of
   media traffic.  This draft explains how keying material and
   parameters for usage with the Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) can be
   established using HIP.

Internet-Draft    Using SRTP transport format with HIP      October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [I-D.ietf-hip-base] provides a way
   to separate the dual role of IP (end point identifier and locator) by
   adding a new layer between the traditional Network and Transport
   layer.  This separation helps the end host to achieve mobility,
   furthermore, HIP provides better security features (like end-to-end
   authentication, confidentiality for the data traffic etc) than other
   multi6 proposals [I-D.ietf-hip-multi6].

   HIP is based on public key cryptography.  All HIP hosts have a
   public/private key pair.  HIP introduces a new name space called Host
   Identity.  It is nothing but the public key of an asymmetric key
   pair.  It provides a rapid exchange of host identities (public keys)
   between communicating hosts and (optionally) establishes IPsec SAs to
   protect subsequent data traffic.  It is a four-way handshake
   protocol, which supports end-to-end authentication and the data
   traffic may experience IPsec ESP encapsulation.

   Transport connections and security associations between the
   communicating HIP hosts are bound to the HITs and IP addresses are
   used for routing purposes only.  Therefore, changes to IP addresses
   do not change the connections or associations.  So, when any of the
   peers move (mobility scenarios), it uses a readdressing mechanism to
   update the current location of the peer, thereby supporting mobility
   in a seamless manner.

   The HIP base exchange provides mutual authentication of the hosts,
   but does not specify any mechanism for protecting data packets.
   [I-D.ietf-hip-esp] draft proposes a way to use IPsec ESP format with
   HIP.

   Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) is a profile for Real Time Protocol
   (RTP), which provides a framework for providing encryption,
   integrity, message authentication, confidentiality and protection
   against replay attacks for the real-time data traffic.

   SRTP mandates the use of a external key management protocol to
   exchange keys and cryptographic parameters, which are used to derive
   keys (like cipher suites, random number etc.,).  This draft proposes
   a way to exchange the SRTP relevant parameters during the HIP base
   exchange.  Besides this, we inherited the key derivation procedure of
   SRTP to show how the keys will be manipulated and maintained for the
   data traffic.  Appendix A describes one possible use case to support
   this document.

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 3 explains the
   revised base exchange, Section 4 explains the rekeying scenario,

   Section 5 presents the packet format and Section 6 explains the key
   derivation, and future work.

   This document was developed in the context of investigating the
   benefits of using HIP for SIP.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This draft uses the terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-hip-base] and
   [RFC3261].

   The term MKI, an optionl parameter, refers to Master Key Identifier
   used in SRTP packets.

3.  Goal

   The HIP base exchange is used to set up a HIP association between two
   hosts.  The base exchange provides two-way host authentication and
   key material generation, but it does not provide any means for
   protecting data communication between the hosts.  In this document,
   we specify the use of SRTP for protecting user data traffic after the
   HIP base exchange.  Note that we did not consider the key management
   issues in this draft.

   To facilitate the use of SRTP, the HIP base exchange messages require
   some minor additions to the parameters transported.  In the R1
   packet, the responder adds the possible KEYING Parameter before
   sending it to the Initiator.  The Initiator gets the proposed
   transforms, selects one of those proposed transforms, and adds it to
   the I2 packet in the corresponding KEYING Parameter.

   In this context, the goal of our proposal is to,

   o  define new parameter exchange for the relevant SRTP parameters.

   o  define the relevant packets structure and parameters.

4.  The Protocol

   In this section, the protocol for setting up an SRTP association to
   be used with HIP association is described.

4.1.  SRTP in HIP

4.1.1.  Setting up an SRTP Association

   Setting up an SRTP Association between hosts using HIP consists of
   two messages passed between the hosts.  The parameters are included
   in R1 and I2 messages during base exchange.


    Initiator                              Responder
                        I1
   ---------------------------------->
        R1:    T,  KEYING PARAMS
   <----------------------------------
        I2:   T, KEYING PARAMS
   ---------------------------------->
           R2
   <----------------------------------

   The integration of HIP and SRTP requires some changes, as mentioned
   earlier, in the HIP parameters.  The changes are (will be) adding,

   T: The timestamp, used mainly to prevent replay attacks.

   KEYING parameter contains

      RAND: Random/pseudo-random byte-string, RAND(nonce) is used as a
      fresh value for the key generation.

      SP: The security policies for the data security protocol. (eg.
      Algorithms and transforms and PRFs supported by the peers).  The
      cipher suites can be negotiated from R1/I2 packet.

      MKI : to identify the Master key and Master salt.

   The R1 message contains the KEYING PARAMS, in which the sending host
   defines the possible Algorithms and transforms, random number and
   optionally MKI it is willing to use for the SRTP association.

   The I2 message contains the response to an KEYING PARAMS received in
   the R1 message.  The sender must select one of the proposed
   transforms from the SP parameter in the R1 message and include the
   selected one in the SP parameter in the I2 packet.  In addition to

Internet-Draft    Using SRTP transport format with HIP      October 2005


   the transform, the host includes the RAND parameter, containing the
   random value (and optionally MKI) to be used as a salt by the peer
   host.  In the R2 message, HIP exchange is finalized.

4.1.2.  Rekeying

   Rekeying can be supported using the UPDATE packet of HIP.  The peer
   which wants to rekey should use the UPDATE packet with the
   appropriate parameters.  The mechanism is explained below:


   Initiator                                               Responder

       UPDATE: KEYING PARAMS [, DIFFIE_HELLMAN]
   ----------------------------------------------->
        UPDATE: KEYING PARAMS [, DIFFIE_HELLMAN]
   <-----------------------------------------------
                           Fig 2:Rekeying mechanism


   Figure 2 depicts the rekeying scenario.  Here, assume that the
   Initiator wants to rekey after the Initial exchange.  It can send the
   rekeying parameters in the Update packet.  The same mechanism is
   followed here, the Initiator chooses its Diffie-Hellmann value and
   sends it to the Responder.  It may send a new MKI value to identify
   the incoming packet.

   The other parameters are explained in [I-D.ietf-hip-base].  The
   Responder checks the return routability by sending the Update seq
   message containing its Diffie-Hellmann value and relevant parameters
   for the rekeying.  After receiving the packet, the Initiator sends
   the ACK thereby both the peers concluding the rekeying procedure and
   now, both of the peers expect to receive the traffic in the new
   keying material.

5.  Parameter and Packet Formats

   This section explains the relationship between the SRTP and KEYING
   parameter and presents the proposed packet format.

   Master Key - derived from Diffie-Hellmann value

   Master Salt - RAND in the KEYING parameter

   MKI - Master Key Identifier

   Master Key and its length - obtained from Diffie-Hellmann key
   exchange

   Session keys are derived using Master key, Master salt and SP and the
   details are up to the key managament protocol.

   As discussed previously, KEYING parameters contains four element:

5.1.  Timestamp

   The timestamp, used mainly to prevent replay attacks.  Like in the
   SRTP packet format a 32-bit value is used to store the timestamp.

5.2.  Pseudo-random byte-string (RAND)

   The RAND or master salt parameter is used as a fresh value for the
   key generation.  The RAND parameter is a 112 bit quantity.

6.  Key management

   This section explains how the key management scheme can be used for
   the data traffic.  After the initial base exchange, both peers have
   the same master key, salt and agreed crypto transforms (including
   pseudo random function).  When the application receives the data
   traffic after the base exchange, an API is invoked and asks the HIP
   daemon for the appropriate key to process the data packet.

   The SRTP based key derivation helps to generate the session keys for
   both peers, so that they have the same keys in possession for
   encrypting/decrypting the incoming packets.  It generates three keys
   namely encryption key to provide confidentiality for the data
   packets, authentication key for providing integrity and salt key for
   the AES counter mode.  For that, it uses the master key, salt and
   crypto transforms together with the packet index.

   Figure 6 depicts the example implementation architecture of the
   proposed mechanism:

                                +------------+
   -------------+   API         | KEY ENGINE |

          Fig 5: Example Implementation Architecture

   Figure 6 depicts the key derivation, for example, when the peer
   receives a packet it gets the packet index, MKI, which is used for
   identifying the relevant master key and transforms.  Then, the key
   derivation function, which is explained below, will generate the
   required keys.

   For single key derivation (key_derivation_rate = 0), we define x for
   later use in calculating keys using PRF and length of PRF bit string
   output like shown in the following table:

   PRF_n (master_key, x)


   For multiple key derivation (key_derivation_rate = 1,2,...2E24)
   x must be calculated according to the following sequence:

   r = index / key_derivation_rate
   (with "/" defines r = 0 for key_derivation_rate = 0)

   with index is a 48-bit concatenation of the 32 bit Roll Over Counter
   (ROC) and the 16 bit sequence number of the SRTP packet given in the
   SRTP header (ROC||SEQ)

   r must be the same length like index, which results in leading zeros.

   Next concatenate an 8-bit label for selecting the usage with r
   key_id = <label> concatenated with r.

   where <label>  is one of the following>
   0x00 for SRTP encryption
   0x01 for SRTP message authentication
   0x02 for SRTP salting key
   0x03 for SRTCP encryption key
   0x04 for SRTCP authentication key
   0x05 for SRTCP salting key

   Finally, x is calculated by performing key_id XOR master_salt,
   where key_id and master_salt are aligned so that their least
   significant bits agree (right-alignment).

7.  Security Considerations

   The initial keying material is generated using using Diffie-Hellman
   procedure.  This document extends the usage of UDPATE packet, defined
   in the base specification, for rekeying.  The hosts may rekey for the
   generation of new keying material using Diffie-Hellman procedure.
   This mechanism enjoys the security protection provided by base
   exchange using HMAC and signature verifications.

   In this approach, we have tried to extend the HIP base exchange to
   support SRTP based key management scheme.  We have listed the
   following security mechanisms that are incorporated with this idea:

      DoS: This approach enjoys the merits of HIP like resisting cpu and
      memory exhaustive DoS attacks by forcing the caller to calculate
      the solution for a cryptographic puzzle.  This provides only a
      basic DoS protection for the callee.

      MitM: HIP uses authenticated Diffie-Hellmann key exchange, which
      prevents the man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

      Eavesdropping : Since the data traffic is encrypted, it is
      unreadable for the attackers.

      Authentication: Both peers are authenticated using asymmetric key
      (signature verification) cryptography assuming that public keys
      can be acquired by secure ways.
