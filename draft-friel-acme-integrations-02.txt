1.  Introduction

   ACME [RFC8555] defines a protocol that a certificate authority (CA)
   and an applicant can use to automate the process of domain name
   ownership validation and X.509 (PKIX) certificate issuance.  The
   protocol is rich and flexible and enables multiple use cases that are
   not immediately obvious from reading the specification.  This
   document explicitly outlines multiple advanced ACME use cases
   including:

   o  ACME integration with EST [RFC7030]

   o  ACME integration with BRSKI
      [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]

   o  ACME integration with BRSKI Default Cloud Registrar
      [I-D.friel-anima-brski-cloud]

   o  ACME integration with TEAP [RFC7170]

   o  ACME integration with TEAP-BRSKI [I-D.lear-eap-teap-brski]

   The integrations with EST, BRSKI (which is based upon EST), and TEAP
   enable automated certificate enrolment for devices.  ACME for
   subdomains [I-D.friel-acme-subdomains] outlines how ACME can be used
   by a client to obtain a certificate for a subdomain identifier from a
   certificate authority where client has fulfilled a challenge against
   a parent domain but does not need to fulfil a challenge against the
   explicit subdomain.  This is a useful optimisation when ACME is used
   to issue certificates for large numbers of devices as it reduces the

   domain ownership proof traffic (DNS or HTTP) and ACME traffic
   overhead, but is not a necessary requirement.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   o  BRSKI: Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures
      [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]

   o  CA: Certificate Authority

   o  CMC: Certificate Management over CMS

   o  CSR: Certificate Signing Request

   o  EST: Enrollment over Secure Transport [RFC7030]

   o  FQDN: Fully Qualified Domain Name

   o  RA: PKI Registration Authority

   o  TEAP: Tunneled Extensible Authentication Protocol [RFC7170]

3.  ACME Integration with EST

   EST [RFC7030] defines a mechanism for clients to enroll with a PKI
   Registration Authority by sending CMC messages over HTTP.  EST
   section 1 states:

   "Architecturally, the EST service is located between a Certification
   Authority (CA) and a client.  It performs several functions
   traditionally allocated to the Registration Authority (RA) role in a
   PKI."

   EST section 1.1 states that:

   "For certificate issuing services, the EST CA is reached through the
   EST server; the CA could be logically "behind" the EST server or
   embedded within it."

   When the CA is logically "behind" the EST RA, EST does not specify
   how the RA communicates with the CA.  EST section 1 states:

   "The nature of communication between an EST server and a CA is not
   described in this document."

   This section outlines how ACME could be used for communication
   between the EST RA and the CA.  The example call flow leverages
   [I-D.friel-acme-subdomains] and shows the RA proving ownership of a
   parent domain, with individual client certificates being subdomains
   under that parent domain.  This is an optimisation that reduces DNS
   and ACME traffic overhead.  The RA could of course prove ownership of
   every explicit client certificate identifier.

   The call flow illustrates the client calling the EST /csrattrs API
   before calling the EST /simpleenroll API.  This enables the EST
   server to indicate to the client what attributes it expects the
   client to include in the CSR request send in the /simpleenroll API.
   For example, EST servers could use this mechanism to tell the client
   what fields to include in the CSR Subject and Subject Alternative
   Name fields.

4.  ACME Integration with BRSKI

   BRSKI [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] is based upon EST
   [RFC7030] and defines how to autonomically bootstrap PKI trust
   anchors into devices via means of signed vouchers.  EST certificate
   enrollment may then optionally take place after trust has been
   established.  BRKSI voucher exchange and trust establishment are
   based on EST extensions and the certificate enrollment part of BRSKI
   is fully based on EST.  Similar to EST, BRSKI does not define how the
   EST RA communicates with the CA.  Therefore, the mechanisms outlined
   in the previous section for using ACME as the communications protocol
   between the EST RA and the CA are equally applicable to BRSKI.

   The following call flow shows how ACME may be integrated into a full
   BRSKI voucher plus EST enrollment workflow.  For brevity, it assumes
   that the EST RA has previously proven ownership of a parent domain
   and that pledge certificate identifiers are a subdomain of that
   parent domain.  The domain ownership exchanges between the RA, ACME
   and DNS are not shown.  Similarly, not all BRSKI interactions are
   shown and only the key protocol flows involving voucher exchange and
   EST enrollment are shown.

   Similar to the EST section above, the client calls EST /csrattrs API
   before calling the EST /cimpleenroll API.  This enables the server to
   indicate what fields the pledge should include in the CSR that the
   client sends in the /simpleenroll API.

5.  ACME Integration with BRSKI Default Cloud Registrar

   BRSKI Cloud Registrar [I-D.friel-anima-brski-cloud] specifies the
   behaviour of a BRSKI Cloud Registrar, and how a pledge can interact
   with a BRSKI Cloud Registrar when bootstrapping.  Similar to the
   local domain registrar BRSKI flow, ACME can be easily integrated with
   a cloud registrar bootstrap flow.

   BRSKI cloud registrar is flexible and allows for multiple different
   local domain discovery and redirect scenarios.  In the example
   illustrated here, the extension to [RFC8366] Vouchers which is
   defined in [[TODO ID-TBD]] and allows the specification of a
   bootstrap DNS domain is leveraged.  This extension allows the cloud
   registrar to specify the local domain RA that the pledge should
   connect to for the purposes of EST enrollment.

6.  ACME Integration with TEAP

   TEAP [RFC7170] defines a tunnel-based EAP method that enables secure
   communication between a peer and a server by using TLS to establish a
   mutually authenticated tunnel.  TEAP enables certificate provisioning
   within the tunnel.  TEAP does not define how the TEAP server
   communicates with the CA.

   This section outlines how ACME could be used for communication
   between the TEAP server and the CA.  The example call flow leverages
   [I-D.friel-acme-subdomains] and shows the TEAP server proving
   ownership of a parent domain, with individual client certificates
   being subdomains under that parent domain.

   The example illustrates the TEAP server sending a Request-Action TLV
   including a CSR-Attributes TLV instructing the peer to send a CSR-
   Attributes TLV to the server.  This enables the server to indicate
   what fields the peer should include in the CSR that the peer sends in
   the PKCS#10 TLV.  For example, the TEAP server could instruct the
   peer what Subject or SAN entries to include in its CSR.

  +------+                +-------------+           +------+     +-----+
  | Peer |                | TEAP-Server |           | ACME |     | DNS |
  +------+                +-------------+           +------+     +-----+
      |                         |                      |           |

   TEAP-BRSKI [I-D.lear-eap-teap-brski] defines how to execute BRSKI at
   layer 2 inside a TEAP tunnel.  Similar to the TEAP proposal in the
   previous section, BRSKI-TEAP leverages the existing TEAP PKXS#10 and
   PKCS#7 mechanisms for certificate enrollment, and does not define how
   the TEAP server communicates with the CA.

   This section outlines how ACME could be used for communication
   between the TEAP server and the CA, and how this fits in with the
   TEAP-BRSKI proposal.

   Similar to baseline TEAP, the TEAP server can use the CSR-Atributes
   TLV to tell the peer what attributes to include in its CSR request.
