                                Abstract

   This document describes new ECC groups for use in the Internet Key 
   Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocols 
   in addition to previously defined groups.  Specifically, the new 
   curve groups are based on modular arithmetic rather than binary 
   arithmetic.  These new groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 
   with other ECC implementations and standards, particularly NIST 
   standards.  In addition, the curves defined here can provide more 
   efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.

INTERNET-DRAFT       ECP Groups For IKE and IKEv2               May 2006 

 

1.  Introduction

   This document describes default Diffie-Hellman groups for use in 
   IKE and IKEv2 in addition to the Oakley groups included in [IKE] and
   the additional groups defined since [IANA-IKE].  This document 
   assumes that the reader is familiar with the IKE protocol and the 
   concept of Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409 [IKE].

   RFC 2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups - three modular
   exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].  
   One modular exponentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1) is 
   mandatory for all implementations to support, while the other four 
   are optional.  Thirteen additional groups subsequently have been 
   defined and assigned values by IANA.  All of these additional groups
   are optional.  Of the eighteen groups defined so far, eight are MODP
   groups (exponentiation groups modulo a prime) and ten are EC2N groups
   (elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N]).

   The purpose of this document is to expand the options available to 
   implementers of elliptic curve groups by adding three ECP groups 
   (elliptic curve groups modulo a prime).  The reasons for adding such 
   groups include the following.

   - The groups proposed afford efficiency advantages in software 
     applications since the underlying arithmetic is integer arithmetic 
     modulo a prime rather than binary field arithmetic.  (Additional 
     computational advantages for these groups are presented in [GMN].)

   - The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve
     standards.  The proposed groups are among those standardized by 
     NIST, by the SECG, by ISO, and by ANSI.  (See Section 3 for 
     details.)

   - The groups proposed are capable of providing security consistent 
     with the new Advanced Encryption Standard.

   These groups could also be defined using the New Group Mode but
   including them in this RFC will encourage interoperability of IKE
   implementations based upon elliptic curve groups.  In addition, the
   availability of standardized groups will result in optimizations for 
   a particular curve and field size as well as allowing precomputation
   that could result in faster implementations.

   In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve 
   groups in IKE implementations and the need for further alignment with
   other standards, this document defines three elliptic curve groups 
   based on modular arithmetic.

2. Requirements Terminology

   Keywords "MUST" and "SHOULD" that appear in this document are to be 
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3. Additional ECC Groups

   The notation adopted in RFC 2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the
   new groups proposed.

3.3 521-bit Random ECP Group

4. Security Considerations

   Since this document proposes new groups for use within IKE and IKEv2,
   many of the security considerations contained within [IKE] and   
   [IKEv2] apply here as well.

   The groups proposed in this document correspond to the symmetric key 
   sizes 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  This allows the IKE key 
   exchange to offer security comparable with the AES algorithms [AES].

5. Alignment with Other Standards

   The following table summarizes the appearance of these three 
   elliptic curve groups in other standards.

    [ISO-15946-4].


6. IANA Considerations

   Before this document can become an RFC, it is required that IANA 
   update its registries of Diffie-Hellman groups for IKE in [IANA-IKE] 
   and for IKEv2 in [IANA-IKEv2] to include the groups defined above.

   In [IANA-IKE], the groups are to appear as new entries in the list of
   Diffie-Hellman groups given by Group Description (attribute class 4).
   The descriptions are "256-bit random ECP group", "384-bit random ECP 
   group", and "521-bit random ECP group".  In each case, the group type
   (attribute class 5) has the value 2 (ECP, elliptic curve group over 
   GF[P]).

   In [IANA-IKEv2], the groups are to appear as new entries in the list 
   of IKEv2 transform type values for Transform Type 4 (Diffie-Hellman 
   groups).

INTERNET-DRAFT       ECP Groups For IKE and IKEv2               May 2006 

7. ECP Key Exchange Data Formats

   In an ECP key exchange, the Diffie-Hellman public value passed in a 
   KE payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the
   coordinates of an elliptic curve point.  Each component MUST have 
   bit length as given in the following table.

        Diffie-Hellman group                component bit length
        ------------------------            --------------------

        256-bit Random ECP Group                   256
        384-bit Random ECP Group                   384
        521-bit Random ECP Group                   528

   This length is enforced, if necessary, by prepending the value with
   zeros.

   The Diffie-Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x 
   and y values.

   The format of the Diffie-Hellman shared secret value is the same as 
   that of the Diffie-Hellman public value. 


8. Test Vectors

   The following are examples of the IKEv2 key exchange payload for each
   of the three groups specified in this document.

   We denote by g^n the scalar multiple of the point g by the 
   integer n; it is another point on the curve.  In the literature, the 
   scalar multiple is typically denoted ng; the notation g^n is  
   used in order to conform to the notation used in [IKE] and [IKEv2].

8.1 256-bit Random ECP Group 

  It is assumed for this example that this Diffie-Hellman group is 
  assigned the id number 19 by IANA.

  We suppose that the initiator's Diffie-Hellman private key is

  Then the public key is given by  g^i=(gix,giy) where 

gix:

The KEi payload is as follows.

  Then the public key is given by  g^r=(grx,gry) where 

grx:

The KEr payload is as follows.

 00000048 00130000 D12DFB52 89C8D4F8 1208B702 70398C34 2296970A 0BCCB74C

 53E74F33 039872AB

These are concatenated to form 

g^ir:
 D6840F6B 42F6EDAF D13116E0 E1256520 2FEF8E9E CE7DCE03 812464D0 4B9442DE
 522BDE0A F0D8585B 8DEF9C18 3B5AE38F 50235206 A8674ECB 5D98EDB2 0EB153A2

This is the value which is used in the formation of SKEYSEED.


8.2 384-bit Random ECP Group 

  It is assumed for this example that this Diffie-Hellman group is 
  assigned the id number 20 by IANA.

  We suppose that the initiator's Diffie-Hellman private key is
