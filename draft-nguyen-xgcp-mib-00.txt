Abstract

    This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management 
Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the 
Internet community. In particular, this proposal specifies a new 
XGCP-MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMI. 
The set of its objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and other 
existing SNMP standards.

1.0	Introduction

    A management system contains: several (potentially many) nodes, 
each with a processing entity, termed the agent, which has access to 
management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a 
management protocol, used to convey management information between the 
agents and management stations. Operations of the protocol are carried 
out under an administrative framework which define authentication, 
authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

Management stations execute management applications which monitor and 
control managed elements. Managed elements are devices such as hosts, 
routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled via 
access to their management information.

Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, 
residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management 
Information Base (MIB). Collections of related objects are defined in 
MIB modules. These modules are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract 
Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1], termed the Structure of Management 
Information (SMI) [2].

This document is the MIB module which defines managed objects for 
managing implementations of the External Media Gateway Control Protocol 
such as SGCP [3] and MGCP [4]. SGCP/MGCP is a protocol used between 
a Media Gateway Controller and a Media Gateway in a VoIP network,
where the Media Gateway Controller uses SGCP/MGCP to control 
the media gateway connected through an IP network. In the SGCP/MGCP 
model, call control intelligence resides in the Media Gateway Controller
and outside of the media gateway.

3.0     The SNMP Network Management Framework

    The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of three major 
    components.  They are:

    1. STD 16/RFC 1155 [5] which defines the SMI, the mechanism used 
       for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  
       STD 16/RFC 1212 [8] defines a more concise description mechanism,

Expires JULY 1999                                              [Page  2]        

INTERNET-DRAFT                  XGCP-MIB                 JANUARY 15,1999

       which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

    2. RFC 1156 [6] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
       for the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 [9] defines
       MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience 
       and new operational requirements.

    3. STD 15/RFC 1157 [7] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
       network access to managed objects.

    The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of 
    experimentation and evaluation.

3.1     Object Definitions

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
    defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
    defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an 
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object 
    type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify 
    a specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we 
    often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the 
    object type.

4.0     Overview

4.1     Tables

4.1.1	Message Statistics Table

    The message statistics information table - This table is used  
    for SGCP/MGCP message statistics since reset. The IP Address   
    will be used as an index for this table.

    Message statistics entry in the table is per IP Address.

4.1.2	Capability Package Table

    The Capability Package table - This table is used to specify
    the availability of the packages.      

    The Capabality Package Name is used as the index for the table.

4.2 	Objects

    This MIB module contains new objects for managing timeout 
    values, maximum waiting delay, restart timer for restart 
    process, request retry counter, package capability, IP  
    Address and Domain Name of the default MGC, packet loss 
    threshold, quality alert thresholds. Trap for protocol shutdown 
    or bring-up is provided.

7.0	Security Considerations

    This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information 
    related to External Media Gateway Control (SGCP/MGCP).  There are 
    also objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write 
    and/or read-create, such as those which allow an administrator to 
    dynamically configure protocol information.  While unauthorized 
    access to the readable objects is relatively innocuous, unauthorized
    access to the write-able objects can cause a denial of service, or
    can cause unauthorized creation and/or manipulation of the 
    protocols. Hence, the support for SET operations in a non-secure 
    environment without proper protection can have a negative effect 
    on network operations.

    It is recommended that the designers consider the security features 
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the

INTERNET-DRAFT                  XGCP-MIB                 JANUARY 15,1999

    User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [17] and the View-based Access 
    Control Model RFC 2275 [16] is recommended.

    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
    entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give 
    access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have 
    legitimate rights to access them.
