Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism to address the address ownership
   problem as well as the trust relationship between different nodes in
   the mobile IPv6 network.  A mechanism integrating the Identity Based

1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] are IPv6
   addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by
   computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and
   auxiliary parameters.  The protection works without a certification
   authority or any security infrastructure.  A signed message from the
   CGA only guarantees that somebody owns this certain IPv6 address and
   the very message is coming from the address owner.  But the receiver
   can never tell whether it trust the owner of this IPv6 address
   without any kind of certification authority.

   The main problem of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) are that it may
   result in a long chain of certifications and the strong
   responsibility of the certification authority (CA) has scared many
   potential customers.  The Identity Based Cryptosystem (IBC) is a good
   substitution for PKI.  It was first proposed by Shamir in 1984
   [Shamir], and the first fully practical and secure identity-based
   public key encryption scheme was presented by D. Boneh and M.
   Franklin in [IBC].  Since then, a rapid development of Identity based
   cryptosystem has taken place.

   In this document, we propose a mechanism integrating the IBC and CGA.
   The proposed mechanism solves the problem of:

    o  Address Ownership problem: to assert that the address is owned by
       somebody and the message is coming from the address owner from
       the merit of CGA;

    o  Trust relationship problem: with Identity based cryptosystem, the
       message receiver makes sure that the message is coming from an
       entity trusted by a third party (the Key Distribution Center,
       KDC).

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The following new terminology and abbreviations are introduced in
   this document and all the other general mobility related terms as
   defined in [IBC]

   Identity Based Cryptosystem (IBC)

      An Identity Based Cryptosystem is a cryptosystem in which the
      public key is retrieved from an identity of the entity, and the
      private key is securely distributed by the Key Distribution
      Center.

   Key Distribution Center (KDC)

      The Key Distribution Center (KDC) receives the registration
      request from any valid entity, and distributes the corresponding
      private key to the entity.

   IBC-ID

      An identity used by the entity in the IBC system.  Examples of
      IBC-ID include email address, IP address, or any valid identity
      used by the entity.

3.  Overview

   For message senders, the procedure of using the proposed IBC-CGA
   scheme can be summarized as follows:

    1  The mobile node registers on the Key Distribution Center and gets
       a IBC-ID and correspondering private key and public key;

    2  The mobile node configures a CGA address using the procedure
       specified in [RFC3972];

    3  The mobile node signs the message using its private key in the
       Identity base cryptosystem;

    4  The mobile node sends the message out with the IBC-CGA parameters
       containing its IBC-ID.

   The message sender asserts its ownership of the CGA IPv6 address by
   IBC signature and that it is an entity trusted by the Key
   Distribution Center.

   For message receivers, the procedure of using the proposed IBC-CGA
   scheme to assert the address ownership problem and trust relationship
   problem can be summarized as follows:

    1  The receiving mobile node gets the IBC-ID of the sender from the
       IBC-CGA parameter data structure;

    2  The receiving mobile node gets the public key of the sender using
       the method specified in any specific IBC scheme;

    3  The receiving mobile node verifies the validity of the CGA
       address using the procedure specified in [RFC3972];

    4  The receiving mobile node verifies the signature of the message
       using corresponding public key of the sender.

   If all the validations come out successful, the receiving mobile node
   is sure that the message is coming from the owner of the certain IPv6
   address and the sender is a trusted entity.

4.  IBC CGA Parameters

   In [RFC3972], each CGA is associated with a CGA parameter data
   structure.  But in Identity Based Cryptosystem, the public key can be
   retrieved through the IBC-ID, so the IBC CGA parameters MAY only
   contain the IBC Identity which is shown in Figure 1.

5.  Comparison

   A comparison between PKI, CGA, IBC and the proposed IBC-CGA scheme is
   present in Figure 2.

   Note that the Certificate Authority (CA) in IBC and IBC-CGA is
   weakened to be the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

6.  Security Considerations

   The main contribution of CGA is that it solves the address ownership
   problem without the help of a certification authority or any security
   infrastructure.  The receiver of a signed message from the CGA can
   tell that the message is from the address owner who owns the public
   key in the CGA parameter data structure.  But unfortunately, CGA does
   not address the trust relationship problem, that is, the receiver of
   the signed message from the CGA cannot tell whether the address owner
   is a trusted entity.  Attackers may self-configure a public and
   private key pair and then configure a CGA address.  If those
   attackers send messages to any entity in the networks, the challenged
   entity will be cheated into communication with the attackers.

   To establish trust relationship between network entities, this
   document proposes a signature mechanism integrating Identity Based
   Cryptosystem with CGA.  In this scheme, every entity MUST register an
   IBC-Identity on the Key Distribution Center and get its public and
   private keys.  The CGA address is computed from the public key in the
   IBC scheme and the message is signed with private key in the IBC
   scheme.  With this IBC-CGA scheme, the receiver of the message can
   tell that the address owner of the CGA address is an entity trusted
   by the KDC.  Compared with PKI, our IBC-CGA scheme does not introduce
   a long chain of certifications and is more efficient and light-
   weighted.
