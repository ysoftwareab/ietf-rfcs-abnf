           Compute Resources for Remote Electron Microscopy		   Abstract
This RFC document envisages the need and necessity in utilizing or
extending the compute resource technologies in such as networking(NW),
remote computing(RC),cloud computing(CC),distributed computing(DC),
Machine Learning(ML) and other related fields of AI to the biological
field of electron microscopy(EC) for use in rapid and timely
identification or diagnosis of virological/bacterial elements in
clinical samples in the current world scenario, within the given
time frame irrespective of the place of origin and with having
geographical presence.Electron microscopy (EM) is a pioneering methodology used in
identification and diagnosing of viral and microbiological elements.
It is able to identify in morphological form the tiniest of the
viruses in minimum amount of time by clinical scientists.Status of This Memo

Problem Statement
In the current world scenario, rapid diagnosis and effective
identification of clinical samples, especially in identification of 
virological elements, has become a challenge due to various factors 
such as lack of equipment, instruments, infrastructure, expertise,
scientific know-how, experienced staff along with other factors 
such as time factor, cost factor, diagnostic reports being error 
prone and above all lack of such facilities in almost all developing 
countries.
Expected Solution
In the proposed solution, we have local screening center fully 
connected remotely using networking and remote computing technologies
with the remote center. The remote screening center (RSC) is fully 
equipped with Electron microscopy and expert staff who will be able 
to view and analyze the images of the clinical samples remotely and
provide the diagnostic results to the local screening center (LSC) 
within the given time frame. The remote screening center may be 
optionally having advanced compute facilities such as distributed
computing (DC), Machine Learning (ML) Image Recognition (IR) and
other related fields of AI. In this scenario, one or more local
screening centers can be connected to one or more Remote Screeningcenters depending on the usage.
