Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2009


1.  Introduction

   As part of the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) work group in the IETF
   a Data Model[I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model] has been created for
   the purpose of modelling conference based services in a standard way.
   The XCON group also requires a standards based mechanism that will
   enable third party conference clients participating to interoperate
   with conference servers and manipulate conference parameters.

   The Media Control (MEDIACTRL) Work Group within the IETF has the
   explicit goal of creating an architecture and framework for
   controlling Media Servers.  As part of this work a Control Channel
   Framework[I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] has been created that is
   based on the Session Initiation protocol (SIP).  It uses SIP to
   setup, maintain and terminate a reliable control channel for the
   purpose of exchanging control based interactions.  The Control
   Framework provides an extension template for creating extensions that
   specify the semantic detail associated with the operations.  The
   extension documents are known as Control Packages and an example is
   the 'Basic IVR Control Package'[I-D.boulton-ivr-control-package].
   This document will specify a Control Package for Conference Control
   by participating clients using the SIP Control Framework.

   The Media Control Channel Framework provides the ideal mechanism for
   reliably exchanging control messages between a conference client and
   server.  It provides inherent properties such as:

   o  Reliable delivery of control messages.
   o  Lightweight Protocol Data Units (PDU).
   o  Linked asynchronous transactional mechanism.
   o  Asynchronous event mechanism.

   The SIP Control Framework uses SIP as its overlying rendezvous
   mechanism.  This provides all the inherent benefits like:

   o  SIP Service Location - Use SIP Proxies or Back-to-Back User Agents
      for discovering Control Servers..
   o  SIP Security Mechanisms - Leverage established security mechanisms
      such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Client Authentication.
   o  Connection Maintenance - The ability to re-negotiate a connection,
      ensure it is active, audit parameters, and so forth.
   o  Agnostic - Allows for ease of extension.

   Not only is the Media Control Channel Framework an ideal mechanism
   for controlling conference instances by participating clients, it
   also provides the property of re-use by conferencing systems of
   functionality implemented for controlling Media Servers etc.  This
   includes re-using the SIP stack for control channel setup as well as

   the Control Channel Framework stack for receiving/sending the PDUs
   for multiple control packages in an XCON conference system.

   It should be noted that this mechanism is a complementary technology
   to that specified in the document 'A Centralized Conferencing
   Manipulation Protocol (CCMP)'[I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  In fact this
   specification simply re-uses the XML payload created in that document
   for a consistent view (so just the transport mechanism is different).
   While the mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp] is ideal for
   certain network deployments (for example Service Orientated
   Architectures), it is important to offer an alternative access method
   for clients with non SOA based technologies.  Using the SIP Control
   Framework provides consistency across both XCON and MEDIACTRL work
   groups.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in the framework and
   data model for centralized conferencing [I-D.ietf-xcon-framework].
   In addition, the following acronyms and terms are used in this
   document:

   SOAP:  Simple Object Access Protocol.
   WSDL:  Web Services Description Language.  WSDL is an XML format for
      describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on
      messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented
      information.


4.  Overview

   The use of the Media Control Channel Framework offers an ideal
   mechanism for creating, deleting and manipulating XCON conference
   instances by participating clients.  As the Control Channel Framework
   is a generic mechanism, this section provides non-normative detail
   showing how the Control Channel Framework can be applied to this
   particular use-case.  In [I-D.ietf-xcon-framework], two distinct
   roles are defined - A 'Control Client' and a 'Control Server'.  Such

   roles are interchangeable between entities within a session depending
   on package requirements.  A simple diagram is illustrated in Figure 1

   The XCON Conference Control package will cast a participating XCON
   compliant User Agent that wishes to control a conference instance as
   a 'Control Client' as defined in the SIP Control Framework.  It will
   have permission to generate and issue commands in CONTROL messages as
   defined in Section 5.2 of this document.  It will also have the
   ability to receive responses to Conference Package CONTROL requests
   that are contained in either appropriate responses or subsequent
   REPORT messages, also specified in Section 5.2.  The specific format
   of the conference control messages and responses are defined in
   Section 5.4 and Section 5.5.  They re-use the format specified in
   CCMP[I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  This provides a common binding set with
   alternative access mechanism depending on client requirements.  The
   previous diagram can be updated as illustrated in Figure 2.

   Editor's Note: The Overview section will be expanded in later
   versions of the document.


5.  Control Package Detail

   The Media Control Channel Framework defines rules that Control
   Package extensions must provide mandatory information as described in
   section 10 of [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework].  This section
   fulfils the obligation.

5.1.  Control Package Name

   The SIP Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique package name.  The name and version of
   this Control Package is "xcon-conf-control/1.0".

5.2.  Framework Message Usage

   The Conference Control package uses the XML schema defined in
   CCMP[I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  To maintain the consistency with the
   design of the XML schema, the SIP Control Framework messages will be
   applied in a similar manner.  The CONTROL message will be used to
   contain requests that enable conference manipulation - as specified
   in Section 5.4 and can only travel from the client to a Conferencing
   System.  Responses, as specified in Section 5.5, can only travel from
   the Conferencing System to an expectant client.  Depending on the
   time it takes to process the request (as specified in
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]), responses can either be
   contained in a Control Framework 200 response or subsequent REPORT
   method.

5.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 16.1 of
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] MUST NOT be supported for media
   dialogs and conferences.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: This document could make use of the Conf common schema
   TBD.

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2009


5.4.  Control Message Bodies

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the XML schema defined
   in [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  To be precise, the CONTROL message body
   MUST comply only to the 'ccmp-request-type' complexType.

5.5.  REPORT Message Bodies

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the XML schema defined
   in [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  To be precise, the REPORT message body MUST
   comply only to the 'ccmp-response-type' complexType.

5.6.  Examples

   TODO


6.  IANA Considerations

   TODO


7.  Security Considerations

   Access to conference control functionality needs to be tightly
   controlled to avoid attackers disrupting conferences, adding
   themselves to conferences or engaging in theft of services.

   The Framework for Centralized Conferencing [I-D.ietf-xcon-framework]
   specifies that the protocols used for manipulation and retrieval of
   confidential information MUST support a confidentiality and integrity
   mechanism.  To support the confidentiality and integrity
   requirements, all conference control information included in the
   package defined in this document SHOULD be carried over TLS.

   Editor's Note: once the security requirements for the control
   packages are further specified in the Control Framework for SIP
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] additional information may be
   added to this section.

   There are also security issues associated with the authorization to
   perform actions on the conferencing system to invoke specific
   capabilities.  Implementers MUST deploy appropriate authentication
   and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized entities
   are able to manipulate the data.
