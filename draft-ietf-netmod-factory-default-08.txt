                  draft-ietf-netmod-factory-default-08

Abstract

   This document defines a method to reset a server to its factory-
   default content.  The reset operation may be used, e.g., when the
   existing configuration has major errors so re-starting the
   configuration process from scratch is the best option.

   A new factory-reset RPC is defined.  When resetting a datastore, all
   previous configuration settings will be lost and replaced by the
   factory-default content.

   A new optional "factory-default" read-only datastore is defined, that
   contains the data that will be copied over to the running datastore
   at reset.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method to reset a server to its factory-
   default content.  The reset operation may be used, e.g., when the
   existing configuration has major errors so re-starting the
   configuration process from scratch is the best option.

   A factory-reset RPC is defined.  When resetting a datastore, all
   previous configuration settings will be lost and replaced by the
   factory-default content.

   A "factory-default" read-only datastore is defined, that contains the
   data to replace the contents of implemented read-write conventional
   configuration datastores at reset.  This datastore can also be used
   in <get-data> operation.

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting           December 2019


   NETCONF defines the <delete-config> RPC operation, but that only acts
   on the <startup-datastore>, whereas the <factory-reset> RPC operation
   can perform additional changes to the device to fully reset the
   device back to a factory-default state

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] [RFC7950] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  server

   o  startup configuration datastore

   o  candidate configuration datastore

   o  running configuration datastore

   o  intended configuration datastore

   o  operational state datastore

   o  conventional configuration datastore

   o  RPC operation

   The following terms are defined in this document as follows:

   o  factory-default datastore: A read-only configuration datastore
      holding a preconfigured minimal initial configuration that can be
      used to initialize the configuration of a server.  The content of
      the datastore is usually static, but MAY depend on external
      factors like available HW.

2.  Factory-Reset RPC

   A new "factory-reset" RPC is introduced.  Upon receiving the RPC





Wu, et al.                Expires June 6, 2020                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting           December 2019


   o  All supported conventional read-write configuration datastores
      (i.e. <running>, <startup>, and <candidate>) are all reset to the
      contents of <factory-default>.

   o  Read-only datastores receive their content from other
      datastores(e.g. <intended> gets its content from <running>).

   o  All data in any ephemeral datastores MUST be discarded.

   o  The contents of the <operational> datastore MUST be reset back to
      an appropriate factory-default state.

   In addition, the "factory-reset" RPC MUST restore storage to factory
   condition, including remove log files, remove temporary files (from
   datastore or elsewhere).  It MUST also remove security credentials
   and restoring default security settings including remove
   certificates, keys, zero passwords, etc.  The process invoked by the
   "factory-reset" RPC SHOULD zero/pattern-write than remove sensitive
   files such as the TLS keys, configuration stores, etc.  The "factory-
   reset" RPC MAY also be used to trigger some other resetting tasks
   such as restarting the node or some of the software processes, which
   are especially needed after having onboard information being
   processed or when a specified boot image needs to be
   downloaded,verified and installed.

3.  Factory-Default Datastore

   Following guidelines for defining Datastores in the appendix A of
   [RFC8342], this document introduces a new optional datastore resource
   named 'factory-default' that represents a preconfigured minimal
   initial configuration that can be used to initialize the
   configuration of a server.  A device MAY only implement the <factory-
   reset> RPC without implementing the 'factory-default' datastore,
   which make it lose the ability to see what configuration the device
   would be reset back to.

   o  Name: "factory-default"

   o  YANG modules: all

   o  YANG nodes: all "config true" data nodes

   o  Management operations: The content of the datastore is set by the
      server in an implementation dependent manner.  The content can not
      be changed by management operations via NETCONF, RESTCONF,the CLI
      etcunless specialized, dedicated operations are provided.  The
      datastore can be read using the standard NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol
      operations.  The <factory- reset> operation copies the factory

      default content to <running> and, if present, <startup> and then
      the content of these datastores is propagated automatically to any
      other read only datastores, e.g., <intended> and <operational>.

   o  Origin: This document does not define a new origin identity as it
      does not interact with <operational> datastore.

   o  Protocols: RESTCONF, NETCONF and other management protocol.

   o  Defining YANG module: "ietf-factory-default".

   The datastore content is usually defined by the device vendor.  It is
   usually static, but MAY change e.g., depending on external factors
   like HW available or during device upgrade.

   The contents of <factory-default> MUST persist across device
   restarts.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].
   The following registration has been made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default


      Registrant Contact: The IESG.


      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   Registry [RFC6020].  The following registration has been made:

      name: ietf-factory-default


      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-factory-default


      prefix: fd


      RFC: xxxx

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document extends the base operations
   for NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The <factory-reset> RPC operation may be considered sensitive in some
   network enviroments,e.g., remote access to reset the device or
   overwrite security sensitive information in one of the other
   datastores, e.g. running, therefore it is important to restrict
   access to this RPC using the standard access control methods.
   [RFC8341]

Internet-Draft           Factory Default Setting           December 2019


   The 'factory-reset' RPC can prevent any further management of the
   device if the session and client config is included in the factory-
   reset contents.

   The operational disruption caused by setting the config to factory-
   reset contents varies greatly depending on the implementation and
   current config.
