<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document specifies, abstractly, how to interface
		applications and transport protocols with IPsec so as to
		create "channels" by latching "connections" (packet
		flows) to certain IPsec Security Association (SA)
		parameters for the lifetime of the connections.
		Connection latching is layered on top of IPsec and does
		not modify the underlying IPsec architecture.
</p>
<p>Connection latching can be used to protect applications
		against accidentally exposing live packet flows to
		unintended peers, whether as the result of a
		reconfiguration of IPsec or as the result of using weak
		peer identity to peer address associations.  Weak
		association of peer ID and peer addresses is at the core
		of Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS), thus connection
		latching can add a significant measure of protection to
		BTNS IPsec nodes.
</p>
<p>Finally, the availability of IPsec channels will make it
		possible to use channel binding to IPsec channels.

Introduction</h3>

<p>IPsec protects packets with little or no regard for
		stateful packet flows associated with upper layer
		protocols (ULPs).  This exposes applications that rely
		on IPsec for session protection to risks associated with
		changing IPsec configurations, configurations that allow
		multiple peers access to the same addresses, and/or weak
		association of peer IDs and their addresses.  The latter
		can occur as a result of "wildcard" matching in the
		IPsec Peer Authorization Database (PAD), particularly
		when Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS) <a class='info' href='#RFC5387'>[RFC5387]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Touch, J., Black, D., and Y. Wang, &ldquo;Problem and Applicability Statement for Better-Than-Nothing Security (BTNS),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>
		is used.
</p>
<p>Applications that wish to use IPsec may have to ensure
		that local policy on the various end-points is
		configured appropriately <a class='info' href='#I-D.bellovin-useipsec'>[I&#8209;D.bellovin&#8209;useipsec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bellovin, S., &ldquo;Guidelines for Specifying the Use of IPsec Version 2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#I-D.dondeti-useipsec-430x'>[I&#8209;D.dondeti&#8209;useipsec&#8209;430x]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dondeti, L. and V. Narayanan, &ldquo;Guidelines for using IPsec and IKEv2,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.  There are no
		standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to do
		this -- a major consequence of which, for example, is
		that applications must still use hostnames (and, e.g.,
		the Domain Name System <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>) and IP
		addresses in existing APIs and must depend on an IPsec
		configuration that they may not be able to verify.  In
		addition to specifying aspects of required Security
		Policy Database (SPD) configuration, application
		specifications must also address PAD/SPD configuration
		to strongly bind individual addresses to individual
		IPsec identities and credentials (certificates, public
		keys, ...).
</p>
<p>IPsec is, then, quite cumbersome for use by applications.
		To address this we need APIs to IPsec.  Not merely APIs
		for configuring IPsec, but also APIs that are similar to
		the existing IP APIs (e.g., "BSD sockets"), so that
		typical applications making use of UDP <a class='info' href='#RFC0768'>[RFC0768]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;User Datagram Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1980.</span><span>)</span></a>, TCP <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> and
		SCTP <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>[RFC4960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> can make
		use of IPsec with minimal changes.
</p>
<p>This document describes the foundation for IPsec APIs
		that UDP and TCP applications can use: a way to bind
		the traffic flows for, e.g., TCP connections to security
		properties desired by the application.  We call these
		"connection latches" (and, in some contexts, "IPsec
		channels").  The methods outlined below achieve this by
		interfacing ULPs and applications to IPsec.
</p>
<p>If widely adopted, connection latching could make
		application use of IPsec much simpler, at least for
		certain classes of applications.
</p>
<p>Connection latching, as specified herein, is primarily
		about watching updates to the SPD and Security
		Association Database (SAD) to detect changes that are
		adverse to an application's requirements for any given
		packet flow, and to react accordingly (such as by
		synchronously alerting the ULP and application before
		packets can be sent or received under the new policy).
		Under no circumstance are IPsec policy databases to be
		modified by connection latching in any way that can
		persist beyond the lifetime of the related packet flows,
		nor reboots.  Under no circumstance is the PAD to be
		modified at all by connection latching.  If all optional
		features of connection latching are excluded then
		connection latching can be implemented as a monitor of
		SPD and SAD changes that intrudes in their workings no
		more than is needed to provide synchronous alerts to
		ULPs and applications.
</p>
<p>We assume the reader is familiar with the IPsec
		architecture <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>[RFC4301]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and IKEv2 <a class='info' href='#RFC4306'>[RFC4306]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Note: the terms "connection latch" and "IPsec channel"
		are used interchangeably below.  The latter term relates
		to "channel binding" <a class='info' href='#RFC5056'>[RFC5056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Williams, N., &ldquo;On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
		Connection latching is suitable for use in channel
		binding applications, or will be, at any rate, when the
		channel bindings for IPsec channels are defined (the
		specification of IPsec channel bindings is out of scope
		for this document).
</p>
<p>Note: where this document mentions IPsec peer "ID" it
		refers to the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) peer ID (e.g.,
		the ID derived from a peer's cert, as well as the cert),
		not the peer's IP address.

Connection Latching</h3>

<p>An "IPsec channel" is a packet flow associated with a ULP
		control block, such as a TCP connection, where all the
		packets are protected by IPsec SAs such that:
		</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the peer's identity is the same for the lifetime
			of the packet flow
</li>
<li>the quality of IPsec protection used for the
			packet flow's individual packets is the same for
			all of them for the lifetime of the packet
			flow
</li>
</ul><p>
	    
</p>
<p>An IPsec channel is created when the associated packet
		flow is created.  This can be the result of a local
		operation (e.g., a connect()) that causes the initial
		outgoing packet for that flow to be sent, or it can be
		the result of receiving the first/initiating packet for
		that flow (e.g., a TCP SYN packet).
</p>
<p>An IPsec channel is destroyed when the associated packet
		flow ends.  An IPsec channel can also be "broken" when
		the connection latch cannot be maintained for some
		reason (see below), in which case the ULP and
		application are informed.
</p>
<p>IPsec channels are created by "latching" various
		parameters listed below to a ULP connection when the
		connections are created.  The REQUIRED set of parameters
		bound in IPsec channels is:
		</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Type of protection: confidentiality and/or
			integrity protection;
</li>
<li>Transport mode vs. tunnel mode;
</li>
<li>Quality of protection (QoP): cryptographic algorithm
			suites, key lengths, and replay protection (see
			<a class='info' href='#qop'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Latching of Quality of 		Protection Parameters</span><span>)</span></a>;
</li>

<p>The SAs that protect a given IPsec channel's packets may
		change over time in that they may expire and be replaced
		with equivalent SAs, or may be re-keyed.  The set of SAs
		that protect an IPsec channel's packets need not be
		related by anything other than the fact that they must
		be congruent to the channel (i.e, the SAs' parameters
		must match those that are latched into the channel).  In
		particular, it is desirable that IPsec channels survive
		the expiration of IKE_SAs and child SAs because
		operational considerations of the various key exchange
		protocols then cannot affect the design and features of
		connection latching.
</p>
<p>When a situation arises in which the SPD is modified, or
		an SA is added to the SAD, such that the new policy or
		SA are not congruent to an established channel (see
		previous paragraph) then we consider this a conflict.
		Conflict resolution is addressed below.
</p>
<p>Requirements and recommendations:
		</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If an IPsec channel is desired then packets for a
			given connection MUST NOT be sent until the
			channel is established.
</li>
<li>If an IPsec channel is desired then inbound
			packets for a given connection MUST NOT be
			accepted until the channel is established.
			I.e., inbound packets for a given connection
			arriving prior to the establishment of the
			corresponding IPsec channel must be dropped or
			the channel establishment must fail.
</li>
<li>Once an IPsec channel is established, packets for
			the latched connection MUST NOT be sent
			unprotected nor protected by an SA that does not
			match the latched parameters.
</li>
<li>Once an IPsec channel is established packets for
			the latched connection MUST NOT be accepted
			unprotected nor protected by an SA that does not
			match the latched parameters.  I.e., such
			packets either must be dropped or must cause the
			channel to be terminated and the application to
			be informed before data from such a packet can
			be delivered to the application.
</li>
<li>Implementations SHOULD provide programming
			interfaces for inquiring the values of the
			parameters latched in a connection.
</li>
<li>Implementations that provide such programming
			interfaces MUST make available to applications
			all relevant and available information about a
			peer's ID, including authentication information.
			This includes the peer certificate, when one is
			used, and the trust anchor that it was validated
			to (but not necessarily the whole certificate
			validation chain).
</li>
<li>Implementations that provide such programming
			interfaces SHOULD make available to applications
			any information about local and/or remote public
			and private IP addresses, in the case of
			NAT-traversal.
</li>
<li>Implementations that provide such programming
			interfaces SHOULD make available to applications
			the inner and outer local and peer addresses
			whenever the latched connection uses tunnel mode
			SAs.
</li>
<li>Implementations SHOULD provide programming
			interfaces for setting the values of the
			parameters to be latched in a connection that
			will be initiated or accepted, but these
			interfaces MUST limit what values applications
			may request according to system policy (i.e.,
			the IPsec PAD and SPD) and the application's
			local privileges.  <br />
<br />

			(Typical system policy may not allow
			applications any choices here.  Policy
			extensions allowing for optional protection are
			described in <a class='info' href='#optional_protection'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Optional 		Protection</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</li>
<li>Implementations SHOULD create IPsec channels
			automatically by default when the application
			does not explicitly request an IPsec
			channel.  Implemenations MAY provide a way to
			disable automatic creation of connection
			latches.
</li>
<li>The parameters latched in an IPsec channel MUST
			remain unchanged once the channel is
			established.
</li>
<li>Timeouts while establishing child SAs with
			parameters that match those latched into an
			IPsec channel MUST be treated as packet loss (as
			happens, for example, when a network
			partitions); normal ULP and/or application
			timeout handling and retransmission
			considerations apply.
</li>
<li>Implementations that have a restartable key
			management process (or "daemon") MUST arrange
			for existing latched connections to either be
			broken and disconnected, or for them to survive
			the restart of key exchange processes.  (This is
			implied by the above requirements.)  For
			example, if such an implementation relies on
			keeping some aspects of connection latch state
			in the restartable key management process (e.g.,
			values that potentially have large
			representations, such as BTNS peer IDs), then
			either such state must be restored on restart of
			such a process, or outstanding connection
			latches must be transitioned to the CLOSED
			state.
</li>
<li>Dynamic IPsec policy (see <a class='info' href='#optional_protection'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Optional 		Protection</span><span>)</span></a>) related to
			connection latches, if any, MUST be torn down
			when latched connections are torn down, and MUST
			NOT survive reboots.
</li>
<li>When IKE dead peer detection (DPD) concludes that
			the remote peer is dead or has rebooted, then
			the system SHOULD consider all connection
			latches with that peer to be irremediably
			broken.
</li>
</ul><p>
	    
</p>
<p>We describe two models, one of them normative, of IPsec
		channels for native IPsec implementations.  The
		normative model is based on abstract programming
		interfaces in the form of function calls between ULPs
		and the key management component of IPsec (basically,
		the SAD, augmented with a Latch Database (LD)).  The
		second model is based on abstract programming interfaces
		between ULPs and the IPsec (Encapsulating Security
		Payload / Authentication Header (ESP/AH)) layer in the
		form of meta-data tagging of packets within the IP
		stack.
</p>
<p>The two models given below are not, however, entirely
		equivalent.  One model cannot be implemented with NICs
		that offload ESP/AH but which do not tag incoming
		packets passed to the host processor with SA
		information, nor allow the host processor to so tag
		outgoing packets.  That same model can be easily
		extended to support connection latching with unconnected
		datagram "sockets", while the other model is rigidly
		tied to a notion of "connections" and cannot be so
		extended.  There may be other minor differences between
		the two models.  Rather than seek to establish
		equivalency for some set of security guarantees we
		instead choose one model to be the normative one.
</p>
<p>We also provide a model for non-native implementations,
		such as bump-in-the-stack (BITS) and Security Gateway
		(SG) implementations.  The connection latching model for
		non-native implementations is not full-featured as it
		depends on estimating packet flow state, which may not
		always be possible.  Nor can non-native IPsec
		implementations be expected to provide APIs related to
		connection latching (implementations that do could be
		said to be native).  As such this third model is not
		suitable for channel binding applications <a class='info' href='#RFC5056'>[RFC5056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Williams, N., &ldquo;On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Latching of Quality of
		Protection Parameters</h3>

<p>In IPsec the assumption of IKE initiator/responder
		    roles is non-deterministic.  That is, sometimes an
		    IKE SA and child SAs will be initiated by the
		    "client" (e.g., the caller of the connect() BSD
		    sockets function) and sometimes by the "server"
		    (e.g., the caller of the accept() BSD sockets
		    function).  This means that the negotiation of
		    quality of protection is also non-deterministic
		    unless one of the peers offers a single
		    cryptographic suite in the IKE negotiation.
</p>
<p>When creating narrow child SAs with traffic selectors
		    matching the connection latch's 5-tuple it is
		    possible to constrain the IKE Quality of Protection
		    negotiation to a single cryptographic suite.
		    Therefore implementations SHOULD provide an API for
		    requesting the use of such child SAs.  Implementors
		    SHOULD consider an application request for a
		    specific QoP to imply a request for narrow child
		    SAs.
</p>
<p>When using SAs with traffic selectors encompassing
		    more than just a single flow then the system may
		    only be able to latch a set of cryptographic suites,
		    rather than a single cryptographic suite.  In such a
		    case an implementation MUST report the QoP being
		    used as indeterminate.

Connection latch state
		machine</h3>

<p>Connection latches can exist in any of the following
		    five states:
		    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>LISTENER
</li>
<li>ESTABLISHED
</li>
<li>BROKEN (there exist SAs which conflict
			    with the given connection latch, conflicting
			    SPD changes have been made, or DPD has been
			    triggered and the peer is considered dead or
			    restarted)
</li>
<li>CLOSED (by the ULP, the application or
			    administratively)
</li>
</ul><p>
		    and always have an associated owner, or holder, such as
		    a ULP transmission control block (TCB).
		
</p>
<p>A connection latch can be born in the LISTENER state,
		    which can transition only to the CLOSED state.  The
		    LISTENER state corresponds to LISTEN state of TCP
		    (and other ULPs) and is associated with IP 3-tuples,
		    and can give rise to new connection latches in the
		    ESTABLISHED state.
</p>
<p>A connection latch can also be born in the
		    ESTABLISHED and BROKEN states, either through the
		    direct initiative of a ULP or when an event occurs
		    that causes a LISTENER latch to create a new latch
		    (in either ESTABLISHED or BROKEN states).  These
		    states represents an active connection latch for a
		    traffic flow's 5-tuple.  Connection latches in these
		    two states can transition to the other of the two
		    states, as well as to the CLOSED state.
</p>
<p>Connection latches remain in the CLOSED state until
		    their owners are informed except where the owner
		    caused the transition, in which case this state is
		    fleeting.  Transitions from ESTABLISHED or BROKEN
		    states to the CLOSED state should typically be
		    initiated by latch owners, but implementations
		    SHOULD provide administrative interfaces through
		    which to close active latches.
</p>
<p>Connection latches transition to the BROKEN state
		    when there exist SAs in the SAD whose traffic
		    selectors encompass the 5-tuple bound by the latch,
		    and whose peer and/or parameters conflict with those
		    bound by the latch.  Transitions to the BROKEN state
		    also take place when SPD changes occur that would
		    cause the latched connection's packets to be sent or
		    received with different protection parameters than
		    those that were latched.  Transitions to the BROKEN
		    state are also allowed when IKEv2 DPD concludes that
		    the remote peer is dead or has rebooted.
		    Transitions to the BROKEN state always cause the
		    associated owner to be informed.  Connection latches
		    in the BROKEN state transition back to ESTABLISHED
		    when all SA and/or SPD conflicts are cleared.
</p>
<p>Most state transitions are the result of local
		    actions of the latch owners (ULPs).  The only
		    exceptions are: birth into the ESTABLISHED state
		    from latches in the LISTENER state, transitions to
		    the BROKEN state, transitions from the BROKEN state
		    to ESTABLISHED, and administrative transitions to
		    the CLOSED state.  (Additionally, see the
		    implementation note about restartable key management
		    processes in <a class='info' href='#connection_latching'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connection Latching</span><span>)</span></a>.)

Normative Model: ULP interfaces to the key
		manager</h3>

<p>This section describes the NORMATIVE model of
		    connection latching.
</p>
<p>In this section we describe connection latching in
		    terms of a function call interface between ULPs and
		    the "key manager" component of a native IPsec
		    implementation.  Abstract interfaces for creating,
		    inquiring about, and releasing IPsec channels are
		    described.
</p>
<p>This model adds a service to the IPsec key manager
		    (i.e., the component that manages the SAD and
		    interfaces with separate implementations of, or
		    directly implements, key exchange protocols):
		    management of connection latches.  There is also a
		    new IPsec database, the Latch Database (LD), that
		    contains all connection latch objects.  The LD does
		    not persist across system reboots.
</p>
<p>The traditional IPsec processing model allows the
		    concurrent existence of SAs with different peers but
		    overlapping traffic selectors.  Such behaviour, in
		    this model, directly violates the requirements for
		    connection latching (see <a class='info' href='#connection_latching'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connection Latching</span><span>)</span></a>).  We address
		    this problem by requiring that connection latches be
		    broken (and holders informed) when such conflicts
		    arise.
</p>
<p>The following INFORMATIVE figure illustrates this
		    model and API in terms that are familiar to many
		    implementors, though not applicable to all:

			    This interface is to be provided by each ULP
			    to the key manager.  The specific details of
			    how this interface is provided are
			    implementation details, thus not specified
			    here (for example, this could be a
			    "callback" function or "closure" registered
			    as part of the CREATE_LISTENER_LATCH()
			    interface, or it could be provided when the
			    ULP is loaded onto the running system via a
			    registration interface provided by the key
			    manager.
</li>
</ul><p>
		
</p>
<p>Needless to say, the LD is updated whenever a
		    connection latch object is created, deleted or
		    broken.
</p>
<p>The API described above is a new service of the IPsec
		    key manager.  In particular the IPsec key manager
		    MUST prevent conflicts amongst latches, and it MUST
		    prevent conflicts between any latch and existing or
		    proposed child SAs as follows:

		    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Non-listener connection latches MUST NOT be
			    created if there exist conflicting SAs in
			    the SAD at the time the connection latch is
			    requested or would be created (from a
			    listener latch).  A child SA conflicts with
			    another, in view of a latch, if and only if:
			    a) its traffic selectors and the conflicting
			    SA's match the given latch's, and b) its
			    peer, type of protection, or quality of
			    protection parameters differ from the
			    conflicting SA.
</li>
<li>Child SA proposals that would conflict with
			    an extant connection latch and whose traffic
			    selectors can be narrowed to avoid the
			    conflict SHOULD be narrowed (see section 2.9
			    of <a class='info' href='#RFC4306'>[RFC4306]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>), otherwise the
			    latch MUST be transitioned to the BROKEN
			    state.
</li>
<li>Where child SA proposals that would conflict
			    with an extant connection latch cannot be
			    narrowed to avoid the conflict the key
			    manager MUST break the connection latch and
			    inform the holder (i.e., the ULP) prior to
			    accepting the conflicting SAs.
</li>
</ul><p>
		
</p>
<p>Finally, the key manager MUST protect latched
		    connections against SPD changes that would change
		    the quality of protection afforded to a latched
		    connection's traffic, or which would bypass it.
		    When such a configuration change takes place the key
		    manager MUST respond in either of the following
		    ways.  The REQUIRED to implement behaviour is to
		    transition into the BROKEN state all connection
		    latches that conflict with the given SPD change.
		    An OPTIONAL behaviour is to logically update the
		    SPD as if a PROTECT entry had been added at the head
		    of the SPD-S with traffic selectors matching only
		    the latched connection's 5-tuple, and with
		    processing information taken from the connection
		    latch.  Such updates of the SPD MUST NOT survive
		    system crashes or reboots.
</p>
<p>ULPs create latched connections by interfacing with
		    IPsec below as follows:
		    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>For listening end-points the ULP will request
			    a connection latch listener object for the
			    ULP listener's 3-tuple.  Any latching
			    parameters requested by the application
			    MUST be passed along.
</li>
<li>When the ULP receives a packet initiating a
			    connection for a 5-tuple matching a 3-tuple
			    listener latch, then the ULP will ask
			    the key manager whether a 5-tuple connection
			    latch was created.  If not then the ULP will
			    either reject the new connection or accept
			    it and inform the application that the new
			    connection is not latched.
</li>
<li>When initiating a connection the ULP will
			    request a connection latch object for the
			    connection's 5-tuple.  Any latching
			    parameters requested by the application
			    MUST be passed along.  If no latch can be
			    created then the ULP MUST either return an
			    error to the application or continue with
			    the new connection and inform the
			    application that the new connection is not
			    latched.
</li>
<li>When a connection is torn down and no further
			    packets are expected for it then the ULP
			    MUST request that the connection latch
			    object be destroyed.
</li>
<li>When tearing down a listener the ULP MUST
			    request that the connection latch listener
			    object be destroyed.
</li>
<li>When a ULP listener rejects connections the
			    ULP will request the destruction of any
			    connection latch objects that may have been
			    created as a result of the peer's attempt to
			    open the connection.
</li>
<li>When the key manager informs a ULP that a
			    connection latch has transitioned to the
			    BROKEN state then the ULP MUST stop sending
			    packets and MUST drop all subsequent
			    incoming packets for the affected connection
			    until it transitions back to ESTABLISHED.
			    Connection-oriented ULPs SHOULD act as
			    though the connection is experiencing packet
			    loss.
</li>
<li>When the key manager informs a ULP that a
			    connection latch has been administratively
			    transitioned to the CLOSED state then
			    connection-oriented ULPs MUST act as though
			    the connection has been reset by the peer.
			    Implementations of ULPs which are not
			    connection-oriented, and which have no API
			    by which to simulate a reset, MUST drop all
			    inbound packets for that connection and MUST
			    NOT send any further packets -- the
			    application is expected to detect
			    timeouts and act accordingly.
</li>
</ul><p>
		
</p>
<p>The main benefit of this model of connection latching
		    is that it accommodates IPsec implementations where
		    ESP/AH handling is implemented in hardware (for all
		    or a subset of the host's SAD), but where the
		    hardware does not support tagging inbound packets
		    with the indexes of SAD entries corresponding to the
		    SAs that protected them.

Race Conditions and
		    Corner Cases</h3>

<p>ULPs MUST drop inbound packets and stop sending
			packets immediately upon receipt of a connection
			latch break message.  Otherwise the ULP will not
			be able to distinguish inbound packets that were
			protected consistently with the connection's
			latch from inbound packets that were not.  This
			may include dropping inbound packets that were
			protected by a suitable SA; dropping such
			packets is no different, from the ULP's point of
			view, than packet loss elsewhere on the network
			at the IP layer or below -- harmless, from a
			security point of view as the connection fails
			safe, but it can result in retransmits.
</p>
<p>Another race condition is as follows.  A
			PROTECTed TCP SYN packet may be received and
			decapsulated but the SA that protected it could
			have expired before the key manager creates the
			connection latch that would be created by that
			packet.  In this case the key manager will have
			to initiate new child SAs so as to determine
			what the sender's peer ID is so it can be
			included in the connection latch.  Here there is
			no guarantee that the peer ID for the new SAs
			will be the same as those of the peer that sent
			the TCP SYN packet.  This race condition is
			harmless: TCP will send a SYN+ACK to the wrong
			peer, which will then respond with an RST -- the
			connection latch will reflect the new peer
			however, so if the new peer is malicious it will
			not be able to appear to be the old peer.
			Therefore this race condition is harmless.

<p>Effectively this says: for TCP ports 1-5000 in
			our network allow only peers that have
			credentials issued by CA X and PROTECT that
			traffic with ESP, otherwise bypass all other
			traffic.
</p>
<p>Now let's consider two hosts, A and B, in this
			network that wish to communicate using port
			4000, and a third host, C, that is also in the
			same network and wishes to attack A and/or B.
			All three hosts have credentials and
			certificates issued by CA X.  Let's also imagine
			that A is connected to its network via a
			wireless link and is dynamically address.
</p>
<p>B is listening on port 4000.  A initiates a
			connection from port 32800 to B on port
			4000.
</p>
<p>We'll assume no IPsec APIs, but that TCP creates
			latches where possible.
</p>
<p>We'll consider three cases: a) A and B both
			support connection latching, b) only A does, c)
			only B does.  For the purposes of this example
			the SAD is empty on all three hosts when A
			initiates its TCP connection to B on port 4000.
</p>
<p>When an application running on A initiates a TCP
			connection to B on port 4000, A will begin by
			creating a connection latch.  Since the SAD is
			empty A will initiate an IKEv2 exchange to
			create an IKE_SA with B and a pair
			of CHILD SAs for the 5-tuple {TCP, A, 32800, B,
			4000}, then a new latch will be created in
			ESTABLISHED state.  Sometime later TCP will send
			a SYN packet protected by the A-to-B child
			SA, per the SPD.
</p>
<p>When an application running on B creates a TCP
			listener "socket" on port 4000, B will create a
			LISTENER connection latch for the 3-tuple {TCP,
			B, 4000}.  When B receives A's TCP SYN packet it
			will then create a connection latch for {TCP, B,
			4000, A, 32800}.  Since by this point CHILD SAs
			have been created whose traffic selectors
			encompass this 5-tuple and there are no other
			conflicting SAs in the SAD, this connection
			latch will be created in the ESTABLISHED
			state.
</p>
<p>If C attempts to mount a man-in-the-middle attack
			on A (i.e., pretend to have B's address(es)) any
			time after A created its connection latch then
			C's SAs with A will cause the connection latch
			to break, and the TCP connection to be reset
			(since we assume no APIs by which TCP could
			notify the application of the connection latch
			break).  If C attempts to impersonate A to B
			then the same thing will happen on B.
</p>
<p>If A does not support connection latching then C
			will be able to impersonate B to A at any time,
			but without having seen the cleartext of traffic
			between A and B, C will be limited by the TCP
			sequence numbers to attacks such as RST
			attacks.  Similarly if B does not support
			connection latching.

Informative model: local packet tagging</h3>

<p>In this section we describe connection latching in
		    terms of interfaces between ULPs and IPsec based on
		    tagging packets as they go up and down the IP stack.
</p>
<p>This section is INFORMATIVE.
</p>
<p>In this model the ULPs maintain connection latch
		    objects and state, rather than the IPsec key
		    manager, as well as effectively caching a subset of
		    the decorrelated SPD in ULP TCBs.  Local tagging of
		    packets as they move up and down the stack with SA
		    identifiers then allows the ULPs to enforce
		    connection latching semantics.  These tags, of
		    course, don't appear on the wire.
</p>
<p>The interface between the ULPs and IPsec interface is
		    as follows:

		    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The IPsec layer tags all inbound protected
			    packets addressed to the host with the index
			    of the SAD entry corresponding to the SA
			    that protected the packet.
</li>
<li>The IPsec layer understands two types of tags
			    on outbound packets:
			    
<ul class="text">
<li>a tag specifying a set of latched
				    parameters (peer ID, quality of
				    protection, etc...) that the IPsec
				    layer will use to find or acquire an
				    appropriate SA for protecting the
				    outbound packet (else IPsec will
				    inform the ULP and drop the
				    packet);
</li>
<li>a tag requesting feedback about the
				    SA used to protect the outgoing
				    packet, if any.
</li>
</ul>
			
</li>
</ul><p>
		
</p>
<p>ULPs create latched connections by interfacing with
		    IPsec below as follows:
		    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the ULP passes a connection's initiating
			    packet to IP the ULP requests feedback about
			    the SA used to protect the outgoing packet,
			    if any, and may specify latching parameters
			    requested by the application.  If the packet
			    is protected by IPsec then the ULP records
			    certain parameters of the SA used to protect
			    it in the connection's TCB.
</li>
<li>When a ULP receives a connection's initiating
			    packet it processes the IPsec tag of the
			    packet, and it records in the connection's
			    TCB the parameters of the SA that should be
			    latched.
</li>
</ul><p>
		
</p>
<p>Once SA parameters are recorded in a connection's TCB
		    the ULP enforces the connection's latch, or binding,
		    to these parameters as follows:
		    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The ULP processes the IPsec tag of all
			    inbound packets for a given connection and
			    checks that the SAs used to protect input
			    packets match the connection latches
			    recorded in the TCBs.  Packets which are not
			    so protected are dropped (this corresponds
			    to transitioning the connection latch to the
			    BROKEN state until the next acceptable
			    packet arrives, but in this model this
			    transition is imaginary), or cause the ULP
			    to break the connection latch and inform the
			    application.
</li>
<li>The ULP always requests that outgoing packets
			    be protected by SAs that match the latched
			    connection by appropriately tagging outbound
			    packets.
</li>
</ul><p>
		
</p>
<p>By effectively caching a subset of the decorrelated
		    SPD in ULP TCBs and through its packet tagging
		    nature, this method of connection latching can also
		    optimize processing of the SPD by obviating the need
		    to search it, both, on input and output, for packets
		    intended for the host or originated by the host.
		    This makes implementation of the OPTIONAL "logical
		    SPD" updates described in <a class='info' href='#key_manager'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Normative Model: ULP interfaces to the key 		manager</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#optional_protection'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Optional 		Protection</span><span>)</span></a> an incidental
		    side effect of this approach.
</p>
<p>This model of connection latching may not be workable
		    with ESP/AH offload hardware that does not support
		    the packet tagging scheme described above.
</p>
<p>Note that this model has no BROKEN connection latch
		    state.
</p>
<p>Extending the ULP/IPsec packet-tagging interface to
		    the application for use with connection-less
		    datagram transports should enable applications to
		    use such transports and implement connection
		    latching at the application layer.

Non-native mode IPsec</h3>

<p>This section is INFORMATIVE.
</p>
<p>Non-native IPsec implementations, primarily BITS and
		    SG, can implement connection latching too.  One
		    major distinction between native IPsec and
		    BITS/BITW/SG IPsec is the lack of APIs for
		    applications at the end-points in the case of the
		    latter.  As a result there can be no uses of the
		    latch management interfaces as described in <a class='info' href='#key_manager'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Normative Model: ULP interfaces to the key 		manager</span><span>)</span></a>, not at the ULP
		    end-points.  Therefore BITS/BITW/SG implementations
		    must discern ULP connection state from packet
		    inspection (which many firewalls can do) and emulate
		    calls to the key manager accordingly.
</p>
<p>When a connection latch is broken a BITS/BITW/SG
		    implementation may have to fake a connection reset
		    by sending appropriate packets (e.g., TCP RST
		    packets), for the affected connections.
</p>
<p>As with all stateful middle-boxes this scheme suffers
		    from the inability of the middle-box to interact
		    with the applications.  For example, connection
		    death may be difficult to ascertain.  Nor can
		    channel binding applications work with channels
		    maintained by proxy without being able to
		    communicate (securely) about it with the
		    middle-box.

Implementation
		Note Regarding Peer IDs</h3>

<p>One of the recommendations for connection latching

		    payloads (certificates) to the applications.
</p>
<p>Additionally, raw public keys are likely to be used
		    in the construction of channel bindings for IPsec
		    channels; see <a class='info' href='#I-D.williams-ipsec-channel-binding'>[I&#8209;D.williams&#8209;ipsec&#8209;channel&#8209;binding]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Williams, N., &ldquo;End-Point Channel Bindings for IPsec Using IKEv2 and Public Keys,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>,
		    and must be available, in any case, in order to
		    implement leap-of-faith at the application layer
		    (see <a class='info' href='#RFC5386'>[RFC5386]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Williams, N. and M. Richardson, &ldquo;Better-Than-Nothing Security: An Unauthenticated Mode of IPsec,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC5387'>[RFC5387]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Touch, J., Black, D., and Y.

</p>
<p>Certificates and raw public keys are large bit
		    strings, too large to be reasonably kept in
		    kernel-mode implementations of connection latching
		    (which will likely be the typical case).  Such
		    implementations should intern peer IDs in a
		    user-mode database and use small integers to refer
		    to them from the kernel-mode SAD and LD.  Corruption
		    of such a database is akin to corruption of the
		    SAD/LD; in the event of corruption the
		    implementation MUST act as though all ESTABLISHED
		    and BROKEN connection latches are administratively
		    transitioned to the CLOSED state.  Implemenations
		    without IPsec APIs MAY hash peer IDs and use the
		    hash to refer to them, preferably using a strong
		    hash algorithm.

<p>At its bare minimum connection latching is a passive

<p>There are some optional features, such as (abstract)

Optional

<p>Given IPsec APIs an application could request that a

<p>When an application requests, and local policy

Simulataneous latch establishment</h3>

<p>Some connection-oriented ULPs, specifically TCP, support
		simulaneous connections (where two clients connect to
		each other, using the same 5-tuple, at the same time).
		Connection latching supports simultaneous latching as
		well, provided that the key exchange protocol does not
		make it impossible.
</p>
<p>Consider two applications doing a simultaneous TCP
		connect to each other and requesting an IPsec channel.
		If they request the same connection latching parameters,
		then the connection and channel should be established as
		usual.  Even if the key exchange protocol in use doesn't
		support simultaneous IKE_SA and/or child SA
		establishment, provided one peer's attempt to create the
		necessary child SAs succeeds then the other peer should
		be able to notice the new SAs immediately upon failure
		of its attempts to create the same.
</p>
<p>If, however, the two peer applications were to request
		different connection latching parameters, then the
		connection latch must fail on one end or on both
		ends.

Handling of BROKEN state for TCP and SCTP</h3>

<p>There are several ways to handle connection latch
		    transitions to the BROKEN state in the case of
		    connection-oriented ULPs like TCP or SCTP:
</p>
<p>
		    </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Wait for a possible future transition back to
			    the ESTABLISHED state, until which time the
			    ULP will not move data between the two
			    end-points of the connection.  ULP and
			    application timeout mechanisms will, of
			    course, trigger in the event of too lengthy
			    a stay in the BROKEN state.  SCTP
			    can detect these timeouts and initiate
			    failover, in the case of multi-homed
			    associations.
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>Act as though the connection has been reset
			    (RST message received, in TCP, or ABORT
			    message received, in SCTP).
</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>Act as though an ICMP destination unreachable
			    message had been received (in SCTP such
			    messages can trigger path failover in the
			    case of multi-homed associations).
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
		
</p>
<p>Implementions SHOULD provide APIs for either
		    informing applications (asynchronously or otherwise)
		    of latch breaks, so that they may choose a
		    disposition (wait, close, or proceed with path
		    failover), or by which applications can select a
		    specific disposition a priori (before a latch break
		    happens).
</p>
<p>Implementions MUST provide a default disposition in
		    the event of a connection latch break.  Though (a)
		    is clearly the purist default, we RECOMMEND (b) for
		    TCP and SCTP associations where only a single path
		    remains (one 5-tuple), and (c) for multi-homed SCTP
		    associations.  The rationale for this recommendation
		    is as follows: a conflicting SA most likely
		    indicates that the original peer is gone and has
		    been replaced by another, and it's not likely that
		    the original peer will return, thus failing faster
		    seems reasonable.
</p>
<p>Note that our recommended default behavior does not
		    create off-path reset denial-of-service (DoS)
		    attacks: to break a connection latch an attacker
		    would first have to successfully establish an SA,
		    with one of the connection's end-points, that
		    conflicts with the connection latch, and that
		    requires multiple messages to be exchanged between
		    that end-point and the attacker.  Unless the
		    attacker's chosen victim end-point allows the
		    attacker to claim IP address ranges for its SAs then
		    the attacker would have to actually take over the
		    other end-point's addresses, which rules out
		    off-path attacks.

Impact on IPsec</h3>

<p>Connection latching effectively adds a mechanism for
		    dealing with the existence, in the SAD, of multiple
		    non-equivalent child SAs with overlapping traffic
		    selectors.  This mechanism consists of, at minimum,
		    a local notification of transport protocols (and,
		    through them, applications) of the existence of such
		    a conflict which affects a transport layer's
		    connections.  Affected transports are also notified
		    when the conflict is cleared.  The transports must
		    drop inbound packets, and must not send outbound
		    packets for connections which are affected by a
		    conflict.  In this minimal form connection latching
		    is a passive, local feature layered atop IPsec.
</p>
<p>Connection latching achieves this by adding a new
		    type of IPsec database, the Latch Database (LD),
		    containing objects which represent a transport
		    protocol's interest in protecting a given packet
		    flow from such conflicts.  The LD is managed in
		    conjunction with updates to the SAD and the SPD, so
		    that updates to either which conflict with
		    established connection latches can be detected.  For
		    some IPsec implementations this may imply
		    significant changes to their internals.  However,
		    two different models of connection laching are
		    given, and we hope that most native IPsec
		    implementators will find one model to be
		    significantly simpler to implement than the
		    other, and simple enough to implement.
</p>
<p>This notion of conflicting SAs and how to deal with
		    the situation does not modify the basic IPsec
		    architecture -- the feature of IPsec which allows
		    such conflicts to arise remains, and it is up to the
		    transport protocols and applications to select
		    whether and how to respond to them.
</p>
<p>There are, however, interesting corner cases in the
		    normative model of connection latching that
		    implementors must be aware of.  The notes in <a class='info' href='#race_cond'>Section&nbsp;2.3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Race Conditions and 		    Corner Cases</span><span>)</span></a> are particularly

Impact on IPsec of Optional Features</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#optional_features'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Optional Features</span><span>)</span></a> describes optional
		    features of connection latching where the key
		    manager takes on a somewhat more active, though
		    still local, role.  There are two such features:
		    optional protect/bypass, and preservation of
		    "logical" SPD entries to allow latched connections
		    to remain in the ESTABLISHED state in the face of
		    adverse administrative SPD (but not SAD)
		    changes.  These two features interact with
		    administrative interfaces to IPsec; administrators
		    must be made aware of these features, and SHOULD be
		    given a way to break ESTABLISHED connection latches.
		    Also, given recent trends toward centralizing parts
		    of IPsec policy, these two features can be said to
		    have non-local effects where they prevent
		    distributed policy changes from taking effect
		    completely.

Security Considerations for Applications</h3>

<p>Connection latching is not negotiated.  It is
		    therefore possible for one end of a connection to be
		    using connection latching while the other does not,
		    in which case it's possible for policy changes local
		    to the non-latched end to cause packets to be sent
		    unprotected.  The end doing connection latching will
		    reject unprotected packets, but if they bear
		    sensitive data then the damage may already be done.
		    Therefore applications SHOULD check that both ends
		    of a connection are latched (such a check is
		    implicit for applications that use channel binding
		    to IPsec).
</p>
<p>Connection latching protects individual connections
		    from weak peer ID&lt;-&gt;address binding, IPsec
		    configuration changes, and from configurations that
		    allow multiple peers to assert the same addresses.
		    But connection latching does not ensure that any two
		    connections with the same end-point addresses will
		    have the same latched peer IDs.  In other words,
		    applications that use multiple concurrent
		    connections between two given nodes may not be
		    protected any more or less by use of IPsec
		    connection latching than by use of IPsec alone
		    without connection latching.  Such multi-connection
		    applications can, however, examine the latched SA
		    parameters of each connection to ensure that all
		    concurrent connections with the same end-point
		    addresses also have the same end-point IPsec
		    IDs.
</p>
<p>Connection latching protects against TCP RST attacks.
		    It does not help, however, if the original peer of a
		    TCP connection is no longer available (e.g., if an
		    attacker has been able to interrupt the network
		    connection between the two peers).

Denial of Service Attacks</h3>

<p>Connection latch state transitions to the BROKEN
		    state can be triggered by on-path attackers, and any
		    off-path attackers that can attack routers, or cause
		    an end-point to accept an ICMP Redirect message.
		    Connection latching protects applications against
		    on- and off-path attackers in general, but not
		    against on-path denial of service specifically.
</p>
<p>Attackers can break latches if they can trigger DPD
		    on one or both end-points and if they cause packets
		    to not move between two end-points.  Such attacks
		    generally require that the attacker be on-path,
		    therefore we consider it acceptable to break latches
		    when DPD concludes that a peer is dead or
		    rebooted.
</p>
<p>Attackers can also break latches if IPsec policy on a
		    node allows the attacker to use the IP address of a
		    peer of that node.  Such configurations are expected
		    to be used in conjunction with BTNS in general.
		    Such attacks generally require that the attacker be
		    on-path.
