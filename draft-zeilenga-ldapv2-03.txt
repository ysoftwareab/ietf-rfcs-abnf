Abstract

  This document recommends the retirement of version 2 of the
  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv2) and dependent
  specifications, and discusses the reasons for doing so.  This document
  recommends RFC 1777, 1778, 1779, 1781, and 2559 be moved to Historic
  status.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, version 2

  LDAPv2 (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, version 2)
  [RFC1777][RFC1778][RFC1779] is an Internet Protocol used to access
  X.500-based directory services.  This document recommends the LDAPv2
  and dependent specifications be retired.  Specifically, this document
  recommends RFC 1777, 1778, 1779, 1781, and 2559 be moved to Historic
  status.  The reasons for taking this action are discussed below.

  LDAPv2 was published in 1995 as a Draft Standard.  Since its
  publication, a number of inadequacies in the specification have been
  discovered.  LDAPv3 [RFC2251] was published in 1997 as a Proposed
  Standard to resolve these inadequacies.  While LDAPv3 is currently
  being revised [LDAPbis], it is clearly technically superior to LDAPv2.

  The LDAPv2 specification is not generally adhered to.  That is, an
  independently developed implementation of the specification would not
  interoperate with existing implementations as existing implementations
  use syntaxes and semantics different than those prescribed by the
  specification.  Below are two examples.

    1) Existing LDAPv2 implementations do not commonly restrict textual
       values to IA5 (ASCII) and T.61 (Teletex) as required by RFC 1777
       and RFC 1778.  Some existing implementations use ISO 8859-1,
       others use UCS-2, others use UTF-8, and some use whatever the
       local character set happens to be.

    2) RFC 1777 requires use of the textual string associated with
       AttributeType in the X.500 Directory standards.  However,
       existing implementations use the NAME associated with the
       AttributeType in LDAPv3 schema [RFC2252].  That is, LDAPv2
       requires the organization name attribute be named
       "organizationName" not "o".

  In addition, LDAPv2 does not provide adequate security features for
  use on the Internet.  LDAPv2 does not provide any mechanism for data
  integrity or confidentiality.  LDAPv2 does not support modern
  authentication mechanisms such as those based on DIGEST-MD5, Kerberos
  V, and X.509 public keys.


Dependent Specifications

  Since the publication of RFC 1777, 1778, and 1779, there have been
  additional standard track RFCs published which are dependent on these
  technical specifications, including:

    "Using the OSI Directory to Achieve User Friendly Naming" [RFC1781]

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-zeilenga-ldapv2-03.txt        16 August 2002


      and
    "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational Protocols -
      LDAPv2" [RFC2559].

  RFC 1781 is a technical specification for "User Friendly Naming" which
  replies on particular syntaxes described in RFC 1779.  RFC 2253, which
  replaced RFC 1779, eliminated support for the "User Friendly Naming"
  syntaxes.  RFC 1781 is currently a Proposed Standard.

  RFC 2559 is primarily an applicability statement for using LDAPv2 in
  providing Public Key Infrastructure.  It depends on RFC 1777 and
  updates RFC 1778.  If LDAPv2 is moved to Historic status, so must this
  document.  RFC 2559 is currently a Proposed Standard.


Security Considerations

  LDAPv2 does not provide adequate security mechanisms for general use
  on the Internet.  LDAPv3 offers far superior security mechanisms
  include support for strong authentication and data confidentiality
  services.  Moving LDAPv2 to Historic may improve the security of the
  Internet by encouraging implementation and use of LDAPv3.


Recommendation

  Developers should not implement LDAPv2 per RFC 1777 as such would
  result in an implementation which will not interoperate with existing
  LDAPv2 implementations.  Developers should implement LDAPv3 instead.

  Deployers should recognize that significant interoperability issues
  exist between current LDAPv2 implementations.  LDAPv3 is clearly
  technically superior to LDAPv2 and hence should be used instead.

  It is recommended that RFC 1777, RFC 1778, RFC 1779, RFC 1781, and RFC
  2559 be moved to Historic status.


Acknowledgment

  The author would like to thank the designers of LDAPv2 for their
  contribution to the Internet community.
