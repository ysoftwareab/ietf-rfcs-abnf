Abstract

   This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
   (IODEF) to support the reporting of phishing, fraud, other types of
   electronic crime, and widespread spam incidents.  These extensions
   are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities
   throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle.  Both simple reporting
   and complete forensic reports are possible, as is consolidated

   reporting of multiple phishing incidents.

   The extensions defined in this document are used to generate two
   different reports: a fraud and phishing report and a wide-spread spam
   report.  Although similar in structure, each report has different
   required objects and intents.

   This document had completed working group last call and was in
   revision when the INCH working group was disbanded.

Internet-Draft          IODEF Phishing Extensions           October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Deception-driven activities on the Internet, such as receiving an
   email purportedly from a bank requesting you to confirm your account
   information, are an expanding attack type on the Internet.  The terms
   phishing and fraud are used interchangeably in this document to
   characterize a broadly-launched social engineering attacks in which
   an electronic identity is misrepresented in an attempt to trick
   individuals into revealing their personal credentials ( e.g.,
   passwords, account numbers, personal information, ATM PINs, etc.).  A
   successful phishing attack on an individual allows the phisher (i.e.
   the attacker) to exploit the individual's credentials for financial
   or other gain.  Phishing attacks have morphed from directed email
   messages from alleged financial institutions to more sophisticated
   lures that may also include malware.

   This document defines a data format extension to the Incident Object
   Description Exchange Format (IODEF) that can be used to describe
   information about a phishing incident or wide-spread spam incident.
   Sections 1 and 2 of this document introduce the high-level report
   format.  Sections 3 and 4 describe the data elements of the fraud
   extensions.  This document includes an XML schema for the extensions
   and a few example fraud reports.

1.1.  Why a Common Report Format is Needed

   The rise in phishing and fraud activities via e-mail, instant
   message, DNS corruption, and malicious code insertion has driven
   corporations, Internet Service Providers, consumer agencies, and
   financial institutions to begin to collect and correlate phishing
   attack information.  The collected data allows them to better
   coordinate mitigation activities and support in the persuit and
   prosecution of the attacker.

   By using a common format, it becomes easier for an organization to
   engage in this coordination as well as correlation of information
   from multiple sources or products into a cohesive view.

   The accumulation and correlation of information is also important in
   resolving phishing incidents detected externally as the phished
   organization may not even be aware of the attack.  Third parties
   aware of the attack may wish to notify the phished organization or a
   central notification service so adequate responses could commence.
   The targeted organization's internal monitoring systems may also
   detect the attack and wish to take mitigation steps.

   While the intended use of this specification is to facilitate data
   sharing between parties, the mechanics of this sharing process and

Internet-Draft          IODEF Phishing Extensions           October 2006


   its related political challenges are out of scope for this document.

1.2.  Relation to the INCH IODEF Data Model

   Instead of defining a new report format, this draft defines an
   extension to the Incident Object Description Exchange Format Data
   Model[IODEF].  The IODEF defines a flexible and extensible format and
   supports a granular level of specificity.  This phishing extension
   reuses subsets of the IODEF data model and, where appropriate,
   specifies new data elements.  Leveraging an existing specification
   allows for more rapid adoption and reuse of existing tools in
   organizations.  For clarity, and in order to eliminate duplication,
   only the additional structures necessary for describing the exchange
   of phishing and e-crime activity are provided.

   The use of this already existent and operational format, based on the
   Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format [IDMEF], allows for
   quicker vendor adoption and reuse of existing tools in organizations.
   To reduce duplication and to be compatible with forward modifications
   to the base IODEF definitions this document only identifies
   additional structures necessary for exchanging phishing and e-crime
   information.

1.2.1.  The IODEF Extensions for Fraud

   In general, an IODEF incident report contains detailed incident-
   specific data which populates an EventData Structure.  That data is
   then incorporated, either singularly or in aggregation with
   additional summary and contact data, into an Incident structure.

   A Fraud Activity Report is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document with
   added EventData and AdditionalData elements.  It contains the
   Incident structure and additional fields in the EventData specific to
   phishing and fraud (the PhraudReport).  Phishing activity may include
   multiple emails, instant messages, or network messages, scattered
   over various times, locations, and methodologies.  The new EventData
   fields are combined into a Fraud Activity Report and include
   information about the email header and body, details of the actual
   phishing lure, correlation to other attacks, and details of the
   removal of the web server or credential collector.  As a phishing
   attack may generate multiple reports to an incident team, the Fraud
   Activity Reports may be combined into one EventData structure.
   Multiple EventData structures may be combined into one Incident
   Report.  One IODEF Incident report may record one or more individual
   phishing events and may include multiple EventData elements.

   This document defines new elements for the EventData and Record Item
   IODEF XML elements and identifies the Fraud Activity Report required

   "Extending the IODEF Format" in[IODEF].

            Figure 2.1: The Components of Internet Phishing


   Internet-based Phishing and Fraud activities are normally comprised
   of at least four components:

      1.  The Phisher, Fraudster, or party perpetrating the fraudulent
      activity.  Most times this party is not readily identifiable.

      2.  The Attack Source, the source of the phishing email, virus,
      trojan, or other attack is masked in an enticing manner.

      3.  The User, Victim, or intended target of the fraud/phish.

      4.  The collection point, where the victim sends their credentials
      or personal data if they have been duped by the phisher.

   If we take a holistic view of the attack, there are some additional
   components:

      5.  The sensor, the means by which the phish is detected.  This
      element may be an intrusion detection system, firewall, filter,
      email gateway, or human analyst.

      6.  A forensic or archive site where an investigator has copied or
      otherwise retained the data used for the fraud attempt or
      credential collection.

3.  Fraud Activity Reporting via IODEF-Documents

   A Fraud Activity Report is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document with
   additional extensions and usage guidance as specified in Section 4 of
   this document.  These additional extensions are implemented through
   the PhraudReport Element.

   The Appendices contain sample Fraud Activity Reports and the complete
   XML Document Type Definition and schema.

   The IODEF Incident element [IODEF, Section 3.2] with fraud extensions
   is summarized below.  It and the rest of the data model presented in
   Section 4 is expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax.

   +------------------+

           Figure 3.1: The IODEF XML Incident Element (modified)


   A Fraud Activity Report is composed of one iodef:Incident element
   that contains one or more related PhraudReport elements embedded in
   iodef:AdditionalData element of iodef:EventData.  The PhraudReport
   element is added to the IODEF using its defined extension procedure
   documented in Section 5 of [IODEF].

   One IODEF-Document may contain information on multiple incidents with
   information for each incident contained within an iodef:Incident
   element [IODEF, Section 3.12].

4.  PhraudReport Element Definitions

   A PhraudReport consists of an extension to the
   Incident.EventData.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   elements of the PhraudReport will specify information about the six
   components of fraud activity identified in Section 2.  Additional
   forensic information and commentary can be added by the reporter as
   necessary to show relation to other events, to show the output of an
   investigation, or for archival purposes.  A PhraudReport accommodates
   the six elements this way:

   a.  The PhishNameRef and LocalPhishNameRef elements identify the
       fraud or class of fraud.

   b.  The LureSource element describes the source of the attack or
       phishing lure, including host information and any included
       malware.

   c.  The DCData describes the technical details of the credential
       collection point.

   d.  The Originating Sensor element describes the means of detection.

   e.  The RelatedData, ArchivedData, and TakeDownInfo fields allow
       optional forensics and history data.

   A specific phish/fraud activity can be identified using a combination
   of the FraudType, FraudParameter, FraudedBrandName, LureSource, and
   PhishRefName elements.

   A PhraudReport element is structured as follows.  The components of a
   PhraudReport are introduced in functional grouping as some parameters
   are related and some elements may not make sense individually.

   Note: Elements that are imported from the base IODEF specification
   are prefaced with an "iodef" namespace and are noted with the section
   defining that element in [IODEF].

4.1.  Version attribute

   STRING.  The version shall be the value 1.0 to be compliant with this
   document.

4.2.  FraudType attribute

   One ENUM.  The FraudType attribute describes the type of fraudlent
   activity described in this PhraudReport.

Internet-Draft          IODEF Phishing Extensions           October 2006


   1.   phishemail.  The FraudParameter should be the email subject line
        of the phishing email.  This type is a standard email phish,
        usually sent as spam, and is intended to derive financial loss
        to the recipient.

   2.   recruitemail.  The FraudParameter is the email subject line of
        the phishing email.  This type of email phish does not pose a
        potential financial loss to the recipient, but covers other
        cases of the phish and fraud lifecycle.

   3.   malwareemail.  The FraudParameter is the email subject line of
        the phishing email.  This type of email phish does not pose a
        potential financial loss to the recipient, but lures the
        recipient to an infected site.

   4.   fraudsite.  This identifies a known fraudulent site that does
        not necessarily send spam but is used for lures.  The
        FraudParameter may be used to identify the website.

   5.   dnsspoof.  This choice does not have a related FraudParameter.
        This is used for a spoofed DNS (e.g., malware changes localhost
        file so visits to www.example.com go to another IP address
        chosen by the fraudster).

   6.   keylogger.  This choice does not have a FraudParameter and
        specifies a keylogger downloaded with the lure.

   7.   ole.  There is no FraudParameter.  This identifies background
        Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) information that
        comes as part of a lure.

   8.   im.  The FraudParameter should be the malicious instant message
        (IM) link supplied to the user.

   9.   cve.  This choice identifies CVE-known malware, with the Common
        Vulnerability and Exposures project (CVE) number as the
        FraudParameter.

   10.  archive.  There is no required FraudParameter for this choice,
        although the FraudParameter of the original phish could be
        entered.  The data archived from the phishing server is placed
        in the ArchiveInfo element.

   11.  spamreport.  This type is used when the PhraudReport is
        reporting a large-scale spam activity.  The FraudParameter
        should be the spam email subject line.

Internet-Draft          IODEF Phishing Extensions           October 2006


   12.  voip.  The lure was received via a voice-over-IP connection
        identified by the information in the FraudParameter field.

   13.  other.  This is used to identify not-yet-enumerated fraud types.

   14.  unknown.  This choice may have an associated FraudParameter.  It
        is used to cover confused cases.

4.2.1.  FraudParameter element

   One value of iodef:MLStringType [IODEF, Section 2.4].  This is the
   lure used to attract victims.  It may be an email subject line, VoIP
   lure, link in an IM message, the CVE or malware identifier, or a web
   URL.  Note that some phishers add a number of random characters onto
   the end of a phish email subject line for uniqueness; reporters
   should delete those characters before insertion into the
   FraudParameter field.

4.3.  PhishNameRef element

   Zero or one value of STRING.  The PhishNameRef element is the common
   name used to identify this fraud event.  It is often the name agreed
   upon by involved parties or vendors.  Using this name can be a
   convenient way to reference the activity collaborating with other
   parties, the media, or engaging in public education.

4.4.  PhishNameLocalRef element

   Zero or one value of STRING.  The PhishNameLocalRef element describes
   a local name or Unique-IDentifier (UID) that is used by various
   parties before a commonly agreed term is adopted.  This field allows
   a cross-reference from the submitting organization's system to a
   central repository.

4.5.  FraudedBrandName element

   Zero or more values of STRING.  This is the identifier of the
   recognized brand name or company name used in the phishing activity
   (e.g., XYZ Semiconductor Corp).

4.6.  LureSource element

   One value.  REQUIRED.  The LureSource element describes the source of
   the PhraudReport lure.  It allows the specification of IP Addresses,
   DNS names, domain registry information, and rudimentary support for

       ArchivedDataComments field.

4.10.2.  ArchivedDataURL

       Zero or one value of URL.  As the archive of an entire site can
       be quite large, the ArchivedURL element points to an Internet-
       based server where the actual gzipped content of the site archive
       can be retrieved.  Note that this element just points out where
       the archive is and does not include the entire archive in the

       report.  This is the URL where the gzipped archive file is
       located.

4.10.3.  ArchivedDataComments

       Zero or one value of STRING.  This field is a free form area for
       comments on the archive and/or URL.

4.11.  RelatedData element

   Zero or more value of anyURI.  This element allows the listing of
   other web or net sites that are related to this incident (e.g.,
   victim site, etc.).

4.12.  CorrelationData element

   Zero or more value of STRING.  Any information that correlates this
   incident to other incidents can be entered here.

4.13.  PRComments element

   Zero or one value of STRING.  This field allows for any comments
   specific to this PhraudReport that does not fit in any other field.

4.14.  EmailRecord element

   Extensions are also made to the iodef:Incident.EventData element
   [IODEF, Section 3.12] to include the actual email message received in
   phishing lure or widespread spam emails.  The ability to report spam
   is included within a PhraudReport to support exchanging information
   about large-scale spam activities related to phishing, not
   necessarily a single spam message to a user.  As such the spam
   reporting mechanism was not designed to minimize overhead and
   processing, but to support other widely-used spam reporting formats
   such as the MAAWG's Abuse Reporting Format [ARF].

   Reporting of the actual mail message is supported by choosing one of
   three methods.  First, an ARF message may be included.  Second, the
   message may be included as one large string.  Third, the header and
   body components may be dissected and included as a series of strings.

4.14.1.  EmailCount

       INTEGER.  REQUIRED.  This field enumerates the number of email
       messages identified in this record detected by the reporter.

4.14.2.  Email Message Inclusion

       The actual wide-spread spam message may be included in a report
       via one of three encodings: an ARF message, one big text blob, or
       a separate header and body element.

4.14.2.1.  ARFText

       Zero or one value of STRING.  The Messaging Anti-Abuse Working
       Group (MAAWG) defined a format for sending abuse and list control
       traffic to other parties.  Since many of these reports will get
       integrated into incident processes, the raw Abuse Reporting
       Format [ARF] may be inserted into this element.

       The ARF should be encoded as a character string.

       email header lines, one line per header element.

4.14.2.2.2.  EmailBody Element

       Zero or one value of iodef:MLStringType.  This element contains
       the body of the phish email.  If present, there should be at most
       one EmailBody element per EmailRecord

4.14.2.3.  Message

       iodef:MLStringType.  The entire mail message can be inserted as
       one large string.

4.14.3.  EmailComments Element

       Zero or one value of STRING.  This field contains comments or
       relevant data not placed elsewhere about the phishing or spam
       email.

5.  IODEF Required Elements

   A report about fraud, spam, or phishing requires certain identifying
   information which is contained within the standard IODEF Incident
   data structure and the PhraudReport extensions.  The following table
   identifies attributes required to be present in a compliant
   PhraudReport to report phishing or fraud or to report widespread
   spam.  The required attributes are a combination of those required by
   the base IODEF element and those required by this document.
   Attributes identified as required SHALL be populated in conforming
   phishing activity reports.

   Note that the major difference between a widespread-spam report and a
   phishing/fraud report is that a spam report does not require the
   FraudParameter element and includes an EMailRecord element.

   The following table is a visual description of the IODEF-Document
   required fields.

5.1.  Fraud or Phishing Report

   A compliant IODEF PhraudReport is required to contain the following
   fields:

   Incident
     @purpose
     IncidentID
     ReportTime
     Assessment -> Confidence
     Contact -> Role
     Contact -> Type
     Contact -> Name
     EventData
       DetectTime
       AdditionalData
         PhraudReport
           FraudType
           FraudedBrandName
           LureSource
           OriginatingSensor

5.2.  Wide-Spread Spam Report

   These following fields MUST be populated in an IODEF PhraudReport
   compliant Spam Activity Report:

   Incident
     @purpose
     IncidentID
     ReportTime
     Assessment -> Confidence
     Contact -> Role
     Contact -> Type
     Contact -> Name
     EventData
       DetectTime
       AdditionalData
         PhraudReport
           FraudType == spamreport
           LureSource
           OriginatingSensor
           EmailRecord

5.3.  Guidance on Usage

   It may be apparent that the mandatory attributes for a phishing
   activity report make for a quite sparse report.  As incident
   forensics and data analysis require detailed information, the
   originator of a PhraudReport should include any tidbit of information
   gleaned from the attack analysis.  Information that is considered
   sensitive can be marked as such using the restriction parameter of
   each data element.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used must ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity.

   The critical security concern is that phishing activity reports may
   be falsified or the PhraudReport may become corrupt during transit.
   In areas where transmission security or secrecy is necessary, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   receiving entity will determine the need, and mechanism, for this
   signature independently.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688]

   Registration request for the IODEF phishing namespace:

       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-phish-1.0

       Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
       document.

       XML: None.

   Registration request for the IODEF phishing extension XML schema:

           URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-phish-1.0

           Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of
           this document.

           XML: See the "Phishing Extensions Schema Definition" in the
           <Appendix A> section of this document.

8.  Contributors

   The extensions are an outgrowth of the Anti-Phishing Working Group
   (APWG) activities in data collection and sharing of phishing and
   other ecrime-ware.

   This document has received significant assistance from two groups
   addressing the phishing problem: members of the Anti-Phishing Working
   Group and participants in the Financial Services Technology
   Consortium's Counter-Phishing project.
