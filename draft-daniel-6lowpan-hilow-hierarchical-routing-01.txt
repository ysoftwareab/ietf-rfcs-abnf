1.  Introduction

   6LowPAN is a low-power wireless personal area network(LoWPAN)  which
   is comprised of the IEEE  802.15.4-2003 standard[ieee802.15.4]
   devices.  In [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-format], the interface
   identifier [RFC4291] for a 6LoWPAN device is based on the EUI-64
   [EUI64] address.  The interface identifier can be used for
   constructing routing tables for multi-hop routing in 6LoWPAN.
   However, considering the limited capabilities (low power, limited
   memory space, and small packet size) of 6LoWPAN devices and the large
   number of devices which is expected to be deployed in 6LoWPAN, the
   on-demand multi-hop routing with the use of the routing table and the
   EUI-64 identifier may have limitations of the scalability.

   One of the distinctive feature of 6LoWPAN is the capability of the
   dynamic assignment of 16-bit short addresses.  By utilizing this
   short address, hierarchical routing can be employed.  Even though
   hierarchical routing produces a sub-optimal routing path, it can
   significantly reduce the overhead of maintaining routing tables.

   This document defines a dynamic address assignment scheme and
   Hierarchical routing for 6LoWPAN (HiLow) based on the assignment.

2.  Terminology

      Association
         A IEEE 802.15.4 device can be assigned a dynamic 16 bit short
         address during an association operation with a neighbor device
         (or router) which is also called a parent.  After getting the
         short address, a device can communicate with its parent or
         child by using only the assigned short address.

      Coordinator
         A full-function device (FFD) which is the principal controller
         of a 6LoWPAN.  It is also called as PAN coordinator.  It MAY
         initiate the synchronization of the entire 6LoWPAN by
         transmitting beacons.

      Current Node
         When a node, a IEEE 802.15.4 device in a 6LoWPAN, receives a
         IPv6 packet, the node is called the current node in this
         document.

      Depth (D)
         The hop distance from the coordinator of a 6LoWPAN to the
         device.        The depth of the coordinator is 0.

      Disassociation
         The disassociation operation removes an existing association
         with its neighbor device.

         router.

      Full Function Device (FFD)
         A device implementing the complete protocol set of IEEE
         802.15.4.  It is capable of operating as a router (multi-hop
         packet forwarding) for its associated neighbors.

      Maximum Number of Children (MC)
         The maximum number of children which a parent can have.

      Neighbor Table
         A node maintains the neighbor table which has the information
         of neighbor devices in its personal operating space.

      PAN Id
         The 16 bit 6LoWPAN identifier which is administratively
         assigned to a 6LoWPAN.

      Personal Operating Space (POS)
         The area within the reception range of the wireless
         transmission of a IEEE 802.15.4 packet.

      Reduced Function Device (RFD)
         The IEEE 802.15.4 device of 6LoWPAN which does not have enough
         power and memory space for maintaining a routing table.

      Router
         a FFD which has the capability of routing packets to the next
         hop device in 6LoWPAN.

      (Short) Address
         A 16 bit address dynamically assigned to a device from its
         parent.  The short address is assumed if only 'address' is used
         in this document.

4.  Message Formats

   This document assumes that the multi-hop routing occurs in the
   adaptation layer by following the message format of 
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-format].  The following shows the message format
   used for the hierarchical routing.

   F: This 1-bit field SHALL be zero if the Final Destination Address is
      an IEEE extended 64 bit address (EUI-64), or 1 if it is a short
      16-bit addresses.

   Hops Left:  This 4-bit field SHALL be decremented by each forwarding
      node before sending this packet towards its next hop.  The packet
      is not forwarded any further if Hops Left is decremented to 0.
      The value 0xF is reserved and signifies an 8-bit Deep Hops Left
      field immediately following, and allows a source node to specify a
      hop limit greater than 14 hops.

   Originator Address:  This is the link-layer address of the
      Originator.

   Final Destination Address:  This is the link-layer address of the
      Final Destination.


5.  Dynamic Address Assignment for Hierarchical Routing

   One of the distinct features of 6LoWPAN is allowing dynamic
   configuration of the 16 bit short address in the MAC layer.  In
   addition to the EUI-64 address, a IEEE 802.15.4 device can be
   assigned a 16-bit short address after completing the association
   operation with its parent (or router).  This section describes the
   assignment of the dynamic address for the hierarchical routing which
   is specified in the next section.

   When a IEEE 802.15.4 device (or child) want to join a 6LoWPAN, it
   first tries to discover an existing 6LoWPAN.  IEEE 802.15.4 specifies
   active and passive scanning procedures for this discovery operation.
   By following either one of the scanning procedures, the child device
   determines whether there is a 6LoWPAN in its POS.  If there is no
   6LoWPAN in its POS, the child device becomes the initiator (or
   coordinator ) of a new 6LoWPAN and assigns it's short address by 0.
   Otherwise, the child device can find an existing neighbor device (or
   parent) which is already a member of the 6LoWPAN.  After finding a
   parent, the child tries to associate with the parent at the IEEE
   802.15.4 MAC layer, and receives a 16 bit short address from the
   parent if the association is successful.

   A parent assigns a 16 bit short address to a child by the assignment
   scheme described in Fig. 2.  The scheme requires one parameter, MC,
   the maximum number of children a parent can have.  If the parent does
   not have any child before this association, the new child becomes the
   first child and receives a short address by the following fomular:

Internet-Draft                    HiLow                        June 2007


   FC = MC * AP + 1

   , where FC is the first child address, and AP is the address of the
   parent.

   If the new child is not the first child of the parent, it receives
   the maximum address of the existing children of the parent plus one.
   For this assignment a router SHOULD maintain a neighbor table which
   has the information about it's children and parent.

   MC = 4

                       (0)              <= Coordinator
                     //   \\
                   /  |   |  \
                 /   /     \   \
               (1) (2)    (3)  (4)        <= Routers
              // \\ ......... // \\
           /  /   \ \       / /   \  \
         (5) (6) (7)(8)..(17)(18)(19)(20)
                        // \\
                     /  /   \  \
       ...........(69) (70)(71) (72)........

              <Fig. 2. The assignment scheme of the short address>

   By the nature of the scheme, it has no depth limitation and is
   efficient for gradually incremental networks.  The only parameter,
   MC, specifies the maximum number of children a router can have.  This
   scheme conforms well to the homogeneous 6LoWPAN in which the density
   of the devices is almost constant in the entire network.  The future
   revision of this draft will include the enhancement of adapting to
   the heterogeneous 6LoWPAN which has some high density areas and some
   low density areas in the network by relaxing NC.

6.  Routing Operations

   For the routing operation, the following symbols are defined.

   D   :   the destination
   C   :   the current node
   AC :  the address of the current node
   AP :  the address of the parent of the current node
   SA :  the set of the ascendant nodes of the destination
   SD :  the set of the descendant nodes of the destination
   AA (D, k) :  the address of the ascendant node of depth D of the node
      k
   DD : the depth of the destination
   DC : the depth of the current node

Internet-Draft                    HiLow                        June 2007


   First of all, it is assumed that every node knows it's own depth.
   When a node receives an IPv6 packet, it is called the current node as
   described in the teminology section.  The address of the parent of
   the current node, AP, can be calculated as follows:

   AP = [(AC - 1) / MC]

   , where [ ] is the symbol of the floor operation.  (For instance,
   [8.3] becomes 8.)

   The current node determines first whether it is either the ascendant
   or decendant nodes of the destination by using this fomular.  When
   the current node receives a packet, the next hop node to forward the
   packet can be calculated by the following three cases.

   If C is the member of SA:
      The next hop node  is AA(DC+1, D).
   If C is the member of SD:
      The next hop node  is AA(DC-1, C).
   Otherwise:
      The next hop node  is AA(DC-1, C).

7.  Route Maintenance

   The neighbor table of a node maintains the information of the parent
   and the children.  When a node loses the association from its parent,
   it SHOULD try to re-associate with its previous parent by utilizing
   the information in its neighbor table.  To identify the loss of the
   association, a node MAY use the periodical reception of beacons if
   the 6LoWPAN in the beacon-enabled mode.  Sometimes, the association
   cannot be recovered by the following reasons: drained battery, node's

   When the current node tries to forward a packet by using the
   hierarchical routing, and the next-hop node (one of the nodes in the 
   neighbor table)  is  not reachable for some  reason, it SHALL try to 
   recover the path or to report this forwarding error to the source of
   the packet.  The detailed operation is TBD.

8.  Interoperability

   The interoperability issues with the external IPv6 networks is out of
   scope of this document.  The use of the short address for mapping
   into the IPv6 128 bit address is TBD.  The interworking with the on-
   demand routing in the mesh network is TBD.

9.  IANA Consideration

   The proto_type in the message formats of Section 4 is already shown 
   in [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-format] and the same value is used to this 
   document. So, there is no IANA consideration.

10.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
