Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)  
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home
   routers.  Specifically, this MIB defines managed objects for both a
   connection speed tool and an ICMP "ping" tool between the Gateway and 
   devices on the LAN.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMP SMIv2.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be

1.  The SNMP Management Framework


   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The
       second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
       [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC

Internet Draft           Cable Gateway Device MIB          October 2002


       1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
       SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
       [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with CableLabs'
   CableHome specification process.

2.1.  CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.
   
2.2 Cable Gateway Device
    A cable gateway device passes data traffic between the cable
    operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and
    the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's
    residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the 
    WAN and LAN, the cable gateway device provides several services
    including a DHCP client and a DHCP server [RFC2131], a TFTP server
    [RFC1350], management services as enabled by SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent 
    compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and security services
    including stateful packet inspection firewall functionality and 
    software code image verification techniques.

2.3  Portal Services
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device.


3.  Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   CableHome compliant residential gateway devices.  The MIB is
   derived from the CableHome 1.0 specification [1].
   Please note that the CableHome 1.0 specification requires 
   residential gateways to implement SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 and to
   process IPv4 customer traffic. Design choices in this MIB reflect
   those requirements.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2129 [2].

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB is structured into two groups: 

      o    The cabhCtpConnSpeed group contains objects needed to 
           test the connection speed between the Gateway and a
           LAN device.

      o    The cabhCtpPing Group provides objects allowing the 
           manager to send an ICMP ping from the Gateway to a
           LAN device.
 
3.2 Management requirements

   In addition to the explicit requirements in this specification,
   the Cable Gateway MUST support all applicable CableHome and IETF
   requirements and MIB objects.

7. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.
