    Brand Indicator for Message Identification in X.509 certificates
                    draft-chuang-bimi-certificate-00

Abstract

   This document defines a X.509 certificate profile to distinguish
   those carrying logotypes and using email domain based authentication
   from other usages.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines the Extended Key Usage extension to define
   different usages of X.509 certificates.  These certificates may carry
   logotype as defined in [RFC3709] whose format is further refined in
   [RFC6170].  This document defines a new usage for these logotype
   carrying certificates to define an identify for Electronic Mail
   senders as defined in [RFC5321] and whose sending domain is
   authenticated by either Sender Policy Framework [RFC7208] or by
   Domain Key Identified Mail signatures [RFC6376].  This new profile
   distinguishes it from other certificate usages with electronic mail
   such as S/MIME [RFC5751].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  BIMI

   This section describes non-normatively the Brand Indicator for
   Message Identification (BIMI) electronic mail profile here.  Its
   intended that there will be a separate document that specifies the
   BIMI electronic mail sending and receiving protocol that describes
   the BIMI electronic mail headers, the sender validation process using
   domain authentication methods and the fetch of the BIMI certificates.
   BIMI follows the current practice of using domain based validation
   methods Sender Policy Framework [RFC7208] or by Domain Key Identified
   Mail signatures [RFC6376].  When an electronic mail sender has been
   validated this way, and with the fetched BIMI certificate, the
   receiver can proceed to validate the BIMI certificate with the sender
   domain as described in this document.  Upon successful validation,
   the receiver may choose to show the associated logotype and other

   identifying information contained in the BIMI certificate.  This
   document does not inform other uses of logotype with other email
   profiles such as S/MIME.

4.  BIMI Certificate Validation

   Before a BIMI certificate can be used to provide identification, the
   certificate path MUST be validated using the algorithm in [RFC5280].
   The BIMI certificate MUST contain an extended key usage extension
   specified for id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification as defined
   in Section 5.  It MUST also contain dnsName field of an X.509 Subject
   Alternative Name as specified in [RFC5280] and a subject LogoType as
   specified in [RFC3709].  The BIMI certificate domain name and the
   domain of the From or Sender header email address are compared.  If
   they match using the method specified in [RFC5280]), then the
   certificate identifies the sender of the electron mail and the
   certificate subject information may be used to describe the sender.

5.  BIMI Certificate Extension

   This document describes a new Extended Key Usage OID for the BIMI use
   case id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification.

   id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
   id-kp 31 }

6.  Security Considerations

   o  SPF maybe spoofed.  See considerations in [RFC7208].

   o  DKIM maybe spoofed.  See considerations in [RFC6376].

   o  LogoTypes identities may be spoofed.  See considerations in
      [RFC3709].

7.  IANA Considerations

   In Section 5 and the ASN.1 module identifier defined in Appendix A.
   IANA is kindly requested to reserve the following assignments for:

   o  The LAMPS-Bimi-Certificate-2018 ASN.1 module in the "SMI Security
      for PKIX Extended Key Purpose" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3).

   o  The BIMI certificate extended key usage (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.31).
