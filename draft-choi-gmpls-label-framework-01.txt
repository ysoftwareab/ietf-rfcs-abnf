1. Introduction 
   
  Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS from 
  supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to 
  include support of four new classes of interfaces and switching: 
  Layer 2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), 
  Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber Switch Capable (FSC) [1]. GMPLS 
  signaling specification [1] presents a functional description of the 
  extensions to MPLS signaling needed to support these new classes of 
  interfaces and switching. GMPLS Signaling such as RSVP-TE extensions 
  [2] and CR-LDP extensions [3] includes the specific formats and 
  mechanisms to support four classes of interfaces.  
   
  In MPLS, a label is a short, fixed length, locally significant 
  identifier which is used to identify a FEC. The label which is put on 
  a particular packet represents the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) 
  to which that packet is assigned [4]. This label value does not 
  necessarily imply a relationship to bandwidth or characteristics 
  (e.g., frequency band, time slot information, etc) data flows. On the 
  other hand, in GMPLS, to deal with the widening scope of MPLS into 
  the optical and time domain, several new forms of "label" are 
  required. These new forms of label are collectively referred to as a 
  "Generalized Label".  
   
  In GMPLS, the meanings of label are different from each other and 
  MUST be identify data flows with several switching type. Therefore, 
  the specific label encoding rule for each interface MUST be specified. 
  At present, the encoding rules for MPLS label and TDM label are 
  defined in related specifications [5],[6],[7]. In GMPLS-based optical 
  network, we SHOULD consider the multiple granularities that label 
  represents. So in GMPLS label hierarchy, data flows with small 
  bandwidth need to be merged and aggregated in fiber and/or wavelength 
  with large bandwidth. In this case, a Label Switched Path (LSP) such 
  as lambda LSP and fiber LSP includes several kinds of labels. However, 
  label format for optical interface such as wavelength and fiber is 
  defined but the specific encoding and mapping rule doesn't be defined. 
  Therefore, it is very important to specify the label allocation rule 
  that is taken optical characteristic into consideration and manage 
  the label with a different granularity.  
   
  To support GMPLS, we SHOULD extend label encoding rule defined the 
  existing MPLS label specification [5]. Therefore, in this draft, we 
  describe the concept and characteristics of Generalized Label for 
  GMPLS. We also discuss the format and considerations for label 
  encoding. Particularly we present the necessity of mapping rule at 
  ingress and egress switching interface where data flows with label of 
  a different granularity are merged into the aggregated data flow of 
  large bandwidth. Using this rule, we can control and manage data 
  flows with several labels inside GMPLS control domain.

2. Generalized Label 
 
2.1. The definition of Generalized Label 
   
  The Generalized Label extends the traditional label by allowing the   
  representation of not only labels which travel in-band with    
  associated data packets, but also labels which identify time-slots,   
  wavelengths, or space division multiplexed positions [1]. Therefore, 
  the Generalized Label includes the various meanings according to 
  different switching interfaces and implies the available bandwidth 
  for the corresponding data flow. In the followings, we summarize the 
  characteristics of Generalized Label in GMPLS signaling specification 
  [1]. 
   
     - Values used in Generalized Label field only have significance 
       between two neighbors, and the receiver may need to convert the 
       received value into a value that has local significance. 
      
     - A Generalized Label does not identify the "class" to which the 
       label belongs. This is implicit in the multiplexing 
       capabilities of the link on which the label is used. 
      
     - A Generalized Label only carries a single level of label, i.e., 
       it is non-hierarchical. When multiple levels of label (LSPs 
       within LSPs) are required, each LSP MUST be established 
       separately. 
      
     - Each Generalized Label object carries a variable length label   
       parameter. 
   
  In the following section, we describe various kinds of label.  
   
   
2.2. The Classification of Generalized Label 
   
2.2.1. label for packet switch capable (PSC) 
   
  Packet Switch Capable (PSC) interface can switch the received data on 
  a packet-by-packet basis. This interface recognizes packet/cell 
  boundaries and can forward data based on the content of the 
  packet/cell header. The label carried in the "shim" header [5] is 
  used in this interface. We define all kinds of label used in PSC 
  interface as "MPLS label". 
   
  - MPLS label 
    This label represents a generic MPLS label, a Frame Relay label, 
    or an ATM label. Generic MPLS labels and Frame Relay labels are 
    encoded right justified aligned in 32 bits (4 octets). ATM labels 
    are encoded with the VPI right justified in bits 0-15 and the VCI 
    right justified in bits 16-31 [1].

2.2.2. label for Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM) 
   
  Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM) interface forwards data based 
  on the data's time slot in a repeating cycle. TDM interface can 
  multiplex or demultiplex channels within a frame such as SDH payload. 
  The followings are the descriptions of label for TDM. 
   
  - SONET/SDH label 
    This label identifies the exact position (i.e. first time-slot) of 
    a particular VTx SPE, STS-x SPE or VC-x signal in a multiplexing 
    structure [6]. Multiplexing structure for SONET/SDH is based on 
    ANSI [8]/ITU-T G.707 [9] recommendations.  
  
  - G.709 label 
    In G.709 optical transport network, this label identifies the 
    exact position of a particular ODUj signal in an ODUk multiplexing 
    structure. To the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk, this label 
    supports the sub-levels of ODUk multiplexing. ODUk multiplexing 
    refers to multiplexing of ODUj (j = 1, 2) into an ODUk (k > j). 
    These multiplexing structures are based on ITU-T G.709 [10] 
    recommendation [7].  
      
   
2.2.3. label for Lambda Switch Capable(LSC) and Fiber Switch 
Capable(FSC)  
   
  Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) interface forwards data based on the 
  wavelength on which the data is received. Therefore, this interface 
  can recognize and switch individual lambdas within the interface. An 
  example of such an interface is an Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) switch 
  that can operate at the level of an individual wavelength. The 
  followings are the descriptions of label for Lambda Switch Capable 
  (LSC). 
   
  - lambda label 
    This label represents a single wavelength within a waveband (or 
    fiber). 
      
  - waveband label 
    Waveband represents a set of contiguous wavelengths which can be 
    switched together to a new waveband. So, this label represents a 
    single wavelength within a waveband (or fiber). 
      
    Note: in waveband switching, the switching interface can recognize 
    and switch individual waveband within the link (without 
    distinguishing lambda, channels or packets). 
   
  Fiber Switch Capable (FSC) interface forward data based on a position 
  of the data in the real world physical spaces. Therefore, this 
  interface can switch the entire contents to another interface 
  (without distinguishing lambdas, channels or packets). Fiber

  switching system switches at the granularity of an entire interface, 
  and can not exact individual lambdas within the interface. This 
  interface uses port label. 
   
  - port label 
    This label represents a single fiber in a bundle 
   
   
2.3. The relationship of label and switching interfaces 
   
  Carrying label information on a given link depends on the switching 
  capability of interface between the ends of the link [11]. The 
  relationship of labels and switching interfaces is shown in Figure 1.

2.4. Generalized Label Hierarchy 
   
  In GMPLS-based optical network, the functionality to simultaneously 
  switch different levels of granularity inside a given network can be 
  supported. Therefore, GMPLS label makes a hierarchical architecture. 
   
  The label hierarchy of GMPLS is shown in Figure 2. At the top of the 
  hierarchy are nodes that do fiber switching using port label of Fiber 
  Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces. Underneath are nodes that do OXC 
  switching using lambda (waveband) label of Lambda Switch Capable 
  (LSC) interfaces, followed by TDM time slot switching such as SONET, 
  SDH and ADM using SONET/SDH label of Time Division Multiplex Capable 
  (TDM) interfaces, and finally, nodes that do packet switching using

  The data flows that have MPLS shim header are transferred through a 
  packet LSP that originates between two packet switches. The data 
  flows are aggregated in TDM switch such as SONET and SDH. The 
  aggregated data flows with new SONET/SDH label are multiplexed inside 
  a TDM time slot LSP between two TDM switches. Similarly, the 
  multiplexed data flows with new lambda (waveband) label can be 
  transferred inside a lambda LSP that originates between two lambda 
  switches. Finally the data flows with new port label can be 
  transferred inside a fiber LSP that originates between two fiber 
  switches. Reversely, these data flows MUST be recovered in lower 
  switching interface using label information. Therefore, using GMPLS 
  signaling each switching interface determines the label value to use

  and keeps the mapping information between label and data flow. In 
  particular, when each data flow with small bandwidth is merged into a 
  data flow with large bandwidth, ingress and egress switching 
  interface SHOULD know the information that data flows are multiplexed 
  and demultiplexed in a synchronous and/or asynchronous manner for 
  sharing resource (i.e., wavelength etc), see Section 4.

3.1. Generalized Label Format 
   
  As currently proposed in GMPLS signaling specification [1], the 
  Generalized Label has the following format.  
 
     0                   1                   2                   3

    |                              ...                              |

        Label: Variable 
   
  Generalized Label carries label information of variable length. The 
  interpretation of this field depends on the type of the link over 
  which the label is used. Therefore, according to classes of interface 
  and switching, the rule for label encoding MUST be specified. In the 
  following section, we discuss the details of label encoding for each 
  switching capable interface.

        Label: 32 bits 
   
  This label information indicates port/fiber or lambda to be used, 
  from the perspective of the sender of the object/TLV in GMPLS 
  signaling [2], [3].   
   
3.4.2. lambda label encoding 
   
  Lambda label encoding SHOULD consider the following attributes that 
  represent lambda characteristics. 
   
  - The wavelength of the selected lambda (Frequency band): This value 
    can imply bandwidth for the corresponding data flow. 
  - Modulation (WDM, SCM) 
  - Additional information 
   
  We will define the concrete flag and field for lambda label encoding 
  in the next time. 
   
3.4.3. waveband label encoding 
   
  As currently defined in [1], the waveband label space definition is 
  suitable and does not require any modification or extension. In the 
  context of waveband switching, the generalized label has the 
  following format: 
   
    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   
        Waveband Id: 32 bits 
   
           A waveband identifier.  The value is selected by the sender 
           and reused in all subsequent related messages. 
   
        Start Label: 32 bits 
   
           Indicates the channel identifier of the lowest value 
           wavelength making up the waveband, from the object/TLV 
           sender's perspective.

        End Label: 32 bits 
   
           Indicates the channel identifier of the highest value 
           wavelength making up the waveband, from the object/TLV 
           sender's perspective. 
   
  Channel identifiers of start label and end label use the same label 
  parameter that will be defined in lambda label encoding (section 
  3.4.2). 
   
3.4.4. port label encoding 
   
  Similar to lambda label encoding, port label encoding SHOULD consider 
  attributes that represent fiber characteristics. 
   
  We will define the concrete flag and field for lambda label encoding 
  in the next time. 
   
   
4. Considerations for implementation 
   
  - Multiplexing in optical switching interface 
   
  Let consider the case that data flows with label of a different 
  granularity are merged into the aggregated data flow of large 
  bandwidth in optical switching interface such as LSC and FSC. Figure 
  3 represents a simple example of multiplexing in OXC with LSC. Each 
  switch performs multiplexing and demultiplexing for the purpose of 
  sharing optical resource. These flows may be merged in a synchronous 
  or/and synchronous manner of time domain according to switching 
  schemes. Similar to label stacking, several flows with label are 
  stacked. For TDM, label can represent the allocated time slot of the 
  TDM hierarchy in use. Otherwise, each switching interface SHOULD have 
  mapping information that each flow is located at a certain point of 
  optical resource (e.g., wavelength etc). Therefore, mapping rule for 
  implementation SHOULD be defined.

  - Unnumbered link and link bundling

  Support of unnumbered link [13] has been introduced to address the 
  scalability issues of assigning IP address to earn link of an optical 
  switch. This is because the link of an optical switch may correspond 
  to a fiber, lambda, or even TDM channel, depending on the switching 
  granularity of the link. This reduces the management effort in 
  configuring IP addresses and tracking allocated IP addresses, 
  especially with optical network having large numbers of links. 
   
  Link bundling [14] can be used to aggregate multiple parallel links 
  into a single "bundled link" for IGP scaling purposes. This is 
  important for optical networks, as hundreds of parallel fibers will 
  be developed between switches and each fiber may obtain hundreds of 
  wavelengths.  
   
  In GMPLS label encoding, we MAY consider to represent unnumbered link 
  and link bundling as "label". 
   
  - Label stacking 
   
  The traditional MPLS supports label stacking that is a more general 
  model in which a labeled packet carries a number of labels, organized 
  as a last-in, first-out stack [4]. This concept can be applied to the 
  GMPLS LSP hierarchy.

Appendix. Summary of GMPLS label encoding specifications 
   
1. label encoding for packet switching capable (PSC) link [5] 
   
  The label stack is represented as a sequence of "label stack    
  entries".  Each label stack entry is represented by 4 octets.  The 
  format of the label for packet switching capable (PSC) link is: 
   
 0                   1                   2                   3 
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Label 
|                Label                  | Exp |S|       TTL     | Stack 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Entry 
 
                      Label:  Label Value, 20 bits 
                      Exp:    Experimental Use, 3 bits 
                      S:      Bottom of Stack, 1 bit 
                      TTL:    Time to Live, 8 bits 
   
   
  The label stack entries appear AFTER the data link layer headers, but   
  BEFORE any network layer headers.  The top of the label stack appears   
  earliest in the packet, and the bottom appears latest.  The network   
  layer packet immediately follows the label stack entry which has the   
  S bit set. 
   
  The details of each label entry are shown in [5]. 
   
2. label encoding for TDM time slot  
   
2.1 label encoding for SONET/SDH [6] 
   
  The format of the label for SONET and/or SDH TDM-LSR link is: 
   
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |               S               |   U   |   K   |   L   |   M   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   
  This is an extension of the (K, L, M) numbering scheme defined in 
  [15]. The higher order numbering scheme defined in [15] is not used. 
   
  Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the parent 
  node in the multiplex structure. Branches are considered as numbered 
  in increasing order, starting from the top of the multiplexing 
  structure. The numbering starts at 1, zero is used to indicate a non-
  significant or ignored field. 
   
  When a field is not significant or ignored in a particular context    
  it MUST be set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when   
  received.

  The higher order SONET/SDH LSP behaves as a "virtual link" with a 
  given bandwidth (e.g. VC-3), it may also be used as a Forwarding 
  Adjacency. A lower order SONET/SDH LSP can be established through 
  that higher order LSP. Since a label is local to a (virtual) link, 
  the highest part of that label (i.e. the S, U and K fields) is non-
  significant and is set to zero, i.e. the label is "0,0,0,L,M". 
  Similarly, if the structure of the lower order LSP is unknown or not 
  relevant, the lowest part of that label (i.e. the L and M fields) is 
  non-significant and is set to zero, i.e. the label is "S,U,K,0,0". 
   
      
2.2 label encoding for G.709 optical transport network [7] 
   
  The format of the label for the G.709 Digital Path Layer label or 
  ODUk label is: 
   
   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+ 
  |                   Reserved                |     t3    | t2  |t1| 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+ 
   
  The specification of the three fields t1, t2 and t3 self-consistently 
  characterizes the ODUk label space. The value space of the t1, t2 and 
  t3 fields is defined as follows: 
   
     1. t1 (1-bit): 
          - t1=1 indicates an ODU1 signal. 
          - t1 is not significant for the other ODUk signal types(t1=0). 
   
     2. t2 (3-bit): 
          - t2=1 indicates a not further sub-divided ODU2 signal. 
          - t2=2->5 indicates the tributary slot (t2th-2) used by the 
            ODU1 in an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2 (via OPU2). 
          - t2 is not significant for an ODU3 (t2=0). 
   
     3. t3 (6-bit): 
          - t3=1 indicates a not further sub-divided ODU3 signal. 
          - t3=2->17 indicates the tributary slot (t3th-1) used by the 
            ODU1 in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3). 
          - t3=18->33 indicates the tributary slot (t3th-17) used by 
            the ODU2 in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3). 
   
     Note: in case of ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing, 4 labels are 
     required to identify the 4 tributary slots used by the ODU2; these 
     tributary time slots have to be allocated in ascending order.
