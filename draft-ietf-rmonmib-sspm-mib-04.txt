INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a method of describing Synthetic Sources
   for Performance Monitoring (SSPM). This is useful within the RMON
   framework for performance monitoring in the cases where it is
   desireable to inject packets into the network for the purpose of
   monitoring their performance with the other MIBs in that framework.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [xx].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

      o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
      called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
      1904 [7].

      o Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
      The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
      described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

      o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

      o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
      [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [16].

3. Overview

   This document defines a MIB for the purpose of remotely controlling
   synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks for the purpose of
   enhancing remote performance monitoring capabilities within IP
   networks and services.  Much work within the IETF exists related to
   performance monitoring.  One interesting aspect of this body of work
   is that it does not explicitly define an 'active' probe capability.
   An active probe capability is complimentary to existing capabilities,
   and this MIB is developed to fill this void.

   3.1 Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

      o 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for
      the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the
      performance of the system.  A performance monitoring system is
      comprised of a) traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data
      reduction, and d) reporting.  The traffic generators may be
      natural sources, synthetic sources or intrusive sources.

      o A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded software program
      which generates a data packet (or packets) and injects it (them)
      onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing server solely
      in support of a performance monitoring function.  A synthetic
      source may talk intrusively to existing application servers.

   The design goals for this MIB are:

      o Compliment the overall performance management architecture being

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


      defined within the RMONMIB WG - this MIB is defined within the
      context of the APM-MIB [38].

      o Extensibility - the MIB should be easily extended to include a
      greater set of protocols and applications for performance
      monitoring purposes.

      o Flexible - it should support both round trip and one way
      measurements.

      o Security - the control of the source and sink of traffic is
      handled by a management application and communication is
      recommended via SNMPv3.

   This document is organized as follows.  The next section discusses
   the relationship of this MIB to other MIBs from the RMONMIB and
   DISMAN working groups.  Then the structure of the MIB is discussed.
   Finally, the MIB definitions are given.

4. Relationship to other MIBs

   This MIB is designed to be used in conjunction with the RMON MIB
   Working Groups two other MIBs for application performance
   measurement: Application Performance Measurement MIB and Transport
   Performance Metrics MIB. These MIBs define reporting capabilities for
   that framework. The intent of this MIB is to define a method for
   injecting packets into the network utilizing probe capabilities
   defined in the base MIBs and measured with the reporting MIBs.

   Specifically, this MIB uses the AppLocalIndex as defined in the APM-
   MIB to map measurement configuration information to defintion and
   reporting structures defined in the APM-MIB.

5. Relationship to Other Work

   Much work has already occurred within the IETF which has a direct
   bearing on the development of active performance probe definitions.
   This body of work is addressed in various working groups over the
   years.  In this section we focus our attention to the work of a) the
   IPPM working group, b) the DISMAN working group, c) the RMON working
   group, d) the ApplMIB working group, and e) the RTFM working group.

5.1 IPPM

   The IPPM working group has defined in detail a set of performance
   metrics, sampling techniques and associated statistics for transport-
   level, or connectivity-level, measurements.  The IPPM framework
   document [22] discusses numerous issues around sampling techniques,

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


   clock accuracy, resolution and skew, wire time versus host time,
   error analysis, etc.  Much of these are considerations for
   Configuration and Implementation Issues discussed below.  The IPPM
   working group has defined several metrics and their associated
   statistics, including

      + a connectivity metric [23]

      + one-way delay metric [24]

      + one-way loss metric [25]

      + round trip delay and loss metrics [26]

      + delay variation metric [27]

      + a streaming media metric [28]

      + a throughput metric [29] and [30], and

      + others are under development.

   These (or a subset) could form the basis for a set of active,
   connectivity-level, probe types designed for the purpose of
   monitoring the quality of transport services.  A consideration of
   some of these metrics may form a set of work activities and a set of
   early deliverables out of a group developing an active probe
   capability.

   During the early development of the SSPM-MIB, it became apparent that
   a one-way measurement protocol was required in order for the ssmpMib
   to control.  This led to the current work with the IPPM WG on the
   development of the One-Way Measurement Protocol (OWDP) [31].  This
   protocol work includes both the measurement protocol itself, as well
   as the development of a seperate control protocol.  This later
   control protocol is rendundant with the current work on the SSPM-MIB,
   so it appears that the IPPM WG will seperate their protocol into two
   seperate drafts, one for the measurement protocol and one for the
   control protocol.  But this remains to be finally agreed to in the
   working group.

5.2 DISMAN

   The DISMAN working group is defining a set of 'active' tools for
   remote management.  Of relevance to this draft are:

      + the pingMIB [32],




C. Kalbfleisch              Expires Dec 2002                    [Page 5]





INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


      + the DNS Lookup MIB [32],

      + the tracerouteMIB [32],

      + the scriptMIB [33], and

      + the expressionMIB [34].

   The pingMIB and tracerouteMIB define an active probe capability,
   primarily for the remote determination of path and path connectivity.
   There are some performance related metrics collected from the pingMIB
   and one could conceivably use these measurements for the evaluation
   of a limited set of performance statistics.  But there is a
   fundamental difference in determining connectivity versus determining
   the quality of that connectivity.  However, in the context of
   performance monitoring, a fault can be viewed as not performing at
   all.  Therefore, they should both be monitored with the same probes
   to reduce network traffic.  This was discussed further in the
   Architecture section above.

   The DNS Lookup MIB also includes some probe-like capabilities and
   performance time measurements for the DNS lookup.  This could be used
   to suggest details of a related session-level, active probe.

   Also mentioned in the Architecture section above, the scriptsMIB
   allows a network management application to distribute and manage
   scripts to remote devices.  Conceivably, these scripts could be
   designed to run a set of active probe monitors on remote devices.

5.3 RMON

   The RMON working group has developed a extensive, passive monitoring
   capability defined in [35] and [36] as well as additional MIB
   modules.  Initially, the monitors collected statistics at the MAC
   layer, but has now been extended to high-layer statistics.  Higher-
   layer statistics are identified through the definition of a Protocol
   Directory [36].

   Within this context (and discussed within the Architecture Section
   above), the development of an active traffic source for performance
   monitoring fits well within the overall performance monitoring
   architecture being defined within the RMON WG.

5.4 ApplMIB

   The ApplMIB working group defined a series of MIBs which monitor
   various aspects of applications, processes and services.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


   The System Application MIB [41] describes a basic set of managed
   objects for fault, configuration and performance management of
   applications from a systems perspective.  More specifically, the
   managed objects it defines are restricted to information that can be
   determined from the system itself and which does not require special
   instrumentation within the applications to make the information
   available.

   The Application MIB [42] complements the System Application MIB,
   providing for the management of applications' common attributes which
   could not typically be observed without the cooperation of the
   software being managed. There are attributes which provide
   information on application and communication performance.

   The WWW MIB [43] describes a set of objects for managing networked
   services in the Internet Community, particularly World Wide Web (WWW)
   services. Performance attributes are available for the information
   about each WWW service, each type of request, each type of response
   and top accessed documents.

   In the development of synthetic application-level probes,
   consideration should be given to the relationship of the application
   MIBs to the measurements being performed through a synthetic
   application-level probe.  Similar, cross-indexing issues arise within
   the context of the RMON monitoring and synthetic application-level
   active probes.

5.5 SNMPCONF

   The snmpconf working group will create a Best Current Practices
   document [44] which outlines the most effective methods for using the
   SNMP Framework to accomplish configuration management.  The scope of
   the work will include recommendations for device specific as well as
   network-wide (Policy) configuration.  The group is also chartered to
   write any MIB modules necessary to facilitate configuration
   management, specifically they will write a MIB module which describes
   a network entities capabilities and capacities which can be used by
   management entities making policy decisions at a network level or
   device specific level.

   Currently the snmpconf working group is focused on the SNMP
   Configuration MIB for policy [45].  For synthetic probes there is
   need to have configuration of a) a single probe, b) several probes,
   c) source and destination probes and d) intermediate probes.  In
   addition, it may be necessary to configure any or all of these
   combinations simultaneously.  It is hoped that the work of snmpconf
   will suffice.  The scripting language defined by the SNMP
   Configuration MIB could allow for active monitoring to be activated

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Jun 2002


   and configured from a policy management script.  Further, the results
   of active monitoring could become arguments in further policy
   decisions.  This notion is reflected in the decision flow outlined in
   Figure 5 below.

5.6 RTFM

   The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group is
   concerned with issues relating to traffic flow measurements, usage
   reporting for network traffic and Internet accounting.  Various
   documents exist which describe requirements [46], traffic flow
   measurement architectures [47], and a traffic flow MIB [48].  The
   work in this group is focused on passive measurements of user
   traffic.  As such, its work is related to the monitoring work within
   the RMON WG.  Fundamentally, their attention has not been concerned
   with methods of active traffic generation.

5.7 Relationship to Other Work: Summary

   In summary, the development of an active traffic generation
   capability primarily for the purpose of performance monitoring should
   draw upon various activities, both past and present within the IETF.
   Figure 1 shows the relationship of the various work activities
   briefly touched upon in this section.

6. MIB Structure

   This section presents the structure of the MIB. The objects are
   arranged into the following groups:

      o general information

      o source configuration

      o sink configuration


6.1.  general information
   This section provides general information about the capabilities of
   the probe. Currently this information is related to the resolution of
   the probe clock and its source.

6.2.  source configuration
   The source is configured with a pair of tables. The first,
   sspmSourceProfileTable, defines a set of profiles for monitoring.
   These profiles are then used by the second table,
   sspmSourceControlTable, to instantiate a specific measurement.  This
   MIB takes an IP centric view of the configuration of the measurement.

6.3.  sink configuration
   Configures the sink for measurements. If the test is round-trip then
   this table is on the same probe as the source configuration. If the
   test is one-way then the table is on a different probe. The
   sspmSinkInstance is a unique identifier for the entry per probe.
   Additional attributes are provided for test type and source of the
   test to uniquely identifier entries in the table.

   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The nature of the MIB is that it defines objects to allow packets to
   be injected into the network for the purpose of measuring some
   performance characteristics. There are some attributes which allow
   specifically configuring various fields in Link and IP layer packets.
   These attributes are: sspmSourceProfileTOS,
   sspmSourceProfileFlowLabel, sspmSourceProfileTTL,
   sspmSourceProfileNoFrag and sspmSourceProfile8021Tagging.

   There are some attributes which configure username and password
   information for some application level protocols. Access to these
   attributes may provide unauthorized use of resources. These
   attributes are: sspmSourceProfileUsername and
   sspmSourceProfilePassword.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

12. Issues

   This section will ultimately be removed from the document.  It
   captures a list of open issues that need to be resolved as this
   document is discussed. If someone feels strongly about any of the
   open issues, please send a proposal to the rmon MIB mailing list.

   Open Issues


      o none

   Resolved Issues

      o Do we need sspmSourceControlEnabled? no discussion. left in.
      draft 4.

      o Need to restructure tables to allow reuse per Lester. Issue 7.
      Resolved in draft 3.

      o Should we allow sspmSourceFrequency to be specified in
      MicroSeconds?  Does this make the system suseptible to DOS
      attacks? What is a reasonable bound? - Issue 1. Added
      sspmMinFrequency

      o What should be the max and min allowed values for
      sspmSourcePacketSize?  Should the size only be for the application
      payload? Maybe not since there are non-application based payloads.
      But what if the min size is smaller than the min packet allowed by
      the network? Should we handle that case?  issue 12 - discuss on
      list. Added clarifying text.

      o Combined extention tables

      o User/Pass are optional in conformance statement

      o Should sspmClockSource define various levels of ntp resolution?
      issue 8 - no, but apm or tpm need to define TC. Defined TC.

      o What should happen if the URL specified in
      sspmSourcePacketFillValue can not be retrieved? The agent could
      fetch the URL once when the row status is set to active state.
      Then the row status could change notReady if the fetch fails.
      issue 11 - clarify text as written here.

      o Should "random" in the sspmSourceSamplingDistribution be renamed
      to "exponential"? Issue 2. REnamed to Poisson. Clarified
      description

      o Should "linear" be added as a sspmSourceSamplingDistribution
      type to incidate the time is incremented by 1? Or can this be done
      with "deterministic"? Issue 2. Left as deterministic. Clarified
      description.

      o Should the packet fill for URL fail if the probe does not
      support that ability? - issue 9 - have status change to active
      fail with inconsistent value. Added clarifying text to
      description.

      o There is currently no object to indicate the 16-bit DS' PHB ID.
      (Cole) issue 10 - Robert to provide text. Not added.

      o Need some text for sspmSourceDestAddressType to restrict
      addresses to to IPv4 only. - Issue 5. Proposal - don't restrict.
      Lester to define additional attributes.

      o Should we more fully specify the quality characteristics of the
      clock, e.g., drift, skew ? - Resolved in 01 draft. Added
      sspmClockMaxSkew

      o Need to flush out conformance and compliance.

      o Should we adopt a more flexible scheduling mechanism as found in
      [22] or stict with enumeration.  [22] E. Stephan, IP measurement
      MIB, <draft-stephan-ippm-mib-00.txt>.

      o Should Appl Layer Parameter be defined. Could need to set more
      attributes for this. One option is a follow on MIB say for HTTP to
      set header values, etc.

      o sspmApplLayerExtentionParameter - We also discussed deleteing
      this attribute and instead describing how one might define such an
      attribute in a private extention in the appendix of this ID.

      o May need to add application specific configuration tables. At
      least need to configure which attributes are part of the protocol
      header or body.  Defer to protocol specific MIB extentions.

      o What are the requirements for indexing on the history table. Do
      we want to add an additional index to allow query based on a
      subset of something like WEB? Resolved. Deleted history tables.

      o Current definition of sspmSourceType and sspmSinkType prevent
      configuration of measurements that are not reportable in apm/tpm.
      May want to add some OID type to indicate non-apLocalIndex. Then
      there is no reporting and breaks indexing. Moved to resolved.

      o start time - time to start some test. Controlled by the control
      object to enable

      o end time - when test ends. Purhaps duration is a better term

      o Should start/end times be specified? Or should these be left to
      the NMS and or implementation of the schedule/script MIBs to set
      the control bit on/off.

      o repeat time - for configuing test which run once per hour, day,
      week, etc.  Perhaps this can/should be done with the DISMAN
      shedule MIB.

      o This was is a reference to a performance monitoring protocol.  (
      http://telesto.advanced.org/~kalidindi/STR/owdp.html  ).  Need to
      consider if the constructs described can be implemented with this
      MIB.




13. Change Log

   Changes from -03 to -04

      o Corrected a number of grammar and spelling errors.

      o Corrected syntax of compliance information.

      o Restructured sspmSourceTable into sspmSourceProfileTable and
        sspmSourceControlTable.
