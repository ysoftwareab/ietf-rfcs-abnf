                           Special-Use Labels
          draft-moonesamy-dnsop-special-use-label-registry-00

Abstract

   This document describes what it means to say that a label is reserved
   for special use, when reserving such a label is appropriate, and the
   procedure for doing so.  It establishes an IANA registry for such
   special-use labels, and seeds it with entries for some of the already
   established special labels.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) rules for an Internet host name are
   specified in [RFC0952] [RFC0952] and [RFC1123] [RFC1123].  Underscore
   scoping [ID.draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf] [ID.draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf]
   was introduced as an alternative to circumvent the deployment issues
   of using a new RR type [RFC1034] [RFC1034].  Some applications, e.g.
   web browsers, do not consider those underscore names as valid they do
   not adhere to the rules for a host name [RFC1123].  This document
   defines a registry to reserve special-use labels for cases where such
   labels are needed as a workaround.

2.  Security Considerations

   A wildcard such as *.example.com could match a host name where a
   special-use label is prepended to the domain name.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The DNS Special-Use Label registry entries consist of two fields:
   Label, RR type, and Reference.  The Label has to conform to DNS rules
   for a label as defined in [RFC1034].  The initial assignment is as
   follows:

        +---------------------------------------+---------+------------+
        | Label                                 | RR Type | Reference  |
        +---------------------------------------+---------+------------+
        | root-key-sentinel-is-ta-<key-tag>     |  A      | [KSK-roll] |
        | root-key-sentinel-is-ta-<key-tag>     |  AAAA   | [KSK-roll] |
        | root-key-sentinel-not-ta-<key-tag>    |  A      | [KSK-roll] |
        | root-key-sentinel-not-ta-<key-tag>    |  AAAA   | [KSK-roll] |
        +---------------------------------------+---------+------------+

3.1.  Registration Procedures

   The registration policy for this registry is "IETF Review" [RFC8126]
   [RFC8126].  The registrant of the label should provide the following
   information:

   o  Label

   o  RR Type

   o  Reference
