                        draft-gao-crossdomain-access-00.txt 


    Abstract 

       Access control is one of the major security concerns for Low power 
       and Lossy Networks (LLN). As LLNs are normally highly distributed and 
       resource-constrained, conventional access control systems that rely 
       on the central Certificate Authority (CA) and sophisticated 
       cryptographic algorithms are not suitable for them. Furthermore, LLNs 
       may consist of embedded devices with limited power, memory, and 
       processing resources from different manufacturers or service 
       providers. Due to the different specifications and designs, it is 
       difficult to ensure consistency in security implementation among all 
       devices. This document proposes a distributed access control method 
       based on local authorization decisions, which takes both the single-
       domain and the multi-domain situation into account.

      1. Introduction 

       LLNs are typically composed of many embedded devices with limited 
       power, memory, and processing resources interconnected by a variety 
       of links, such as IEEE 802.15.4 or Low Power WiFi [I-D.ietf-roll-
       terminology], [RFC6550]. The low-cost and low-power field devices 
       have the ability to cooperatively perceive characteristics of the 
       physical world, which can provide a wide scope of applications, 
       including intelligent buildings, industrial monitoring [RFC5673], 
       battlefield surveillance [Newman2010]. 

       LLNs are usually deployed in a highly distributed manner in an open 
       and remote environment. In this case, LLNs are highly vulnerable to 
       various attacks due to the open, distributed and dynamic nature. 
       Consequently, ensuring the quickly establishment and maintenance of 
       network security among these deployed devices becomes one of key 
       challenges [I-D.ietf-roll-security-threats]. 

       Access control is the first line of defense in LLNs, which can be 
       defined as the process of limiting access to sensitive information 
       only to trusted field devices. Granting proper access to legitimate 
       devices is essential to ensure correct operation of LLNs. A proper 
       design of an access control ensures that information is accessible 
       only to any authorized and trustworthy devices. Different models of 
       access control have been proposed over the years [Xiao2005], 
       [Yang2011]. However, most access control models were developed for 
       some specific systems not suitable for a resource-constrained system 
       such as a LLN. 

       In this document, a distributed and cross-domain access control 
       method based on local authorization decisions is proposed and 
       analyzed. 

      2. Problem statement 

       Certain supports are required for the access control that targets 
       LLNs. In the following, we summarize the unique challenges of LLNs to 
       design a proper access control system. 

       Firstly, LLNs are often deployed in a remote and open environment. It 
       is difficult to prevent foreign devices from being physically present 
       in the network, especially when they remain passive. Besides, 
       legitimate field devices that are unattended can be physically 
       compromised. Secondly, LLNs usually rely on multi-hop wireless 
       channels for communication. As wireless communication uses a 
       broadcast channel, eavesdropping by foreign or compromised nodes 
       cannot be prevented. Thirdly, fixed infrastructure in LLNs is not a

       necessary component. As a result, conventional access control models, 
       such as role-based access control (RBAC) [Sandhu1996], which 
       generally rely on a central Certificate Authority (CA) for 
       authorization, are not applicable. Fourthly, sophisticated 
       cryptographic methods and authentication mechanisms require high 
       memory usage and power consumption because of their complex 
       algorithms and processes [Yu2009], which is not practical for a 
       resource-constrained LLN. Finally, LLNs may consist of embedded 
       devices from two or more manufacturers. Due to the different 
       specifications and designs, it is difficult to ensure consistency in 
       security implementation among all sensor nodes. This gives rise to 
       the need for cross-domain access control, which is also considered in 
       our proposed design. 

       Sections 3 to Section 5 provide the solutions to the problems 
       mentioned above. 

      3. Basic framework of access control model 

       In this paper, we propose a distributed and fine-grained access 
       control model based on the RBAC. The basic framework of our model is 
       presented in Fig. 1. Our main idea is that introducing security level 
       based on centrality degree attributes and other security policies 
       into the RBAC model to make it practical for LLNs.

       The access control framework consists of the following components:

       Administrators (A): The entities that include constraints to adjust 
       the set of permissions, privileges, centrality degree, security level 
       and security policies. 

       Permissions (PE): A description of authorized interactions that 
       determine whether a new access request can be granted. The results of 
       the permissions can be fed back to the administrators, enabling 
       dynamic adjustment of constraints for the network. 

       Privileges (PR): The rights approved in the network, which are 
       related to the users' roles.  

       Constraints (C): The clauses that can modify security policies, 
       security level and centrality degree, which is instituted by the 
       administrators. 

       Security Level (SL): The measure for the security of a node. The 
       security level is also a part of the input to the calculation and 
       granting of permissions. It is associated with specific roles. 

       Centrality Degree (CD): It is used to analyze the relations among the 
       entities in the network, which represents the importance of the 
       access point. 

       Security Policies (SP): A set of rules used to limit the security 
       risk. 

       Users (U): The entities who want to join the network. In this model, 
       the users are simply embedded devices in LLNs. 

       Roles (R): The job functions that describe the authority and 
       responsibility of the users. A user who joins the network must be 
       assigned to a specific role. 

      4. Centrality degree evaluation 

       In our model, security level is used to measure for the security of a 
       node. It consists of centrality degree and other conventional 
       security policies, such as key encryption-decryption algorithm and 
       trust evaluation methods. The conventional security policies are not 
       specified in this document. 

       The concept of centrality degree comes from social networks. It is 
       used to analyze the relations among the entities in the network. For 
       example, a higher centrality degree for a given person may imply that 
       he attracts more attention than usual from other people. Instead of 
       using the centrality degree to measure the relations between devices,

       we utilize it in our access control model to evaluate the security 
       level when adopting the distributed systems. In this section, we 
       propose a method to measure the device's centrality degree. As is 
       shown in Fig. 2, the device's centrality degree in the network is 
       composed of the access rank and the number of the device's neighbors. 
       The access rank can be defined as the set of field devices which have 
       the same routing distance from the sink node (device S). For example, 
       the access rank of device E is ranked at layer two, and device E has 
       four neighbors which are devices B, D, F and I. Based on this 
       information, we propose the following method to evaluate the 
       centrality degree of device i, CD(i): 

                          CD(i)=w* Max(R(N))/R(i)+k*|N(i)|               (1) 

       where w + k = 1, w > 0, k > 0. The function R(i) represents the 
       access rank of device i. The quantity N is the set of devices in the 
       network, Max(R(N)) represents the largest value of access rank in the 
       network, and |N(i)| is the number of the neighbors of device i.

       There are two main reasons for choosing this mechanism for assessing 
       the security level. First, it is intuitive that with a shorter 
       distance to the sink node, a malicious device can be more successful 
       in intercepting communications and launching attacks. Secondly, a

       malicious device with more neighbors generally has higher influence 
       in the network. A malicious device may use this influence to quickly 
       affect the network performance by launching an attack. 

      5. Access control in a single-domain situation 

       The security level is a crucial parameter for determining whether a 
       device is acceptable. The higher the security level a device has, the 
       easier it can join the network.  

       Not all devices in the network have the privilege to allow the newly 
       arrived device to join the network. Depending on the context, this 
       privilege is set by the administrators. In addition, the proposed 
       model is a flexible access control model. It is not only designed for 
       LLNs without central CA for authorization, but is also an optional 
       scheme for the one that has the complete authentication system. If a 
       newly arriving device has the key-join (a key used to join the 
       network), it will obtain a high security level immediately. 

       In a single domain, each device has the same security policies. The 
       process that a newly arriving device follows to join LLNs in a single 
       domain is shown in Fig. 3. The detailed descriptions are given as 
       follows: 

       1) The newly arriving device (NAD) sends the access request to the 
          destination device (DD). In this model, the access request is a 
          4-ary tuple, and is denoted as U = <u-id, r, t, key-join>, where 
          u-id is the source device's ID, r is the role that the device 
          request to activate, and t is the timestamp. Furthermore, the 
          request device may include the key-join if it has one. 

       2) When the destination device receives the request, it should check 
          whether it has the rights to allow the new device to join the 
          network. If it has, it will send a security level request to the 
          neighbors of the new device (NND) to obtain their recommendations 
          (broadcast the request with finite TTL). 

       3) The devices that receive the security level request will check 
          whether they are the requested objects. If they are, they will 
          send a reply including a variety of security metrics. Otherwise, 
          they simply keep silent. 

       4) After obtaining the recommendations, the destination device to 
          compute the overall security level of the new device. In addition, 
          the new device that has the key-join must be considered as owning 
          a high security level when it has no history records in the 
          network.

    Internet-Draft    Cross-domain Access Control in LLN     January 2014 
     

       5) The destination device should decide whether to grant permission 
          to the newly arriving device. As the destination device may be 
          corrupted, we think that it is unsafe if the decision to give or 
          not give permission to a new arrival device to join the network 
          is made by only one device. In accordance with the above process, 
          the newly arriving device will have access to LLNs and obtain the 
          corresponding privileges when it receives more than two 
          certificates from different destination devices.

      6. Access control in cross-domain situation 

       The access control model in cross-domain is important because LLNs 
       may be formed by several autonomous groups wishing to share resources. 
       However, each domain is likely to own the individual security 
       policies. So a mapping mechanism is designed for the situation that a 
       device in one domain that wishes to gain an access to a network in a 
       different domain. In this case, the sink node is responsible for 
       negotiating and maintaining the information with other domains. 

       The process of a new device to join the network in a cross-domain 
       situation is shown in Fig. 4.

       1) Step 1. A newly arriving device, say device N, in domain Y (NY) 
          sends a access request to the destination device D in domain X 
          (DX). The request contains the necessary information of device N. 

       2) When the destination device D receives the request, it should 
          check whether it has the privilege to allow a device in another 
          domain to join the network. If it has, it will send security 
          level request to its sink device SDX. Node SD that receives the 
          security level request will forward the request to the sink node 
          of domain Y, say node SNY. Then node SN evaluates the security 
          level of device N in its local domain (request the neighbors of 
          device N in domain Y for recommendations, NNY). 

       3) After the security level evaluation process, the sink node SN 
          sends reply to the sink node SD. Adding in the assessment results 
          from domain Y to domain X, the sink node SD forwards the reply to 
          device D. 

       4) Then the destination device D computes the overall security level 
          of device N.

       5) If the access request is accepted, the device D should issues a 
          certificate to new device N. If the device N receives more than 
          two certificates from different destination devices, it will join 
          the network and obtain the privileges corresponding to its role.
