  Internet Draft - DNS MIB - November 12, 1992



  This memo defines a set of DNS (Domain Name System) exten-
  sions that have been created for the Internet MIB. When used
  in conjunction with the Structure of Management Information (RFC
  1155), the Management Information Base for Network Management
  of TCP/IP-based internets (RFC 1213) and the Simple Network
  Management Protocol (RFC 1157), it will be possible to provide
  integrated network management of DNS resolver and server soft-
  ware in standard TCP/IP based environments. This document was
  produced by the DNS working group.

                      Internet Draft - DNS MIB - November 12, 1992



  1  Introduction

  With the adoption of The Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC
  1157), the Management Information Base for network management of
  TCP/IP-based internets (RFC 1213), and the Structure of Manage-
  ment Information (RFC 1155) by the Internet, and a large number
  of vendor implementations of these standards in commercially
  available products, it became possible to provide a higher level
  of effective network management in TCP/IP-based internets than
  previously available. With the growth in the use of these stan-
  dards, it has become possible to consider the management of
  other elements of the infrastructure beyond the basic TCP/IP
  protocols. A key element of the TCP/IP infrastructure is the
  DNS.

  Up to this point there has been no mechanism to integrate the
  management of the DNS with SNMP-based managers. This memo pro-
  vides the mechanisms by which IP-based management stations can
  effectively manage DNS client and server software in an inte-
  grated fashion through the use of the standard Internet SMI, MIB
  and Simple Network Management Protocol.

  New DNS MIB objects have been defined to be used in conjunction
  with the Internet MIB to allow access and control of the DNS via
  SNMP by the Internet community.


  2  The DNS Model

  In theory, the DNS world is pretty simple. There are two kinds
  of entities: resolvers and name servers. Resolvers ask ques-
  tions. Name servers answer them. The real world, however, is not
  so simple. Implementors have made widely differing choices about
  how to divide DNS functions between resolvers and servers. They
  have also constructed various sorts of exotic hybrids. The most
  difficult task in defining this MIB was to accommodate this wide
  range of entities without having to come up with a separate MIB
  for each.

   Internet Draft - DNS MIB - November 12, 1992



  We divided up the various DNS functions into two, non-
  overlapping classes, called 'resolver functions' and 'name
  server functions'. A DNS entity that performs what we define
  as resolver functions contains a resolver, and therefore must
  implement the MIB groups required of all resolvers. Some re-
  solvers also implement 'optional' functions such as a cache. In
  this example, they will also implement the cache group contained
  in this MIB. A DNS entity which implements name server functions
  is considered to be a name server, and must implement the MIB
  groups required for name servers. If the same piece of software
  performs both resolver and server functions, we imagine that it
  contains both a resolver and a server.

  In our model, a resolver is a program (or piece thereof) which
  obtains resource records from servers. Normally it does so at
  the behest of an application, but may also do so as part of its
  own operation. A resolver sends DNS protocol queries and re-
  ceives DNS protocol replies. A resolver neither receives queries
  nor sends replies. A full service resolver is one that knows
  how to resolve queries: it obtains the needed resource records
  by contacting a server authoritative for the records desired.
  A stub resolver does not know how to resolve queries: it sends
  all queries to a local name server, setting the recursion de-
  sired flag to indicate that it hopes that the name server will
  be willing resolve the query. A resolver may (optionally) have
  a cache for remembering previously acquired resource records.
  It may also have a negative cache for remembering names or data
  that have been determined not to exist.

  A name server is a program (or piece thereof) that provides
  resource records to resolvers. All references in this document
  to 'a name server' imply 'the name server's role'. (In some
  cases the name server's role and the resolver's role might
  be combined into a single program.) A name server receives
  DNS protocol queries and sends DNS protocol replies. A name
  server neither sends queries nor receives replies. As a con-
  sequence, name servers do not have caches. Normally, a name
  server would expect to receive only those queries for which it

                      Internet Draft - DNS MIB - November 12, 1992



  could respond to with authoritative information. However, if
  a name server receives a query that it cannot respond to with
  purely authoritative information, it may choose to try to obtain
  the necessary additional information from a resolver which may
  or may not be a separate process.



  3  Selected Objects

  Many of the objects included in this memo have been created from
  information contained in the DNS specification. The DNS spec-
  ification is found in Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities
  (RFC 1034) and Domain Names - Implementation and Specification
  (RFC 1035), as amended and clarified by Requirements for In-
  ternet Hosts - Application and Support (RFC1123). Additional
  usage information is found in the Domain Administrators Guide
  (RFC 1032), and the Domain Administrators Operations Guide (RFC
  1033). Other objects have been created based on experience with
  existing DNS management tools, expected operational need, and
  the statistics generated by existing DNS implementations. These
  objects have been ordered into groups as follows:


  o  General Configuration Group

  o  Resolver Configuration Group

  o  Server Configuration Group

  o  Resolver Counter Group

  o  Server Counter Group

  o  Records Group

  o  Resolver Cache Group

  o  Resolver Negative Cache Group

  o  Resolver Statistics Group

   Internet Draft - DNS MIB - November 12, 1992



  o  Server Management Group

  The ordering of objects into these groups reflects the DNS model
  in which the resolver and server functions can be separate
  pieces of code which may or may not reside on the same host.
  This approach accommodates common implementations such as BIND,
  but it is not constrained by that or any other implementation
  paradigm.

  Some of the objects defined in this memo have been created from
  information contained in existing configuration files used by
  many DNS implementations. This information has been converted
  into a standard form using the Internet Standard SMI defined in
  RFC 1155.

  4  Objects

  The objects in this memo are described using the standard Inter-
  net SMI and BER of RFC 1155. Each object description includes
  the objects name, its syntax and encoding. Just as with objects
  supported in the MIB (RFC 1156), an object name is identified
  with an object identifier which has been administratively as-
  signed. This identifies an Object Type. When an object type
  is combined with a specific instance - the particular object
  is uniquely identified. Use of Object Descriptors in this memo
  is consistent with that of RFC 1156 - meaning that they are
  text strings meant to be read by humans. The descriptors have
  been created from a variety of sources. For the most part, the
  descriptions are influenced by by the DNS related RFCs noted
  above. For example, the descriptors for counters used for the
  various types of queries of DNS records are influenced by the
  definitions used for the various record types found in Domain
  Names - Implementation and Specification RFC 1035.

  4.1  Format of Definitions

  An object in this memo is specified by five fields of informa-
  tion: Object, Syntax, Description, Access, and Status.

  The OBJECT is a textual name (OBJECT DESCRIPTOR) for that ob-
  ject type combined with an administratively obtained OBJECT
  IDENTIFIER.

  SYNTAX : For each object type, its abstract syntax is presented
  using the ASN.1 specified in RFC 1155.

  DESCRIPTION: A general description of the object type.

  ACCESS : The standard access keywords supported in RFC 1156 are
  used. The keywords used in this MIB are: read-only, read-write,
  and not-accessible.

  STATUS : The status field is used to describe with a single
  keyword whether the object type is mandatory or optional. Status
  keywords of obsolete and deprecated are not used in this memo
  since this is the first version of the DNS MIB.

  4.2  Textual Conventions

  Several datatypes have been introduced as a textual conven-
  tions in this DNS MIB document. These additions will facilitate
  the common understanding of information used by the DNS. No
  changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support these
  conventions which are described in 5.0 (Object Definitions).

       -- protocol, however, no such separators are needed because each label
       -- is encoded as a length octet followed by the indicated number of
       -- octets of label.  For  example, "Acme.COM" is encoded as the octet
       -- sequence { 4, 'A', 'c', 'm', 'e', 3, 'C', 'O', 'M', 0 } (the final

       -- encoding as the DNS protocol.

       -- Server Counter Group

       -- The implementation of the Server Counter Group is mandatory for
       -- all systems which offer either recursive or non recursive server
       -- software functions.

       -- Several of the objects in this group make distinctions between
       -- queries which originate with the local host, within the same
       -- zone as the local host or come from outside the zone of the
       -- server.  The purpose of these distinctions is to allow for
       -- implementations to group queries and responses on this basis.
       -- One way in which servers may make these distinctions is by
       -- looking at the source IP address of the DNS query.  If the
       -- source of the query is 'your own' then the query should be
       -- counted as 'yourself' - local host.  If the source of the query
       -- matches an 'access list' - the the query came from a friend,
       -- that is; within the local zone.  What constitutes an 'access
       -- list' is implementation dependent and could be as simple as all
       -- hosts on the same IP network as the DNS server are classed as in
       -- the local zone and are 'friends'.  In order to avoid double
       -- counting, the following rules apply:

       -- 1.  No host is in more than one of the three groups defined above.
       -- 2.  All queries from the local host are always counted in the
       --     'yourself' group regardless of what the access list, if any,
       --     says.
       -- 3.  The access list should not define 'your friends' in such a way
       --     that it includes all hosts, that is 'not everybody is your
       --     friend'.
