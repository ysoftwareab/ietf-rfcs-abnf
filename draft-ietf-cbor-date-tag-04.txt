       Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date
                      draft-ietf-cbor-date-tag-04

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
   RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date/time
   string) and tag 1 (Posix "seconds since the epoch").  Since then,
   additional requirements have become known.  This specification
   defines a CBOR tag for an RFC 3339 date text string, for applications
   needing a textual date representation within the Gregorian calendar
   without a time.  It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the date
   1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a
   numeric date representation without a time.  It is intended as the
   reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags
   defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049] provides
   for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
   pre-agreed schema.  RFC 7049 defines a basic set of data types, as
   well as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data
   types supported via an IANA registry.

   This specification defines a CBOR tag for a text string representing
   a date without a time.  The tagged text string is represented as
   specified by the RFC 3339 [RFC3339] "full-date" production.  Per RFC
   3339, this represents a date within the Gregorian calendar.

   This specification also defines a CBOR tag for an integer
   representing a date without a time.  The tagged integer is an
   unsigned or negative value indicating the number of days since the

   Gregorian calendar date 1970-01-01.  As an implementation note, this
   value has a constant offset from the Modified Julian Date value
   (which is defined by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory as the
   number of days since November 17, 1858); this value is the Modified
   Julian Date minus 40587.

   Note that since both tags are for dates without times, times of day,
   time zones, and leap seconds are not applicable to these values.
   These tags are both for representations of Gregorian calendar dates.

1.1.  Calendar Dates

   Calendar dates are used for numerous human use cases, such as marking
   the dates of significant events.  For instance, John Lennon was born
   on October 9, 1940 and died on December 8, 1980.  One such common use
   case is driver's licenses, which typically include a date of birth.
   The dates used in this specification use the Gregorian calendar, as
   do those in RFC 3339 [RFC3339].  The time zones and actual times of
   these events are intentionally not represented in the calendar date.

   The epoch chosen for the second tag, which represents days since the
   Gregorian calendar date 1970-01-01, is related to the IEEE Std
   1003.1, 2013 Edition [POSIX.1] time epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC
   only insofar as both contain the date 1970-01-01.  This should not be
   construed as indicating that dates using this tag represent either a
   specific time of day and/or time zone.

   The day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.) is not explicitly
   represented in either of these date formats.  However, deterministic
   algorithms that are beyond the scope of this specification can be
   used to derive the day of the week in the Gregorian calendar from
   dates represented in both of these formats.

1.2.  Comparing Dates

   Comparison of dates in "full-date" format can be accomplished by
   normal string comparison, since by design, the digits representing
   the date are in fixed format and ordered from most significant to
   least significant.  Comparison of numeric dates representing days
   since 1970-01-01 can be performed by normal integer comparison.
   Comparison of dates in other formats or using other calendars require
   conversions that are beyond the scope of this specification.

1.3.  Comparing Dates and Times

   Comparing dates with times is beyond the scope of this specification.
   That said, if a date is augmented with a time zone and time of day,
   comparing that augmented date with other times becomes possible.  For

   instance, if one were to augment John Lennon's birth date of October
   9, 1940 with the time of day and time zone of his birth, then it
   would be possible to derive a time at which he was born that could be
   compared with other times.

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags Registrations

   This section registers the following values in the IANA "Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags" registry [IANA.cbor-tags].

   o  Tag: 1004 (value requested)
   o  Data Item: UTF-8 text string
   o  Semantics: RFC 3339 full-date string
   o  Reference: [[ this specification ]]

   o  Tag: 100 (ASCII 'd') (value requested)
   o  Data Item: Unsigned or negative integer
   o  Semantics: Number of days since the epoch date 1970-01-01
   o  Reference: [[ this specification ]]

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 7049 apply; the tags introduced
   here are not expected to raise security considerations beyond those.

   A date, of course, has significant security considerations.  These
   include the exploitation of ambiguities where the date is security
   relevant or where the date is used in access control decisions.

   When using a calendar date for decision making, for example access
   control, it needs to be noted that since calendar dates do not
   represent a specific point in time, the results of the evaluation can
   differ depending upon where the decision is made.  For instance, a
   person may have reached their 21st birthday in Japan while
   simultaneously being a day short of their 21st birthday in Hawaii.
