1.  Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   This document is not normative and does not contain requirements
   language

1.2.  Defined Terms

   The terms of art used in this document are described in the Mesh
   Architecture Guide [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture] .

1.3.  Related Specifications

   The architecture of the Mathematical Mesh is described in the Mesh
   Architecture Guide [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture] . The Mesh
   documentation set and related specifications are described in this
   document.

1.4.  Implementation Status

   The implementation status of the reference code base is described in
   the companion document [draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer] .

2.  Getting the Reference Code and Build Tools

   The Mesh Reference library was developed using Visual Studio 2017
   Community Edition [VS2017] using PHB?s Build Tools [PHB2017]
   extensions.  The reference code itself is currently limited to C#
   libraries.

   The code should in theory run under other operating systems but this
   has not been tested recently.

   Development under different development environments is also possible
   but would require re-engineering to make use of the line mode
   versions of the build tools.

2.1.  Obtaining the Development Environment

   Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition is currently available at no
   cost for a wide range of non-commercial development including
   personal use and development of Open Source software.  For full
   details, please consult the license published by Microsoft.

   https://www.visualstudio.com/

                                 Figure 1

2.2.  Obtaining the Build Tools

   Over half the code in the reference code library is generated using
   code generators.  These are used to ensure that the specification,
   examples and reference code are always kept in synchronization.

   The build tools are published under an MIT License and are available
   in two forms:

   As stand-alone tools to be run from the command line.

   As a VSIX package that integrates into the Visual Studio environment.

   The source distribution is configured to use the tools integrated
   into the Visual Studio environment.  If development on other
   platforms is desired, the simplest approach is likely to be to write
   a tool that reads the Visual Studio configuration files and generates
   the corresponding files for use with make.

   The VSIX package is available from the Visual Studio extensions
   gallery:

   PHB Code Generation Tools

                                 Figure 2

   The source code for the build tools is available from:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/phb-build-tools/

2.3.  Obtaining the Mesh Source Libraries

   The Mesh reference library source code is published under an MIT
   license and is available from:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/mathematicalmesh/

                                 Figure 4

3.  Running the Reference Code Examples

   The reference code examples are designed to illustrate how the Mesh
   might be used in an application rather than be standalone tools in
   their own right.  The Mesh is designed to make it each for developers
   to add security to their own applications rather than providing the
   applications themselves.

3.1.  Starting the Server

   On the Windows platform, the server runs in the context of the
   platform Web server and must be granted permission to bind to the
   range of server addresses used using the netsh command.

   From a command prompt with administrator privileges, run the
   following command:

   netsh http add urlacl http://<domain>/.well-known/mmm/
       \user=<machine>\<user>

                                 Figure 5

   Where is the DNS domain name under which the service is run, is the
   Windows domain name of the machine and the account name.

   To start the service from the command line type:

   servermesh <domain>

                                 Figure 6

   The server does not require administration privileges.

3.2.  The Profile Manager Wizard

   The profile manager wizard demonstrates functions that are performed
   on an administration device.  These include creating a completely new
   profile and initial configuration of applications, connecting a
   device to the profile and recovery of the profile from escrow data.

   To run the client from the command line, place the executable image
   in a location that it will be found in the PATH variable and type:

   meshclient

                                 Figure 7

3.3.  The Profile Connection Wizard

   The Profile connection wizard demonstrates the much more restricted
   functionality that would be required in a Mesh connected application
   and/or a profile manager for a non-administration device.

   To run the client from the command line, place the executable image
   in a location that it will be found in the PATH variable and type:

   meshconnect

                                 Figure 8

4.  Platform specific configuration data

4.1.  Windows

4.1.1.  Private Key Data

   All private key data is stored using the Windows public key store.
   At minimum, this ensures that private keys are obfuscated and
   encrypted under the account password to protect the data against
   casual extraction attacks.  On a machine with cryptographic hardware
   support such as a TPM or HSM, extraction of the private key may be
   infeasible without physical access to the machine and possibly
   require sophisticated diagnostic equipment.

4.1.2.  Registry settings

   Separate settings are used for production and test code.  Test Code
   should use the Registry Hive:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\CryptoMesh

   Production code should use the hive

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MathematicalMesh

   In either case the sub structure is:

   Accounts  Contains the set of Mesh Portal Accounts for the user.  The
      default value is the account name of the default account.  The
      Name of the each key is a portal account name and the value a
      REG_SZ entry containing the UDF of the profile master key.

   PersonalProfiles  Contains the set of Mesh Profiles for the user.
      The default value is the UDF of the default profile master key.
      The Name of each key is the UDF of the master key and the value a
      REG_SZ entry containing the file location of the cached copy of
      the personal profile.

   ThisDevice  Contains the set of Device profiles in the same format as
      the PersonalProfiles.

4.1.3.  Profile data files

   The profile data itself is stored in data files at the location
   specified in the registry.  The files are standard XML files in UTF8
   encoding.

4.2.  OSX and Linux

   [[Not yet implemented, subject to change.]

   All configuration information is stored in the user directory ~/.mmm

   Keys are stored in SSH key file format [RFC4716] using the customary
   name and extension conventions for that application.

5.  Using the Mesh C#/.Net Libraries in an Application

   The application ExampleGenerator shows the use of the Mesh in an
   application using the convenience API.  It is the application program
   used to generate the examples in the reference document.

   ExampleGenerator implements a client that connects to a remote Web
   Service, creates new personal profile with an escrow entry with
   offline recovery codes, attaches applications and other devices,
   updates an application profile, deletes all the profile data from the
   local machine and then restores them using the recovery codes and
   escrow entry.

5.1.  Portals, Sessions and Clients

   The libraries are designed to support testing and development use.
   For this reason, the client side of the libraries is divided into the
   following main classes:

   MeshClient  Provides a logical connection to a remote or simulated
      Mesh service.

   MeshPortal  Provides the interface to a Mesh service which may be an
      actual remote service accessed via a network connection, or local
      code running in the same process as the client to simulate a Mesh
      service for testing purposes.

   MeshMachine  Provides an interface to Mesh data stored on the local
      machine.

   MeshSession / PersonalSession  Provide the high level application
      interface to the Mesh combining access through the MeshClient and
      MeshMachine.

   The relationship between these parts is shown in . The application
   programmer will typically need only the MeshSession class.

   The principal classes in the Mesh Client side API.

   This division makes it possible to test Mesh clients and server
   implementations in a single process with a single debugger which is
   usually more convenient than spinning up a separate development
   session for the client and service.

5.1.1.  MeshSession vs PersonalSession

   Most Mesh operations are performed within the context of a specific
   PersonalProfile registered on the current machine.  This context is
   provided by an instance of the PersonalSession class.

   An instance of the MeshSession class is used for operations that are
   not bound to a specific PersonalProfile registered on the machine.
   These operations are:

   o  Binding a new PersonalProfile to the machine.

   o  Offline key recovery.

   o  Requesting and completing a device connection request from the new
      device.

   o  Acquiring a PersonalSession instance.

5.2.  Creating a Mesh Session

   The primary interface for the application programmer is the
   MeshSession class.  To create a mesh session class, the following
   steps are required:

   1.  Initialize the Mesh code for the intended platform

   2.  Request a new MeshSession instance.

   Although C# code is nominally 'write once, run anywhere', this
   approach does not ensure use of platform specific features such as
   the Windows registry or protected storage for cryptographic keys.
   Calling MeshWindows.Initialize() causes the platform specific code
   for the Windows to be initialized in production mode.  Alternatively,
   calls to MeshLinux.Initialize() or MeshOSX.Initialize() causes the
   platform specific code for those platforms to be initialized.

   The code to initialize a production instance of the code is shown in
   :

           static MeshSession MeshSession = null;

           static void ApplicationInit () {
               MeshWindows.Initialize();
               MeshSession = new MeshSession();
               }

                                 Figure 9

   If the user has already created a PersonalProfile and connected it to
   the machine, it will automatically be read from local storage.  The
   instance will automatically create MeshClient instances as required
   to establish a web service using the default transport (HTTP) to the
   service as necessary (see ).

   Connecting to a remote service from a Windows platform.

   The server implementation is managed in the same fashion.
   Internally, the MeshService and MeshClient classes are both descended
   from the same parent.

5.3.  Creating a Mesh Session for Testing

   Since the purpose of the ExampleGenerator is to create examples for
   the documentation, it is not necessary for the JSON Remote Procedure
   Calls to actually be ?Remote?. Instead the ?Local?  Procedure Call
   mode is used in which the client and server both run in the same

   process with the client API invoking the server dispatch methods
   through an interface that performs JSON serialization and
   deserialization but does not invoke the network transport.

   Connecting to a direct service for testing.

   A direct connection to the service provider may be established by
   either specifying the portal to use in the initialization of
   MeshSession or by setting the default portal property of the
   MeshPortal class as is done here .

           static void DebugApplicationInit () {

               MeshPortal.Default = new MeshPortalDirect("example.com",
                   "MeshLog.jlog", "PortalLog.jlog");

               MeshWindows.Initialize(true);
               MeshSession = new MeshSession();
               MeshSession.EraseTest();
               }

                                 Figure 10

   This time, we initialize a specific version of the platform dependent
   code and specify that it is to be initialized as test code rather
   than production.  This will cause all persistent data stored on the
   machine (keys, profiles) to be stored in locations marked as test
   locations.  The EraseTest() method causes all data stored in test
   locations to be erased from the machine, thus ensuring that the test
   begins from a known state with no results from previous runs.

   When writing test code, it is frequently useful to create multiple
   independent MeshSessions to simulate multiple machines.  To prevent
   data written to one machine interfering with another, a new simulated
   machine is created for each session using the MeshMachineCached class

               MeshSession = new MeshSession(new MeshMachineCached());

                                 Figure 11

5.4.  Checking that a Portal Account name is acceptable

   The user experience is improved if the application indicates whether
   their choice of portal account name is acceptable or not while they
   are entering it.  The Validate method allows the user's choice of
   account name to be validated .

           PersonalProfile PersonalProfile;
           PersonalSession PersonalSession;
           OfflineEscrowEntry OfflineEscrowEntry;

           void DebugCreateProfile () {
               var Response = MeshSession.Validate("alice@example.com");
               if (!Response.Valid) {
                   throw new Exception();
                   }
               ...

                                 Figure 12

   The portal address is given in the usual username@domain format, for
   example alice@example.com.

5.5.  Creating a Personal Profile

   Creating a PersonalProfile has two steps:

   1.  Create a DeviceProfile (if necessary)

   2.  Create the PersonalProfile

   3.  Create an account bound to the profile at the portal.

   These steps are shown in .

               var Device = MeshSession.CreateDevice();
               PersonalProfile = new PersonalProfile(
                   Device.DeviceProfile);
               PersonalSession = MeshSession.CreateAccount(
                   "alice@example.com", PersonalProfile);

                                 Figure 13

   The application could have overridden the default values of DeviceID
   and DeviceDescription when creating the device.

5.6.  Creating an Offline Escrow Entry

   Having created a potentially valuable profile, we probably want to
   back it up.  To do this, we create an instance of the
   OfflineEscrowEntry class with the desired quorum and number of shares
   (2 out of 4) .

               OfflineEscrowEntry = new OfflineEscrowEntry(
                   PersonalProfile, 2, 4);
               PersonalSession.Escrow(OfflineEscrowEntry);

                                 Figure 14

5.7.  Deleting Profile Data

   We can test our escrow parameters by deleting the profile from the
   current machine using the Delete method .

               PersonalSession.Delete();

                                 Figure 15

5.8.  Recovering Profile Data

   Profile recovery has two steps:

   1.  Reconstruct the shared secret from the recovery shares.

   2.  Recover the profile.

   In this case our recovery shares are the first and the third key
   shares we just generated.  The Recover method recovers the profile
   and rebinds it to the existing portal .

               var RecoveryShares = new KeyShare[] {
                   OfflineEscrowEntry.KeyShares[0],
                   OfflineEscrowEntry.KeyShares[2] };

               var Secret = new Secret(RecoveryShares);
               PersonalSession = MeshSession.Recover(
                   Secret, "alice@example.com");
               }

5.9.  Connecting a New Device

   Device connection involves two devices, the device to be connected
   and the device used to approve the request.

   The new device:

   1.  Create a device profile for the new device.

   2.  Request connection to the new device

   3.  Wait for the result.

   These calls are shown .

           void RequestConnect (string Address) {
               var DeviceRegistration = MeshSession.CreateDevice();
               var Connect = MeshSession.Connect(DeviceRegistration,
                       Address, out var Authenticator);
               PersonalSession = Connect.Await();
               }

                                 Figure 17

   In a real example, we would want to show the connection
   authentication code to the user so that they can verify that they are
   responding to the right request on the approval device.

   On the approval device, the application

   1.  Requests a list of pending requests using ConnectPending.

   2.  Accepts or Rejects devices using ConnectClose.

           void AcceptPending () {

               var Pending = PersonalSession.ConnectPending();
               foreach (var Request in Pending.Pending) {
                   var Result = PersonalSession.ConnectClose(Request,
                       ConnectionStatus.Accepted);
                   }
               }

                                 Figure 18

5.10.  Managing Applications

   Application profiles are created in the same manner as personal
   profiles .

               var PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile(true);
               var RegistrationApplication =
                       RegistrationPersonal.Add(PasswordProfile, false);

                                 Figure 19

   Changes to the Application Profile are written to the
   RegistrationApplication instance and then committed using the
   Update() method.

6.  Using other languages

   If you are building Mesh applications in another language, the least
   effort approach may be to rewrite the PROTOGEN build tool to target
   your language.

   Protogen does support generation of C header files that may be used
   to drive a parser.  If however you are adding Mesh support for an
   application that already uses JSON based protocols, you might want to
   edit the generator scripting files to generate code for your existing
   libraries.

6.1.  Lightweight API

   A lightweight API providing the minimal features required to Mesh
   enable an application is required.  Such an API should exclude most
   account management features:

   o  Creating new Personal Profiles and portal accounts.

   o  Key escrow, recovery

   o  List, accept pending device connection requests

   This leaves the following features:

   o  Create Device Profile

   o  Request device connection

   o  Get Personal Profile

   o  Get, Update, Application Profile

   In addition to providing less functionality, an implementation of the
   lightweight binding is likely to be written in a 'flattened' style
   rather than the abstracted, object oriented approach of the reference
   code.

7.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6892] .
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort

   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6892] , "this will allow reviewers and working
   groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit
   of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
   more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
   information as they see fit".

7.1.  Reference Implementation

   Organization: Comodo Group Inc.

   Implementer: Phillip Hallam-Baker

   Maturity: Experimental Prototype

   This implementation was used to produce the reference section and all
   the examples in this document.  Since the conversion of specification
   to code is automatic, there is a high degree of assurance that the
   reference implementation is consistent with this document.

7.1.1.  Coverage:

   The draft-xx branch describes the code used to create version xx of
   this document.

   The main current limitations are that the code only supports RSA key
   pairs and for ease of development the server does not persist keys
   across sessions.  Nor does the implementation currently support the
   HTTP payload authentication and encryption layer or make use of TLS.
   These could be easily fixed.

   The client and server are implemented as libraries that may be called
   from a multi-protocol server.  A standalone server will be provided
   in a future release.

   Only the JSON encoding is currently implemented.  The JSON-B, JSON-C,
   ASN.1 and TLS Schema implementations are all supported by the code
   generation tool but not currently implemented as the build tool
   bindings for those encodings have not yet been finalized or
   documented.

   The key restrictions for TLS key exchange have not yet been
   implemented.

   The code has only been tested on Windows 10 but passed compatibility
   testing for both Mono and dotNetCore 10 run times which should in
   theory permit use on Linux and OSX platforms.

7.1.2.  Licensing

   The code is released under an MIT License
