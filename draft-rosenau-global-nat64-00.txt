             Global NAT64 translation system (GlobalNAT64)
                     draft-rosenau-global-nat64-00

Abstract

   This document describes an idea of a IPv6-to-IPv4 translation method.

   The advantage of the method is that the required public IPv4
   addresses are shared between the internet providers (and even between
   the RIRs) so there are less IPv4 addresses required for IPv6-to-IPv4
   translation mechanisms (NAT64, DS-Lite, 464XLAT).

   The main disadvantage is that an IPv4 address range would have to be
   reserved for this method.

1.  Introduction

   Because of the IPv4 address shortage the IPv6 protocol has been
   developed.  Unfortunately most servers in the web are still IPv4-only
   but the IPv4 addresses already ran out for most RIRs so new network
   operators and internet providers can only provide IPv6 to their
   customers

   To enable IPv6-only hosts to access IPv4-only services there the
   NAT64 method can be used which is described in RFC 6146 [RFC6146].
   However this method requires the operator of NAT64 servers to have an
   own IPv4 address range and IPv4 address space is short so the number
   of new NAT64 servers is limited.

   This document describes a method that would allow all NAT64 servers
   to share the same IPv4 address range so IPv4 addresses required for
   IPv6-to-IPv4 are saved and network operators and internet access
   providers who only provide support for "outgoing" IPv4 TCP
   connections would not even need an own IPv4 address range.

   The method assumes that an IPv4 packet sent by a certain host to
   another host will always be routed to the same destination host even
   if multiple destination hosts (accidentally or intentionally) have
   the same IPv4 address.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

3.  Theory of operation

3.1.  Route discovery

   The IPv6-only host establishing a TCP connection first sends a TCP-
   SYN packet to the NAT64 to establish a TCP connection.

   Because multiple NAT64 servers have the same IPv4 address it is not
   predictable which NAT64 server will receive an IPv4 packet with the
   NAT64 server's address as destination address.

   The NAT64 will send a ping request to the IPv4-only host which is
   listening for a TCP connection.  The data of the ping request
   contains the IPv6 address of the NAT64.  It is assumed that the host
   which will receive the ping response will also receive all IPv4
   packets sent by the listening host to the given IPv4 address.

   Two cases have to be distinguished:
   - The ping response is received by the NAT64 which has sent the ping
   request
   - The ping response is received by another NAT64

3.2.  Direct routing

   If the ping response arrives at the NAT64 which has sent the ping
   request the NAT64 can directly establish a TCP/IPv4 connection to the
   destination host.

   The packet sequence looks like this:

     TCP Client (IPv6 or           NAT64                     TCP Server
     private IPv4 address)       (or CGNAT)                    (IPv4)

3.3.  Indirect routing

   If the ping response arrives at another NAT64 the first NAT64 cannot
   establish a direct IPv4 connection to the TCP server.  Instead the
   IPv4 connection must be established using the NAT64 which received
   the ping response.

   NAT64 servers which are capable to use the shared addresses MUST be
   capable to evaluate the content of the data in the ping response and
   notify the other NAT64 about the indirect route to be taken using a
   special data packet.

   The packet sequence looks like this:

     TCP Client          NAT64 A              NAT64 B         TCP Server
         |                   |                   |                   |
         +---- TCP-SYN ----->|                                       |

   Type: 8 bits
      This field MUST have the value 8 in the packet sent to the IPv4
      host and in the reply from the IPv4 host this field will be set to
      0 according to RFC 792 [RFC0792].

   Code: 8 bits
      This field MUST have the value 0 according to RFC 792.

      IPv4-only host does not drop the packet as "duplicate packet" when
      receiving multiple ping requests.

   Magic value: 32 bits
      This field MUST contain the ASCII characters 'N', 'T', '6', '4'
      (hexadecimal value 4E543634 in network byte order) so the second
      NAT64 will detect an incoming ping reply as reply to a ping
      request sent by another NAT64.

   IPv6 address of the first NAT64: 128 bits
      The IPv6 address of the NAT64 that has sent the ping request.

   Information for use by the first NAT64: 64 bits
      Information used by the first NAT64 to match the "ping response"
      or the "route info" packet to a TCP connection.  The meaning is
      depending on the implementation of the first NAT64.

   Options: variable
      Information for the second NAT64.  Currently no options are
      defined.  Therefore the field MUST be left empty (it must not be
      present) and the second NAT64 MUST ignore the field if it is
      present.

4.2.  Route info

   The route info packet is sent by the second NAT64 to the first NAT64
   upon reception of a ping response packet and it has the following
   form:

   IPv4 address from the pool: 32 bits
      Copy of the "destination address" field in the IPv4 header of the
      ping response message.

   Address of the IPv4 host: 32 bits
      Copy of the "source address" field in the IPv4 header of the ping
      response message.

   Information for use by the first NAT64: 64 bits
      Copy of the corresponding field in the ping response message.

   Options: variable
      Information for the first NAT64.  Currently no options are
      defined.  Therefore the field MUST be left empty (it must not be
      present) and the first NAT64 MUST ignore the field if it is
      present.

   The "IPv4 server not reachable" message is sent if the second NAT64
   is not able to establish a TCP connection to the IPv4-only host at
   all.

   The "NAT64 is busy" message is sent if the second NAT64 does
   currently have no free resources to establish a TCP connection; the
   first NAT64 may try another IPv4 address to reach another NAT64
   server.

   The "Pool address is busy" message is sent if the second NAT64 can
   establish a TCP connection but the source IPv4 address cannot be
   used.  In this case the first NAT64 may try another IPv4 address from
   the address pool.  This is necessary if the method described in
   section "Address change and bad routing" (Section 5.1) is used.

5.  Special scenarios

5.1.  Address change and bad routing

   Scenario:

      A more powerful NAT will use a pool of multiple IPv4 addresses to
      establish an IPv4 connection.

      Let's say the address range XX.XX.0.0/16 is reserved for global
      NAT64 routing.  Packets from the IPv4 host will be routed to NAT64
      B when the destination address is in the range XX.XX.1.0/8 and to
      NAT64 C if the destination address is in the range XX.XX.2.0/8.

      The NAT64 A (first NAT64) selects address XX.XX.1.1 as source
      address of the ping message.



Rosenau                   Expires July 1, 2016                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 GlobalNAT64                 December 2015


      NAT64 B receives the response and tells NAT64 A that it is able to
      route the TCP connection.

      NAT64 A will now establish a TCP connection using NAT64 B and
      NAT64 B selects one available IPv4 address from the address pool:
      XX.XX.2.1.

      The TCP connection will fail because address XX.XX.2.1 is routed
      to NAT64 C instead of NAT64 B.

   A solution would be to encode the address selected by NAT64 A into
   the IPv6 address of NAT64 B: The NAT64 does not use a /96 prefix but
   an /80 prefix - let's say 2001:db8:1:2::/80.

   If a ping response is received with the destination address
   XX.XX.nn.mm and the source address pp.qq.rr.ss the IPv6 address sent
   to the NAT64 A will be 2001:db8:1:2::nnmm:ppqq:rrss.

   When NAT64 B received a TCP-SYN packet to IPv6 address
   2001:db8:1:2::nnmm:ppqq:rrss this means that NAT64 B should create a
   TCP connection to address pp.qq.rr.ss using the address XX.XX.nn.mm
   as source address.

   When there are not enough TCP ports available on address XX.XX.nn.mm
   then NAT64 B will send a "Pool address is busy" (Route info error)
   message instead of a "Route info" message to NAT64 A as soon as the
   ping response is received.  In this case NAT64 A will select another
   IPv4 source address from the pool XX.XX.0.0/16 and send a new ping
   request.

5.2.  Dual-stack host ICMP echo implementation

   When the address range used for this method is well-known and the
   IPv4 TCP server also supports IPv6 the destination host may answer
   ping requests coming from NAT64s by "route info" packets instead of
   ping replies.  The "IPv6" field of the "route info" message is filled
   with the IPv6 address of the TCP server.

5.3.  Router caching

   IPv4 and IPv6 packets are routed over the internet through routers.

   A router detecting a ping request from a NAT64 router might directly
   answer with a "routing info" packet when the corresponding second
   NAT64 is known instead of routing the ping request to the receiver.

   However there is the danger that this will work unstably beacause the
   IPv4 routes may change.  It would also not allow the
   "GlobalNAT64-capable server" approach (Section 5.2).

5.4.  Other protocols

   This method may also work with UDP.

   Port-less protocols such as GRP will probably not work.

   Translating ICMP messages over NAT64 makes no sense.
