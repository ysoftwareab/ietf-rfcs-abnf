1. Introduction 
    
   The base NEMOv4 specification [NEMOv4] defines extensions to Mobile 
   IPv4 [MIPv4] for mobile networks.  
    
   This specification adds support for dynamic allocation of mobile 
   prefixes by the home agent. 
    
 
2. Dynamic Mobile Prefix allocation 
    
    
2.1 Mobile Client Considerations 
    
   [NEMOv4] defines that the prefix field of the mobile network request 
   extension can not be set to zero.  
    
   According to this specification, however, a mobile client MAY 
   include one or more mobile network request extensions with the 
   prefix field set to zero. Such mobile network request extensions 
   indicate that the mobile client requests mobile network prefix(es) 
   to be assigned to it by the home agent. In this case, the mobile 
   client MAY set the prefix length field of such extensions to zero or 
   to a length of its choice as a hint to the home agent. According to 
   this specification, mobile network request extensions with the 
   prefix field set to zero MAY be included in a registration request 
   message either during initial registration or during a subsequent 
   registration.  
    
   When a mobile client receives a registration reply it MUST process 
   it as defined in [MIPv4] and [NEMOv4]. If one or more network 
   acknowledgement extension are included with the Code field set to 
   "Success" the mobile client SHOULD treat the prefixes in the 
   corresponding prefix fields as allocated prefixes and create the 
   appropriate bindings as defined in [NEMOv4]. 
    
   If in response to a registration request with a mobile network 
   request extension with the prefix field set to zero, a mobile client 
   receives a registration reply with a Code field set to 70 "poorly 
   formed request", it may use it as a hint that the home agent does 
   not support dynamic prefix allocation. 
    
   [Ed. Note: alternatively [NEMOv4] should define an appropriate Code 
   in the Mobile Network Acknowledgment extension e.g., "Bad Prefix"]

2.2 Home Agent Considerations 
    
   A home agent receiving a mobile network request extension with the 
   prefix field set to zero MAY return a mobile network acknowledgement 
   extension [NEMOv4] with the prefix field set to the prefix allocated 
   to the mobile client. The length of that prefix is at the discretion 
   of the home agent. The home agent MAY take into account the prefix 
   length hint if one is included in the mobile network request 
   extension. Once the home agent allocates a prefix it MUST maintain 
   the prefix registration table as defined in [NEMOv4]. Alternatively 
   the home agent MAY return a mobile network acknowledgement extension 
   with the Code field set to one of the negative codes defined in 
   [NEMOv4]. 
    
   Dynamic mobile prefix allocation as defined in this specification 
   MAY be combined with dynamic home address allocation as defined in 
   [MIPv4]. In other words the home address field of the registration 
   request message MAY be set to zero while the message also includes 
   one or more mobile network request extensions with the prefix field 
   also set to zero. 
    
   Once the home agent allocates a prefix it MUST maintain the prefix 
   registration table as defined in [NEMOv4]. 
    
   For dynamic prefix allocation the mobile client's home address MAY 
   be used to identify the client if it is not set to zero. If the home 
   Otherwise, as defined in [MIPv4] and [NAI], the NAI extension [NAI] 
   needs to be included in the registration request, in which case the 
   same extension SHOULD be used to identify the mobile client for 
   prefix allocation purposes. 
 
 
 
3. Security Considerations 
    
   This specification operates in the security constraints and 
   requirements of [MIPv4], [NAI] and [NEMOv4].  
    
   Home agent implementations SHOULD take steps to prevent address 
   exhaustion attacks. One way to limit the effectiveness of such an 
   attack is to limit the number and size of prefixes any one mobile 
   router can be allocated.
