  Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework Extension to Convolutional
                                 Codes
                     draft-roca-tsvwg-fecframev2-03

Abstract

   RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) codes with applications in public and private IP networks to
   provide protection against packet loss.  The framework supports
   applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable transport and
   is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming, media.  However
   FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block FEC codes.  The
   present document extends FECFRAME to support convolutional FEC Codes,
   based on a sliding encoding window, in addition to Block FEC Codes.
   This is done in a backward compatible way.  During multicast/
   broadcast real-time content delivery, these codes significantly
   improve robustness in harsh environments, with less repair traffic
   and lower FEC-related added latency.

1.  Introduction

   Many applications need to transport a continuous stream of packetized
   data from a source (sender) to one or more destinations (receivers)
   over networks that do not provide guaranteed packet delivery.  In
   particular packets may be lost, which is strictly the focus of this
   document: we assume that transmitted packets are either received
   without any corruption or totally lost (e.g., because of a congested
   router, of a poor signal-to-noise ratio in a wireless network, or

   because the number of bit errors exceeds the correction capabilities
   of a low-layer error correcting code).

   For these use-cases, Forward Error Correction (FEC) applied within
   the transport or application layer, is an efficient technique to
   improve packet transmission robustness in presence of packet losses
   (or "erasures"), without going through packet retransmissions that
   create a delay often incompatible with real-time constraints.  The
   FEC Building Block defined in [RFC5052] provides a framework for the
   definition of Content Delivery Protocols (CDPs) that make use of
   separately defined FEC schemes.  Any CDP defined according to the
   requirements of the FEC Building Block can then easily be used with
   any FEC scheme that is also defined according to the requirements of
   the FEC Building Block.

   Then FECFRAME [RFC6363] provides a framework to define Content
   Delivery Protocols (CDPs) that provide FEC protection for arbitrary
   packet flows over unreliable transports such as UDP.  It is primarily
   intended for real-time or streaming media applications, using
   broadcast, multicast, or on-demand delivery.

   However [RFC6363] only considers block FEC schemes defined in
   accordance with the FEC Building Block [RFC5052] (e.g., [RFC6681],
   [RFC6816] or [RFC6865]).  These codes require the input flow(s) to be
   segmented into a sequence of blocks.  Then FEC encoding (at a sender
   or an encoding middlebox) and decoding (at a receiver or a decoding
   middlebox) are both performed on a per-block basis.  This approach
   has major impacts on FEC encoding and decoding delays.  The data
   packets of continuous media flow(s) can be sent immediately, without
   delay.  But the block creation time, that depends on the number k of
   source symbols in this block, impacts the FEC encoding delay since
   encoding requires that all source symbols be known.  This block
   creation time also impacts the decoding delay a receiver will
   experience in case of erasures, since no repair symbol for the
   current block can be received before.  Therefore a good value for the
   block size is necessarily a balance between the maximum decoding
   latency at the receivers (which decreases with the block size and
   must be in line with the most stringent real-time requirement of the
   protected flow(s)), and the desired robustness against long loss
   bursts (which increases with the block size).

   This document extends [RFC6363] in order to also support
   convolutional FEC codes based on a sliding encoding window.  This
   encoding window, either of fixed or variable size, slides over the
   set of source symbols.  FEC encoding is launched whenever needed,
   from the set of source symbols present in the sliding encoding window
   at that time.  This approach significantly reduces FEC-related
   latency, since repair symbols can be generated and sent on-the-fly,

   at any time, and can be regularly received by receivers to quickly
   recover packet losses.  Using convolutional FEC codes is therefore
   highly beneficial to real-time flows, one of the primary targets of
   FECFRAME.

   [RLC-ID] provides an example of such FEC Scheme for FECFRAME, built
   from the well-known Random Linear Codes (RLC) convolutional FEC
   codes.

   This document is fully backward compatible with [RFC6363] that it
   extends but does not replace.  Indeed:

   o  this extension does not prevent nor compromize in any way the
      support of block FEC codes.  Both types of codes can nicely co-
      exist, just like different FEC schemes can co-exist;

   o  any receiver, e.g., a legacy receiver that only supports block FEC
      schemes, can easily identify the FEC scheme used in a FECFRAME
      session thanks to the associated SDP file and its FEC Encoding ID
      information (i.e., the "encoding-id=" parameter of a "fec-repair-
      flow" attribute, [RFC6364]).  This mechanism is not specific to
      this extension but is the basic approach for a FECFRAME receiver
      to determine whether or not it supports the FEC scheme used in a
      given FECFRAME session;

   This document leverages on [RFC6363] and re-uses its structure.  It
   proposes new sections specific to convolutional FEC codes whenever
   required.

2.  Definitions and Abbreviations

   The following list of definitions and abbreviations is copied from
   [RFC6363], adding only the Block/Convolutional FEC Code and Encoding/
   Decoding Window definitions:

   Application Data Unit (ADU):  The unit of source data provided as
       payload to the transport layer.

   ADU Flow:  A sequence of ADUs associated with a transport-layer flow
       identifier (such as the standard 5-tuple {source IP address,
       source port, destination IP address, destination port, transport
       protocol}).

   AL-FEC:  Application-layer Forward Error Correction.

   Application Protocol:  Control protocol used to establish and control

   Content Delivery Protocol (CDP):  A complete application protocol
       specification that, through the use of the framework defined in
       this document, is able to make use of FEC schemes to provide FEC
       capabilities.

   FEC Code:  An algorithm for encoding data such that the encoded data
       flow is resilient to data loss.  Note that, in general, FEC codes
       may also be used to make a data flow resilient to corruption, but
       that is not considered in this document.

   Block FEC Code:  FEC Code that operate in a block manner, i.e., for
       which the input flow MUST be segmented into a sequence of blocks,
       FEC encoding and decoding being performed independently on a per-
       block basis.

   Convolutional FEC Code:  FEC Code that can generate repair symbols
       on-the-fly, at any time, from the set of source symbols present
       in the sliding encoding window at that time.

   FEC Framework:  A protocol framework for the definition of Content
       Delivery Protocols using FEC, such as the framework defined in
       this document.

   FEC Framework Configuration Information:  Information that controls
       the operation of the FEC Framework.

   FEC Payload ID:  Information that identifies the contents of a packet
       with respect to the FEC scheme.

   FEC Repair Packet:  At a sender (respectively, at a receiver), a
       payload submitted to (respectively, received from) the transport
       protocol containing one or more repair symbols along with a
       Repair FEC Payload ID and possibly an RTP header.

   FEC Scheme:  A specification that defines the additional protocol
       aspects required to use a particular FEC code with the FEC
       Framework.

   FEC Source Packet:  At a sender (respectively, at a receiver), a

       FEC Payload ID.

   Protection Amount:  The relative increase in data sent due to the use
       of FEC.

   Repair Flow:  The packet flow carrying FEC data.

Internet-Draft           FEC Framework Extension           February 2017


   Repair FEC Payload ID:  A FEC Payload ID specifically for use with
       repair packets.

   Source Flow:  The packet flow to which FEC protection is to be
       applied.  A source flow consists of ADUs.

   Source FEC Payload ID:  A FEC Payload ID specifically for use with
       source packets.

   Source Protocol:  A protocol used for the source flow being
       protected, e.g., RTP.

   Transport Protocol:  The protocol used for the transport of the
       source and repair flows, e.g., UDP and the Datagram Congestion
       Control Protocol (DCCP).

   Encoding Window:  Set of Source Symbols available at the sender/
       coding node that are used to generate a repair symbol, with a
       Convolutional FEC Code.

   Decoding Window:  Set of received or decoded source and repair
       symbols available at a receiver that are used to decode erased
       source symbols, with a Convolutional FEC Code.

   Code Rate:  The ratio between the number of source symbols and the
       number of encoding symbols.  By definition, the code rate is such
       that 0 < code rate <= 1.  A code rate close to 1 indicates that a
       small number of repair symbols have been produced during the
       encoding process.

   Encoding Symbol:  Unit of data generated by the encoding process.
       With systematic codes, source symbols are part of the encoding
       symbols.

   Packet Erasure Channel:  A communication path where packets are
       either lost (e.g., by a congested router, or because the number
       of transmission errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the
       physical-layer codes) or received.  When a packet is received, it
       is assumed that this packet is not corrupted.

   Repair Symbol:  Encoding symbol that is not a source symbol.

   Source Block:  Group of ADUs that are to be FEC protected as a single
       block.  This notion is restricted to Block FEC Codes.

   Source Symbol:  Unit of data used during the encoding process.

   Systematic Code:  FEC code in which the source symbols are part of
       the encoding symbols.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Architecture Overview

   The architecture of [RFC6363], Section 3, equally applies to this
   FECFRAME extension and is not repeated here.

4.  Procedural Overview

4.1.  General

   The general considerations of [RFC6363], Section 4.1, that are
   specific to block FEC codes are not repeated here.

   With a Convolutional FEC Code, the FEC source packet MUST contain
   information to identify the position occupied by the ADU within the
   source flow, in terms specific to the FEC scheme.  This information
   is known as the Source FEC Payload ID, and the FEC scheme is
   responsible for defining and interpreting it.

   With a Convolutional FEC Code, the FEC repair packets MUST contain
   information that identifies the relationship between the contained
   repair payloads and the original source symbols used during encoding.
   This information is known as the Repair FEC Payload ID, and the FEC
   scheme is responsible for defining and interpreting it.

   To the Sender Operation ([RFC6363], Section 4.2.) and Receiver
   Operation ([RFC6363], Section 4.3), both specific to block FEC codes
   and therefore omitted below, the following two sections detail
   similar operations for convolutional FEC codes.

4.2.  Sender Operation with Convolutional FEC Codes

   With a convolutional FEC scheme, the following operations,
   illustrated in Figure 1 for the case of UDP repair flows, and in
   Figure 2 for the case of RTP repair flows, describe a possible way to
   generate compliant source and repair flows:

   1.   A new ADU is provided by the application.

   2.   The FEC Framework communicates this ADU to the FEC scheme.





Roca & Begen             Expires August 28, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           FEC Framework Extension           February 2017


   3.   The sliding encoding window is updated by the FEC scheme.  The
        ADU to source symbols mapping as well as the encoding window
        management details are both the responsibility of the FEC
        scheme.  However Appendix A provide some hints on the way it
        might be performed.

   4.   The Source FEC Payload ID information of the source packet is
        determined by the FEC scheme.  If required by the FEC scheme,
        the Source FEC Payload ID is encoded into the Explicit Source
        FEC Payload ID field and returned to the FEC Framework.

   5.   The FEC Framework constructs the FEC source packet according to
        [RFC6363] Figure 6, using the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
        provided by the FEC scheme if applicable.

   6.   The FEC source packet is sent using normal transport-layer
        procedures.  This packet is sent using the same ADU flow
        identification information as would have been used for the
        original source packet if the FEC Framework were not present
        (for example, in the UDP case, the UDP source and destination
        addresses and ports on the IP datagram carrying the source
        packet will be the same whether or not the FEC Framework is
        applied).

   7.   When the FEC Framework needs to send one or several FEC repair
        packets (e.g., according to the target Code Rate), it asks the
        FEC scheme to create one or several repair packet payloads from
        the current sliding encoding window along with their Repair FEC
        Payload ID.

   8.   The Repair FEC Payload IDs and repair packet payloads are
        provided back by the FEC scheme to the FEC Framework.

   9.   The FEC Framework constructs FEC repair packets according to
        [RFC6363] Figure 7, using the FEC Payload IDs and repair packet
        payloads provided by the FEC scheme.

   10.  The FEC repair packets are sent using normal transport-layer
        procedures.  The port(s) and multicast group(s) to be used for
        FEC repair packets are defined in the FEC Framework
        Configuration Information.

4.3.  Receiver Operation with Convolutional FEC Codes

   With a convolutional FEC scheme, the following operations,
   illustrated in Figure 3 for the case of UDP repair flows, and in
   Figure 4 for the case of RTP repair flows.  The only differences with
   respect to block FEC codes lie in steps (4) and (5).  Therefore this
   section does not repeat the other steps of [RFC6363], Section 4.3,
   "Receiver Operation".  The new steps (4) and (5) are:

   4.  The FEC scheme uses the received FEC Payload IDs (and derived FEC
       Source Payload IDs when the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field
       is not used) to insert source and repair packets into the
       decoding window in the right way.  If at least one source packet
       is missing and at least one repair packet has been received and
       the rank of the associated linear system permits it, then FEC
       decoding can be performed in order to recover missing source

       payloads.  The FEC scheme determines whether source packets have
       been lost and whether enough repair packets have been received to
       decode any or all of the missing source payloads.

   5.  The FEC scheme returns the received and decoded ADUs to the FEC
       Framework, along with indications of any ADUs that were missing
       and could not be decoded.

5.  Protocol Specification

5.1.  General

   This section discusses the protocol elements for the FEC Framework
   specific to convolutional FEC schemes.  The global formats of source
   data packets (i.e., [RFC6363], Figure 6) and repair data packets
   (i.e., [RFC6363], Figures 7 and 8) remain the same with convolutional
   FEC codes.  They are not repeated here.

5.2.  FEC Framework Configuration Information

   The FEC Framework Configuration Information considerations of
   [RFC6363], Section 5.5, equally applies to this FECFRAME extension
   and is not repeated here.

5.3.  FEC Scheme Requirements

   The FEC scheme requirements of [RFC6363], Section 5.6, mostly apply
   to this FECFRAME extension and are not repeated here.  An exception
   though is the "full specification of the FEC code", item (4), that is
   specific to block FEC codes.  The following item (4) applies instead:

   4.  A full specification of the convolutional FEC code

       This specification MUST precisely define the valid FEC-Scheme-
       Specific Information values, the valid FEC Payload ID values, and
       the valid packet payload sizes (where packet payload refers to
       the space within a packet dedicated to carrying encoding
       symbols).

       Furthermore, given valid values of the FEC-Scheme-Specific
       Information, a valid Repair FEC Payload ID value, a valid packet
       payload size, and a valid encoding window (i.e., a set of source
       symbols), the specification MUST uniquely define the values of
       the encoding symbols to be included in the repair packet payload
       with the given Repair FEC Payload ID value.

   Additionally, the FEC scheme associated to a Convolutional FEC Code:

   o  MUST define the relationships between ADUs and the associated
      source symbols (mapping);

   o  MUST define the management of the encoding window that slides over
      the set of ADUs.  Appendix A provides a non normative example;

   o  MUST define the management of the decoding window, consisting of a
      system of linear equations (in case of a linear FEC code);

6.  Feedback

   The discussion of [RFC6363], Section 6, equally applies to this
   FECFRAME extension and is not repeated here.

7.  Transport Protocols

   The discussion of [RFC6363], Section 7, equally applies to this
   FECFRAME extension and is not repeated here.

8.  Congestion Control

   The discussion of [RFC6363], Section 8, equally applies to this

9.  Implementation Status

   Editor's notes: RFC Editor, please remove this section motivated by
   RFC 7942 before publishing the RFC.  Thanks!

   An implementation of FECFRAME extended to convolutional codes exists:

   o  Organisation: Inria

   o  Description: This is an implementation of FECFRAME extended to
      convolutional codes and supporting the RLC FEC Scheme [RLC-ID].
      It is based on: (1) a proprietary implementation of FECFRAME, made
      by Inria and Expway for which interoperability tests have been
      conducted; and (2) a proprietary implementation of RLC
      Convolutional FEC Codes.

   o  Maturity: the basic FECFRAME maturity is "production", the
      FECFRAME extension maturity is "under progress".

   o  Coverage: the software implements a subset of [RFC6363], as
      specialized by the 3GPP eMBMS standard [MBMSTS].  This software
      also covers the additional features of FECFRAME extended to
      convolutional codes, in particular the RLC FEC Scheme.

   o  Lincensing: proprietary.

   o  Implementation experience: maximum.

   o  Information update date: March 2017.

10.  Security Considerations

   This FECFRAME extension does not add any new security consideration.
   All the considerations of [RFC6363], Section 9, apply to this
   document as well.

11.  Operations and Management Considerations

   This FECFRAME extension does not add any new Operations and
   Management Consideration.  All the considerations of [RFC6363],
   Section 10, apply to this document as well.

12.  IANA Considerations

   A FEC scheme for use with this FEC Framework is identified via its
   FEC Encoding ID.  It is subject to IANA registration in the "FEC
   Framework (FECFRAME) FEC Encoding IDs" registry.  All the rules of
   [RFC6363], Section 11, apply and are not repeated here.

Appendix A.  About Sliding Encoding Window Management (non Normative)

   The FEC Framework does not specify the management of the sliding
   encoding window which is the responsibility of the FEC Scheme.  This
   annex provides a few hints with respect to the management of this
   encoding window.

   Source symbols are added to the sliding encoding window each time a
   new ADU arrives, where the following information is provided for this
   ADU by the FEC Framework: a description of the source flow with which
   the ADU is associated, the ADU itself, and the length of the ADU.
   This information is sufficient for the FEC scheme to map the ADU with
   the corresponding source symbols.

   Source symbols and the corresponding ADUs are removed from the
   sliding encoding window, for instance:

   o  after a certain delay, when an "old" ADU of a real-time flow
      times-out.  The source symbol retention delay in the sliding
      encoding window should therefore be initialized according to the
      real-time features of incoming flow(s).

   o  once the sliding encoding window has reached its maximum size
      (there is usually an upper limit to the sliding encoding window
      size).  In that case the oldest symbol is removed each time a new
      source symbol is added.

   Several aspects exist that can impact the sliding encoding window
   management:

   o  at the source flows level: real-time constraints can limit the
      total time source symbols can remain in the encoding window;

   o  at the FEC code level: there may be theoretical or practical
      limitations (e.g., because of computational complexity aspect)
      that limit the number of source symbols in the encoding window.

   o  at the FEC scheme level: signaling and window management are
      intrinsically related.  For instance, an encoding window composed
      of a non sequential set of source symbols requires an appropriate
      signaling to inform a receiver of the composition of the encoding
      window.  On the opposite, an encoding window always composed of a
      sequential set of source symbols simplifies signaling: providing
      the identity of the first source symbol plus their number is
      sufficient.
