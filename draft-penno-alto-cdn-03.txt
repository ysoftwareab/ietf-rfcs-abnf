                   ALTO and Content Delivery Networks
                        draft-penno-alto-cdn-03

Abstract

   Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocol
   information about the underlying network topology from the ISP or
   Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view.  In
   other words, information about what a Provider prefers in terms of
   traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.  The ALTO Service
   provides information such as preferences of network resources with
   the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while
   maintaining or improving application performance.

   One of the main use cases of the ALTO Service is its integration with
   Content Delivery Networks (CDN).  The purpose of this draft is
   twofold: first, to describe how ALTO can be used in existing and new
   CDNs, both within an ISP and in separate organizational entities from
   the ISP; second, to collect requirements for ALTO usage in CDNs and
   to provide recommendations into the development of the ALTO protocol
   for better support of CDNs.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   Content Delivery Networks are becoming increasingly important in the
   Internet [ARBOR] and many CDNs today already use some form of
   proximity such as latency-based proximity [GoogleCDN].  But in many
   cases the content provider/distributor and the Internet Service
   Provider (ISP) are disjoint entities.  Consequently, even if content
   servers are co-located into the ISP's networks, there is not a
   standardized way to share server location and/or network topology
   information.  Therefore a natural step forward would be to use ALTO
   to share this information.

   Another key aspect of ALTO in the context of CDNs deployments is that
   it is desirable that no changes to the hosts are needed (or that
   changes to hosts would be transparent to the user).  In other words,
   a traditional web browser using standard HTTP flow is all there is
   needed to take advantage of ALTO information.  This is a significant
   difference from the P2P applications where a special client is
   typically needed and ALTO is normally used as a way to reduce
   operational expense.


2.  Scope

   This document discusses how Content Delivery Networks can benefit
   from ALTO through integration of the ALTO Service with the main
   request routing techniques.  There are two objectives:

   o  Present basic integration schemes of ALTO into CDNs.

   o  Provide protocol recommendations to ALTO: Whenever a new
      requirement on protocol functionality is identified to achieve
      integration with CDNs, it will be enumerated with 'REQ-<N>'.  Each
      requirement is documented in a section of its own in order to
      foster parallel discussions and possible adoption.


3.  Terminology

   We use the following terms defined in ALTO Problem Statement
   [RFC5693]: Application, ALTO Service, ALTO Server, ALTO Client, ALTO
   Query, ALTO Reply, ALTO Transaction.

   In addition to the above, the following terms are defined:

      Content-aware Proximity Request Routing Function: The Request
      Routing function knows about locations and presence of content &
      media objects in the network.  Therefore the redirection to a CDN

      node is made based on both the availability of content and/or
      content-type in that CDN node and the proximity of the CDN node to
      the requesting user.

      Service-aware Proximity Request Routing Function: The Request
      Routing function knows about locations of CDN nodes in the network
      and redirects user to the closest CDN node.  A redirection is made
      irrespective of content presence in the CDN node; if content is
      not present, the node will be populated with the content while the
      content is being served to the user.

      HTTP Request Routing Function: a Content-aware or Service-aware
      Proximity Request Routing function for HTTP.  It embeds an HTTP
      Server that performs HTTP Redirects, an ALTO client that retrieves
      network mapping from the ALTO Server, and a Location Database
      which stores network mappings received from the ALTO Client.  The
      HTTP Server consults the Location Database when making redirection
      decisions.


4.  Request Routing as an Integration Point of ALTO into CDN

   Content Distribution is a rich and evolving field.  New architectures
   and approaches (e.g., a hybrid architecture using both servers and
   P2P) continue to be developed in the research community and industry.
   Several CDN architectures are being deployed in production.  While we
   would like to provide a survey of each possible CDN architecture and
   show how it may be integrated with ALTO, it would be a daunting task
   to track such a rapidly-changing field.

   One scheme that is out of the scope of this document is P2P-only
   CDNs, where the application tracker takes the role of the ALTO
   Client, fetching the Network and Cost Maps from the ALTO Server and
   integrating them with its peer database.  The result is a peer
   database that takes into account both the current peer metrics, such
   as peer availability or content availability, and network metrics,
   such as topological localization.  This architecture, in the context
   of file sharing, has been studied extensively and trialed by ISPs
   such as Comcast [RFC5632] and China Telecom
   [I-D.lee-alto-chinatelecom-trial] under the ALTO/P4P [P4P] protocol.
   Thus, P2P-only CDNs are not discussed in this document.

   The Request Routing Component of a CDN directs a request to a serving
   CDN node, and thus is the major integration point to utilize
   information available through ALTO.  Today, multiple request routing
   schemes have been used even in CDNs with purely server-based
   infrastructure.  The specific schemes include HTTP Redirect, DNS name
   resolution, and anycast.  We focus on HTTP Redirect and DNS name

   resolution.

   Though anycast is a request routing technique that has been used in
   deployed CDNs, we do not discuss it in this document.  Even though
   one may be able to integrate ALTO with anycast, we do not believe
   that this is a proper use of ALTO's capabilities.  In particular,
   ALTO has been developed to improve selection amongst multiple content
   providers at the application level.  In contrast, anycast operates by
   adjusting the routing layer to match content consumers with the
   desired content providers.  Applying ALTO to routing layer decisions
   introduces additional complexity because it directly adjusts the
   routing layer from which the ALTO information is typically generated,
   creating a tight feedback loop.  We leave a more detailed study of
   integrating ALTO with anycast-based CDNs as future work.

   We next briefly review the two mechanisms presented in this document,
   HTTP Redirect and DNS Request Routing.

4.1.  HTTP Redirect

   In this mechanism, an HTTP GET request from a host is received by an
   HTTP Request Routing Function which sends back an HTTP response with
   Status-Code 302 (Redirect) informing the host of the most preferred
   location to fetch the content.  The HTTP Redirection method is
   already commonly used in production CDNs as described in RFC3568
   [RFC3568].  ALTO integration provides localization services where the
   device that performs the redirection becomes an ALTO client.

4.2.  DNS Request Routing

   In this mechanism, the DNS server handling host requests provides the
   Request Routing Component.  When the host performs a DNS query/
   lookup, the IP address(es) in the DNS response will indicate the
   selected location to serve the request.

   DNS queries can be either iterative or recursive.  Iterative queries
   can be used with ALTO if the host itself queries the DNS Servers, or
   if the DNS Proxy used by the host is topologically close to the host.
   If the Host directly queries the DNS Servers, the authoritative DNS
   Server can see directly the host's IP address.  If the DNS Proxy is
   topologically close to the Host, its IP address is a good
   approximation for the host's location.  In recursive queries, the
   authoritative DNS Server sees the IP address of the previous DNS
   Server in the resolution chain, and the IP address of the host is
   unknown.  DNS-based request routing does not work well with recursive
   DNS queries.

   In an iterative DNS lookup with a DNS Proxy (say for cdn.com), the



Penno, et al.          Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


   host queries the Proxy, which in turn first queries one of the root
   servers to find the server authoritative for the top-level domain
   (com in our example).  The Proxy then queries the obtained top-level-
   domain DNS server for the address of the DNS server authoritative for
   the CDN domain.  Finally, the Proxy queries the DNS server that is
   authoritative for the cdn.com domain.  The authoritative DNS Server
   for cdn.com will perform the request routing to the most appropriate
   CDN node, based on the source IP address of the requestor.  The host
   will then request the content directly from the CDN Node.

   Recently, an EDNS0 option in DNS query has been proposed in
   [I-D.vandergaast-edns-client-subnet] that will provide a mechanism to
   carry sufficient network information about the client for the
   authoritative DNS server to tailor DNS response based on the client's
   subnet.  Using this mechanism, the authoritative DNS server can
   achieve the same request routing accuracy as that of the HTTP Request
   Routing Function, and both recursive and iterative queuries can be
   supported.


5.  Basic Scheme of CDN/ALTO Integration

   Although HTTP Redirect and DNS are quite different mechanisms to
   direct a request to a serving CDN node, as we will see, the basic
   structure of integrating ALTO with them can be quite similar.  Thus,
   we first present common structures.  We refer to the HTTP Redirect
   component or the DNS component of a CDN as a CDN Request Routing
   Function.

5.1.  Basic Integration Scheme

   Figure 1 shows a general structure to embed an ALTO Client into a CDN
   Request Routing Function.

   An ALTO Server may aggregate information from multiple sources, such
   as routing protocols, traffic engineering policies, and monitoring
   systems.  Thus, ALTO is complementary to existing infrastructure.
   For further detail, see Figure 1 of [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

5.2.  Multi-hop Redirection

   The preceding examples show the logical flow for redirection.  It is
   important to state that there maybe multiple redirection hops.

   For HTTP Redirect, the requestor may be redirected again by the first
   CDN node.  For DNS, the first DNS server may direct, using aggregated
   ALTO information (e.g., from multiple ALTO Servers of multiple ISPs),
   the DNS resolution to a second level DNS server, which then may use
   more specific ALTO information as well as CDN node status.

6.  Request Routing using ALTO Services

   Either the Map Service or the Endpoint Cost Service of ALTO can be
   used by the Request Routing Function.  We first discuss two common
   issues: how to configure ALTO topology at ALTO servers; and how to
   achieve CDN node discovery and status notification.  Then we give
   specific details on using the Map Service or the Endpoint Cost
   Service.

6.1.  ALTO Topology vs. Network Topology

   To answer queries from CDN Request Routing Functions, the ALTO server
   builds a ALTO-specific network topology that represents the network
   as it should be understood and utilized by the application layer (the
   CDN).  Besides the security requirements that consist of not
   delivering any confidential or critical information about the
   infrastructure, there are efficiency requirements in terms of what
   visibility of the network, and at which level of granularity, is
   required by the CDN and more in general by the application layer.

   The ALTO server builds topology (for either Map and ECS services)
   based on multiple sources that may include routing protocols, network
   policies, state and performance information, geo-location, etc.  In
   all cases, the ALTO topology will not contain any details that would
   endanger the network integrity and security (for example, there will
   be no leaking of OSPF/ISIS/BGP databases to ALTO clients).

6.2.  CDN Node Discovery and Status Notification

   A design issue of integrating ALTO into Request Routing is how CDN
   Request Routing discovers the available CDN nodes and their
   locations.  The exact mechanism is outside the scope of this
   document.

   It is desirable that not only CDN node locations, but also real-time
   CDN node status (like health, load, cache utilization, CPU, etc.) is
   communicated to the Request Routing Function.

   Specifically, CDN node status can be retrieved from the existing Load
   Balancer infrastructure.  Most Load Balancers today have mechanisms
   to poll caches/servers via ping, HTTP Get, traceroute, etc.  Most LBs
   have SNMP trap capabilities to let other devices know about these
   thresholds.  Specification of a particular mechanism or API used to
   fetch load status information into an ALTO Server is out of scope of
   this document.

   Note that in addition to the CDN node status, network status can also
   be retrieved from TE/RP databases.  The Request Routing Function may

   also need to be configured with a proper set of policies and business
   rules that control routing of requests.  For example, it may be
   desirable to set up a rule that within a CDN certain requests have
   higher priority.

   We see two approaches that CDN node status can be communicated to the
   Request Routing Function.

6.2.1.  CDN Node Status Updates received by Request Routing Function

   In the first approach, the Request Routing Function receives CDN
   Status updates directly.

   For example, the Request Routing Function can implement an SNMP agent
   and get to know whatever is needed.

           Figure 4: CDN Node Status to Request Routing Function

6.2.2.  CDN Node Status Updates received by ALTO

   In the second approach, the Request Routing Function receives CDN
   Status from ALTO instead of CDN nodes.

   This model generally simplifies the Request Routing Function.  It
   allows an easier distribution of the Request Routing Function, and to
   keep real time CDN status data updates in a logically centralized
   ALTO Server or in an ALTO Server Cluster.  It allows for the Request
   Routing Function and the ALTO Server to be in different
   administrative domains.  For example, the Request Routing Function
   can be in a Content Provider's domain; the ALTO Server and CDN Nodes

   in a Network Service Provider's domain.

   Specifically, ALTO Server could provide an API (for example, a Web
   Service or XMPP-based API) that could be used by CDN nodes to
   communicate their status to the ALTO server directly.

6.3.  Request Routing using the Map Service

   The ALTO client embedded in the Request Routing Function fetches the
   Network and Cost Maps from the ALTO Server and provides that
   information to the Request Router.

   As an illustrative example, we consider the case of HTTP Redirect.  A
   simple Request Router may be given (from an external source) the list
   of available CDN nodes.  The Request Router precomputes a redirection
   table indexed by source PID with values being the closest CDN nodes.
   This redirection table can be built based on information from Network
   and Cost Maps.  Then when the Request Router receives an HTTP GET
   request, it looks up the PID of the source IP address on the request,
   indexes the redirection table using the request PID to select a CDN
   node, and finally returns a response that is an HTTP redirect with
   the URL of the selected CDN node.  The URL in 302 Redirect may
   contain the IP address of the selected CDN node or a domain name
   instead of IP address due to virtual hosting.  Therefore the IP
   addresses contained in the cost maps may need to be correlated to



Penno, et al.          Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


   domain names a priori.  In practice, the redirection table may be
   indexed by both source and content to provide better redirection.

   The illustrative example can also be extended to DNS.

   The Network Maps generated by the ALTO Server will contain both Host
   PIDs and CDN Node PIDs, i.e., Host PIDs contain host subnets; CDN
   PIDs contain IP addresses of available CDN nodes.  Cost Maps may
   contain only cost from each host PID to each CDN PID and not the full
   matrix across all PIDs.  The reason is that the Request Router may
   redirect a host only to a CDN node, not to another host as in the P2P
   case.  Moreover, there is no generic way to disambiguate PIDs
   containing only hosts from PIDs containing CDN nodes.

   It is possible that a Request Router may be designated as being
   responsible only for a fixed set of Host PIDs.  This information can
   be made available to the Request Router before it receives requests
   from hosts.  If the set of Host PIDs is not known ahead of time, the
   latency for serving requests will be impacted by the capabilities of
   the ALTO server.

   With such information ahead of time, a Request Router that uses the
   Network Maps Service may pre-download the Network Map for the
   interesting Host PIDs and the CDN PIDs.  It can also start
   periodically pulling Cost Map for relevant PID 2-tuples.

   The Request Router can rely on the ALTO Server generated Cache-
   Control headers to decide how often to fetch CDN PID network map and
   Host PID network maps.

   For Alto protocol requirements related to request routing with the
   Map Service see Section 8.1.1 and Section 8.1.2.

6.4.  Request Routing using the Endpoint Cost Service

   Alternatively, the Request Router may request the Endpoint service
   from the ALTO client.

   Specifically, the Request Router requests the Endpoint Cost Service
   to rank/rate the content locations (i.e., IP addresses of CDN nodes)
   based on their distance/cost (by default the Endpoint Cost Service
   operates based on Routing Distance) from/to the user address.

   Once the Request Router obtains from the ALTO Server the ranked list
   of locations (for the specific user) it can incorporate this
   information into its selection mechanisms in order to point the user
   to the most appropriate location.

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


   A Request Router that uses the Endpoint Cost Service may query the
   ALTO Server for rankings of CDN Node IP addresses for each requesting
   host and cache the results for later usage.

   Maps Services and ECS deliver similar ALTO service by allowing the
   Request Routing Functino to optimize internal selection mechanisms.
   Both services deliver similar level of security, confidentiality of
   layer-specific information (i.e.: application and network) however,
   Maps and ECS differ in the way the ALTO service is delivered and
   address a different set of requirements in terms of topology
   information and network operations.

6.4.1.  Topology Computation and ECS Delivery

   ECS allows the Request Routing Function to not have to implement any
   specific algorithm or mechanism in order to retrieve, maintain and
   process network topology information (of any kind).  The complexity
   of the network topology (computation, maintenance and distribution)
   is kept in the ALTO server and ECS is delivered on demand.  Thus ECS
   is used in order to implement a lightweight integration of ALTO
   services in the CDN layer.  ECS implies an ALTO and CDN
   implementation with the necessary scalability in order to cope with
   the amount of transactions that CDN and ALTO server will have to
   handle (knowing that the CDN is able to cache ALTO ECS results for
   further use).

6.4.2.  Ranking Service

   When a user requests a given content, the Request Routing Function
   locates the content in one or more caches and executes a selection
   algorithm to redirect the user to the 'best' cache.  In order to
   achieve that, the CDN issues an ECS request with the endpoint address
   (IPv4/IPv6) of the user (content requester) and the set of endpoint
   addresses of the content caches (content targets).  The ALTO server,
   receives the request and ranks the list of content targets addresses
   based on their distance from the content requester.  By default,
   according to [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], the distance represents the
   routing cost as computed by the routing layer (OSPF, ISIS, BGP) and
   may take into consideration other routing criteria such as MPLS-VPN
   (MP-BGP) and MPLS-TE (RSVP), policy and state & performance
   information.

   Once the ALTO server has computed the distance it replies with the
   ranked list of content target addresses.  The list being ranked by
   distance, the CDN is capable of integrating the rankings into its
   selection process (that will also incorporate other criteria) and
   redirect the user accordingly.

6.5.  Update, Redirection of ALTO Info to CDN Request Routing

   The information provided by an ALTO server to Request Routing is
   based on topology information of the network.  The different methods
   and algorithms through which the ALTO server computes topology
   information and rankings is out of the scope of this document.
   However, update and rediction of such information may have an impact
   on the integration of ALTO into CDN Request Routing.

6.5.1.  ALTO Update and Network Events

   In the case that ALTO information is based on routing (IP/MPLS)
   topology, it is obvious that network events may impact the ALTO
   computation.  The scope of the ALTO information delivered to Request
   Routing is not to maintain the CDN aware of any possible network
   topology changes since, due to redundancy of current networks, most
   of the network events happening in the infrastructure will have
   limited impact on the CDN.  However, catastrophic events such as main
   trunks failures or backbone partition will have to take into account
   by the ALTO server so to redirect traffic away from the failure
   impacted area.

6.5.2.  Caching and Lifetime

   Each reply sent back by the ALTO server to the ALTO client running in
   the Request Routing Function has a validity in time so that the CDN
   can cache the results in order to re-use it and hence reducing the
   number of transactions between CDN and ALTO server.  The ALTO server
   may indicate in the reply message how long the content of the message
   is to be considered reliable and insert a lifetime value that will be
   used by the Request Routing Function in order to cache (and then
   flush or refresh) the entry.

   An ALTO server implementation may want to keep state about ALTO
   clients so to inform and signal to these clients when a major network
   event happened so to clear the ALTO cache in the client.  In a CDN/
   ALTO interworking architecture, where there are only a few CDN
   components interacting with the ALTO server, there are no scalability
   issues in maintaining state about clients in the ALTO server.

6.5.3.  ALTO Redirection

   When ALTO server receives a request from a CDN Request Routing
   Function, it may not have the most appropriate topology information
   to reply.  In such case, the ALTO server, may want to adopt the
   following strategies:





Penno, et al.          Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


   o  Reply with available information (best effort).

   o  Redirect the request to another ALTO server presumed to have
      better topology information (redirection).

   o  Doing both (best effort and redirection).  In this case, the reply
      message contains both the rankings and the indication of another
      ALTO server where more accurate information may be delivered.

   The decision process that is used to determine if redirection is
   necessary (and which mode to use) is out of the scope of this
   document.  As an example, an ALTO server may decide to redirect any
   request having addresses that are located into a remote Autonomous
   System.  In such case the redirection message includes the ALTO
   server to be used and that resides in the remote AS.  Redirection
   implies communication between ALTO servers so to be able to signal
   their identity, location and type of visibility (AS number).

6.5.4.  Groups and Costs

   An automated ALTO implementation may use dynamic algorithms to
   aggregate network topology.  However, it is often desirable to have a
   mechanism through which the network operator can control the level
   and details of network aggregation based on a set of requirements and
   constraints.  IP/MPLS networks make use of a common mechanism to
   aggregate and group prefixes that is called BGP Communities.  BGP is
   the protocol all ISP networks use in order to exchange information
   about their prefix reachability.  BGP Community us an attribute used
   to tag a prefix so to group prefixes based on mostly any criteria (as
   an example, most SP networks originate BGP prefixes with communities
   identifying the Point of Presence (PoP) where the prefix has been
   originated).

   The ALTO server may leverage the BGP information that is available in
   the ISP network layer and compute group of prefixes.  By policy, the
   ALTO server operator may decide an arbitrary cost to set between
   groups.  Alternatively, there are algorithms that allow dynamic
   computation of cost between groups.


7.  Multiple Administrative Domains

   The preceding discussion works well in a single administrative domain
   setting: the CDN nodes are in the administrative domain of the ISP.
   However, the CDN nodes, the ISP, and the Request Router can be in
   different administrative domains.  In this section, we consider a few
   such deployment cases.  We use DNS as an example.

7.1.  CDN nodes/Request Router in a separate administrative domain  from
      that of ISP

   In many situations, the CDN nodes and the Request Router are in a
   separate network managed by an entity that is distinct from the ISP.
   Consequently, the CDN nodes belong to a network with its own ALTO
   server that is distinct from the ALTO server of the ISP where the
   subscribers belong to.

           Figure 6: Map advertising between ISP and CDN domains

   The ALTO server in the CDN provider network is assumed to be
   initialized with information about the ISP networks it serves.  For
   every such ISP network, it consults the routing plane to find the set
   of Border routers.  The CDN network ALTO server computes the cost of
   reaching each Border router from every CDN node (say, C_cdn).

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


   Next, the CDN ALTO server contacts the ISP network's ALTO server and
   downloads the network map.  In order to help the CDN ALTO server
   compute the cost from a CDN node to a subscriber's PID, we break it
   down into two parts - the cost from the CDN node to the Border Router
   (C_cdn) and the cost from the Border Router to the subscriber's PID
   (say, C_isp).  Note that for any chosen exit point, C_cdn may be
   computed locally by the CDN ALTO Server.  However, the fundamental
   issue is that C_isp depends on the exit point (Border outer) chosen
   by the CDN.  There are multiple ways for the CDN ALTO Server to
   compute C_isp given the Network Map and Cost Map from the ISP's ALTO
   Server.

   One possibility is for the ISP ALTO Server to define a special Border
   Router PID (denoted by a PID attribute) which also indicates the
   corresponding Border Router PID in the CDN.  The attributes and
   values may be agreed-upon by the ISP and CDN when the ALTO Services
   are configured.  For example, in the example shown in Figure 5, the
   ISP ALTO Server indicates that its PID4 and PID5 are Border PIDs,
   with corresponding PIDs in the CDN as PID6, and PID7, respectively.
   Then, CDN ALTO Server can locally compute C_isp = cost(ISP Border
   Router PID, Subscriber PID).

   A second possibility for computing C_isp is to make use of Border
   Router IP addresses.  The CDN's Border Router can locally determine
   the IP address of the connected border router in the ISP.  In this
   approach, neither the CDN ALTO Server nor the ISP ALTO Server define
   PID attributes.  The ISP ALTO Server is not required to define
   special PIDs for Border Routers - it only needs to ensure that Border
   Router IP addresses are aggregated appropriately in its Network Map.

   Specifically, we identify two scenarios for the CDN ALTO Server to
   compute C_isp and C_cdn.

   In the first scenario, the CDN does not conduct CDN-level multi-path
   routing from the CDN nodes to the subscriber hosts.  Thus, the
   routing path from a CDN IP address to a subscriber host IP address is
   typically uniquely (if no ECMP) determined by the network routing
   system.  In this scenario, for a given CDN node IP address to a
   subscriber host IP address, the CDN ALTO Server uses the routing
   system to compute the Border Egress router inside the CDN, and the
   corresponding Border Ingress router inside the ISP.  Then the CDN
   ALTO Server has C_cdn(CDN node IP, Border Egress router IP inside the
   CDN), and C_isp(Border Ingress router IP inside the ISP, Subscriber
   IP).  The computation of C_cdn and C_isp can be done using ALTO in
   the traditional way through either the Network Map and Cost Map or
   the Endpoint Cost Service.

   In the second scenario, the CDN may support CDN-level multi-path

   routing from the CDN nodes to the subscriber hosts.  In particular,
   from each CDN node, the CDN has a capability (e.g., through
   tunneling) to send to a subscriber host IP through multiple Border
   Egress routers (e.g., through any Egress router that receives an
   announcement from the ISP of the subscriber host IP).  In this case,
   the cost of reaching a host PID from a given CDN node is then
   determined as the minimum cost among all possible intermediate Border
   Routers.

   If the network is homogeneous, then a good approximation of the cost
   between each host PID and a given CDN node can be given as: C_cdn(CDN
   Node, Border router) + C_isp(Border router, Subscriber PID).  In this
   computation, the Border Router is the one that is on the best path
   from the CDN node to the Subscriber PID.

   The CDN ALTO server now has a cost map that provides the cost from
   each CDN node to all known Subscriber PIDs.  The ALTO client in the
   CDN DNS server downloads this cost map in preparation for subscriber
   DNS requests.

   When a subscriber DNS request arrives at the CDN provider's DNS
   server, it looks up the network map and maps the source IP address to
   a Subscriber PID.  It then uses the cost map to pick the best CDN
   node for this Subscriber PID.

7.2.  Managed DNS Domain with Three Administrative Domains

   Many organizations / content providers outsource DNS management to
   the external vendors for various reasons like reliability,
   performance improvement, DNS security etc.  Managed DNS service could
   be used either with caches owned by the organization itself (section
   6.3.1) OR with external CDNs (section 6.3.2)

7.2.1.  Managed DNS  Redirect to Local CDN

   One of the common functions offered by managed DNS service vendor is
   DNS traffic management where DNS resolver can load balance traffic
   dynamically across CDN servers.

   Typically managed DNS service provider has DNS resolvers spread
   across geographical locations to improve performance.  This also
   makes easier for DNS resolver to redirect host to the nearest cache.
   Such a DNS resolver would be an ideal candidate to implement ALTO
   client where it can fetch network map and cost map from ALTO servers
   located in the same geographical area only.  Load balancing
   implemented with the knowledge of network and cost map would be more
   efficient than other mechanisms like round robin.

   In the figure above, there exists 2 possibilities:

   provider network.  This case is similar to section 6.1

   Case 2: Domain 1 and Domain 2 are connected to different service
   provider network.  This case is similar to section 6.2

7.2.2.  Managed DNS with CDN-Provided Request Routing

   It is also possible to utilize a Managed DNS service and still rely
   on a CDN's request routing.  For example, this could be done if a
   network provider wishes to utilize a Managed DNS provider, but also
   wishes to integrate its own CDN using ALTO with DNS-based request
   routing.

   To support this, the network provider may submit any necessary
   configuration files (e.g., indicating necessary CNAME records) to
   redirect CDN requests to the CDN's DNS Request Routing mechanism.
   Requests for the CDN (e.g., 'cdn.isp.com') will then be directed by
   DNS request routing, while requests for other hosts are handled by
   the Managed DNS solution.


8.  Protocol Recommendations

   In the previous sections, this document has taken the approach of
   providing information on existing CDN approaches and possible
   benefits of utilizing ALTO.  However, in developing the taxonomy, use
   cases, and deployment scenarios, we have identified cases where the
   ALTO Protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] and Server Discovery
   [I-D.kiesel-alto-3pdisc] [I-D.song-alto-server-discovery]
   [I-D.stiemerling-alto-dns-discovery] may be lacking capabilities that
   may be helpful and/or necessary for usage with CDNs.  We now focus on
   detailing these gaps with the goal of providing feedback and
   recommendations.  Note that some protocol changes may be necessary in
   the core protocol, while others may be implemented as extensions.

   This section will be updated to track changes in the ALTO Protocol,
   ALTO Server Discovery, and accompanying protocols.

8.1.  Necessary Additions

   This section details changes to the ALTO protocols that would be
   necessary to make use of ALTO within CDN infrastructures.  We
   classify a change as "necessary" if there is a core feature of a CDN/
   ALTO integration that is not possible to implement with the existing
   protocols.

8.1.1.  NA1: PID Attributes

   In order to disambiguate between PIDs that contain endpoints of a
   specific class, a PID property is needed.  A PID can be classified as
   containing "CDN nodes", "Mobile Hosts", "Wireline Hosts", etc.  This
   mechanism can be used to provide an ALTO Client a list of nodes of a
   particular type, along with the ALTO Costs to each node.  In the
   context of CDNs, the attributes could describe a type of CDN node.
   For example an Origin would have one type of attribute while an edge
   cache would have another.  This would allow for more intelligent
   routing.

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


8.1.2.  NA2: PID Attributes and Query

   PID attributes can be used by the ALTO Client to select a appropriate
   host and also passed as a constraint in the map filtering service.

8.2.  Helpful Additions

   This section details changes to the ALTO Protocol that would be
   helpful to make use of ALTO within CDN infrastructures.  We classify
   a change as "helpful" if there is a compelling extension to existing
   CDNs that would be possible with additional functionality within
   ALTO, or if there is a component of CDN/ALTO integration that could
   be made more efficient or otherwised improved with additional ALTO
   functionality.

8.2.1.  HA1: Push Mechanism

   It is important for the ALTO Service through the ALTO protocol or a
   companion protocol to provide a push mechanism from server to client.
   The push mechanism can be a notification that new data is available
   or the data itself.

8.2.2.  HA2: Incremental Map Updates

   A natural evolution to the protocol if maps are large and change
   often is to allow for incremental map updates.  In this sense the map
   contained in the reply would be considered the delta from the
   previous version.

8.2.3.  HA3: ALTO Border Router PID attribute

   In order for administrative domains to collate costs across domain
   boundaries, the border routers may be placed in their own PIDs.  Such
   PIDs may be identified by a Border Router attribute.

8.2.4.  HA4: CDN ALTO Server Discovery

   In certain deployment scenarios, it may be beneficial for an ALTO
   client to directly query a CDN's ALTO Server (instead of the CDN's
   ALTO Server only being consulted as a backend process).  For example,
   this can provide more accurate guidance than DNS Request Routing
   since the client's IP address may be directly used by the CDN in
   order to select a cache node.  This would require an ALTO Client
   (e.g., an ISP subscriber) to be able to discover an ALTO Server owned
   and/or managed by a CDN.  This could be done by an extension to the
   discovery protocol, or it could be done by allowing an ISP's ALTO
   Server to redirect certain queries to a CDN ALTO Server.

Internet-Draft                ALTO and CDNs                   March 2011


8.2.5.  HA5: Extensible ALTO Cost Maps

   Certain deployment scenarios may benefit from additional information
   being carried within ALTO information.  For example, a trusted
   neighboring ISP B may be able to help ISP A optimize multihoming
   costs.  To provide an extensible way to communicate additional data,
   the ALTO Protocol could be extended to include opaque data strings
   (in addition to numeric and ordinal values) in an ALTO Cost Map.

8.2.6.  NA4: Federated Deployment of ALTO Servers

   There is a need to define how ALTO servers may communicate with each
   other in a federated model.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


10.  Security Considerations

   When the ALTO Server and Client are operated by different entities
   the issue of trust and security comes forward.  The exchange of
   information could be done using the encryption methods already
   present in HTTP but preventing unauthorized redistribution comes into
   play.  A further issue is if the ALTO information information is
   transitive, which modifications are allowed.
