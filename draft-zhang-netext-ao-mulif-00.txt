     Abstract 

        The NetLMM WG has specified the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for 
        network-based localized mobility management, taking basic support for 
        registration, de-registration and handover of Mobile Node (MN) into 
        account in the RFC 5213 [1]. However, when a MN configures with 
        multiple interfaces, the corresponding supporting scheme is needed. 
        This document proposes an easy extension of the basic PMIPv6 protocol 
        with the address option. Then the MN can communicate with CN using 
        anyone interface but always maintain the upper layer application with 
        a fixed home address (HoA). Besides, the operation and extension is 
        transparent to the MAG and compatible with the other specifications.

      1. Introduction 

        As an important extension of basic PMIPv6 specification [1], the 
        multi-interface supporting in PMIPv6 has attracted special attentions. 
        Based on the multi-interface supporting scheme, the MN can support 
        the multihoming, vertical handover and flow mobility. In the draft 
        [2], the multi-interface deployment scenarios are proposed. Based on 
        this study, many multi-interface supporting schemes are proposed in 
        order to support the above mentioned features [3-6] in separated or 
        integrated manner. However, some of them can support the multi-
        interface MN in special scenario, and some of them have to extend the 
        basic PMIPv6 to a large degree.

     Internet-Draft     Address option based mulif in PMIPv6      March 2010 
      

        So in this document, we propose a light-weight multi-interface 
        supporting scheme based on the extended address option in basic 
        PMIPv6. We are aiming to support the multi-interface MN under every 
        deployment scenario but be compatible with other specifications. 

      2. Address options in PMIPv6 

        In MIPv6 [7], the Home address option and Type2 routing header are 
        used to support the optimized communication between MN and the 
        corresponding node (CN). With these two options, the upper layer 
        applications of MN always use the HoA even the corresponding traffic 
        may be transmitted through the Care-of Address (CoA). Based on this 
        scheme, we extend the PMIPv6 with the address option to support the 
        multi-interface MN. 

     2.1. Primary HoA option 

        In the multi-interface scenario, the first HoA configured by the MN 
        is denoted by the primary HoA. Then all the upper layer applications 
        are established based on the primary HoA. 

        For all the packets transmitted from MN to LMA, the primary HoA 
        option is used to carry the primary HoA if the MN wants to transmit 
        the packets from the interface different from the interface 
        corresponding to the primary HoA. The format of primary HoA option is 
        illustrated in figure 1.

        Primary HoA 

         The primary HoA of the multi-interface MN. This address MUST be a 
        unicast routable address. 

     2.2. Type2 routing header. 

        We use the Type2 routing header defined in MIPv6 to allow the packet 
        to be routed to the final destination (e.g., primary HoA). Once the 
        packet arrives at the MN, the mobile node retrieves its primary HoA 
        from this routing header and uses it as the final destination of the 
        packet. Its format is shown in figure 2.

      3. Extended binding state 

        In order to support the multi-interface MN, the binding state in LMA 
        should be extended. In order to differentiate the multiple paths to 
      
      
     Zhang et al.            Expires December,2010                  [Page 4]

        the MN, the LMA should maintain multiple sub-entries corresponding to 
        one MN-ID. The newly defined information is: 

        InterFace Priority (IFP): 8-bit unsigned integer. This value is an 
        identification number used to distinguish multiple bindings 
        registered for one MN. Assignment of distinct IFPs allows registering 
        multiple binding cache entries for a given mobile node. Besides, the 
        higher value of IFP means the priority of the corresponding interface 
        is higher. The LMA must transmit the packets to MN through the path 
        with the highest IFP value. 

        P flag (P): 1-bit unsigned integer. This flag is used to denote 
        whether the corresponding interface is that interface configured with 
        primary HoA. 

        The value of IFP and P can be set by the MN itself and transmitted to 
        the MAG. Besides, they are contained in the PBU and PBA messages to 
        notify the LMA. They can be contained in the Mobile Node Link-layer 
        Identifier Option as shown in figure 3.

      4. Packet transmission  

        Based on the newly defined address option and routing header, the 
        packet transmission in basic PMIPv6 has to be extended as follows. 

     4.1. Incoming packets 

        For the incoming packets sent from CN to MN, they are firstly 
        transmitted to the LMA according to the routing protocol.  

        Then the LMA checks the destination address and finds if the primary 
        HoA should be added (e.g., primary HoA has the highest IFP). If the 
        IFP of primary HoA is the highest, the LMA directly encapsulates this 
        packet into the LMA-MAG tunnel and sends this packet to MAG as the 

      
      
     Zhang et al.            Expires December,2010                  [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft     Address option based mulif in PMIPv6      March 2010 
      

        basic PMIPv6 specified. Finally, the packet can be transmitted 
        through the MN's interface corresponding to the primary HoA.  

        Otherwise, the LMA replaces the destination address with the HoA with 
        the highest IFP and adds the Type2 routing header in the packet. Then 
        the packet is encapsulated into the LMA-MAG tunnel. In the Type 2 
        routing header, the primary HoA is carried. When the MN receivers 
        this packet finally and finds the existing of the Type2 routing 
        header, the MN replaces the destination address with the address in 
        the Type2 routing header. Then the packet is transferred to the upper 
        layer and seems to be transmitted to the primary HoA. 

     4.2. Outgoing packets 

        When the MN wants to send the packet from the interface corresponding 
        to its primary HoA, it is sent out following the basic PMIPv6 
        procedure. However, when the MN wants to send it through a different 
        interface, the Primary HoA option is added in the packet and its 
        primary HoA is carried. When the LMA receivers this packet with 
        Primary HoA option, it replaces the source address with the address 
        in the primary HoA option and sends it to the destination. Finally, 
        when the CN receives this packet, it seems that the packet is sent by 
        the primary HoA of MN. 

      5. Deployed in different scenarios 

        In this section, we illustrate our scheme based on the following 
        three multi-interface scenarios [2].

                          Figure 4 Network architecture 

        The network architecture is shown in figure 4. As shown in figure 4, 
        the multi-interface MN is configured with interface 1 (IF1) and 
        interface 2 (IF2), which connect to the MAG1 and MAG2 separately. 

        In order to encapsulate the primary HoA of MN in the primary HoA 
        option, the LMA should know the primary HoA of the MN firstly.  

        When the stateless address configuration scheme is used, the LMA only 
        allocate the HNP for the MN. However, when the LMA receives the PBU 
        message containing the Mobile Node Link-layer Identifier Option, 
        the LMA can also know the primary HoA of MN because the LMA can 
        construct the HoA as the MN does. When the stateful address 
        configuration scheme is adopted, the MAG can notify the HoA to the 
        LMA. The actual implementation details are out of scope of this 
        document. 

     5.1. Unique Prefix per Interface 

        In this scenario, the MN receives different HNPs from different 
        interfaces and configures different HoAs accordingly. The first HoA 
        is denoted as primary HoA. And all the upper layer applications are 
        established with the primary HoA. Then the binding state of LMA is 
        shown in figure 5.

                Figure 5 The extended binding state in scenario1 

        As shown in figure 5, the MN configures two HoAs in the IF1 and IF2, 
        according to the distinguished HNPs. The HNP1:IF1 is its primary HoA,, 
        then its P flag is set to 1. If the IFP1 is bigger than IFP2, the 
        basic PMIPv6 procedure is executed. If the IFP1 is smaller than IFP2, 
        the packet should be sent through the MAG2 but the HNP1:IF1 is 
        contained in the primary HoA option. If the IFP1 equals to the IFP2, 
        the packet should be sent simultaneously though the MAG1 and MAG2, 
        but the packet sent through MAG2 should contain the primary HoA 
        option. 

     5.2. Unique Address per Interface 

        In this scenario, the mobile node is assigned the same prefix across 
        multiple interfaces, but with a unique address per interface. The 
        first HoA is denoted as primary HoA. And all the upper layer 
        applications are established with the primary HoA. Then the binding 
        state of LMA is shown in figure 6.

        The operation of our scheme is similar with that in the first 
        scenario and we will not explain it in detail.

     5.3. Shared Address across Interfaces 

        In this scenario, the mobile node is assigned the same address across 
        multiple interfaces. This scenario enables a mobile node to use 
        different links, but make only one IP address visible to the 
        applications. Figure 7 illustrates this scenario.

                Figure 7 The extended binding state in scenario1 

        As shown in figure 7, the MN configures the same addresses in 
        different interfaces. When the LMA receives the packet sent to the MN, 
        it only needs to judge which tunnel has the highest priority and then 
        sends the packets to the MAG with the highest IFP. However, the 
        address option and routing header are not needed because the HoA is 
        just the primary HoA of the MN. 

      6. Use cases 

        Based on the extension defined in this document, the MN can connect 
        to the PMIPv6 network with multiple interfaces. In this section, the 
        following three typical use cases are presented. For simplicity, we 
        illustrate them in the Unique Prefix per Interface scenario.

     6.1. Multihoming support  

        In this use case, the MN is configured with two interfaces (e.g., IF1 
        and IF2) and their corresponding MAGs are MAG1 and MAG2. The 
        following signaling flow is the attachments of IF1 and IF2, and then 
        the MN communicates using the two interfaces simultaneously.

                           Figure 8 multihoming procedure 

        The procedure is listed as follows: 

        1) the MN attaches to the MAG1 through the IF1; 

        2) after the PBU and PBA exchange between MAG1 and LMA, the bi-
           directional tunnel is established between them. Then the MAG1 
           send the allocated HNP1 to IF1; 



      
      
     Zhang et al.            Expires December,2010                 [Page 10] 
         
     Internet-Draft     Address option based mulif in PMIPv6      March 2010 
      

        3) then the primary HoA is configured by HNP1. The upper layer 
           application is established using the primary HoA. Because the MN 
           only activates the IF1 at this moment, the packets to and from 
           the MN are transmitted using the primary HoA directly  

        4) the MN attaches to the MAG2 using the IF2; 

        5) after the PBU and PBA exchange between MAG2 and LMA, the bi-
           directional tunnel is established between them. Then the MAG2 
           send the allocated HNP2 to IF2; 

        6) because the IFP1 equals to the value of IFP2 in the multihoming 
           case. The IF1 and IF2 are used to transmit packets simultaneously. 
           For the packets sent to IF1, they are sent following the basic 
           PMIPv6 specification. However, for the packets sent to IF2, the 
           primary HoA (e.g., HoA1) is carried in the Primary HoA option and 
           Type2 routing header by MN and LMA, separately. 

     6.2. Inter-technology handover support 

        During the inter-technology handover, the MN transfers the traffic 
        from one interface to another one. Figure 6 shows the inter-
        technology handover procedure.

                 Figure 9 Inter-technology handover procedure 
        The procedure is listed as follows: 

        1) at the beginning, the MN communicates in the multihoming manner. 

      
      
     Zhang et al.            Expires December,2010                 [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft     Address option based mulif in PMIPv6      March 2010 
      

        2) when the vertical handover from IF1 to IF2 is triggered, the MN 
           sends the Handover Indication (HI) message to the MAG2 from IF2. 
           The format of this message is not confined in this document. It 
           may be a neighbor advertisement (NA) message or other upper layer 
           signaling message. However, the IFP settings should be contained 
           in this HI signaling. In our example, we assume that the IFP2 is 
           bigger than IFP1 in the HI message. 

        3) after the PBU and PBA exchange between MAG2 and LMA, the binding 
           state is refreshed with the new IFP settings. 

        4) then the following packets are transmitted through the IF2, which 
           has the higher IFP value. However, the HoA1 is carried in the 
           extended option and routing header.  

     6.3. Flow mobility support  

        For supporting flow mobility support, there is a need to support 
        vertical handover scenario but setting the same IFP for a subset of 
        interfaces. 

      7. Compatibility 

        In order to make sure that our scheme can be deployed in any network 
        architecture, its compatibility with other specifications must be 
        considered. 

     7.1. With RFC 5213  

        When the MN is configured with only one interface, the HoA configured 
        in that interface is just its primary HoA. Then all the packets to 
        and from the MN are transmitted using this primary HoA and then the 
        procedure is totally compatible with the RFC 5213.  

     7.2. With RFC 3775  

        When the MN enters the MIPv6 network, the mobility should be managed 
        by itself. However, when the route optimization between CN is 
        completed, the MN and CN can communicate with each other directly 
        with the Home address option and Type2 routing header. The operations 
        of the Home address option and Type2 routing header are just the same 
        as in our scheme. 

     7.3. With RFC 5648 

        Based on the RFC 5648 [8], the multi-interface MN can register 
        multiple care-of addresses (CoA) at the HA. For the packets 
      
      
     Zhang et al.            Expires December,2010                 [Page 12] 
         
     Internet-Draft     Address option based mulif in PMIPv6      March 2010 
      

        transmission, the CoA with the highest priority is used. As specified 
        in the RFC 5648, the MN can configure multiple addresses in multiple 
        interfaces according to our scheme, and then the interface with the 
        highest IFP is always used to transmit packets. However, the tunnel 
        is used in RFC 5648 and the address-replacement is used in our scheme 
        in order to guarantee that the packets arrive at the final 
        destination of the MN (e.g., HoA in RFC 5648 and primary HoA in our 
        scheme). In a word, they are two schemes to implement the multi-
        interface MN connectivity and just use the different packet 
        transmission mechanisms. 

      8. Security Considerations 

        In order to manage the multiple interfaces of the MN, the IFP and P 
        should be synchronized between LMA and MN. Besides, the MN should 
        actively set the values of IFP and P. Then the network must monitor 
        the settings of the IFP and P in order to eliminate the malicious and 
        unreasonable settings.
