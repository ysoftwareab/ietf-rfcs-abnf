Abstract

   This document defines an electronic mail header that enables a sender
   to include a Jabber Identifier in the header block of an email
   message for the purpose of associating the email message or sender
   with a particular address on an Extensible Messaging and Presence
   Protocol (XMPP) network.

Internet-Draft                  Jabber-ID                      July 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), documented in
   [RFC3920], is a streaming XML technology that enables any two
   entities on a network to exchange well-defined but extensible XML
   elements (called "XML stanzas") in close to real time.  Given XMPP's
   heritage in the Jabber open-source community, one of the primary uses
   for XMPP is instant messaging and presence as documented in
   [RFC3921], and XMPP addresses are still referred to as Jabber
   Identifiers.

   Because almost all users of Jabber instant messaging and presence
   systems are users of email systems, it would be helpful for such
   users to specify their Jabber Identifiers in the email messages they
   send.  The Jabber-ID header defined in this document provides a
   standard location for that information.

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Jabber-ID Syntax

   The syntax of the Jabber-ID header is defined below using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (as specified by [RFC4234]), where the "pathxmpp"
   rule is defined in [XMPP-URI] and the remaining rules are defined in
   [RFC2822]:

   "Jabber-ID:" [FWS] pathxmpp (*WSP / obs-FWS) CRLF

   Although a native XMPP address may contain virtually any [UNICODE]
   character, an electronic mail header may contain only printable [US-
   ASCII] characters (see Section 2 of [RFC2822]).  Therefore, any non-
   US-ASCII characters in an XMPP address MUST be converted to US-ASCII
   before inclusion in a Jabber-ID header, in accordance with the rules
   specified in [XMPP-URI].


3.  Examples

   For a user whose XMPP address is "juliet@example.com", the
   corresponding Jabber-ID header would be:

   Jabber-ID: juliet@example.com

   As noted, non-US-ASCII characters in XMPP addresses must be converted

   into US-ASCII before inclusion in a Jabber-ID header.  Consider the
   following XMPP address:

   ji&#x159;i@&#x10D;echy.example

   Note: The string "&#x159;" stands for the Unicode character LATIN
   SMALL LETTER R WITH CARON and the string "&#x10D;" stands for the
   Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CARON, following the "XML
   Notation" used in [RFC3987] to represent characters that cannot be
   rendered in ASCII-only documents (note also that these characters are
   represented in their stringprep canonical form).  For those who do
   not read Czech, this example could be Anglicized as
   "george@czech-lands.example".

   Following the rules in [XMPP-URI] and the Jabber-ID header syntax,
   the resulting header would be:

   Jabber-ID: ji%C5%99i@%C4%8Dechy.example


4.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with [RFC3864], the IANA registers the "Jabber-ID"
   header field in the Permanent Message Header Field Registry.  The
   registration template is as follow:

   Header field name: Jabber-ID
   Applicable protocol: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (RFC
      3920)
   Status: provisional
   Author/Change controller: IETF
   Specification document(s): XXXX
   Related information: None


5.  Security Considerations

   Message headers are an existing standard and are designed to easily
   accommodate new types.  Although the Jabber-ID header may be forged,
   this problem is inherent in Internet email.  A forged Jabber-ID
   header may break automated processing; therefore the Jabber-ID header
   SHOULD NOT be depended upon to indicate the authenticity of the
   message or the identity of the sender.

   Advertising XMPP addresses in email headers may make it easier for
   malicious users to harvest XMPP addresses and therefore to send
   unsolicited bulk communications to the users or applications
   represented by those addresses.  Care should be taken in balancing

   the benefits of open information exchange against the potential costs
   of unwanted communications.
