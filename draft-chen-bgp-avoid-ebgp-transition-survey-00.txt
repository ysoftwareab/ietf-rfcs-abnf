1. Summary

   This document provides an implementation report for "Avoid BGP Best
   Path Transitions from One External to Another" [1].  Each response is
   listed. The editor makes no claim as to the accuracy of the
   information provided.

   The following organizations reported having implementations of the
   draft: Cisco Systems, and Redback Networks.


2. Implementation Forms


2.1. Cisco Systems

   Person filling out this form:

       Kawika Chetron (kawika@cisco.com)

   Implementation (Software Version):

       IOS-XR 3.3

   Does the implementation include all parts of the specification?

       We implement the first and second paragraphs of section 3.

       We have support for parallel peering sessions between the same
       two peers, and as such, paragraph 3 is not applicable to our
       implementation.

   Are there parts of the specification that are unclear for
   implementation?

       No.

   List other implementations that have been tested for
   interoperability.

       Certainly, IOS-XR has been tested extensively with IOS.  I do not
       know if this particular behavior has been covered in testing with
       any other OS.
