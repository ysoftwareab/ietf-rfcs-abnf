1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide a number of detailed
   reports and documents that their registrars require on a daily,
   weekly and monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction
   reports, as well as lists containing currently unavailable domains
   and current premium domains. These reports are critical for
   registrars' businesses and play an important role in accounting and
   operations processes as well as in sales and marketing activities.
   In the current set-up registrars must download these reports from
   each registry's intranet in a different manner according to each
   registry's own document management set up.
   
   A domain inventory comparison between the domains that are on an
   accreditation and the domains that a registrar has in his system
   is therefore helpful.
   
   This document describes the content of a domain inventory report
   based on the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-report-structure] and
   delivered by the [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-reporting-repo].

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.
   
2.1.  Internationalized Domain Names

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-report-structure].

2.2.  Character Encoding

   MUST be as defined in
   [I-D.mcpherson-sattler-registry-report-structure].

3.  Report Headings

   The first row MUST be the column headings in the following order:
   
   TLD               It MUST contain the top-level domain name and
                     formatted according to section 2.1 of this
                     document.
   
   DOMAIN            It MUST contain the domain name formatted according
                     to section 2.1 of this document.

   REGISTRARID       It MUST contain the registrar ID of the succesful
                     transaction according to section 4 of this
                     document.
                     
4.  Registrar ID

   A unique registrar ID MUST be listed, with each transaction. Those
   IDs MUST be according the IANA registrar IDs (https://www.iana.org/
   assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xhtml) where applicable,
   otherwise another unique registrar ID MUST be used.

5.  Examples

5.1.  Single TLD File Example

   This is an example of a domain inventory report for a single
   top-level domain .example.
   
   Filename: example_domain-inventory_2018-11-01.csv.gz
   
   TLD,DOMAIN,REGISTRARID
   example,test1.example,1
   example,test2.example,1
   example,test3.example,1
   example,xn--4gqvdy3r.example,1

5.2.  Multiple TLDs File Example

   This is an example of a domain inventory report for multiple
   top-level domains from example registry.
   
   Filename: example-registry_domain-inventory_2018-11.csv.gz

   TLD,DOMAIN,REGISTRARID
   example1,test1.example1,1
   example2,test1.example2,1
   example3,test2.example3,1
   xn--zckzah,xn--r8jz45g.xn--zckzah,1

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   The registry domain inventory report described in this document do
   not provide any security services.

8.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Add implementation details once available.
