            Packet expiration time in 6LoWPAN Routing Header
                   draft-lijo-6lo-expiration-time-03

Abstract

   This document specifies a new type for the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Page 1
   for carrying the expiration time of data packets within the 6LoWPAN
   routing header.  The expiration time is useful in making forwarding
   and scheduling decisions for time critical IoT M2M applications that
   need deterministic delay guarantees over constrained networks and
   operate within time-synchronized networks.

1.  Introduction

   Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are likely to be employed for
   implementing real time industrial applications that require end-to-
   end delay guarantees [I-D.grossman-detnet-use-cases].  A
   Deterministic Network typically requires that data packets generated
   by some senders have to reach their receivers within strict time
   bounds.  Intermediate nodes use the expiration time information to
   make appropriate packet forwarding and scheduling decisions to meet
   the time bounds.

   The draft [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch] specifies the 6LoWPAN
   Routing Header (6LoRH), compression schemes for RPL routing (source
   routing) operation [RFC6554], header compression of RPL Packet
   Information [RFC6553], and IP-in-IP encapsulation.  This document
   specifies a new Deadline-6LoRH type to the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Page 1,

   so that the expiration time of data packets can be included within
   the 6LoWPAN routing header.  In addition, this specification
   specifies handling of the expiration time when packets traverse
   through time-synchronized networks operating in different timezones
   or distinct reference clocks.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The Terminology used in this document is consistent with and
   incorporates that described in [RFC6550] and [I-D.ietf-6tisch-
   terminology].

3.  6LoRHE Generic Format

   The generic header format of the 6LoRHE is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch].  Figure 1 illustrates the 6LoRHE
   generic format.  Note: this section is not normative.  It is included
   for convenience, and may be deleted in a later revision of this
   document.

4.  Deadline-6LoRH Description

   The Deadline-6LoRH (see Figure 2) is an elective 6LoRH that provides
   a compressed form of expiration time for an IPv6 datagram.  Along
   with the expiration timer, the header can include the packet




Lijo Thomas, et al.     Expires December 23, 2017               [Page 3]

   origination time, to enable a close estimate of the total delay
   incurred by a packet.

   The packet expiration time field contains the value of the packet
   expiration time.  The packet SHOULD be delivered to the Receiver
   before this time.

      packet_expiration_time = packet_origination_time + max_delay

   All nodes within the network SHOULD process the Deadline-6LoRH in
   order to support delay-sensitive deterministic applications.  In this
   specification, the packet origination time is represented in
   different time units according to a scaling parameter value in the
   routing header.  One of the time units is the Network ASN (Absolute
   Slot Number) which can be used in case of a time slotted synchronized
   network, for instance a 6TiSCH network, where a global time is
   maintained in the units of slot lengths of certain resolution.

   The delay experienced by packets in the network is a useful metric
   for network diagnostics and performance monitoring.  To support this
   feature, the specification provides an optional packet Origination
   Time (OT) field as part of the header which is initialized by the
   sender using the current clock time of the outgoing network interface
   through which the packet is forwarded.  Whenever the packets crosses
   over to a network using a different reference clock, the Origination
   Time field is updated to represent the same Origination Time as
   expressed using the reference clock of the outgoing interface into
   the new network.  This is the same as the current time when the
   packet is transmitted into the new network, minus the delay already
   experienced by the packet, say 't'.  In effect, to the newly entered
   network, the packet will appear to have originated 't' time units
   earlier with respect to the reference clock of the new network.

   Origination Time in new network = current_time_in_new_network -
                  delay_already_experienced_in_previous_network(s)

   Length (5 bits): Length represents the total length of the Expiration
   Time type measured in octets.

   6LoRH Type: TBD

   O flag (1bit): Indicates the presence of Origination Time field.  '1'
   means the Origination Time is present, and '0' means it is absent.

   D flag (1 bit): The 'D' flag, set by the Sender, indicates the action
   that needs to be taken when an 6LR detects expiration time is
   elapsed.  If 'D' bit is 1, then the 6LR SHOULD drop the packet if the
   expiration time is elapsed.  If 'D' bit is 0, then the 6LR MAY ignore
   the Expiration Time and forward it.

   ETL (3 bits): Length of Expiration Time field.

   OTL (3 bits) : Length of Origination Time field.

      For example, ETL = 000 means the expiration time in the 6LoRHE is
      1 octet (8 bits) long.  Similarly, OTL = 111 means the origination
      time is 8 octets (64 bits) long.

   TU (2 bits) : Indicates time units for packet expiration and
   origination time fields

      00 : Time represented in microseconds
      01 : Time represented in seconds
      10 : Network ASN
      11 : Reserved

   EXP (3 bits) : Multiplication factor expressed as exponent of 10.

      The value of the ET field is multiplied by 10 to this power, to
      get the actual expiration time in the units represented by TU.
      The default value of EXP is 000, so that the ET field is
      unaffected.

   Rsv (3 bits) : Reserved

   ET Value (8..64-bit) : Expiration Time value

   OT Value (8..64-bit) : Origination Time value

   Whenever the Sender initiates the IP datagram, it includes the
   Deadline-6LoRH along with other 6LoRH information.

   Example: Consider a 6TiSCH network with time-slot length of 10ms.
   Let the current ASN when the packet is originated be 54400, and the

   maximum allowable delay (max_delay) for the packet delivery is 1
   second from the packet origination, then:

      expiration_time = packet_origination_time + max_delay

         = 55400 + 100 (in Network ASNs)
         = 55500(Network ASNs)

   Deadline-6LoRH encoding with 'O' flag set to 1 :

      ETL = 001, OTL = 001, TU = '10', EXP = 2, ET = 0x22B, OT = 0x22A

6.  Deadline-6LoRH in Three Network Scenarios

   In this section, Deadline-6LoRH operation is described for 3 network
   scenarios.  Figure 3 depicts a constrained time-synchronized LLN that
   has two subnets N1 and N2, connected through LBRs
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router] with different reference clock times
   T1 and T2.

6.1.  Scenario 1: Endpoints in the same DODAG (N1) in non-storing mode.

   In scenario 1, shown in Figure 4, the Sender 'S' has an IP datagram
   to be routed to a Receiver 'R' within the same DODAG.  For the route
   segment from Sender to 6LBR, the Sender includes a Deadline-6LoRH by
   encoding the expiration time contained in the inband-OAM header
   extension.  Then 6LR begins hop-by-hop operation to forward the

   packet towards the 6LBR.  Once 6LBR receives the IP datagram, it
   generates a IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulated packet when sending the packet
   downwards to the Receiver [I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo].  The 6LBR
   copies the Deadline-6LoRH from the Sender originated IP header to the
   outer IP header.  The Deadline-6LoRH contained in the inner IP header
   is elided.

   At the tunnel endpoint of IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation, the Deadline-
   6LoRH is copied back from the outer header to inner header, and the
   inner IP packet is delivered to 'R'.

6.2.  Scenario 2: Endpoints in Networks with Dissimilar L2 Technologies.

   In scenario 2, shown in Figure 5, the Sender 'S' (belonging to DODAG
   1) has IP datagram to be routed to a Receiver 'R' over a time-
   synchronized IPv6 network.  For the route segment from 'S' to 6LBR,
   'S' includes a Deadline-6LoRH.  Subsequently, 6LR will perform hop-
   by-hop operation to forward the packet towards the 6LBR.  Once the IP
   datagram reaches 6LBR of DODAG1, it encodes the expiration time (and,
   if available, the origination time) into the In-band OAM header
   extension, [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] and passes the datagram to
   the IPv6 layer for further routing.

      Figure 5: Packet transmission in Dissimilar L2 Technologies or
                                 Internet

   The IP datagram is routed to another time synchronized deterministic
   network following its own distinct reference clock, so the expiration
   time in In-band OAM has to be updated according to the measurement of
   the current time in the new network.

6.3.  Scenario 3: Packet transmission across different DODAGs (N1 to
      N2).

   Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 6, in which the Sender 'S'
   (belonging to DODAG 1) has an IP datagram to be sent to Receiver 'R'
   belonging to another DODAG (DODAG 2).  The operation of this scenario
   can be decomposed into combination of case 1 and case 2 scenarios.
   For the route segment from 'S' to 6LBR, 'S' includes the Deadline-
   6LoRH.  Subsequently, each 6LR will perform hop-by-hop operation to
   forward the packet towards the 6LBR.  Once the IP datagram reaches
   6LBR1 of DODAG1, it applies the same rule as described in Case 2
   while routing the packet to LBR2 over a (likely) time synchronized
   wired backhaul.  The wired side of LBR2 can be mapped to receiver of
   Case 2.  Once the packet reaches LBR2, it updates the Deadline-6LoRH
   by adding the current time of DODAG2.  Further, it generates an IPv6-
   in-IPv6 encapsulated packet when sending the packet downstream to the
   Receiver [I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo].

        Figure 6: Packet transmission in different DODAGs(N1 to N2)

   Consider an example of a 6TiSCH network in which S in DODAG1
   generates the packet at ASN 20000 to R in DODAG2.  Let the maximum
   allowable delay be 1 second.  The time-slot length in DODAG1 and
   DODAG2 is assumed to be 10ms.  Once the expiration time is encoded in
   Deadline-6LoRH, the packet is forwarded to LBR of DODAG1.  Suppose
   the packet reaches LBR of DODAG1 at ASN 20050.

      current_time = ASN at LBR * slot_length_value

      remaining_time = expiration_time - current_time
      = ((packet_origination_time + max_delay) - current time)
      = (20000 + 100) - 20050
      = 50 (in Network ASNs)
      = 50 * 10^3 milliseconds.

   The remaining time is encoded in In-Band OAM (see Case 2) and
   forwarded to LBR2 over a different L2-interface, typically wired.
   Once the packet reaches LBR2, the expiration time in Deadline-6LoRH
   is adjusted by adding or subtracting the difference between the
   reference clocks of the two networks, before forwarding the packet to
   its connected 6TiSCH network.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new 6LoWPAN Timestamp Header Type, and
   assigns a value (TBD) from the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Page1 number space.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4944], [RFC6282] and [RFC6553]
   apply.  Using a compressed format as opposed to the full in-line
   format is logically equivalent and does not create an opening for a
   new threat when compared to [RFC6550], [RFC6553] and [RFC6554].
