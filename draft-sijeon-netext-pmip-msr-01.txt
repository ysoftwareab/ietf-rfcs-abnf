1. Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification allows no provision to
   switch a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to another LMA during mid-
   session when an LMA may need to handoff a mobile node (MN) to
   another LMA for load balancing or maintenance purpose.

   RFC 6463 describes the runtime LMA assignment functionality and the
   protocol extension for PMIPv6. However, it is defined only for
   initial registration process not in the case of mid-session.

   This specification describes a procedure and assisted methods for
   switching a current LMA to a target LMA, called mobility session
   redirection, in short MSR.



2. Overview

   The mobility session redirection (MSR) relies on the runtime LMA
   assignment scheme defined in [RFC6463].

                    Figure 1 An LMA switching procedure



   Figure 1 shows the message sequence procedure for the LMA switching
   operation. Suppose that each LMA has a load threshold it can endure.
   When load reaches the threshold of acceptable capacity of LMA1, LMA
   switching is then activated for a selected mobile node (MN). When
   the load reaches the absolute maximum capacity allowed in LMA1, LMA1
   sends load balancing (LB) warning indication to the determined MAG
   to have a specific LMA switching request such as a designated LMA.
   For the warning indication, the update notification mechanism,
   defined in [RFC7077], as to induce the binding refresh request can
   be utilized.

   However, LMA switching can be determined by the MAG in the allowed
   LMA load condition. So, the MAG can reject the LMA switching not to
   prevent an on-going session activity. When the MAG has a designated
   LMA address to switch the current one in the ordered list, the

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 with MSR                   July 2014


   target LMA address is delivered by an added option message in the
   PBU signaling message. For the option message, Redirect Mobility
   Option, defined in [RFC6463], can be used. When the MAG is no
   designated LMA address, null is given. Alternatively, when the load
   reaches the absolute maximum capacity allowed in LMA1, LMA1 does not
   wait for the next refresh binding request of Proxy Binding Update
   (PBU) message, and can proceed sending the PBU message for LMA
   switching towards LMA2. Once a chosen MN gets successfully
   redirected at LMA2, LMA2 takes the anchoring role for the MN so that
   data traffic between the MN and CNs is anchored at LMA2.



3. Selecting a Target Local Mobility Anchor

3.1. Based on the Ordered List

   MAG may choose a target LMA in the ordered list it for switching the
   current one. When the contacted LMA is failed to switch, the
   subsequent LMA is tried to switch the current LMA again.



3.2. Based on Load Monitoring Entity

   On the presence of load monitoring server of the deployed LMAs, the
   LMA can rely on the load monitoring server to know load status of
   target LMAs.



3.3. Based on Explicit Signaling

   A distributed approach can be utilized between LMAs to check load
   status of target LMA by internally defined signaling messages or the
   external mechanisms such as IEEE 802.21 signaling primitives or
   peer-to-peer (P2P) approach.



3.4. Periodic Load Information Broadcasting Among LMAs

   Load information can be obtained from periodic load information
   broadcasting of all the available LMAs. The LMA preparing the LMA
   switching can base the obtain information to select a target LMA.

4. IP Session Continuity

   The proposed LMA switching can be used, regardless of IP session
   continuity. When the LMA switching occurs, the MN needs to configure
   a new home network prefix (HNP) allocated from the prefix pool of
   the redirected LMA. IP session continuity support might be difficult
   in PMIPv6. But in case where all LMAs are connected behind a switch
   and configured with a shared network prefix on egress interfaces of
   the LMAs, Proxy Neighbor Discovery (ND) can be used to deliver the
   packets destined to the MN. In the configured network, the use of
   Anycast routing can be another option to let the MN exchange its
   traffic with a new LMA.
