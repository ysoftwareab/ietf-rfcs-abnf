                      IETF Discussion List Charter
                        draft-eggert-bcp45bis-01

Abstract

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology
   through the general discussion of topics for which no dedicated
   mailing lists exists.  As this is the most general IETF mailing list,
   considerable latitude is allowed.  Advertising, whether to solicit
   business or promote employment opportunities, falls well outside the
   range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a personal nature.

   This document obsoletes RFC3005.

Internet-Draft        IETF Discussion List Charter            March 2021


1.  Introduction

   The IETF discussion list [IETF-DISCUSS] furthers the development and
   specification of Internet technology through the general discussion
   of topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exists.  As this is
   the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed.
   Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote employment
   opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as
   do discussions of a personal nature.

   The IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL] applies to discussions on the IETF
   discussion list and all other IETF mailing lists, and requires
   conformance with the IETF Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the
   Anti-Harassment Policy [IETF-AHP], among others.

2.  Charter for the IETF Discussion List

   This list is meant for initial technical discussion only.
   Discussions that fall within the area of any working group, area or
   well established list should be moved to such more specific forums as
   soon as this is pointed out.

   When no dedicated mailing list exists, it may be preferable to
   request the creation of one [NON-WG-LISTS] and only announce the
   availability of the new list on the IETF discussion list.

   In addition to the topics noted above, appropriate postings include:

   *  Initial discussion of technical issues that are candidates for
      IETF work, but have not yet identified appropriate mailing lists.

   *  Questions and clarifications concerning IETF meetings, although
      most of these topics are better brought up on the discussion list
      for IETF LLC administrative issues [ADMIN-DISCUSS] or the attendee
      discussion list for a given IETF meeting, such as
      [IETF110-ATTENDEES] for IETF-110.

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF, although
      the IETF announcement list [IETF-ANNOUNCE] is the preferred list
      for these.

   These topics used to be in scope for the IETF discussion list, but
   have since moved to dedicated lists:

   *  Last Call discussions of proposed protocol actions now take place
      on the IETF Last Calls mailing list [LAST-CALLS].

   *  Discussion of IETF administrative policies now take place on the
      discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS].

   Inappropriate postings include:

   *  Unsolicited bulk e-mail

   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical concerns

   *  Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.

3.  Security Considerations

   The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-at-arms
   [SAA-SOP] appointed by the Chair is empowered to restrict posting by
   a person, or of a thread, when the content is inappropriate and
   represents a pattern of abuse [SAA-UPC].  They are encouraged to take
   into account the overall nature of the postings by an individual and
   whether particular postings are an aberration or typical.  Complaints
   regarding their decisions should be referred to the IAB.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
