signed_data = SIG_RDATA | RR(1) | RR(2)...  where

            "|" denotes concatenation

            SIG_RDATA is the wire format of the SIG RDATA fields with
               the Signature field excluded and the Signer's Name in
               canonical form.

            RR(i) = name | class | type | OrigTTL | RDATA length | RDATA
               name is calculated according to the function below

               class is the RRset's class

               type is the RRset type and all RRs in the class

               OrigTTL is the value from the SIG Original TTL field

               All names in the RDATA field are in canonical form

               The set of all RR(i) is sorted into canonical order.

            To calculate the name:
               let sig_labels = the value of the SIG Labels field

               let fqdn = RRset's fully qualified domain name in
                               canonical form

               let fqdn_labels = RRset's fully qualified domain name in
                               canonical form

               if sig_labels = fqdn_labels,
name = fqdn

name = "*." | the leftmost sig_label labels of the
   	                     fqdn
