Abstract


   BGP4 [1] uses a 32 bit field to identify router (the so called
   "router-IDs"). In IPv4 domain, an IPv4 address of the router
   is typically used in this field.
   In an IPv6 routing domain, routers may very well not have any IPv4
   Addresses. This document provides a simple way to form a globally
   Unique ID in such a case.


1. Introduction


   BGP4 [1] extension for IPv6 are defined in [2] and [3].
   However, BGP4 uses a 32 bit field known as the router ID.
   This router ID is used in:


   BGP4 [1] uses the router ID as an identifier in:
    - BGP Identifier in OPEN messages (local use)
    - AGGREGATOR (optional transitive) attributes
    - ORIGINATOR_ID (optional non-transitive) attributes [4]
    - CLUSTER_LIST (optional non-transitive) attributes [4]


   The AGGREGATOR attributes contain an Autonomous
   System (AS) number with the IP address of the BGP speaker
   that formed the aggregate route. It is the only transitive,
   (i.e. non local) use of the router ID.


   The router ID should be somehow unique and BGP implementations
   should provide a way to manually set it. This field typically
   contains one of the IPv4 addresses of the BGP4 speaker.
   In an IPv6 domain, some router may have IPv4 addresses,
   and some other may very well not have any. On those routers,
   one can not assigned random values to the router ID, as it could
   conflict with the router ID derived from an IPv4 addresses on
   another dual stack router.


   This document specifies a simple way to construct a somehow
   globally unique 32 bit router ID.


2. Recommended practice


   In the absence of a globally unique IPv4 address on the router,
   the 32 bit routing ID may be constructed with:


    - 4 bits set to one (as for an old reserved class E IPv4 address),


    - 16 bits set to the AS number (a global AS number
      SHOULD be used if the router ID can be seen outside the routing
      domain).


    - 12 bits manually allocated within the domain. This allows for 4096
      different router IDs in each routing domain.


                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
   |       |                               |                       |
   |  0xF  |          AS  Number           |  Locally allocated    |
   |       |                               |                       |   
   +-------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+



   Note: 32 bit AS numbers could be introduced in the future.
         This recommended solution would then have to be adapted.




3. Security Considerations


   The usage of fake IPv4 address of this form minimizes accidental
   or deliberate confusions (ie. same router ID for two different
   BGP speakers).
