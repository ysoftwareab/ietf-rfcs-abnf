1.  Introduction

   Generalised Multiprotocol Label Switched (GMPLS) is widely used in
   Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) to support the optical
   circuits set-up through the signalling between Core Nodes and Edge
   Nodes.  This extension addresses the use cases described by [RFC7698]
   Ch.3.3 and supports the information, needed in Spectrum Switched
   Optical Network (SSON), to signal a Media Channel and the associated
   carriers set request.  The new set of parameters is related to the
   Media Channel and the carrier(s) routed with it and keep the backward
   compatibility with the WSON signalling.  In particular this memo
   wants do address the use cases where the SSON LSP (the Media Channel
   in RFC7698) carries multiple carrier (OTSi) containing same Payload.
   The set of the carriers can be seen as single Logical circuit.  This

   memo can be considered as the extension of [RFC7792].  The contents
   and the parameters reflect the experimental activity on IP over SSON
   recently done by some vendors and research consortia.

   Figure 1 shows how the multiple carrier are mapped into a Media
   Channel.  A set of parameters must be shared on the UNI to allow the
   GMPLS to do the proper routing and Spectrum Assignment and decide the
   carrier position.

2.  Client interface parameters

   The Edge Node interface can have one or multiple carriers (OTSi).
   All the carrier have the same characteristics and are provisionable
   in terms of:

   Number of subcarriers:
      This parameter indicates the number of subcarriers (OTSi)
      available for the super-channel (OTSiG) in case the Transceiver
      can support multiple carrier circuits.  The OTSi is defined in
      ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4 [G.959.1].  The OTSiG
      is currently being moved from ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709]
      to the new draft Recommendation G.807 (still work in progress)
      [G.807].  The OTSiG is an electrical signal that is carried by one

      or more OTSi's.  The relationship between the OTSiG and the the
      OTSi's is described in ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807, section
      10.2 [G.807].

   Central frequency (see G.694.1 Table 1):
      This parameter indicates the Central frequency value that Ss and
      Rs will be set to work (in THz).  See the details in Section 6/
      G.694.1 or based on "n" value explanation and the following "k"
      values definition in case of multicarrier transceivers.

   Central frequency granularity:
      This parameter indicates the Central frequency granularity
      supported by the transceiver, this value is combined with k and n
      value to calculate the central frequency of the carrier or sub-
      carriers.

   Minimum channel spacing:
      This is the minimum nominal difference in frequency (in GHz)
      between two adjacent channels (or carriers) depending on the
      Transceiver characteristics.

   Bit rate / Baud rate of optical tributary signals:
      Optical Tributary Signal bit (for NRZ signals) rate or Symbol (for
      Multiple bit per symbol) rate .

   FEC Coding:
      This parameter indicate what Forward Error Correction (FEC) code
      is used at Ss and Rs (R/W) (not mentioned in G.698.2).  .

   Wavelength Range (see G.694.1):  [ITU.G694.1]
      This parameter indicate minimum and maximum wavelength spectrum in
      a definite wavelength Band (L, C and S).

   Modulation format:
      This parameter indicates the list of supported Modulation Formats
      and the provisioned Modulation Format.

   Inter carrier skew:
      This parameter indicates, in case of multi-carrier transceivers
      the maximum skew between the sub-carriers supported by the
      transceiver.

   Laser Output power:
      This parameter provisions the Transceiver Output power, it can be
      either a setting and measured value.

   Receiver input power:




Galimberti, et al.         Expires May 7, 2020                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draftdraft-ggalimbe-ccamp-flexigrid-carrier-label-November 2019


      This parameter provisions the Min and MAX input pover suppotred by
      the Transceiver, i.e. Receiver Sensitivity.

   The above parameters are related to the Edge Node Transceiver and are
   used by the Core Network GMPLS in order to calculate the optical
   feasibility and the spectrum allocation.  The parameters can be
   shared between the Client and the Network via LMP or provisioned to
   the Network by an EMS or an operator OSS.

3.  Use Cases

   The use cases are described in draft-ietf-ccamp-dwdm-if-mng-ctrl-fwk
   and [RFC7698]

4.  Signalling Extensions

   Some of the above parameters can be applied to RFC7792 (SENDER_TSPEC/
   FLOWSPEC).  The above parameters could be applied to [RFC4208]
   scenarios but they are valid also in case of non UNI scenarios.  The
   [RFC6205] parameters remain valid.

4.1.  New LSP set-up parameters

   When the E.N. wants to request to the C.N. a new circuit set-up
   request or the GMPLS wants to signal in the SSON network the Optical
   Interface characteristics the following parameters will be provided
   to the C.N.:

   Number of available subcarriers (c):
      This parameter is an integer and identifies the number of Client
      ports connected to the Core ports available to suport the
      requested circuit, this identify also the number of OTSi in an
      OTSiG.

   Total bandwidth request:
      e.g. 200Gb, 400Gb, 1Tb - it is the bandwidth (payload) to be
      carried by the multiple carrier circuit (OTSiG).  In alternative
      the OTUCn can be used

   Policy (strict/loose):
      Strict/loose referred to B/W and subcarrier number.  This is to
      give some flexibility to the GMPLS in order to commit client
      request.

   Subcarrier bandwidth tunability:
      (optional) e.g. 34Ghz, 48GHz.

   Carrier Number: number of carrier to be allocated for the requested
       channel (16-bit unsigned integer)
       If Carrier Number == 0 no constraint set on the number of
       carriers to be used

   S strict number of subcarrier
    -  S = 0 the number of requested carriers is the maximum number
             that can be allocated (a lower value can be allocated if
             the requested bandwidth is satisfied)
    -  S = 1 the number of requested carriers is strict (must be > 0)

   Total Bandwidth: the requested total bandwidth to be supported by
       the Media Channel (32-bit IEEE float, bytes/s)
       If Total Bandwidth == 0: no bandwidth constraint is defined
       (B must be 0)

   B Bandwidth constraints
    - B = 0: the value is the maximum requested bandwidth (a lower
             value can be allocated if resources are not available)
    - B = 1: the requested bandwidth is the minimum value to be
             allocated (a higher value can be allocated if requested
             by the physical constraints of the ports)

   Reserved: unused bit (for future use, should be 0)

   Note: bandwidth unit is defined in accordance to RFC 3471
      chap. 3.1.2 Bandwith Encoding specification.  Bandwidth higher
      than 40Gb/s values must be defined (e.g. 100Gb/s, 150Gb/s
      400Gb/s, etc.) or in alternative the OTUCn defined in
      ITU-T G.709.

   TLV Usage:
   Head UNI-C PATH: requested traffic constraints, the Head UNI-N
       node must satisfy when reserving the optical resources and
       defining the carriers configuration
   The TLV can be omitted: no traffic constraints is defined
       (resources allocated by UNI-N based on a local policy)

4.2.  Extension to LSP set-up reservation

   Once the GMPLS has calculated the Media Channel path, the Spectrum
   Allocation, the Sub-carrier number and frequency, the modulation
   format, the FEC and the Transmit power, sends back to the E.N. the
   path set-up confirmation providing the values of the calculated
   paramenters:

   Media Channel:
      (Grid, C.S., Identifier m and n). as indicated in RFC7699
      Section 4.1

   Modulation format:
      This parameter indicates the Modulation Formats to be set in the
      Transceivers.

   FEC Coding:
      This parameter indicate what Forward Error Correction (FEC) code
      must be used by the Transceivers (not mentioned in G.698).  .

   Bit rate / Baud rate of optical tributary signals:
      Optical Tributary Signal bit (for NRZ signals) rate or Symbol (for
      Multiple bit per symbol) rate.

   List of subcarriers:
      This parameter indicates the subcarriers to be used for the super-
      channel (OTSiG) in case the Transceiver can support multiple
      carrier Circuits.

   Central frequency granularity (J):
      This parameter indicates the Central frequency granularity
      supported by the transceiver, this value is combined with K and n
      value to calculate the central frequency on the carrier or sub-
      carriers.

   Central frequency (see G.694.1 Table 1):
      Grid, Identifiers, central frequency and granularity.

   Laser Output power:
      This parameter provisions the Transceiver Output power, it can be
      either a setting and measured value.

   Circuit Path, RRO, etc:
      All these info are defined in [RFC4208].

   Path Error:
      e.g. no path exist, all the path error defined in [RFC4208].


   The TLV defines the carriers signal configuration.
   All carriers in a Media Channel MUST have the same configuration.

   Traffic Type
   - Modulation ID (Format) : is the modulation type:
         BPSK, DC DP BSPSK, QPSK, DP QPSK, 8QAM, 16QAM,
         32QAM, 64QAM, etc.
          - <TBD> (ITU-T reference)
          - Value > 32768 (first bit is 1): custom defined values
          - Value 0 is reserved to be used if no value is defined
   - Bits/Symbol(BPS) this indicates the bit per symbol in case of
      hybrid modulation format. It is an off-set with values from 0
      to 127 to be applied to the specified Modulation Format and
      indicates the mix between the selected Modulation Format and its
      upper adjacent.
      (e.g. QPSK + 63 BPS indicates that there is a 50% MIX between
      QPSK and 8-QAM = 2.5 bits per symbol) If value = 0 the
      standard Modulation Format is applied
   - FEC: the signal Forward Error Corrections type (16-bit
            unsigned integer), the defined values are:
            - 1 to 32767 <TBD> (ITU-T reference)
            - 32768 to 65536 (first bit is 1): custom defined values
            - Value 0 is reserved to be used if no value is defined
     - Baud Rate: the signal symbol rate (IEEE 32-bit float,
              in bauds/s)
            - Value 0 is reserved to be used if no value is defined

   Notes:
   - The PATH request from the Head UNI-C node can specify all or
     only a subset of the parameters (e.g. the Modulation and the
     baud rate as required but not the FEC) setting to 0 for the
     undefined parameters.
     When forwarding the PATH message, the UNI-N will set the
     undefined parameters based on the optical impairment calculation
     and the constraints giveng by the UNI-C
   - Custom codes (values > 0x8000) interpretation is a local
     installation matter.

   TLV Usage:
   - Head UNI-C PATH: used to force specific transponder
     configurations
   - Head UNI-N RESV: set selected configuration on head node
   - Tail UNI-N PATH: set selected configuration on tail node

         position inside the Media Channel (16-bit unsigned integer)
         The Carrier Identifier is the logical circuit sub-lane
         position, a TLV for each value from 1 to the number of
         allocated carriers must be present.
   - J field:  granularity of the channel spacing, can be a
         multiple of 0.01GHz. - default value is 0.1GHz.
   - K field:  positive or negative integer (including 0) to multiply
         by J and identify the Carrier Position inside the
         Media Channel, offset from media Channel Central frequency
   - sub-TLVs: additional information related to carriers if needed
         and the ports associated to the carrier.

     In summary Carrier Frequency = MC-C.F. (in THz) + K * J GHz.

4.3.  RSVP Protocol Extensions considerations

   The additional information described in the draft, is related to the
   Media Channel supported traffic.  It could be encoded in the
   SENDER_TSPEC/FLOW_SPEC objects by extending the SSON_SENDER_TSPEC/
   SSON_FLOW_SPEC defined in RFC 7792 (or defining a new C-Type) with an
   optional TLV list or it could be encoded in a newly defined entry
   (new OBJECT or new LSP_ATTRIBUTES OBJECT TLV)

   This solution is consistent with other technology specific extensions
   (e.g.  SDH), but requires the explicit handling of the extensions by
   all nodes.

   Beside this, some of the additional information defined is local to
   the head/tail UNI link (e.g. the carrier/port association), while the
   traffic spec info should be valid end-to-end.

   There can be different methods to model and signal the carriers as
   described in draft-lee-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang.  The
   Media Channel, Network Media Channel and lables are well modelled by
   the RFC7698, RFC7699 and RFC7792 reflecting the ITU-T Recommendations
   G.694.1 and G.698.2.

   Some work is in progress in ITU-T SG15/Q12 to define Network Media
   Channel (group) that is capable of accommodating the optical
   tributary signals (OTSi) belonging to optical tributary signal group
   (OTSiG) (see new ITU-T Draft Recommendation G.807).  Currently, no
   models exist (in the IETF nor ITU-T SG15) that define how the optical
   tributary signals are described inside the Network Media Channel
   Group in terms of OTSi identifier, OTSi carrier frequency and OTSi
   signal width.

   Other the encoding proposal reported in this draft, there are several
   at least two other methods to describe the parameters.  An option is
   to describe the OTSi carrier frequency relative to the anchor
   frequency 193.1THz based on a well-defined granularity (e.g.  OTSi
   carrier frequency = 193100 (GHz) + K * granularity (GHz) where K is a
   signed integer value).  A second option is to explicitly describe the
   OTSi carrier frequency and the OTSi signal width in GHz with a
   certain accuracy.

   The second option which is independent of the n, m values already
   defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.694.1.  The OTSi carrier frequency
   is described in GHz with 3 fractional digits (decimal 64 fraction
   digits 3).  The OTSi signal width is described in GHz with 3
   fractional digits (decimal 64 fraction digits 3) and includes the
   signal roll off as well as some guard band.

   The accuracy of 0.001 GHz does not impose a requirement on the
   optical transceiver components (optical transmitter) in terms of
   carrier frequency tunability precision.  Today's components typically
   provide a tunability precision in the range of 1..1.5GHz (carrier
   frequency offset compared to the configured nominal carrier
   frequency).  Future components may provide a better precision as
   technology evolves.  If needed, a controller may retrieve the
   transceiver properties in terms of carrier frequency tunability
   precision in order to be capable of properly configuring the
   underlying transceiver.

   GMPLS message security uses IPsec, as described in xxxx.  This
   document only defines new UNI objects that are carried in existing
   UNI messages, similar to the UNI objects in xxx.  This document does
