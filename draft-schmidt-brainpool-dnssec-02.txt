1.  Introduction

   In [RFC5639] a new set of elliptic curve groups over finite prime
   fields for use in cryptographic applications is specified.  These
   groups, denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a
   verifiable pseudo-random way and comply with the security
   requirements of relevant standards from ISO [ISO1] [ISO2], ANSI
   [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS-186-4], and SecG [SEC2].

   [RFC6605] defines the usage of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) in DNSSEC with two specific NIST curves.  This
   document specifies the use of two additional curves from [RFC5639].
   Details on Elliptic Curves and the implementation of ECDSA can be
   found e.g. in [SEC1], [HMV], [BSI1], and [RFC6090].

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  SHA-384 DS Records

   The SHA-384 record is defined according to [RFC6605].  The algorithm
   SHA-384 is specified in [FIPS-180-4] and [RFC6234].  It is
   implemented in DNSSEC the same way as SHA-256 in [RFC4509].  For
   SHA-384 the digest size is 48 byte with digest type code 4.

4.  ECDSA Parameters

   Signer and verifier of an ECDSA signature need to agree on a set of
   parameters.  This document makes use of the Brainpool curves with the
   bit-sizes 256, and 384, specified in Section 3.4 and 3.6 of
   [RFC5639], denoted as Brainpool P256r1, and Brainpool P384r1.

5.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for ECDSA

   The records are defined as in [RFC6605]: The "Q" value of the ECDSA
   keys according to [FIPS-186-4] is encoded as the bit string "x|y",
   representing the concatenation of the x and y coordinates of the
   uncompressed curve point.  An ECDSA signature is composed of the
   integer values "r" and "s" (see [FIPS-186-4]).  Each integer value is
   encoded as bit string of 32 octets for Brainpool P256r1 and of 48
   octets for Brainpool P384r1.  The conversion of integers in bit
   strings is specified in Section C.2 of [FIPS-186-4].  The signature
   for DNSSEC is encoded as concatenation of the bit strings of "r" and
   "s", i.e., as "r|s".

   The IANA Considerations section defines the algorithm numbers used
   for DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records.

      Algorithm number TBD1 for using ECDSA with Brainpool P256r1 and
      SHA-256 for DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records.

      Algorithm number TBD2 for using ECDSA with Brainpool P384r1 and
      SHA-384 for DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records.

   The use of these algorithms is OPTIONAL, an implementer can choose to
   support any subset.

6.  Support for NSEC3 Denial of Existence

   The statement of [RFC6605] applies.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign numbers for ECDSA with ECC Brainpool
   curves listed in Section 4 to "Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
   Algorithm Numbers".  In the following the two new entries are listed.

              Number           TBD1
              Description      ECDSA Curve Brainpool P256r1 with SHA-256

      * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
      this algorithm with Transaction Security.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5639], [RFC6605], and [RFC4509]
   apply accordingly.
