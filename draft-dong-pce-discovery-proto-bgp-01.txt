      BGP Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery
                 draft-dong-pce-discovery-proto-bgp-01

Abstract

   In network scenarios where Path Computation Element (PCE) is used for
   centralized path computation, it is desirable for Path Computation
   Clients (PCCs) to automatically discover a set of PCEs.  As BGP can
   be used for north-bound distribution of routing and Label Switched
   Path (LSP) information to PCE, the PCEs may not participate in
   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for collecting the routing
   information, thus the IGP based PCE discovery cannot be used directly
   in these scenarios.  This document specifies the BGP extensions for
   PCE discovery.

1.  Introduction

   In network scenarios where Path Computation Element (PCE) is used for
   centralized path computation, it is desirable for Path Computation
   Clients (PCCs) to automatically discover a set of PCEs.  [RFC5088]
   and [RFC5089] define PCE discovery mechanism based on Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP).  The IGP based mechanisms may not work well
   in scenarios where the PCEs do not participate in the IGP, and it is
   difficult for PCE to participate in IGP of multiple domains where PCE
   discovery is needed.

   For example, Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] may
   be used by cooperating PCEs to compute inter-domain path, in which
   case these cooperating PCEs should be known to other PCEs.  In case
   of inter-AS network where the PCEs do not participate in a common
   IGP, the existing IGP discovery mechanism cannot be used to discover
   the PCEs in other domains.  Also in the Hierarchical PCE scenario,
   the child PCEs need to know the address of the parent PCE.  This

   cannot be achieved through IGP based discovery, as normally the child
   PCEs and the parent PCE are under different administration and reside
   in different domains.

   As BGP could be used for north-bound distribution of routing and
   Label Switched Path (LSP) information to PCE as described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] [I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution] and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-pm-bgp], PCEs can obtain the routing information
   without participating in IGP.  In this scenario, some other PCE
   disovery mechanism is also needed.

   A detailed set of requirements for a PCE discovery mechanism are
   provided in [RFC4674].

   This document proposes to extend BGP for PCE discovery for the above
   scenarios.  In networks where BGP-LS is already used for the north-
   bound routing information distribution to PCE, BGP based PCE
   discovery can reuse the existing BGP sessions and mechanisms to
   achieve PCE discovery.  It should be noted that, in IGP domain, the
   IGP based PCE discovery mechanism may be used in conjunction with the
   BGP based PCE discovery.  Thus the BGP based PCE discovery is
   complementary to the existing IGP based mechanisms.

                      Figure 1: BGP for PCE discovery

   As shown in the network architecture in Figure 1, BGP is used for
   both routing information distribution and PCE information discovery.
   The routing information is collected from the network elements and
   distributed to PCE, while the PCE discovery information is advertised
   from PCE to PCCs, or between different PCEs.  The PCCs maybe co-
   located with the BGP speakers as shown in Figure 1.  The IGP based
   PCE discovery mechanism may be used for the distribution of PCE
   discovery information in IGP domain.

2.  Carrying PCE Discovery Information in BGP

2.1.  PCE Address Information

   The PCE discovery information is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages
   using the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760].
   The AFI and SAFI defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] are re-
   used, and a new NLRI Type is defined for PCE discovery information as
   below:

   The 'Identifier' field is used to identify the "routing universe"

   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] apply.

   The detailed PCE discovery information is carried in BGP-LS attribute
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] with a new "PCE Discovery TLV", which
   contains a set of sub-TLVs for specific PCE discovery information.
   The PCE Discovery TLV and sub-TLVs SHOULD only be used with the PCE
   Discovery NLRI.

   The format of the PCE Discovery TLV is shown as below:

                       Figure 3. PCE Discovery TLV

   The PCE Discovery Sub-TLVs are listed as below.  The format of the
   PCE Discovery sub-TLVs are consistent with the IGP PCED sub-TLVs
   defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].  The PATH-SCOPE TLV MUST always
   be carried in the BGP-LS Attribute if the NLRI is PCE Discovery NLRI.
   Other PCE Discovery TLVs are optional and may facilitate the PCE
   selection process.

     TBD         3         PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV

     TBD     variable     OSPF-NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV
     TBD     variable     IS-IS-NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV

   More PCE Discovery sub-TLVs may be defined in future and the format
   SHOULD be in line with the new sub-TLVs defined for IGP based PCE
   discovery.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Existing BGP operational procedures apply to the advertisement of PCE
   discovery information.  This information is treated as pure
   application level data which has no immediate impact on forwarding
   states.  Normal BGP path selection can be applied to PCE Discovery
   NLRI only for the information propagation in the network, while the
   PCE selection on the PCCs would be peformed based on the information
   carried in the PCE Discovery TLV.

   PCE discovery information is considered relatively stable and does
   not change frequently, thus this information will not bring
   significant impact on the amount of BGP updates in the network.

Internet-Draft      BGP Extensions for PCE Discovery        October 2014


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign a new NLRI Type for 'PCE Discovery NLRI' from
   the "BGP-LS NLRI- Types" registry.

   IANA needs to assign a new TLV code point for 'PCE Discovery TLV'
   from the "node anchor, link descriptor and link attribute TLVs"
   registry.

   IANA needs to create a new registry for "PCE Discovery Sub-TLVs".
   The registry will be initialized as shown in section 2.2 of this
   document.

5.  Security Considerations

   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP security model.  See the 'Security Considerations'
   section of [RFC4271] for a discussion of BGP security.  Also refer to
   [RFC4272] and [RFC6952] for analysis of security issues for BGP.
