Internet-Draft            Classification of SDP            February 2009


Abstract

   Generally, next SDP is alternative descriptions for the previous one
   of the same session.  But there is other type of SDP which describe
   part of the session, not all aspects of the session.  It must be
   combined with the previous one(or ones) to show the effects.  There
   has been such usage of SDPs in RFC3108.  But there is no such
   guidance for that extension and usage.  This text is aimed for that.

Internet-Draft            Classification of SDP            February 2009


1.  Introduction

   There has been SDPs usage that make one SDP just part description of
   the session.  So we should have a detailed classification of SDP, and
   the classification will be guidance for complex extension and usage
   in the future.

2.  Classification of SDP

2.1.  Integrative SDP

   The SDP describes all aspects of the session.So we can say the new
   SDP is alternative description of the old one for same session.

2.2.  Non-Integrative SDP

   The SDP describe part of the session, not all aspects of the session.
   It must be combined with the previous one(or ones) to show the
   effects, as the formula:

   "current session state" = "previous session state" + "modification
   session description"

   Considering the distinction of different usages, it can be further
   divided into two categories.  Both of the usage categories obey the
   formula mentioned above.

2.2.1.  Partitive SDP

   The SDP describe part of the session, and the description of this
   part is self-governed.  One nice example is the usage in RFC3108:
   these different SDP describe different layers of the same connection,
   and SDP descriptors for different layers to remain simple and clean.

   The self-government is just confined in semantics of description.
   Relationship between the parts is not confined.  For example, one
   part of modification takes the modification of another part as
   precondition.  Then the modification will have predefined sequence.
   And it forms the Incremental SDPs in viewpoint of session level.

2.2.2.  Incremental SDP

   The SDP describe part of the session, and the description of this
   part must be combined with the previous one(or ones) to show the
   meaning and effect.  SDP has any or more than one characteristic of
   the three ones below can be treated as incremental SDP.

2.2.2.1.  attributes value means unchangge for absence

   For some type of medias, it must pre-set a lot of attributes, but
   there attributes do not change in high frequency.  So, this kind of
   attributes might be practical.

2.2.2.2.  attributes using incremental value

   For some type of medias, some of its attributes needed to be adjusted
   frequently.  And the value of the attributes is incremental.

   One example of such usage is virtual reality and multi-projector 3D
   displays. the location and angle of there projectors are usually
   controlled by stepper motor(stepping motor).  The control signal of
   the stepper motor is a discrete and incremental value, which will
   only be meaningful in the basis of the original value.

   We may draw an analogy between it and whiteboard application:
   Whiteboard application has the attribute "a=orient:orientation" which
   has clearly predefined permitted values.  But in virtual reality
   application, we should adjust the cameras and projectors according
   the movement of the viewer(user).  Further, location and angle of
   there projectors might has some king of relationship for achieving
   seamless imagery.

   So,the predefined permitted values is not enough for virtual reality
   application.  And the attributes with incremental value will be
   effective.

2.2.2.3.  Partitive SDPs have predefined sequence

   If There is some relationship in the SDPs, such as one part of
   modification takes the modification of another part as precondition,
   the modification will have predefined sequence, and forms a big
   nested transaction.

   And the sub-modification in the whole nested transaction must be
   issued one by one.  And in the whole, it forms a kind of incremental
   SDP.
