         CGA SEC Option for Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol
                   draft-jiang-6man-cga-sec-option-01

Abstract

   A Cryptographically Generated Address is an IPv6 addresses binding
   with a public/private key pair.  It is a vital component of Secure
   Neighbor Discovery (SeND) protocol.  The current SeND specifications
   are lack of procedures to specify the Sec bits.  A new SEC option is
   defined accordingly to address this issue.

1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA, [RFC3972]) are used to
   make sure that the sender of a Neighbor Discovery message is the
   "owner" of the claimed address.  Although it is not mandatory, it is
   a vital component of Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND, [RFC3971])
   protocol.  After CGA has been defined, as an independent security
   property, many other CGA usages have been proposed and defined, such
   as Enhanced Route Optimization for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4866], Site
   Multihoming by IPv6 Intermediation (SHIM6) [RFC5533], etc.

   SEC bits are an important parameter in the generation of CGAs.
   Particularly, SEC values are used to artificially introduce
   additional difficulty in the CGA generation process in order to
   provide additional protection against brute force attacks.
   Therefore, in different environments, host may be required to use
   different SEC bits in the generation of their CGAs.  However, the
   base SeND protocol fails to distribute the SEC values to the hosts.
   As a result, the network administration cannot propagate any
   requirements regarding to SEC value of host-generated CGA addresses.
   In order to fill this gap, a new CGA SEC Option, is defined in this
   document.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  CGA SEC Option

   CGA SEC Option is used to indicate on link hosts the lowest CGA SEC
   value they SHOULD use.  It SHOULD be contained in and only in the
   Router Advertisement Message [RFC4861].

   SEC bits  The value of SEC bits is specified in [RFC3972].

4.  Host Behavior

   On receiving the CGA SEC Option with a recommended SEC value, a host
   SHOULD use a CGA with the recommended or higher SEC value.  If
   choosing a CGA with a SEC value lower than the recommended, the host
   MAY take the risk that it is not able to use full network
   capabilities.  The network may consider the hosts that use CGAs with
   lower SEC values as unsecure users and decline some or all network
   services.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document extends SeND with a CGA SEC Option to transprot SEC
   bits used in the generation of GCAs, which enables administrators to
   specify and adjust the security level of the CGAs used in the
   network.  Apart from that, this approach does not introduce any
   significant changes to the underlying security issues considered in
   Section 9 of [RFC3971].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Neighbor Discovery Protocol options,
   which must be assigned an Option Type value within the IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery Option Formats table of Internet Control Message Protocol
   version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   icmpv6-parameters):
