1.  Introduction

   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] only defines challenges for validating control
   of DNS host name identifiers which limits its use to being used for
   issuing certificates for DNS identifiers.  In order to allow
   validation of IPv4 and IPv6 identifiers for inclusion in X.509
   certificates this document specifies how challenges defined in the
   original ACME specification and the TLS-ALPN extension specification
   [I-D.ietf-acme-tls-alpn] can be used to validate IP identifiers.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
   [RFC2119].

3.  IP Identifier

   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] only defines the identifier type "dns" which is
   used to refer to fully qualified domain names.  If a ACME server
   wishes to request proof that a user controls a IPv4 or IPv6 address
   it MUST create an authorization with the identifier type "ip".  The
   value field of the identifier MUST contain the textual form of the
   address as defined in [RFC1123] Section 2.1 for IPv4 and in [RFC4291]
   Section 2.2 for IPv6.

   An identifier for the IPv6 address 2001:db8::1 would be formatted
   like so:

   {"type": "ip", "value": "2001:db8::1"}

4.  Identifier Validation Challenges

   IP identifiers MAY be used with the existing "http-01" and "tls-alpn-
   01" challenges from [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] Section 8.3 and
   [I-D.ietf-acme-tls-alpn] Section 3 respectively.  To use IP
   identifiers with these challenges their initial DNS resolution step
   MUST be skipped and the IP address used for validation MUST be the
   value of the identifier.

   For the "http-01" challenge the Host header MUST be set to the IP
   address being used for validation per [RFC7230].

   For the "tls-alpn-01" challenge the SNI value MUST be set to the IP
   address being used for validation and the subjectAltName extension in
   the validation certificate MUST contain a single iPAddress which
   matches the address being validated.

   The existing "dns-01" challenge MUST NOT be used to validate IP
   identifiers.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Identifier Types

   Adds a new type to the Identifier list defined in Section 9.7.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] with the label "ip" and reference I-D.ietf-acme-
   ip.

5.2.  Challenge Types

   Adds the value "ip" to the Identifier Type column in the Validation
   Methods list defined in Section 9.7.8 of [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] for the
   "http-01" and "tls-alpn-01" challenges.

6.  Security Considerations

   Given the often short delegation periods for IP addresses provided by
   various service providers CAs MAY want to impose shorter lifetimes
   for certificates which contain IP identifiers.  They MAY also impose
   restrictions on IP identifiers which are in CIDRs known to be
   assigned to service providers who dynamically assign addresses to
   users for indeterminate periods of time.
