                I-Regexp: An Interoperable Regexp Format
                   draft-bormann-jsonpath-iregexp-00

Abstract

   "Regular expressions" (regexps) are a set of related, widely
   implemented pattern languages used in data modeling formats and query
   languages that is available in many dialects.  This specification
   defines an interoperable flavor of regexps, I-Regexp.

   The present version -00 of this document is a trial balloon, meant to
   determine whether this approach is useful for the JSONPath WG.

1.  Introduction

   Data modeling formats (YANG, CDDL) as well as query languages
   (jsonpath) often need a regular expression (regexp) sublanguage.
   There are many dialects of regular expressions in use in platforms,
   programming languages, and data modeling formats.

   While regular expressions originally were intended to provide a
   Boolean matching function, they have turned into parsing functions
   for many applications, with capture groups, greedy/lazy/possessive
   variants, etc.  Language features such as backreferences allow
   specifying languages that actually are context-free (Chomsky type 2)
   instead of the regular languages (Chomsky type 3) that regular
   expressions are named for.

   YANG (Section 9.4.5 of [RFC7950]) and CDDL (Section 3.8.3 of
   [RFC8610]) have adopted the regexp language from W3C Schema [XSD2].
   XSD regexp is a pure matching language, i.e., XSD regexps can be used
   to match a string against them and yield a simple true or false

   result.  XSD regexps are not as widely implemented as programming
   language regexp dialects such as those of Perl, Python, Ruby, Go
   [RE2], or JavaScript (ECMAScript) [ECMA-262].  The latter are often
   in a state of continuous development; in the best case (ECMAScript)
   there is a complete specification which however is highly complex
   (Section 21.2 of [ECMA-262] comprises 62 pages) and evolves on a
   yearly timeline, with significant additions.  Regexp dialects such as
   PCRE [PCRE2] have evolved to cover a common set of functions
   available in parsing regexp dialects, offered in a widely available
   library.

   With continuing accretion of complex features, parsing regexp
   libraries have become susceptible to bugs, in particular those that
   can be exploited in DoS attacks.  The library RE2 that is compatible
   with Go language regexps strives to be immune to DoS attacks, making
   it attractive to applications such as query languages where an
   attacker could control the input.  The problem remains that other
   bugs in such libraries can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities; at
   the time of writing, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
   system has 131 entries that mention the word "regex" [REGEX-CVE] (not
   all, but many of which are such bugs, with 23 matches for arbitrary
   code execution).

   Implementations of YANG and CDDL often struggle with providing true
   XSD regexps; some instead cheat by providing one of the parsing
   regexp varieties, sometime without even advertising this fact.

   A matching regexp that does not use the more complex XSD features
   (Section 3) can usually be converted into a parsing regexp of many
   dialects by surrounding it with anchors of that dialect (e.g., "^" or
   "\A" and "$" or "\z").  If the original matching regexps exceed the
   envelope of compatibility between dialects, this can lead to
   interoperability problems, or, worse, security vulnerabilities.
   Also, features of the target dialect such as capture groups may be
   triggered inadvertently, reducing performance.

   The present specification defines an interoperable regexp flavor for
   matching, I-Regexp.  This flavor is a subset of XSD regexps.  It also
   comes with defined rules for converting the regexp into common
   parsing regexp dialects.

2.  Requirements

   I-Regexps should handle the vast majority of practical cases where a
   matching regexp is needed in a data model specification or a query
   language expression.

Internet-Draft                  I-Regexp                        May 2021


   A brief survey of published RFCs yielded the regexp patterns in
   Appendix A (with no attempt at completeness).  These should be
   covered by I-Regexps, both syntactically and with their intended
   semantics.

3.  Subsetting XSD Regexps

   XSD Regexps are relatively easy to implement or map to widely
   implemented parsing regexp dialects, with a small number of notable
   exceptions:

   *  Character class subtraction.  This is a very useful feature in
      many specifications, but it is unfortunately mostly absent from
      parsing regexp dialects.

      -  *Issue*: This absence can be addressed by translating character
         class subtraction into positive character classes, or by
         leaving out subtraction.  The current draft opts for the
         latter, but that decision is up for discussion.

   *  Unicode.  While there is no doubt that a regexp flavor meant to
      last needs to be Unicode enabled, there are a number of aspects of
      this that need discussion.  First of all, predefined character
      classes such as "\w" may be meant to be ASCII only, or they may
      encompass all letters and digits defined in Unicode.  The latter
      is usually of interest in query languages, while the former is of
      interest to a subset of applications in data model specifications.
      Second, not all regexp implementations that one might want to map
      I-Regexps to will support accesses to Unicode tables that enable
      executing on constructs such as "\p{IsCoptic}".

      -  *Issue*: The ASCII focus can partially be addressed by adding a
         constraint that the matched text has to be ASCII in the first
         place.  This often is all that is needed where regexps are used
         to define lexical elements of a computer language.  The access
         to Unicode tables can simply be ruled out.  (Note that RFC 6643
         contains a lone instance of "\p{IsBasicLatin}{0,255}", which is
         needed to describe a transition from a legacy character set to
         Unicode.  The author believes that this would be a rare
         application and can be left out.  RFC2622 contans
         "[[:digit:]]", "[[:alpha:]]", "[[:alnum:]]", albeit in a
         specification for the "flex" tool; this is intended to be close
         to "\d", "\p{L}", "\w" in an ASCII subset.)

4.  Formal definition of I-Regexp

   I-Regexp is defined by the ABNF specification in Figure 1.

   *  *Issue*: This is essentially XSD regexp without character class
      subtraction.  There is probably potential for simplification in
      IsBlock (leave out) and possibly in the rather large part for
      IsCategory as well.  The ABNF has been automatically generated and
      maybe could use some polishing.  The ABNF has been verified
      against Appendix A, but a wider corpus of regular expressions
      should be examined.

5.  Mapping I-Regexp to Regexp Dialects

   (TBD; these mappings need to be thoroughly verified.)

5.1.  XSD Regexps

   Any I-Regexp also is an XSD Regexp [XSD2], so the mapping is an
   identify function.

5.2.  ECMAScript Regexps

   An I-Regexp, enveloped in "^" and "$", is an ECMAScript regexp
   [ECMA-262].  The performance can be increased by turning
   parenthesized regexps (production "atom") into "(?:...)"
   constructions.

5.3.  PCRE, RE2, Ruby Regexps

   An I-Regexp, enveloped in "\A" and "\z", is a valid regexp in PCRE
   [PCRE2], the Go programming language [RE2], and the Ruby programming
   language.  The performance can be increased by turning parenthesized
   regexps (production "atom") into "(?:...)" constructions.

Acknowledgements

   This draft has been motivated by the discussion in the IETF JSONPATH
   WG about whether to include a regexp mechanism into the JSONPath
   query expression specification, as well as by previous discussions
   about the YANG "pattern" and CDDL ".regexp" features.

   The basic approach for this draft was inspired by The I-JSON Message
   Format [RFC7493].
