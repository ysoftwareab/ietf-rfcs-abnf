1.  Introduction

   Operating systems, processes and applications generate messages
   indicating their own status or the occurance of events. These
   messages are useful for managing and/or debugging the network and its
   services. The BSD Syslog protocol is a widely adopted protocol that
   is used for transmission and processing of the messages.

   Since each process, application and operating system was
   written somewhat independently, there is little uniformity to the
   content of Syslog messages.  For this reason, no assumption is made
   upon the formatting or contents of the messages.  The protocol is
   simply designed to transport these event messages. No
   acknowledgement of the receipt is made.

   Essentially, a Syslog process receives messages (from the kernel,
   processes, applications or other Syslog processes) and processes
   those. The processing involves logging to a local file, displaying on
   console, user terminal, and/or relaying to syslog processes on other
   machines. The processing is determined by the "facility" that
   originated the message and the "severity" assigned to the message by
   the facility.

   We are using definitions of Syslog protocol from [RFC3164] in this
   draft.

2.  Problem Statement


   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] configuration data model that
   may be used to monitor and control one or more syslog processes running
   on a system. YANG models can be used with network management 
   agents such as NETCONF [RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete 
   the configuration of network devices.

   This module makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows 
   implementations to support only those Syslog features that lie
   within their capabilities.

3.  Design of the SYSLOG Model

   The syslog model was designed by comparing various syslog features 
   implemented by various vendors' in different implementations.

   This draft addresses the common leafs between all vendors and creates
   a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary features, if 
   necessary. The base model is designed to be very simple for maximum 
   flexibility.

   Syslog consists of message producers, a group level suppression filter, 
   and message distributors. The following digram shows syslog messages 
   flowing from a message producer, through the group level suppression 
   filter, and if passed by the group filter to message distributors where 
   further suppression filtering can take place.

     - remote server(s).

   Optional features are used to specified fields that are not present in 
   all vendor configurations.

4.3.  A SYSLOG Example

   Requirement:
   Enable global logging of two facilities:
     kern - severity critical(1)
     auth - severity error(3)

   Enable console logging of syslogs of severity
   critical(1)
   
   Here is the example syslog configuration xml:

   <rpc message-id="101" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <edit-config>
       <target>
         <running/>
       </target>
       <config>
         <syslog xmlns="urn:cisco:params:xml:ns:yang:syslog">
           <global-logging>
             <facility>syslogtypes:kern</facility>
             <severity>syslogtypes:critical</severity>
             <facility>syslogtypes:auth</facility>
             <severity>syslogtypes:error</severity>
           </global-logging>
           <console-logging>
             <logging-severity>syslogtypes:critical</logging-severity>
           </console-logging>
         </syslog>
       </config>
     </edit-config>
   </rpc>

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <rpc-reply message-id="101" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <ok/>
   </rpc-reply>

5.  Implementation Status

  [Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]
  
  This section records the status of known implementations of the Syslog
  YANG model at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft.

  Cisco Systems, Inc. has implemented the proposed IETF Syslog model
  for the Nexus 7000 NXOS OS as a prototype, together with an
  augmentation model for operating system specific Syslog configuration
  features.

  Five leaves were implemented in the base IETF model and three leaves
  were implemented in the NXOS specific augmentation model as follows:

      Leaf XPATH                Sample NXOS CLI Command(s)

  syslog:global-logging      logging level cron 2
  syslog:console-logging     logging console 1
  syslog:file-logging        logging logfile mylog.log 2 4096
  syslog:terminal-logging    logging monitor 2
  syslog:remote-logging     *logging server server.cisco.com 2
                               facility user use-vrf management
                            *logging source-interface loopback 0
  cisco-syslog:logging-timestamp-config  logging timestamp milli-seconds
  cisco-syslog:origin-id-cfg  logging origin-id string abcdef
  cisco-syslog:module-logging logging module 1

  *The "logging server" and "logging source-interface" commands were
  combined into one base model leaf.

  The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
  the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242] [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   TBD: List specific Subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688]
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688, the following
   registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:syslog

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: syslog namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:syslog
   prefix: syslog reference: RFC XXXX
