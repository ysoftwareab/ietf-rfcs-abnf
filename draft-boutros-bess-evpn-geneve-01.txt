INTERNET DRAFT       EVPN control plane for Geneve     February 13, 2018


1  Introduction

   The Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) develop solutions for
   network virtualization within a data center (DC) environment that
   assumes an IP-based underlay. An NVO3 solution provides layer 2
   and/or layer 3 overlay services for virtual networks enabling multi-
   tenancy and workload mobility. The NVO3 working group have been
   working on different dataplane encapsulations. The Generic Network
   Virtualization Encapsulation [GENEVE] have been recently recommended
   to be the proposed standard for network virtualization overlay
   encapsulation.

   This document describes how the EVPN control plane can signal Geneve
   encapsulation type in the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Extended Community
   defined in [TUNNEL-ENCAP]. In addition, this document defines how to
   communicate the Geneve tunnel option types in a new BGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute sub-TLV. The Geneve tunnel options are
   encapsulated as TLVs after the Geneve base header in the Geneve
   packet as described in [GENEVE].

   [DT-ENCAP] recommends that a control plane determines how Network
   Virtualization Edge devices (NVEs) use the GENEVE option TLVs when
   sending/receiving packets. In particular, the control plane
   negotiates the subset of option TLVs supported, their order and the
   total number of option TLVs allowed in the packets. This negotiation
   capability allows, for example, interoperability with hardware-based
   NVEs that can process fewer options than software-based NVEs.

   This EVPN control plane extension will allow a Network Virtualization
   Edge (NVE) to express what Geneve option TLV types it is capable to
   receive or to send over the Geneve tunnel to its peers.

   In the datapath, a transmitting NVE MUST NOT encapsulate a packet
   destined to another NVE with any option TLV(s) the receiving NVE is
   not capable of processing.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Most of the terminology used in this documents comes from [RFC7432]
   and [NVO3-FRWK].

2. GENEVE extensions

   This document adds some extensions to the [GENEVE] encapsulation that
   are relevant to the operation of EVPN.

2.1 Source Ethernet Segment option TLV

   [RFC7432] defines the use of ESI-labels on egress NVEs that are part
   of multi-homed Ethernet Segments (ES), so that they can determine if
   the received packet was originated from an ES that is also locally
   defined. Based on the ESI-label, the egress NVE can apply split-
   horizon for the local ES'es and avoid packet duplication in all-
   active multi-homing. In single-active multi-homing, packet
   duplication can also happen during transient times, therefore the use
   of ESI-labels and split-horizon checks are strongly recommended too.

   In addition, [EVPN-ETREE] makes use of the ESI-labels to indicate BUM
   leaf AC originated packets, so that the egress NVEs can filter BUM
   traffic between leaf ACs.

   In order to apply existing EVPN data plane split-horizon and E-Tree
   filtering procedures, this document describes a new option TLV for
   GENEVE:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Option Class=EVPN         | Type=ESI      |R|R|R| Length  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      |       Rsvd  |             Source-ESI                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Where:
        - Option Class is set to EVPN (new Option Class requested to 
        IANA)
        - Type is set to ESI (new type requested to IANA) and C bit 
        must be set.
        - Source-ESI is a 24-bit value that encodes the ESI-label value 
        signaled on the EVPN Autodiscovery per-ES routes, as described 
        in [RFC7432] for multi-homing and [EVPN-ETREE] for leaf-to-leaf 
        BUM filtering.

   The egress NVEs that make use of ESIs in the data path (because they
   have a local multi-homed ES or support [EVPN-ETREE]) SHOULD advertise
   their AD per-ES routes along with the EVPN/ESI sub-TLV and in
   addition to the ESI-label Extended Community. The ingress NVE can
   then use the EVPN/ESI option-TLV when sending GENEVE packets based on
   the [RFC7432] and [EVPN-ETREE] procedures. The egress NVE will use
   the Source-ESI field in the received packets to make filtering
   decisions.

   Note that [EVPN-OVERLAY] modifies the [RFC7432] split-horizon
   procedures for NVO3 tunnels using the "local-bias" procedure. "Local-
   bias" relies on tunnel IP source address checks (instead of ESI-
   labels) to determine whether a packet can be forwarded to a local ES.

   While "local-bias" MUST be supported along with GENEVE encapsulation,
   the use of the EVPN/ESI option-TLV is RECOMMENDED in cases where
   local-bias does not work, for instance: single-active multi-homing,
   multi-homing ES'es in Inter-AS option B scenarios and EVPN-ETREE.

2.2 BUM bit for Bridge Ethernet Protocol Type

   As described in [EVPN-OVERLAY], in EVPN, when an ingress NVE uses
   ingress replication to flood unknown unicast traffic to the egress
   NVEs, the ingress NVE needs to indicate to the egress NVE that the
   packet encapsulates an ingress replicated BUM frame. This is required
   to avoid transient packet duplication in all-active multi-homing
   scenarios.

   This document defines the B bit as the ingress-replicated BUM traffic
   indication and encodes it in Source Ethernet Segment option TLV.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Where:
        - Option Class is set to EVPN. 
        - Type is set to ESI.
        - B bit is set to 1 for BUM traffic.
        - Source-ESI is set to 0 or to a value identifying the ingress 
        NVE.

   An ingress NVE using ingress replication to flood BUM traffic MUST
   send B=1 in all the GENEVE packets that encapsulate BUM frames. An
   egress NVE SHOULD determine whether a received packet encapsulates a
   BUM frame based on the B bit. The use of the B bit is only relevant
   to GENEVE packets with Protocol Type 0x6558 (Bridged Ethernet).

3. BGP Extensions


   As per [EVPN-OVERLAY] the BGP Encapsulation extended community
   defined in [TUNNEL-ENCAP] is included with all EVPN routes advertised
   by an egress NVE. 

   This document specifies a new BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Type for
   Geneve and a new Geneve tunnel option types sub-TLV as described
   below.

3.1 Geneve Tunnel Option Types sub-TLV


   The Geneve tunnel option types is a new BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute Sub-TLV.


                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |      Sub-TLV Type (1 Octet)       |
                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |     Sub-TLV Length (1 or 2 Octets)|
                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |     Sub-TLV Value (Variable)      |
                      |                                   |
                      +-----------------------------------+

     The Sub-TLV Type field contains a value in the range from 192-252.
     To be allocated by IANA.



   Sub-TLV value MUST match exactly the first 4-octets of the option TLV
   format. For instance, if we need to signal support for two option
   TLVs:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          Option Class         |      Type     |R|R|R| Length  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
      |          Option Class         |      Type     |R|R|R| Length  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where, an NVE receiving the above sub-TLV, will send GENEVE packets
   to the originator NVE with with only the option TLVs the receiver NVE
   is capable of receiving, and following the same order. Also the high
   order bit in the type, is the critical bit, MUST be set accordingly.

4. Operation

   The following figure shows an example of an NVO3 deployment with
   EVPN.

                 Figure 2: Data Center Interconnect with ASBR

   iBGP sessions are established between NVE1, NVE2, ASBR1, possibly via
   a BGP route-reflector. Similarly, iBGP sessions are established
   between NVE3, NVE4, ASBR2.

   eBGP sessions are established among ASBR1 and ASBR2.

   All NVEs and ASBRs are enabled for the EVPN SAFI and exchange EVPN
   routes.  For inter-AS option B, the ASBRs re-advertise these routes
   with NEXT_HOP attribute set to their IP addresses as per [RFC4271]. 

   NVE1 sets the BGP Encapsulation extended community defined in all
   EVPN routes advertised. NVE1 sets the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute Tunnel Type to Geneve tunnel encapsulation, and sets the
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel sub-TLV for the Geneve tunnel
   option types with all the Geneve option types it can transmit and
   receive.

   All other NVE(s) learn what Geneve option types are supported by NVE1
   through the EVPN control plane. In the datapath, NVE2, NVE3 and NVE4
   only encapsulate overlay packets with the Geneve option TLV(s) that
   NVE1 is capable of receiving.  

   [TBD] How do we propagate the signaling of GENEVE option-TLVs end to
   end using other encaps?


5. Security Considerations

   The mechanisms in this document use EVPN control plane as defined in
   [RFC7432]. Security considerations described in [RFC7432] are equally
   applicable.

   This document uses IP-based tunnel technologies to support data plane
   transport. Security considerations described in [RFC7432] and in
   [EVPN-OVERLAY] are equally applicable.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the following:

    BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute
      Tunnel Type:

      XX     Geneve Encapsulation

   BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs a Code point from the
   range of 192-252 for Geneve tunnel option types sub-TLV.

   IANA is requested to assign a new option class from the "Geneve
   Option Class" registry for the Source Ethernet Segment option TLV.
