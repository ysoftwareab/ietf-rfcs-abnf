Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
   for representing presence information for a presentity.  The
   Application and Media Information (AMI) format described here is an
   extension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information
   Data Format (PIDF), describing what music a presentity is listening
   to, what video it is watching, or what game it is playing.

Internet-Draft  Application and Media Extension for PIDF   November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) [1]defines a basic format
   for representing presence information for a presentity.  The
   Application and Media Information (AMI) format described here is an
   extension that conveys additional information about the audio that a
   presentity is listening to, the video that it is watching, the web
   site it is visiting and the game that it is playing.  The information
   format is closely modeled on the similar XMPP extensions XEP-0118,
   XEP-0197, XEP-0195, and XEP-0196, respectively.  Such information may
   be considered an extension of rich presence [3] and may be integrated
   into media players or games.

   The elements defined in this document may appear in the <device> or
   <person> data elements of the presence data model [4].


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


3.  Music

   The <tune> element describes the current piece of music that the
   presentity is listening to.  The elements below are a superset of
   those described in XMPP extension XEP-0118, adding the composer,
   genre, start_time, and user_comment elements.  All elements are
   OPTIONAL.

   artist:  The performer of the song or piece.
   composer:  The composer of the song or piece.
   genre:  The musical genre or category.
   length:  The duration of the song or piece in seconds.
   source:  The collection (e.g., album) or other source (e.g., a band
      website that hosts streams or audio files).
   start_time:  The time the presentity has started listening to the
      piece..
   title:  The title of the song or piece.
   track:  A unique identifier for the tune; e.g., the track number
      within a collection or the specific URI for the object (e.g., a
      stream or audio file).

   uri:  A URI or URL pointing to information about the song,
      collection, or artist.

4.  Video

   The video element describes a video program that the presentity is
   watching, e.g., on a DVD, VCR or DVR, from a web site, or a broadcast
   service such as over-the-air television, satellite TV or CATV.  The
   elements are copied from XMPP XEP-0197.  All elements are OPTIONAL.

   program_name:  The name of the program (for television series) or
      movie title.
   program_type:  The type of the program, such as comedy, drama, sports
      or news.
   start_time:  The start time of the program.  For time-shifted
      viewing, the start_time describes the time that the presentity has
      started watching the video, not the original broadcast time, is
      shown.

   engaged in and can be part of social networking applications.  The
   information is similar to the XMPP extension XEP-0196 and contains
   the information in the table below.  All elements are OPTIONAL.

   character_name:  The name of the user's character in the game.
   character_profile:  A URI for a profile of the user's character.

6.  Web page

   The <page> element describes the web page the presentity is browsing.
   A presence document MAY contain multiple such elements since a single
   user may have multiple windows open at the same time.  This element
   is also useful for remote collaboration or joint web browsing.  The
   elements and their characteristics are derived from XMPP XEP-0195.
   All elements except uri are OPTIONAL, uri is REQUIRED.

   description:  The value of the HTML "description" META tag.
   keywords:  The value of the HTML "keywords" META tag.
   title:  The value of the HTML <title/> element
   uri:  The URI of the page.

   </presence>

8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines additional location elements carried by PIDF
   [1], so its security considerations apply.  Revealing ones taste in
   music or video entertainment can be embarrassing; employers and
   parents may not appreciate the games being played by a presentity, so
   presentity discretion and privacy policies are strongly advised.  In
   particular, audio and video tools MUST NOT publish such information
   without explicit consent of the presentity.

   The watcher MUST NOT automatically resolves URLs provided in the
   information elements, as these may lead to malicious or inappropriate
   material.


9.  IANA Considerations

   A future version of this document will provide IANA considerations.


10.  Acknowledgements

   The data formats were derived from the XMPP extensions XEP-0118, XEP-
   0195, XEP-0196 and XEP-0197.  Tracking channels was suggested by Erik
   Huizer and Pascal Decointet.
