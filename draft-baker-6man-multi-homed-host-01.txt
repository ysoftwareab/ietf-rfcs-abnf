1.  Introduction

   This note describes the expected behavior of an IPv6 [RFC2460] host
   in a network that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an
   upstream network that implements BCP 38 [RFC2827] filtering, and in
   which the host is presented with a choice of routers.  It expects
   that the network will implement some form of egress routing, so that
   packets sent to a host outside the local network from a given ISP's
   prefix will go to that ISP.  If the packet is sent to the wrong
   egress, it is liable to be discarded by the BCP 38 filter.  However,
   the mechanics of egress routing once the packet leaves the host are
   out of scope.  The question here is how the host interacts with that
   network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Expectations the host has of the network

   A host receives prefixes in a Router Advertisement [RFC4861], which
   goes on to identify whether they are usable by SLAAC [RFC4862]
   [RFC4941] [RFC7217].  When no prefixes are usable for SLAAC, the
   Router Advertisement would normally signal the availability of DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] and the host would use it to configure its addresses.  In
   the latter case it will be generally the case that the configured
   addresses match one of the prefixes advertised in a Router
   Advertisement that are supposed to be on-link in that subnet.

Internet-Draft   Host routing in a multi-prefix network      August 2015


   The simplest multihomed network implementation in which a host makes
   choices among routers might be a LAN with one or more hosts on it and
   two or more routers, one for each upstream network, or a host that is
   served by disjoint networks on separate interfaces.  In such a
   network, especially the latter, there is not necessarily a routing
   protocol, and the two routers may not even know that the other is a
   router as opposed to a host, or may be configured to ignore its
   presence.  One might expect that the routers may or may not receive
   each other's RAs and form an address in the other router's prefix.
   However, all hosts in such a network might be expected to create an
   address in each prefix so advertised.

                       Figure 1: Two simple networks

   Because there is no routing protocol among those routers, there is no
   mechanism by which packets can be deterministically forwarded between
   the routers (as described in BCP 84 [RFC3704]) in order to avoid BCP
   38 filters.  Even if there was, it would be an indirect route, rather
   than a direct route originating with the host; this is not "wrong",
   but can be inefficient and prone to failure.  Therefore the host
   would do well to select the appropriate router itself.

   Since the host derives fundamental default routing information from
   the Route Advertisement, this implies that, in any network with hosts
   using multiple prefixes, each prefix SHOULD be advertised via on-link
   Prefix Information Options [RFC4861] by one of the attached routers,
   even if addresses are being assigned using DHCPv6.  A router that
   advertises a prefix indicates that it is able to appropriately route
   packets with source addresses within that prefix.

3.  Reasonable expectations of the host

   Modern hosts maintain a fair bit of history, in terms of what has
   historically worked or not worked for a given address or prefix and
   in some cases the effective window and MSS values for TCP or other
   protocols.  This includes a next hop address for use when a packet is
   sent to the indicated address.

   When a host makes a successful exchange with a remote address or
   prefix using a particular source address, and the host has received a
   prefix that matches that source address in an RA, then the host
   SHOULD include the prefix in such history.  On subsequent attempts to
   communicate with that remote address, if it has an address in that
   prefix at that time, a host MAY use an address in the remembered
   prefix for the session.

   A host SHOULD select a "default gateway" for each source prefix it
   uses to form an address or is assigned an address in.  That router
   SHOULD be one of the routers advertising the prefix in its RA.  As a
   result of doing so, when a host emits a datagram using a source
   address in one of those prefixes and has no history directing it
   otherwise, it SHOULD send it to the indicated "default gateway".  In
   the "simplest" network described in Section 2, that would get it to
   the only router that is directly capable of getting it to the right
   ISP.  This will also apply in more complex networks, even when more
   than one physical or virtual interface is involved.

   In more complex cases, wherein routers advertise RAs for multiple
   prefixes whether or not they have direct or isolated upstream
   connectivity, the host is dependent on the routing system already.
   If the host gives the packet to a router advertising its source
   prefix, it should be able to depend on the router to do the right
   thing.

   There is an interaction with Default Address Selection [RFC6724].
   Rule 5.5 of that specification states that the source address used to
   send to a given destination address should if possible be chosen from
   a prefix known to be advertised by the next-hop router for that
   destination.  This selection rule would be applicable in a host
   following the recommendation in the previous paragraph.

   There is potential for adverse interaction with any off-link Redirect
   message sent by a router in accordance with Section 8 of [RFC4861].
   Hosts SHOULD apply off-link redirects only for the specific pair of
   source and destination addresses concerned, so the host's Destination
   Cache needs to contain appropriate source-specific entries.

4.  Expectations of multihomed networks

   The direct implication of Section 2 is that routing protocols used in
   multihomed networks SHOULD be capable of source-prefix based egress
   routing, and that multihomed networks SHOULD deploy them.

5.  Residual issues

   In an HNCP network, in which one router on each LAN advertises all
   prefixes and the others do not, the assumption that packets will be
   forwarded to the appropriate egress by the local routing system might
   cause at least one extra hop in the local network (from the host to
   the wrong router, and from there to another router on the same LAN
   but in a different subnet).  In some scenarios, where the local
   network is a highly constrained or lossy wireless network, this extra
   hop may be a significant performance handicap.

   In a slightly more complex situation such as the disjoint LAN case of
   Figure 1, which happens to be one of the authors' home plus corporate
   home-office configuration, the two upstream routers might be on
   different LANs and therefore different subnets (e.g., the host is
   itself multi-homed).  In that case, there is no way for the "wrong"
   router to detect the existence of the "right" router, or to route to
   it.

   In such a case it is particularly important that hosts take the
   responsibility to memorize and select the best first-hop as described
   in Section 3.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create any new security or privacy exposures.

   There might be a small privacy improvement, however: with the current
   practice, a multihomed host that sends packets with the wrong address
   to an upstream router or network discloses the prefix of one upstream
   to the other upstream network.  This practice reduces the probability
   of that occurrence.
