Scheduling to Increase Lifetime for Low Energy Body-Centric Wearable Networks
                        draft-hongcs-6lo-sbcn-00

Abstract

Recent advances in Internet of Things(IoT) have increased the usage of 
sensing technologies. Breakthroughs is microelectronics have increased the 
use of wearable devices to monitor human body functions and its surroundings. 
A typical wearable device has low resources in terms of power and processing 
capabilities. Reducing the energy consumption is one of the key design factors 
in a wearable network so that the devices may work for longer duration. Idle 
listening and overhearing are major causes of energy consumption. These issues 
can be resolved by maximizing the sleeping time of a device (switched off) and avoid 
unnecessary wakeup time (idle listening) to save energy. An external wakeup 
scheduling to handle the sleep/wakeup cycle of a device can be adapted. 
This document describes how a 2wakeup scheduling using an out-of-bound external 
wake up mechanism can work to successfully increase the lifetime of a typical 
body-centric wearable network (S-BCN).

1.  Introduction

The wearable wireless sensor devices are nowadays becoming popular. 
A network of these devices can monitor the human body functions and 
its surroundings to provide efficient health and personal care.

In a typical network, the receiver device must be switched on (awake) 
before the sender can transfer the packets. Due to this reason, a 
receiver spends extra time in the on state, which causes energy 
wastage. Sometimes, a device remains in the on state in anticipation 
of packets from a potential sender, which also causes energy wastage. 
The majority of the protocols use a sleep/wakeup scheduling to conserve 
energy. The schedule can be periodic or aperiodic. Wakeup scheduling 
is a major design issue in energy constrained networks. Current 
standardized protocols lack mechanisms to communicate if a device is 
not in the awake state at the time of communication. Therefore, in an 
event-based unscheduled packet transfer scenario, a sender must wait 
till the receiver device is awake causing delay and energy wastage. 
To resolve this issue, we propose an external radio triggered wakeup 
scheduling for a wearable network. In this model, a low cost, low 
power wakeup radio circuit is attached to a wearable device.

RFC4944 [RFC4944] specifies the transmission of IPv6 over 
IEEE802.15.4. The BC-WN in many respects has similar 
characteristics to that of IEEE802.15.4. This document specifies 
the details of a system to manage an emergency event in wearable 
device communication in an efficient manner.


1.1.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

This document is in part inspired by [IEEE802-2011].  

2.  Wake up Scheduling

An external radio to trigger on the receiver device as and when needed. 
This method can avoid periodic scheduling, which reduces energy wastage.

In one cycle, a device spends time in the idle period and busy period. 
In the idle period, it sleeps and in the busy period it tries to 
transmit the packets. We have used a Wakeup Radio/Wakeup-ACK/Data/ACK 
operation.

Emergency events can occur due to several reasons. It may happen in 
any of the devices including the network controller. For example, 
a device can sense abnormality in the sensing data. It can also sense 
that the battery is dying. The Controller may face critical problems 
during its operation. It may also require sudden data from a device,
which is currently in the sleep state. All of these can be classified 
as an emergency or urgent task. The tasks can be medical health 
related or non-medical in nature. The handling of the emergency event 
is a very sensitive issue in a BAN. The delay must be as low as 
possible to handle such situations.

2.1.  Communication Process

A wake up process is handled using the wake up radio. A two-stage 
communication process is used as shown in Figure 1. In stage-1, 
the wake up radio is switched on. Once the receiver node verifies 
itself as the intended receiver, it transmits back an acknowledgment 
to the sender using the same channel. In stage-2, the main radio 
transceivers are triggered on for data communication.

2.2.  Data communication

The communication process is shown in Figure 2. The device sends a 
wake up radio packet to the receiver (controller). It waits for the 
wake up acknowledgment (WACK) timeout period. It retransmits the 
command if no WACK is received.

Once the WACK packet is received, it transmits the data packet and waits 
for the acknowledgment (ACK). The retransmission continues till the 
process is sucessful.

2.3 Network setup

A star topology is used as shown in Figure 3.

                Figure 3: S-BCN Star topology

All the devices in the network MUST be equipped with wake up radio 
antennae. A device is capable of both receiving and sending the 
wake up radio signal. It remains in the sleep state until either an e
vent triggers it on or it is woken up by external radio signal.

2.4.  Packets

A typical wake up packet uses the address of a node as shown in 
Figure 4. The fields in the wake up packets are - frame header, 
address, payload and frame check sequence (FCS) using the cyclic 
redundancy code (CRC) algorithm. The frame header contains a preamble
and start frame delimiter (SFD). They help against miss and false 
detection and provide synchronization. Node address or ID is used to 
identify the intended receiver. The payload contains information 
about the events. 


   +---------+---------+-----------+-------+
   | Frame   |Address  | Payload   |  CRC  |
   | Header  |         |           |       |
   +---------+---------+-----------+-------+
       Figure 4: Wake up packet

Other MAC frames used are shown in Figure 5. A 'More Data' field 
is used for multiple packets transmission. One bit is used 
to depict simple yes/no for more data packets. The final packet size 
depends on the payload field. The physical (PHY) layer packet 
properties are similar to the IEEE802.15.4 channel model.

3.  Low Energy Operation

A BC-WN uses a low power wake up radio for prompt communication. There 
is a lack of a satisfactory means to communicate immediately in 
current protocols and delay is a major issue. This is also true in 
the case of the IEEE15.4x standard protocols.

A wake up radio based system through the on-demand request can 
significantly reduce the idle state energy consumption. A typical 
wearable network has 1 to 10m coverage area. In addition, there is 
only a very limited impact on latency because the corresponding device 
wakes up immediately. Wake up radios operate at very low power mode.

The wake up radio based MAC takes advantage of a typical BC-WN 
as follows:
- smaller network size in terms of devices compared to typical 
sensor networks;
- limited communication range;
- a device can be easily triggered on by external wake up radio signal;
- wake up radio puts little extra cost in terms of power consumption.


3.1 On-demand communication with addressing

Addressing is an important factor in the wake up radio. It is used for 
selective communication. A flow chart of a typical wake up radio based 
system using addressing is shown in Figure 6. It is to be noted that 
energy is consumed to decode a wake up packet to determine the 
recipient. Addressing can reduce the waking up of all the nodes in the 
neighborhood with a slight increase in the complexity.

3.2.  MAC Operation and back-off

A slotted contention based mechanism is used for communication. An 
example MAC operation is shown in Figure 7. A device with an emergency 
event uses channel sensing to check the channel for activity. It also 
uses the back-off mechanism to avoid the collision. It uses single 
clear channel assessment (CCA) unlike the IEEE802.15.4.

                 Figure 7: MAC operation and back-off

				 

Before attempting to transmit, a device utilizes the back-off 
mechanism. It chooses the value from the range (0, B), where 
the back-off window size (B) can be fixed or adapted as per the 
application requirements. The value it chooses is called the back-off 
counter. It is expressed in terms of slots. The counter value is 
decremented one slot at a time. For example, if it chooses a back-off 
value of 3, it waits for 3 slots before reattempting to transmit the 
packet. Once the counter expires, it senses the channel. If the 
channel is idle, it transmits the wake up radio packet. If it senses 
the channel busy, it chooses a new value for the Counter and the 
process is repeated.
