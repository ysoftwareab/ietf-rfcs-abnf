1.  Introduction

   This document presents a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module defining
   identities, typedefs, and groupings useful to cryptographic
   applications.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Crypto Types Module

2.1.  Tree Diagram

   This section provides a tree diagram [RFC8340] for the "ietf-crypto-
   types" module.  Only "grouping" statements are represented, as tree
   diagrams have no means to represent identities or typedefs.

   module: ietf-crypto-types

3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  No Support for CRMF

   This document uses PKCS #10 [RFC2986] for the "generate-certificate-
   signing-request" action.  The use of Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF) [RFC4211] was considered, but is was unclear if there
   was market demand for it.  If it is desired to support CRMF in the
   future, a backwards compatible solution can be defined at that time.

3.2.  Access to Data Nodes

   The YANG module in this document defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   There are a number of data nodes defined by the grouping statements
   that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is



Watsen                  Expires November 21, 2020              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft   Common YANG Data Types for Cryptography        May 2020


   the default).  Some of these data nodes may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      *: All of the data nodes defined by all the groupings are
         considered sensitive to write operations.  For instance, the
         modification of a public key or a certificate can dramatically
         alter the implemented security policy.  For this reason, the
         NACM extension "default-deny-write" has been applied to all the
         data nodes defined by all the groupings.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /private-key:  The "private-key" node defined in the "asymmetric-
         key-pair-grouping" grouping is additionally sensitive to read
         operations such that, in normal use cases, it should never be
         returned to a client.  For this reason, the NACM extension
         "default-deny-all" has been applied to it here.

   Some of the operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      *: All of the "action" statements defined by groupings SHOULD only
         be executed by authorized users.  For this reason, the NACM
         extension "default-deny-all" has been applied to all of them.
         Note that NACM uses "default-deny-all" to protect "RPC" and
         "action" statements; it does not define, e.g., an extension
         called "default-deny-execute".

      generate-certificate-signing-request:  For this action, it is
         RECOMMENDED that implementations assert channel binding
         [RFC5056], so as to ensure that the application layer that sent
         the request is the same as the device authenticated when the
         secure transport layer was established.

Internet-Draft   Common YANG Data Types for Cryptography        May 2020


   o  Added 'must' expressions to the 'public-key-grouping' and
      'asymmetric-key-pair-grouping' statements ensuring sibling nodes
      are either all exist or do not all exist.

   o  Added an explanation to the 'permanently-hidden' that the value
      cannot be configured directly by clients and servers MUST fail any
      attempt to do so.

   o  Added 'trust-anchor-certs-grouping' and 'end-entity-certs-
      grouping' (the plural form of existing groupings).

   o  Now states that keys created in <operational> by the *-hidden-key
      actions are bound to the lifetime of the parent 'config true'
      node, and that subsequent invocations of either action results in
      a failure.

A.8.  06 to 07

   o  Added clarifications that implementations SHOULD assert that
      configured certificates contain the matching public key.

   o  Replaced the 'generate-hidden-key' and 'install-hidden-key'
      actions with special 'crypt-hash' -like input/output values.

A.9.  07 to 08

   o  Removed the 'generate-key and 'hidden-key' features.

   o  Added grouping symmetric-key-grouping

   o  Modified 'asymmetric-key-pair-grouping' to have a 'choice'
      statement for the keystone module to augment into, as well as
      replacing the 'union' with leafs (having different NACM settings.

A.10.  08 to 09

   o  Converting algorithm from identities to enumerations.

A.11.  09 to 10

   o  All of the below changes are to the algorithm enumerations defined

   o  Revise/add in enum of signature algorithm for x25519 and x448

   o  Add in des3-cbc-sha1 for IPSec

   o  Add in sha1-des3-kd for IPSec

   o  Add in definit for rc4-hmac and rc4-hmac-exp.  These two
      algorithms have been deprecated in RFC 8429.  But some existing
      draft in i2nsf may still want to use them.

   o  Add x25519 and x448 curve for asymmetric algorithms

   o  Add signature algorithms ed25519, ed25519-cts, ed25519ph

   o  add signature algorithms ed448, ed448ph

   o  Add in rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 for SSH protocols (rfc8332)

A.12.  10 to 11

   o  Added a "key-format" identity.

   o  Added symmetric keys to the example in Section 2.3.

A.13.  11 to 12

   o  Removed all non-essential (to NC/RC) algorithm types.

   o  Moved remaining algorithm types each into its own module.

   o  Added a 'config false' "algorithms-supported" list to each of the
      algorithm-type modules.

A.14.  12 to 13

   o  Added the four features: "[encrypted-]one-[a]symmetric-key-
      format", each protecting a 'key-format' identity of the same name.

   o  Added 'must' expressions asserting that the 'key-format' leaf
      exists whenever a non-hidden key is specified.

   o  Improved the 'description' statements and added 'reference'
      statements for the 'key-format' identities.

   o  Added a questionable forward reference to "encrypted-*" leafs in a
      couple 'when' expressions.

   o  Did NOT move "config false" alg-supported lists to SSH/TLS drafts.

A.15.  13 to 14

   o  Resolved the "FIXME: forward ref" issue by modulating 'must',
      'when', and 'mandatory' expressions.

   o  Moved the 'generatesymmetric-key' and 'generate-asymmetric-key'
      actions from ietf-keystore to ietf-crypto-types, now as RPCs.

   o  Cleaned up various description statements and removed lingering
      FIXMEs.

   o  Converted the "iana-<alg-type>-algs" YANG modules to IANA
      registries with instructions for how to generate modules from the
      registries, whenever they may be updated.

A.16.  14 to 15

   o  Removed the IANA-maintained registries for symmetric, asymmetric,
      and hash algorithms.

   o  Removed the "generate-symmetric-key" and "generate-asymmetric-key"
      RPCs.

   o  Removed the "algorithm" node in the various symmetric and
      asymmetric key groupings.

   o  Added 'typedef csr' and 'feature certificate-signing-request-
      generation'.

   o  Refined a usage of "end-entity-cert-grouping" to make the "cert"
      node mandatory true.

   o  Added a "Note to Reviewers" note to first page.
