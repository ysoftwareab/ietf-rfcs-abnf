1.  Introduction

   IPsec is the standard for IP layer traffic protection, however in a
   big network where mesh connections are needed, configuring large
   number of IPsec tunnels is error prone and not scalable.  So instead
   of pre-provision IPsec tunnels on each router, this document defines
   a method to allow router to advertise the IPsec tunnel configurations
   it requires to reach a given NLRI via BGP.  This document does not
   intend to be one solution for all cases, the main use case is to
   simplify IPsec tunnel provision in networks under single
   administrative domain; it uses standard based components (IPsec/
   IKEv2[RFC7296] and BGP) with limited changes.  There is no change to
   IPsec/IKEv2, and only limited changes to BGP.

   IPsec tunnel in this document means IPsec tunnel mode as defined in
   [RFC4301].

   IPsec tunnel configurations typically include following parts:

   o  tunnel endpoint address (local and remote)

   o  public routing instance, routing instance where IPsec packet is
      forwarded in

   o  private routing instance, routing instance where payload packet is
      forwarded in

   o  tunnel authentication method and credentials

   o  IKE SA and CHILD SA transform (a.k.a crypto algorithms)

   o  CHILD SA traffic selector

   o  other: like lifetime, DPD timer, use of PFS ..etc

   In order to minimize amount configurations signal via BGP, only
   following configurations are explicit advertised:

   o  local tunnel endpoint address: BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute

   o  public routing instance: sub-TLV in tunnel encapsulation attribute

   o  CHILD SA traffic selector address range: NLRI and/or sub-TLV in
      tunnel encapsulation attribute

   Other configurations are either derived or via tag mapping:

   o  remote tunnel endpoint address: dynamic learned when received
      IKEv2 IKE_SA_INIT request

   o  private routing instance: via route-target in same BGP UPDATE

   o  tunnel authentication/credentials, traffic selector protocol/port
      range, IKE SA and CHILD SA transform, lifetime, DPD timer, PFS
      ..etc: all these configurations are implicitly signaled via IPsec
      configuration tag sub-TLV in tunnel encapsulation attribute

   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] defines a generic tunnel encapsulation
   attribute for BGP, however it needs to be extended to support IPsec
   tunnel.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for IPsec

   This document extends tunnel encapsulation attribute specified in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] by introducing following changes:

   o  A tunnel type for IPsec tunnel: ESP tunnel mode (AH tunnel mode is
      not included in this document).  Existing type 4 (IPsec in Tunnel-

      mode) in IANA "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types"
      registry could be reused

   o  A new sub-TLV for public routing instance

   o  A new sub-TLV for remote address prefix

   o  A new sub-TLV for local address prefix

   o  A new sub-TLV for IPsec configuration tag

   Following existing sub-TLVs apply to IPsec tunnel encapsulation
   attribute:

   o  Remote Endpoint: IPsec tunnel endpoint address

   o  Embedded Label Handling: see Section 4 for detail

2.1.  Local and Remote Prefix sub-TLV

   Local prefix sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to specify a list of
   address prefix that used as local traffic selector address ranges; if
   local prefix sub-TLV is not included, then prefixes in NLRI will be
   used; Remote prefix sub-TLV is a mandatory sub-TLV used to specify a
   list of address prefix that used as remote traffic selector address
   ranges; The IP version of local/remote prefix MUST be as same as IP
   version of prefix in NLRI.  A single all zero prefix means any prefix
   is allowed.  Local and remote prefix sub-TLV has same encoding as
   following:

                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  list of prefixes (variable)          |
                  +---------------------------------------+

                      Figure 1: Source Prefix sub-TLV

   Each prefix is encoded as following:

                          +---------------------------+
                          |   prefix Length (1 octet) |
                          +---------------------------+
                          |   Prefix (4 or 16 octets) |
                          +---------------------------+

                             Figure 2: prefix

   For a given IPsec tunnel TLV, local prefix sub-TLV MUST appear either
   zero or one time; remote prefix sub-TLV MUST appear only one time.

2.2.  Public Routing Instance sub-TLV

   Public routing instance sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to
   specify the routing instance to which the remote point address
   belongs, if tunnel encapsulation attribute doesn't include this TLV,
   then the routing instance is the same to which BGP session belongs.
   the value field of the sub-TLV consist a route target community as
   defined in [RFC4360].

   For a given IPsec tunnel TLV, public routing instance sub-TLV MUST
   appear either zero or one time.

2.3.  IPsec Configuration Tag sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV represents the IPsec configurations (like IPsec
   transform) that are not explicit advertised by other sub-TLVs
   specified in this documentation; the meaning of this sub-TLV is local
   to the administrative domain.  Follow are some examples:

   o  tag value T1 map to following configurations:

      *  Certificate trust-anchor: CA-1

      *  IKE_SA/CHILD_SA transform: AES-GCM-128

      *  Diffie-Hellman Group: 15

      *  Perfect Forward Secrecy: No

      *  local/remote Traffic selector protocol: any

      *  local/remote Traffic selector port range: any

      *  IKE_SA lifetime: 24 hours

      *  CHILD_SA lifetime: 1 hour

      *  DPD interval: 30 seconds

      *  ESP extended sequence number: no

   o  tag value T2 map to following configurations:

      *  Certificate trust-anchor: CA-2

      *  IKE_SA/CHILD_SA transform: AES-GCM-256

      *  Diffie-Hellman Group: 20

      *  Perfect Forward Secrecy: Yes with group 20

      *  local/remote Traffic selector protocol: UDP

      *  local/remote Traffic selector port range: any

      *  IKE_SA lifetime: 48 hours

      *  CHILD_SA lifetime: 2 hours

      *  DPD interval: 10 seconds

      *  ESP extended sequence number: yes

   The value field of this sub-TLV is 4 octets long. each IPsec tunnel
   TLV SHOULD only contain one IPsec configuration tag sub-TLV;

                          +--------------------------------------+
                          |   IPsec Configuration tag (4 octets) |
                          +--------------------------------------+

                     Figure 3: IPsec Configuration Tag

   For a given IPsec tunnel TLV, IPsec configuration tag sub-TLV MUST
   appear only one time.

3.  Operation

   Following are the rules of operation:

   1.  All routers are in same administrative domain

   2.  All routers are pre-provisioned with Mapping between IPsec
       configuration tag value and IPsec configurations include
       authentication method/credentials

   3.  If a given NLRI need IPsec protection, then advertising router
       need to include an IPsec tunnel encapsulation attribute, along
       with the NLRI in BGP UPDATE U;

   4.  When a router need to forward a packet along a path is determined
       by a BGP UPDATE which has a tunnel encapsulation attribute that
       contains one or more IPsec tunnel TLV, and router decides use
       IPsec based on local policy, then the router use first feasible
       CHILD_SA, a CHILD SA is considered as feasible when it meets all
       following conditions:

       *  its private routing instance is same as routing instance to
          which the packet to be forwarded belongs

       *  its public routing instance is same as indicated by the Public
          Routing Instance sub-TLV; if the sub-TLV doesn't exist, then
          it is same as routing instance to which BGP session belongs


       *  its peer tunnel address is same as indicated by Remote
          Endpoint sub-TLV

       *  the source and destination address of the packet to be
          forwarded falls in the range of CHILD SA's traffic selector

       *  its transform and other configuration maps to the tag
          indicated in the IPsec configuration tag sub-TLV

   5.  If router can't find such CHILD SA, then it will use IKEv2 to
       create one; if there are multiple IPsec tunnel TLVs in U, then it
       need to select one from feasible TLVs, a IPsec tunnel TLV is
       considered as feasible when it meets all following requirements:

       *  the source address of the packet must fall in one of Remote
          Prefixes

       *  the destination address of the packet must fall one of Source
          Prefixes

       *  the Remote Endpoint, along with Public Routing Instance sub-
          TLV identifies an IP address that is reachable

   6.  If there are multiple feasible IPsec tunnel TLV exists, then
       select the TLV using following rules in order:

       1.  TLV with smallest local address range as indicated by Remote
           Prefix sub-TLV

       2.  TLV with smallest remote address range as indicated by Local
           Prefix sub-TLV (NLRI prefix if local prefix sub-TLV is not
           included in TLV)

   7.  After an IPsec TLV is selected, router uses IKEv2 to create the
       CHILD_SA:

       *  public/private routing instance, peer's tunnel address are
          chosen based on above rules

       *  Traffic Selector:

   Both R1 and R2 are provisioned with IPsec authentication credentials
   and configurations corresponding to Tag-1 and Tag-2; both Tag-1 and
   Tag-2 map to traffic selector protocol any and port range any.

   o  R1 advertise subnetA in BGP UPDATE, which has a tunnel
      encapsulation attribute that contains two IPsec tunnel TLVs:

      *  TLV-1: endpoint R1TunnelAddr, tag sub-TLV Tag-1 and subnetB in
         Remote Prefix sub-TLV.

      *  TLV-2: endpoint R1TunnelAddr, tag sub-TLV Tag-2 and subnetC in
         Remote Prefix sub-TLV.

   o  R2 advertise subnetB in BGP UPDATE, which has a tunnel
      encapsulation attribute that contains one IPsec tunnel TLV:
      R2TunnelAddr, tag sub-TLV Tag-1 and subnetA in Remote Prefix sub-
      TLV.

   o  R2 advertise subnetC in BGP UPDATE, which has a tunnel
      encapsulation attribute that contains one IPsec tunnel TLV:
      R2TunnelAddr, tag sub-TLV Tag-2 and subnetA in Remote Prefix sub-
      TLV.

   o  R1 received a packet from subnetA destined to subnetB, since BGP
      UPDATE contain subnetB also contains an IPsec tunnel encapsulation
      attribute, there is no existing CHILD SA could be used, based on
      the rules described in this section, R1 select TLV-1 and uses
      IKEv2 to establish an IPsec tunnel to R2TunnelAddr, using
      certificate authentication, create 1st CHILD SA CHILDSA1:

      *  ESP transform: CHACHA20_POLY1305

      *  Traffic Selector:

         +  TSi: address subnetA, protocol any, port any

         +  TSr: address subnetB, protocol any, port any

   o  after tunnel is created, R1 and R2 could forward traffic between
      subnetA and subnetB over CHILDSA1

   o  R1 received a packet from subnetA destined to subnetC, CHILDSA1
      can't be used for this packet, R1 select TLV-2 to create 2nd CHILD
      SA, and given there is already an IKE SA between R1 and R2, R1
      uses existing IKESA to create CHILDSA2:

      *  ESP transform: NULL-AES-GMAC-256

   o  R1 and R2 could forward traffic between subnetA and subnetC over
      CHILDSA2

4.  Semantics and Usage of IPsec Tunnel Encapsulation attribute

   IPsec tunnel encapsulation TLV has same usage and semantics as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] with following specific to
   IPsec tunnel:

   o  Due to nature of IPsec, the payload packet could only be IPv4 or
      IPv6 packet, so it MAY be carried in any BGP UPDATE message whose
      AFI/SAFI is 1/1 (IPv4 Unicast), 2/1 (IPv6 Unicast).

   o  For 1/128 (VPN-IPv4 Labeled Unicast), 2/128 (VPN-IPv6 Labeled
      Unicast), these NLRI has embedded label, which cause the payload
      packet can't be encapsulated in ESP packet, however with IPsec
      tunnel encapsulation, the label could be ignored during
      encapsulation since CHILD SA itself could be used to identify the
      private routing instance; so an UPDATE that include IPsec tunnel
      encapsulation attribute, which contains value 2 of Embedded Label
      Handling Sub-TLV, could be used to signal this type of setup.

   o  For other types of AFI/SAFI, a nested tunnel setup could be used
      to get IPsec protection, for example, an 25/70 (EVPN) payload
      packet could be encapsulated in VXLAN over IPsec tunnel.  See
      Section 4.1 for further detail.

4.1.  Nested Tunnel

   A nested tunnel could be used for payload packet type that can't be
   encapsulated in IPsec tunnel directly, e.g. an Ethernet packet of
   EVPN service.  Following is an example of using VXLAN over IPsec
   tunnel for EVPN service:

   o  R1 need to forward an Ethernet packet P

   o  the path along which P is to be forwarded is determined by BGP
      UPDATE U1, which has a VXLAN tunnel encapsulation attribute and
      the next-hop is router R2

   o  the best path to R2 is a BGP route that was advertised in BGP
      UPDATE U2, which has an IPsec tunnel encapsulation TLV.

Internet-Draft            BGP Provisioned IPsec           September 2019


   o  R1 will encapsulate P in a VXLAN tunnel as indicated in U1, then
      encapsulate VXLAN packet into IPsec tunnel as indicated in U2

   o  if tag sub-TLV is used, then both U1 and U2 MUST have matching tag
      sub-TLV, otherwise the VXLAN packet will not be sent through IPsec
      tunnels identified in U2


4.2.  Other Operation Specifics

   Following are some operation specific rules:

   1.  An IPsec dead peer detection mechanism, like IKEv2 DPD or BFD
       over IPsec, SHOULD be used to monitor liveness of IPsec tunnel;


   2.  If IPsec peer goes down, as described in section 5 of
       [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps], packet forwarding router chooses
       another functional tunnel, specified by another tunnel TLV of
       same BGP route if there is any, to forward the packet; if there
       is no such tunnel, then router MAY drop the packet or MAY forward
       packet as it would had the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute not
       been present. this is matter of local policy.

   3.  After IPsec peer goes down, packet forwarding router SHOULD try
       to re-establish IPsec tunnel with certain hold-down timer and
       back-off mechanism. the detail is up to implementation. also
       IKEv2 session resumption [RFC5723] MAY be used to efficiently re-
       create tunnel;

   4.  When router receives a packet destined to a BGP route it
       advertised but does not have any of tunnel encapsulation in the
       BGP route, it MAY drop it or MAY accept it; this is matter of
       local policy. by default, the packet should be accepted.

   5.  As with all types of tunnel technology, IPsec tunnel adds
       overhead (crypto & encapsulation) to the packet, which often
       causes MTU issues, deployment SHOULD take tunnel overhead into
       MTU consideration.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document reuses "IPsec in Tunnel-mode"(4) as BGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types.

   This document will request new values in IANA "BGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs" registry for following sub-TLV:

   o  public routing instance

   o  remote address prefix

   o  local address prefix

   o  IPsec configuration tag

6.  Security Considerations

   IKEv2 is used to create IPsec tunnel, which ensures following:

   o  Traffic protection keys are generated dynamically during IKEv2
      negotiation, only known by participating peer of the IPsec tunnel;
      there is no central node to manage and distribute all keys.

   o  IKEv2 rekey mechanism refresh keys regularly; PFS(Perfect Forward
      Secrecy) provides additional protection;

   o  Secure authentication mechanism that only allow authenticated peer
      to create tunnel

   o  Traffic Selector guarantee that only agreed traffic is allowed to
      be forwarded within the IPsec tunnel;

   o  Using a separate, dedicate protocol(IKEv2) for key management/
      authentication ensure they are not tied to BGP, all existing and
      future IKEv2 features could be used without changing BGP;

   There is concern that malicious party might manipulate IPsec tunnel
   encapsulation attribute to divert traffic, however this risk could be
   mitigated by IKEv2 mutual authentication.

   BGP route filter include outbound route filter [RFC5291], Origin
   Validation [RFC6811] and BGPSec [RFC8205] could be used to further
   secure BGP UPDATE message.

   IKEv2 cookie [RFC7296] and varies mechanisms defined including client
   puzzle defined in [RFC8019] could be used to protect IKEv2 from
   Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks.

   Follow latest IETF ESP/IKEv2 implementation requirement and guidance
   ([RFC8221] and [RFC8247] at time of writing) to make sure always
   using secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms;

7.  Change Log

   o  v00 March 04, 2019: initial draft

   o  v01 Sep 04, 2019:

      *  replaces color sub-TLV with a new IPsec configuration tag sub-
         TLV

      *  add rule on selecting TLV when there multiple feasible TLVs in
         section Section 3

      *  change crypto used in example of section Section 3

      *  change title from "BGP Signaled IPsec Tunnel Configuration" to
         "BGP Provisioned IPsec Tunnel Configuration"

      *  Add a section Section 4.2 on some operation specifics

      *  add more content in Section 6

      *  add specification of number of time each new sub-TLV allowed in
         a given tunnel TLV

      *  add clarification in section Section 1 to clarify IPsec tunnel
         means IPsec tunnel mode

      *  traffic selector protocol and port range now come from tag
         mapped configuration
