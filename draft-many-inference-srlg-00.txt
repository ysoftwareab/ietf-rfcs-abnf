Abstract

   The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]
   is considered as one of the most important criteria concerning the
   constrained-based path computation of optical channel routes. By
   applying the SRLG constraint criteria to the constrained-based path
   computation, one can select a route taking into account resource and
   logical structure disjointness that implies a lower probability of
   simultaneous lightpath failure. This contribution describes the
   various physical and logical resource types considered in the SRLG
   concept. The proposed model focuses on the inference of SRLG
   information between the network physical layers as well as logical
   structures such as geographical locations. The main applications of
   the proposed model are the related Constraint-based Shortest Path
   First (CSPF) algorithm for optical channel path computation and the
   reduction of the SRLG advertisements through the Topology and
   resource Distribution Protocol.

1. Introduction

   Many proposals include the SRLG concept when considering the
   constraint-based path computation of optical channel routes. In
   optical domains this concept of SRLG is used for deriving a path,
   which is disjoint from the physical resource and logical topology
   point-of-view. However, the definition of SRLG in the current format
   as described in [GMPLS-OSPF] and [GMPLS-ISIS] does not provide:
   - the relationship between logical structures or physical resources
   (For example, a fiber could be part of a sequence of fiber segments,
   which is included in a given geographical region), and
   - the risk assessment during path computation implying the
   allocation of a conditional failure probabilities with the SRLGs
   - the analysis of the specifications of constraint-based path
   computation and path re-optimization taking SRLG information into
   account.

   The model proposed in this document proposes a technique to compute
   the SRLG with respect to a given risk type. This is achieved by
   identifying for a given physical layer the resources belonging to an
   SRLG. The proposed model also permits one to compute the
   dependencies of these resources into the resources belonging to
   lower physical layers. The result of the computation also enables
   one to determine the risk associated to each of the SRLGs.

   In section 2, we present the hierarchical model of the resources and
   the corresponding SRLG encoding. In section 3, we discuss the use of
   such a model for the risk assessment for the path computation.
   Future work is proposed in section 4, which is followed by
   references in section 5. Appendix 1 provides an elaborate discussion
   on the inference of SRLGs.

2. Requirements

   The requirements concerning the SRLG have already been discussed in
   the IPO Carrier requirement documents [IPO-OLCP]. Within the scope
   of this document, these can be summarized as follows:

   1. The SRLG encoding mechanism should reduce the path computation
   complexity.

   2. The SRLG information flooding should be scoped to reduce the
   amount of information that is sent across domains.

   3. The SRLG encoding should accommodate the physical and logical
   restrictions imposed on the diversity requirements as discussed in
   [IPO-OLCP].

3. Hierarchical Model

   The model defined in this proposal includes two hierarchies, as
   mentioned below:

   - Physical hierarchy, which is related to the fiber topology (more
   generally the physical resources) of the optical network including
   the wavelengths built on top of this physical topology.

   - Logical hierarchy, which is related to the geographical topology
   of the network.

   Between these two hierarchies, the nodes such as Optical Cross-
   Connect (OXC) and Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC) constitute the
   boundary layer. Each of these concepts is elaborated in the
   following sections.

   The encoding of the SRLG could be either mapped on this hierarchical
   model or simply use a flat encoding scheme. Both methods seam
   feasible. Difference between both approaches relies on the extended
   usage of the SRLGs in the context of diverse route computation (i.e.
   path disjointness). Since a link can belong to more than one SRLG,
   an SRLG identifier list, as described in [IPO-BUNDLE] and [IPO-
   FRAME] is attached to the link identifier (Link ID). This results in
   a linear and non-structured information from which the underlying
   structure cannot be deduced.

   Consequently, either a type field indicating the type of resource
   (or logical structure) to which this SRLG identifier refers extends
   the flat encoding scheme or the encoding itself translates the
   underlying hierarchical structure. Worth mentioning here that an
   hierarchical encoding (since depending on the physical layer which
   is by definition static) needs an additional mapping structure in
   order to keep the relationship with link identifiers. Nevertheless,
   the computational model developed in Appendix 1 does not depend on
   the encoding scheme.

3.1 Physical Hierarchy (or Network Resource Hierarchy)

   The network (physical) resource model considered in the inference of
   the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) is based on concepts detailed in
   [IPO-FRAME] and [OIF2000-019]. The concepts around network resource
   hierarchy developed within this document are based on the following
   definitions:
   - Sub-Channel: a dedicated container included within a given channel
   uniquely identifies a sub-channel
   - Channel (or wavelength): a channel is uniquely identified by a
   dedicated wavelength (i.e. lambda)
   - Fiber Link: a fiber connects two Optical Network Element (ONE)
   ports communicating through one optical channel or more than one
   optical channel if the ONE interfaces support Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM).
   - Fiber Segment: a fiber segment includes a collection of fiber sub-
   segments.
   - Fiber Sub-segment: grouping of several cables forms a fiber sub-
   segment.
   - Fiber Trunks: a fiber trunk is a sequence of fiber segments,
   including one or more fiber segments starting and terminating at the
   same ONE.

   The model developed extends the definition given within
   [OIF2000.019] by enabling æfiber topologyÆ non-limited to point-to-
   point ONE connections. Physical resources considered within this
   model are a common denominator of most Optical Transport Network
   (OTN) environments.

   As represented in Figure 1, the fiber trunk from the location N1 to
   the location N3 is composed by the fiber segments A and B and the
   fiber trunk from the location N1 to the location N2 includes the
   fiber segment A, C and D.

   In this figure, the Segment A is composed by the fiber sub-segments
   A[1], A[2], à, A[I], à, A[n]. The same terminology applies for the
   segments B, C, D and E.

   Consequently, the fiber trunk from location N2 to location N4
   includes the sub-segments D[2] to D[n] and their corresponding sub-
   segments within the segment E: E[2] to E[n]. The fiber trunk from
   location N1 to location N2 includes the fiber sub-segments A[n],
   C[1] and D[1].

   Note that if we introduce the new OIF terminology a lightpath refers
   to a link connection. The proposed hierarchy is suitable for diverse
   æfiber topologiesÆ. We assume that all connections are
   unidirectional point-to-point unless otherwise specified.

3.2 Geographical Hierarchy (or Logical Hierarchy)

   Concerning the geographical hierarchy, the SRLG model developed in
   this document, includes the following definitions going from the
   less to the most extended logical structure partitioning of the area
   covered by the optical network (as shown in Figure 2.)

   - Node: a node is a single device or active element included within
   the optical network; a node could be an Optical Cross-Connect (OXC)
   or a Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC). Exit points of a node are defined
   as the node ports.

   - Zone: a zone includes one or more nodes whose location is limited
   to a confined area for the sake of maintainability. Zones have a
   fixed number of exit points and are non-overlapping meaning that a
   given node belongs to only one zone.

   - Region: a region includes one or more zones whose location covers
   the individual locations of each of the area composing this region.
   Regions have a fixed number of exit points and are non-overlapping
   meaning that a given zone belongs to only one region.

   Hence, a region could include one or more than one non-overlapping
   zone each of these zone could include one or generally more than one
   node.

   Note: A zone could correspond to an IGP area such as an OSPF area,
   and a region to an Autonomous System (or Autonomous Systems).
   However, the model does not exclude network topologies where the
   SRLG geographical hierarchy does not map the routing hierarchical
   topology.

3.3 Hierarchical SRLG encoding

   The objective of this hierarchical encoding is to achieve
   summarization of the SRLG identifiers at the boundary of
   geographical structures defined logically on the optical network.
   Here, we propose a linear encoding (with a type field) which seams
   more efficient, enables to abstract the physical layer structure and
   should facilitate the management of the identifiers.

   Consequently, the detailed encoding of an SRLG identifier could
   include:

   1. Resource Location (32-bit field)

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The resource location identifies the logical structure into which
   the SRLG Resource identifier is included.

   Within the SRLG Resource Identifier, the Type field defines the
   resource type (i.e. the type of ôlinkö) to which the SRLG identifier
   refers. The following resource types are currently defined:
        - Fiber Link:        0x01
        - Fiber Sub-segment: 0x02
        - Fiber Segment:     0x03
        - Fiber Trunk:       0x04

   Since a given resource can belong to more than one SRLG, the SRLG
   Resource Identifier structure is defined in the most general case as
   a list of SRLG Resource Identifier structure (n x 32-bit):

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |                SRLG Identifier                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |                SRLG Identifier                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      /                              à                                /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |                SRLG Identifier                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Even if we propose a linear encoding, the summarization of the SRLG
   (at the logical structure boundaries) is still provided since the
   SRLG identifiers are structured as follows:
        - A resource location frame (32-bit): Region (8-bit) + Zone (8-
        bit) + Unspecified (16-bit)
        - And a physical Resource Identifier (32-bit) for each SRLG:
        Type (8-bit) + Resource Identifier (24-bit)

   This encoding enables one to perform summarization at the boundaries
   of logical structures while overcoming the drawbacks of full
   hierarchical encoding scheme.

   Note: the proposed encoding does not include the conditional failure
   probability as defined in section 4.2

4. Risk Assessment

   Risk assessment is defined as the quantification process of the
   potential risk associated to the inclusion of a given resource (this
   resource belongs to a given resource type located within a given
   logical structure such as a geographical location) in a given
   optical channel.

4.1 Rationale for Risk Assessment

   Consider the following example, where the client device makes the
   following requests to the optical network:

   - Request for a persistent connection with 99.999 % (well known 5
   9s) of availability or equally a down time less than X minutes per
   year.

   - Request a high-protection for a portion of the traffic (at the
   expense of more charging) compared to other low-priority traffic.

   Such requirements will be translated into path specific
   requirements. Such path specific requirements can be grouped into
   path selection requirements and path characterization requirements.

   - Path selection requirements
   These typically dictate which physical path should be taken to
   achieve the availability requirements of the client. These
   requirements are typically the logical and physical diversity as
   mentioned in the hierarchical encoding section (see section 3).

   - Path characterization requirements
   Path characterization requirements typically dictate the protection
   mechanisms as requested by the client. This can be achieved in the
   form of optical rings, meshed protection mechanisms, etc. However,
   these are out of the scope of this document.

   The components that need formalization in this example are:
   - Step 1. Specification of the user requirements (such as the
   example above)
   - Step 2. Configuring the network that helps in assessing the
   features such as the availability
   - Step 3. Propagating the above-configured information.
   - Step 4. Using the above-propagated information.

   Step 1 of specifying the requirements is not in the scope of this
   document. Steps 2 û 4 are discussed in the remainder of this
   document.


   As an example for this discussion we elaborate on the risk
   assessment for a selected path.

4.2 Quantifying the Risk Assessment

   Risk (the complementary of availability) assessment is defined as
   the evaluation of the potential risk associated to the inclusion of
   a given resource (this resource belongs to a given resource type
   located within a given logical structure such as a geographical
   location) in a given path.

   Given that an SRLG is used to encode the group of logical or
   physical resources, if a mechanism is devised to assign the risk

   associated with the resource, we can calculate the corresponding
   path with a high availability (as requested by the client).

   A simple approach is to assign the conditional failure probability
   with each of the SRLG. This information can be encoded as an
   optional parameter along with the SRLG information. In addition,
   weights can be associated to each of the SRLG to either increase or
   decrease the usage of the resource.

   In this approach the configurable parameters are:
   - SRLG (Resource and Location Identifiers)
   - Conditional failure probability per SRLG
   - Weight for the selection of the SRLG

   As mentioned above, the resource failure probability is defined as a
   conditional probability. For instance, we can associate a
   conditional failure probability 25% to any fiber sub-segment located
   within the same zone. It means that by selecting two (or more than
   two) different optical channels belonging to the same SRLG with
   respect to fiber sub-segment failure, if one of these lightpaths
   fails, then the probability that the other lightpath fails is 25%.
   Moreover, the failure probability of a fiber can also depend on the
   zone and the length of the fiber. Moreover, a fiber can pass across
   different zones with different failure probabilities. In this case,
   we need to consider a summary failure probability per fiber.

   For instance (if we refer to our previous example) and if we
   consider that:
   1. a conditional failure probability of 50% is associated to any
   fiber link
   2. a conditional failure probability of 1% to any fiber segment
   located within the same zone

   Then by selecting two different optical channels included within the
   same SRLG with respect to fiber segment failure (S1, for instance),
   we obtain a simultaneous lightpath failure probability of 1%.
   Consequently, if the client asks for a protected path, by choosing
   fiber segment path disjointness, the simultaneous lightpath failure
   probability is also of 1%. However, choose two optical channels
   flowing through the same fiber (r1, for instance), then we have a
   probability of 50% that both optical channels fail simultaneously.

4.3 Risk Assessment Application

   Up to now we didnÆt define the association between the high
   availability of the path and SRLG conditional failure probability. A
   simple way to define the relationship is to consider the
   availability of the service requested by the client (i.e. a working
   and a protected path from the provider point of view) and
   conditional failure probability of the sequence of physical resource
   elements included within the corresponding paths. So if we consider,
   1. a path whose source is located is zone 1 and whose destination in
   zone 2 (same region)

   2. a conditional failure probability of 1% if fiber links are
   selected within the same fiber trunk (and located within the zone 1)
   3. a conditional failure probability of 1% if fiber links are
   selected within the same fiber trunk (and located within the zone 2)
   4. the conditional failure probabilities are independent and
   weighted equally
   Then, the availability of the service concerning the fiber link
   availability is of 98% since in this specific case conditional
   failure probabilities are additive.

   Note that currently, the initial conditional failure probability
   value need to be statically encoded; however, based on the ôhistoryö
   of the failures these values could be dynamically re-evaluated. The
   corresponding mechanism still needs to be specified.


5. Application of the SRLG Inference Model

   The SRLG Inference Model applications are related to the CSPF
   lightpath route computation and the SRLG identifier sets
   summarization in order to enable intra- and inter-area diverse
   routing.

5.1 Routing requirements

   1. Given the region-level and zone-level decomposition of the
   physical topology of the optical network, the link semantics should
   be extended to accommodate the inter-region and inter-zonal links.
   Moreover, this concept helps in constructing the logical-level
   topologies at the region-level and zone-level abstraction, which in
   turn can be used in the SRLG summarization and loose-path
   computation.

   2. Propagate these additional (region and zonal) links using the
   IGP routing protocols for intra- and inter-area routing purposes.

   3. To reduce the amount of the flooded information and hence
   lightpath route computation complexity, the flooding scope of the
   information propagation is extended to accommodate region-level and
   zone-level.

5.2 CSPF Route Computation

   Applications of this model are directly related to the Constraint-
   based Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm used for optical channel
   path computation (i.e. engineered lightpath setup) to maximize the
   lightpath disjointness and so decrease the lightpath failure
   probability. This application will be detailed in a future release
   of the present contribution.

   The SRLG information adds another dimension to existing constraint-
   based path computation methods traditionally used in MPLS (or PNNI)
   based networks. The SRLG constraints provide an additional dimension

Draft-many-inference-srlg-00.txt                         February 2001


   to the other traffic-engineering constraints such as bandwidth
   availability, path metrics and other parameters. This specificity
   requires the use of more appropriate path computation algorithms
   that provide not only complete multi-path disjointness, but also
   partial multi-path disjointness based on various risk factors. In a
   similar way, appropriate mechanisms should also be used in order to
   perform path re-optimization following various restoration
   strategies.

5.2 Summarization in Topology and Resource Distribution

   By combining recursively several dependency graphs (of known
   structures) into a higher-level dependency graph, the number of SRLG
   sets and the number of element they include can be further reduced.
   Consequently, the applications of the extended model will also cover
   the reduction of the SRLG advertisements in the Topology and
   Resource Distribution [IPO-ONNI] running instance (i.e. the traffic
   engineering extensions to the link-state advertisements of the IGP
   protocol). In turn, this improvement will reduce the CSPF algorithm
   complexity for optical channel path calculation (i.e. engineered
   lightpath setup).

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations related to SRLG Inference model and its
   applications are left for further study.

10. Appendix 1

   This appendix describes in detail the concept of SRLG.

1.1 Definition of the Concept and Example

   The present model is intended to be used to automate the discovery
   of the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) at a given layer for a given
   physical resource type. This resource type could be located within a
   given region and zone.

   Note that a typical resource type can be a fiber, a fiber sub-
   segment, a fiber segment or a fiber trunk and a typical resource
   location can be a zone, a region or a node. For a given resource
   type, when the resource location is not specified, the resource
   location is limited to the nodes.

   Definitions and assumptions:
   - An SRLG is a set of links sharing a common physical resource i.e.
   a common risk.
   - The set of links said to belong to the same SRLG, if they are
   established over fibers that go through the same fiber sub-segments
   (so through the same fiber trunk) and through the same fiber segment
   between two ONEs.
   - A lightpath is defined to cover an SRLG iff (if and only if) it
   crosses one of the links belonging to that SRLG.
   - Two lightpaths are defined as diverse with respect to a set of
   SRLGs iff the sets of SRLGs they cover are disjoint.

   Example:

   The following example referring to Figure 5 (for the physical
   network topology) offers some clarification. Let assume that
   - N1, N2, N3, and N4 represent locations that are linked by the
   fiber sub-segments,
   - A, B, C, D and E be fiber segments,
   - and r1 (ACD), r2 (AB), r3 (BCD) and r4 (DE) are fibers routed over
   the fiber segment topology.

   N1            N2
   |             |
   |             |                          r1
   |A            |D                 N1 ------------ N2
   |             |                  |               |
   |             |                  |               |
   |      C      |                  |               |
   x-------------x                  |r2             |r4
   |             |                  |               |
   |             |                  |               |
   |             |                  |       r3      |
   |B            |E                 N3 ------------ N4
   |             |

   Figure 4. A Correlation between Fiber segment topology and Fiber
   link topology

   In such a physical topology the obvious SRLGs are the following:
   - {r1, r2} both going down when segment A breaks
   - {r1, r3} both going down when segment C breaks
   - {r1, r4} both going down when segment D breaks
   - {r2, r3} both going down when segment B breaks
   - {r3, r4} both going down when segment E breaks

   These five SRLGs can be replaced by two SRLGs, S1 = {r1, r2, r3} and
   S2 = {r1, r3, r4}, where S1 and S2 constitute the minimum edge
                         
   covering with cliques (                         n                          o                           t                            e                             : A clique of a graph G is a sub-graph of
   G in which every two nodes are connected by an edge) of the Shared
   Risk Relationship (SRR) graph that can be drawn between r1, r2, r3,
   r4 (see Figure 5). This decomposition is unique. If there was a
   dependency between r2 and r4, there would be a unique SRLG, S = {r1,
   r2, r3, r4}.

   r1 ------- r4

   |        \  |
   r2 ------- r3

   Figure 5. SRR Graph between Fiber link and (shared) Fiber segment
   failure risk relationship

   Although R1 = r1-r2-r3 and R2 = r4 are diverse lightpaths between N2
   and N4 in the fiber topology (link and node disjointness), they are
   not diverse with respect to the SRLGs, because both R1 and R2 cover
   SRLG S2, which contains r1, r3 (part of R1) and r4 (part of R2).
   SRLGs are thus a way of formalizing the propagation of link risk
   dependencies from server layers to client layers.

   The rules guiding the definition of minimum set of SRLGs for more
   complex physical network topologies will be addressed in a future
   version of this study.

1.2 Rationale for the Model

   We define the routing diversity requirement of a lightpath as the
   SRLG Inclusion Set (SIS) of all the lightpaths from which a given
   lightpath must be physically diverse. When client layers implement
   their own recovery mechanism, they may not want to request protected
   lightpaths (for instance, a client could only request unprotected
   lightpaths from the optical network). However, the client may

Draft-many-inference-srlg-00.txt                         February 2001


   request that some of these unprotected lightpaths be diverse
   throughout the optical network, such that corresponding links in the
   client layer topology do not fail together or at least, are unlikely
   to fail together.

   The SLRG Inclusion Set (SIS) of a lightpath is defined as the set of
   SRLGs covered by this lightpath. As mentioned in before, routing
   diversity could be related to the following physical optical network
   resources:
   - Optical network element (not considered in this document)
   - Fiber link
   - Fiber sub-segment
   - Fiber segment
   - Fiber trunk

   The resource identifiers (Resource ID) corresponding to the optical
   network resources can be defined by considering a hierarchical
   encoding:
   - Optical device: ONE ID (or Node ID)
   - Fiber link: Identified by a Fiber ID (and a Fiber ID û Port ID
   mapping table)
   - Fiber sub-segment: Identified by a Fiber Sub-segment ID
   - Fiber segment: List of fiber sub-segments included within the same
   segment; coded as Fiber Segment ID
   - Fiber trunk: Sequence of fiber sub-segments connecting two ONEÆs

1.2.1 Lightpath Creation

   When a client CNE sends a lightpath create request to the boundary
   ONE, it can only reference lightpath(s) from which the new lightpath
   j should be diverse. This because we assume that the client only
   knows about the lightpaths it has already established. The purpose
   is to avoid the set of SRLGs contained in the SISs of lightpath 1,
   lightpath 2, à, lightpath N when routing lightpath j.

   The ONE will process this request by considering the Shared Risk
   Link Groups (SRLGs) of the lightpath 1, lightpath 2, à, lightpath N
   and find a physical route for the lightpath j whose SIS does not
   contain any of the SRLGs covered by the lightpath 1, lightpath 2, à,
   lightpath N. Consequently, the SIS of the lightpath j could be
   represented as the union of the SIS of the lightpaths from which the
   lightpath j has to be diverse.

   Each of the physical resources included within the optical network
   could be allocated to a lightpath. Consequently, there is a
   corresponding list of lightpaths sharing a common resource
   identified by a resource type and a resource ID that could be
   represented as a resource allocation array:

   [<<RT 1; RID 1>    ; <LPSet[1,1]>>
    <<RT 1; RID 2>    ; <LPSet[1,2]>>
    ...
    <<RT 1; RID N[1]> ; <LPSet[1,n]>>

Draft-many-inference-srlg-00.txt                         February 2001


    ...
    <<RT 2; RID 1>    ; <LPSet[2,1]>>
    <<RT 2; RID 2>    ; <LPSet[2,2]>>
    ...
    <<RT 2; RID N[2]> ; <LPSet[2,n]>>
    ...
    ...
    <<RT M; RID 1>    ; <LPSet[m,1]>>
    <<RT M; RID 2>    ; <LPSet[m,2]>>
    ...
    <<RT M; RID N[M]> ; <LPSet[m,n]>>]

   where
   - RT: Resource Type (such as - Fiber, Fiber sub-segment, Fiber
   segment, Trunk)
   - RID: Resource Identifier for a given RT.
   - LPSet[i,j] := Set of Lightpaths covering a RT i having a RID j

   Since each of these lightpath sets shares a common resource each of
   these resources constitutes a shared risk. Hence, in the optical
   channel layer, the corresponding lightpath sets constitutes an SRLG
   for a given (RT, RID) pair.

   If we consider the fiber set allocated to the optical network
   topology, then there is a corresponding list of fibers sharing a
   common resource and identified by a (RT, RID), as illustrated below:

   [<<RT 1; RID 1>    ; <FLSet[1,1]>>
    <<RT 1; RID 2>    ; <FLSet[1,2]>>
    ...
    <<RT 1; RID N[1]> ; <FLSet[1,n]>>
    ...
    <<RT 2; RID 1>    ; <FLSet[2,1]>>
    <<RT 2; RID 2>    ; <FLSet[2,2]>>
    ...
    <<RT 2; RID N[2]> ; <FLSet[2,n]>>
    ...
    ...
    <<RT M; RID 1>    ; <FLSet[m,1]>>
    <<RT M; RID 2>    ; <FLSet[m,2]>>
    ...
    <<RT M; RID N[M]> ; <FLSet[m,n]>>]

   where
   - FLSet[i, j] := Set of Fiber Links covering a RT i having a RID j

   In this case, each of these fiber sets shares a common resource
   meaning that each of these resources constitutes a shared risk Hence
   in the physical layer, the corresponding fiber sets constitutes an
   SRLG for a given (RT, RID) pair. Note that this discussion including
   the one related to the LPSet does not include the logical structure
   to which a resource belongs.

Draft-many-inference-srlg-00.txt                         February 2001


   Consequently, the routing diversity of a lightpath X (so, extendedly
   the SRLG Inclusion Set of a lightpath X will be defined as the
   corresponding complement) can be represented as the list of all the
   resources covered by all the lightpaths from which this lightpath X
   has to be physically diverse from (i.e. the set of resources that
   must not be used the lightpath X):

   [<<RT 1>; <RID 1, RID 2, à, RID K>>
    <<RT 2>; <RID 1, RID 2, à, RID L>>
    ...
    <<RT N>; <RID 1, RID 2, à, RID M>>]

   meaning exclude lightpath X from
   - RT 1 is identified by excluding <RID1,à, RID K>
   - RT 2 is identified by excluding <RID1,à, RID L>
   - à
   - and RT N is identified by excluding <RID1,à, RID M>.

   However, this interpretation does not permit to find the
   relationship between logical structures or physical resources: for
   instance a fiber is included in a fiber sub-segment, which is
   included in a fiber segment. Moreover, several lightpaths can be
   included within the same fiber (or link). As defined in [IPO-Frame]
   and [IPO-Bundle], the notable characteristic of SRLGs is that a
   given link could belong to more than one SRLG, and two links
   belonging to a given SRLG may individually belong to two other
   SRLGs. The algorithm described in the section 1.4, propose a method
   to dynamically discover these relationships.

1.2.2 Risk Type

   As specified up to now, the SRLG model specification considers that
   each of the resource (as used in the lightpath computation) may
   experience one or more failure type(s). The same applies to
   geographical locations - a given location might be subjected to more
   than one failure type. Moreover, by applying the SRLG properties, a
   network resource failure could cover more than one geographical
   location. Consequently, some heuristics must be introduced to keep
   the SRLG computational complexity limited.

   In order to limit the computational complexity, we define the
   following heuristics when considering the SRLG computation with
   respect to the type of risk:

   - The set of risk types associated to network resources corresponds
   exactly to the set of resource type failure.
        - So, for instance, the risk type associated to a fiber segment
        is a fiber segment failure. The same principle applies for
        other network resources such as fiber link, fiber sub-segment
        and fiber trunk. Consequently, we donÆt consider a finest
        granularity for the network resource failure than the one
        referred by their type.


Internet Draft - CCAMP Working Group û Expires August 2001          18

Draft-many-inference-srlg-00.txt                         February 2001


   - A risk type associated to a geographical structure covers exactly
   the region where it is defined. Moreover, a geographical failure is
   limited to a given location and does not impact the neighboring
   locations or generate another geographical failure type.
        - For instance, we consider that an earthquake covers exactly
        one region or one area and that such a failure does not
        generate a hurricane impacting the neighboring locations. So,
        there is no correlation between geographical failures.

   - Each of the network resources covers exactly one geographical
   logical structure (defined by a region ID or a zone ID).
        - Consequently, when a geographical failure occurs, it
        generates a failure impacting the entire network resources
        included within the corresponding location. Hence, there is an
        ON/OFF relationship between geographical and network resource
        failures.

   Consequently, when considering network resources, the risk type
   associated to an SRLG is defined as the potential failure of one (or
   more than one) instance of the resource belonging to a given
   resource type or the potential failure of one (or more than one)
   instance of the resource depending on one (or more than one) of the
   instance of this given resource.

   In the previous section, we defined the concept of SRLG with respect
   to a given resource type (and by extension to the risk type to which
   this resource type refers) and a given resource identifier by means
   of the lightpath and fiber set concept. This definition can be
   extended to include the fiber sub-segment and fiber segment set
   concept. Since each instance of these sets corresponds to an SRLG
   class, we assign an identifier to each of the SRLG classes members
   and define this value as a SRLG identifier.

   Moreover, by applying the defined heuristics above, the SRLG
   identifiers can be grouped together by taking into account their
   geographical location. The latter is encoded by identifying the
   region identifier (region ID) and the zone identifier (zone ID)
   including the resource identifiers to which the SRLG refers.

1.3 Calculation of Shared Risk Link Groups

   In the calculation method, shared_risk(RID i, RID j, RT)is TRUE only
   if RID i and RID j belong to the same SRLG with respect to the type
   of risk  (RT). The risk types considered here are related the fiber
   trunk, the fiber segment, the fiber sub-segment and the fiber link
   risk failure.

   A recursive calculation of shared_risk proceeds as follows:

   shared_risk(RID i, RID j, RT) =
        at_risk(RID i, RT)
        and at_risk(RID j, RT)
        and (RID i = RID j

                or (exists RID k, RID l
                such that
                        depends_on(RID i, RID k)
                        and depends_on(RID j, RID l)
                        and shared_risk(RID k, RID l, RT)))

   In this calculation:
   - at_risk(RID i, RT) is TRUE only if RID is susceptible to a risk of
   type RT, either directly, or indirectly, through the failure of one
   of the elements it depends on.
   - depends_on(RID i, RID j) is TRUE only if RID i fails as soon as
   RID j fails.

   If we refer to the example detailed in section 1.1, then
   shared_risk(r1, r2, [fiber segment failure]) = TRUE because
   depends_on(r1, A) = TRUE , depends_on(r2, A) = TRUE and at_risk(A,
   [fiber segment failure]) = TRUE (the latter simply because A is a
   fiber segment).

1.4 Practical Method for SRLG Calculation

   The recursive formula presented in the previous section does not
   directly lead to an efficient algorithm. ItÆs top-down nature
   illustrates nicely the recursive nature of the SRLG concept, but the
   calculation of the SRLGs in a top-down fashion would be totally
   inefficient, entailing the calculation of the same SRLGs in lower
   network layers over and over again.

   A far more efficient algorithm can be obtained by a bottom-up
   calculation. Figure 6 illustrates this by using the example we
   introduced in the section 1.1 and in by introducing the concept of
   Shared Risk Relationship Graph (SRR) which defines the membership of
   a resource belonging to the same SRLG.

   Figure 6. Bottom-up calculation of Shared Risk Relationships

   For the calculation of a set of SRLGs, we need to calculate a Shared
   Risk Relationship (SRR) graph. The bottom-up calculation of the
   fiber SRR graph proceeds as follows:

   - Step 1. For each fiber segment, there is an SRR between every two
   fibers contained in that segment (vertical arrows in Figure 6.)

   - Step 2. For every SRR between two fiber segments, there is an SRR
   between every two fibers contained in either of the two fiber
   segments.

   In the previous example, there are no SRRs between fiber segments,
   and the calculation stops after Step 1.

1.5 Application of the Model

   The model is intended to be used to automate the discovery of the
   SRLGs at a given layer for a given risk type (RT).

   The dependencies may be confined to one layer, e.g. the dependency
   of an optical link on a ONE (for instance, a DWDM end-system) to
   which it is connected, when the RT = [ONE failure]. Dependencies may
   also extend over layer boundaries, e.g. the dependency of an TDM
   circuit in an SDH network established on an optical channel (or
   wavelength) through the optical network that is the server of the
   SDH network, when RT = [fiber failure].

   Let two optical network resources RID i and RID j within the same
   layer share a common risk of type RT. Let this risk type be tied to
   a lower layer, which we will call the risk layer. To enable the
   layer to infer shared_risk(RID i, RID j, RT),  its serving layer
   should advertise the following information:

     shared_risk(component_1, component_2, RT)

        where
        - component_1 are services of the serving layer on which RID i
        rely and
        - component_2 are services of the serving layer on which RID j
        rely.

   If the serving layer is not the risk layer, the latter has to infer
   this knowledge itself from what its serving layer is advertising.

Draft-many-inference-srlg-00.txt                         February 2001



   If shared risk relationships are not advertised, client layers
   should at least be able to query from their serving layer the shared
   risk relationships between the services they receive.

   Some dependencies do not lend themselves easily to automatic
   discovery. For instance, it is hardly imaginable that the process of
   finding out through which fiber segments a fiber goes can be
   automated. This means that part of the image of depends_on (RID i,
   RID j) will have to be provided æmanuallyÆ by the operator or be at
   least statically configured into a centralized repository.

   More formally, an efficient calculation of shared risk link
   relationships relies on two things:
   - In the lowest network layer with elements susceptible to the risk
   type RT that is considered, every network element RID j susceptible
   to the risk RT constitutes an SRR on its own, that is, (RID j, RID
   j) satisfies the recursive formula;
   - Every SRR that has been discovered in one network layer leads to
   SRRs in the next higher network layer. In particular, two next
   higher layer network elements (RID i, RID j) depending on lower
   layer network elements that have an SRR satisfy the recursive
   formula. In order to allow an efficient calculation of the shared
   risk relationships in the next higher layer (e.g. the fiber layer),
   the shared risk relationships that were discovered in lower layers
   (e.g. the fiber segment layer) are stored in SRR graphs. This way,
   the recalculation of lower layer shared risk relationships can be
   avoided.

1.6 Generalized SRLG Inference Model

   By referring to the example provided in the section 1.1, we can
   deduce the following statements:

   - First, given a physical network, we must assign in the optical
   network the fibers to fiber sub-segments (this is usually trivial
   since a fiber sub-segment will correspond to a fiber bundle), and we
   must (less trivially) assign fiber sub-segments to fiber segments.

   - Then, given a physical network, every fiber sub-segment that is
   connected to a location Ni must belong to a common fiber segment.

   However one can argue that a location should be allowed to have
   multiple fiber segments connected to it. Consider for instance the
   example of a central office in a SDH/SONET network, which may be
   connected to a metro ring and a local access ring or a linear
   cascade of nodes. Such a facility could be represented by a location
   vertex that is connected to four fiber segments in the two-ring case
   (two segments associated with each ring). A logistical issue is how
   the network will know that a particular section of a fiber bundle
   belongs to a particular fiber segment.

1.6.1 Connectivity Graph

   So in the general case, any network at the fiber segment level can
   be represented as a graph G([N,X], S), where N is the set of
   vertices that correspond to locations {N1, N2, ... , Nn}, X is the
   set of vertices that are not locations but are meeting points for
   fiber segments (call these vertices {X1, X2, ... , Xm}), and S is
   the set of fiber segments {S1, S2, ... , Sp}.

   Similarly, the network can be represented by a fiber connectivity
   graph C(N, F), where the set N is equal to the set N in the fiber
   segment graph above, and the set F is the set of edges indicating
   fiber connectivity between the elements of the set N.  Specifically,
   an edge Fi exists between two vertices Nk and Nl if and only if
   there exists at least one direct fiber link connection between the
   two locations corresponding to Nk and Nl.  Furthermore, we can say
   that for every edge {Nk, Nl} in C(N,F), there is a walk that can be
   represented as a path {Nk, Xa1, Xa2, ... , Xan, Nl} or equivalently
   as a trail {Sa1, Sa2, ... , Sa(n+1)} in G([N,X],S), where {Sa1, Sa2,
   ... , Sa(n+1)} is the trail of fiber segments (the fiber trunk) that
   connects Nk to Nl, and that every such walk corresponds to a fiber
   trunk that connects the two locations.

                                    F1
                            N1 ------------ N2
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |F2             |F4
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |       F3      |
                            N3 ------------ N4

                    Figure 7. Connectivity Graph C(N,F)

   However, it is important to note that not every path in G([N,X],S)
   of the form {Nk, Xa1, Xa2, ... , Xan, Nl} maps to an edge in C(N,
   F).  There must be a corresponding edge in C(N,F) to obtain such a
   mapping. When referring to the above example, {N1, X1, X2, N4} is a
   path from N1 to N4 whose only members that are elements of N are its
   endpoints, but there is no direct connection between N1 and N4, as
   can be seen from the connectivity graph C(N,F).

1.6.2 Combined Connectivity Graph

   In order to construct the SRR graph, we need to find a way to
   combine the information in C(N,F) and G([N,X],S) to form a new
   graph, H(F,S). In this new graph, the members of the connectivity
   graph edge set become the vertices of the SRR graph, while the edges
   of the fiber segment graph become the edges in H.

   The graph H(F,S) can almost be created by taking C(N,F) and
   "switching" the vertices and edges, and then naming each edge with

   the fiber segment emanating from the location associated with the
   edge, rather than naming the edge with the location itself.

   In the above example, the connectivity graph C(N,F) is

                                    F1
                            N1 ------------ N2
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |F2             |F4
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |       F3      |
                            N3 ------------ N4

                    Figure 8. Connectivity Graph C(N,F)

   By exchanging vertices into edges and edges into vertices one get:

                                    N2
                            F1 ------------ F4
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |N1             |N4
                             |               |
                             |               |
                             |       N3      |
                            F2 ------------ F3

               Figure 9. Reverse Connectivity Graph RC(N,F)

   Each location has its own fiber segment that comprises all the fiber
   sub-segments that emanate from that location.  By replacing each
   location Ni with its own adjacent segment, the above graph becomes a
   combined graph:

                                     D
                            F1 ------------ F4

1.6.3 Basic Topologies

   As first basic topology, take for instance the case of a network
   that is a linear cascade:


           N1------------N2------------N3


                                   A      B      C      D
   Its fiber segment graph is: N1-----X1-----N2-----X2-----N3


                                        F1      F2
   Its fiber connectivity graph is: N1------N2------N3


                     N1     N2     N3
   The new graph is: <>-F1------F2-<>, where -<> and <>- denote looped
   edges (so technically speaking it's a multi-graph).

   By replacing locations with associated fiber segments, one get the
   following graph:


                                   {B,C}
                           A <>-F1-------F2-<> D


   In this graph, segments A and D affect only the fiber links (N1, N2)
   and (N2, N3) respectively, and affect no other fibers.  The edge
   between F1 and F2 really shouldn't be a fully connected edge, since
   failure of the fiber segment B will not impact the (N2, N3) fiber
   connection.  So, one should say that there can be an edge between
   Fi's if and only if they share a fiber segment connecting them to a
   location.
