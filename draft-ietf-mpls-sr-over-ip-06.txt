                     draft-ietf-mpls-sr-over-ip-06

Abstract

   MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) is an MPLS data plane-based source
   routing paradigm in which the sender of a packet is allowed to
   partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through
   the network by imposing stacked MPLS labels on the packet.  SR-MPLS
   can be leveraged to realize a source routing mechanism across MPLS,
   IPv4, and IPv6 data planes by using an MPLS label stack as a source
   routing instruction set while making no changes to SR-MPLS
   specifications and interworking with SR-MPLS implementations.

   This document describes how SR-MPLS capable routers and IP-only
   routers can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate through the use of
   SR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in-
   UDP as defined in RFC 7510.

1.  Introduction

   MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls]
   is an MPLS data plane-based source routing paradigm in which the
   sender of a packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the
   route the packet takes through the network by imposing stacked MPLS
   labels on the packet.  SR-MPLS uses an MPLS label stack to encode a
   source routing instruction set.  This can be used to realize a source
   routing mechanism that can operate across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data
   planes.  This approach makes no changes to SR-MPLS specifications and

Internet-Draft               SR-MPLS over IP                    May 2019


   allows interworking with SR-MPLS implementations.  More specifically,
   the source routing instruction set information contained in a source
   routed packet could be uniformly encoded as an MPLS label stack no
   matter whether the underlay is IPv4, IPv6, or MPLS.

   This document describes how SR-MPLS capable routers and IP-only
   routers can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate through the use of
   SR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in-
   UDP [RFC7510].

   Section 2 describes various use cases for the tunneling SR-MPLS over
   IP.  Section 3 describes a typical application scenario and how the
   packet forwarding happens.

1.1.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC3031] and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Use Cases

   Tunneling SR-MPLS using IPv4 and/or IPv6 tunnels is useful at least
   in the use cases listed below.  In all cases, this can be enabled
   using an IP tunneling mechanism such as MPLS-in-UDP as described in
   [RFC7510].  The tunnel selected MUST have its remote end point
   (destination) address equal to the address of the next SR-MPLS
   capable node identified as being on the SR path (i.e., the egress of
   the active segment).  The local end point (source) address is set to
   an address of the encapsulating node.  [RFC7510] gives further advice
   on how to set the source address if the UDP zero-checksum mode is
   used with MPLS-in-UDP.

   o  Incremental deployment of the SR-MPLS technology may be
      facilitated by tunneling SR-MPLS packets across parts of a network
      that are not SR-MPLS as shown in Figure 1.  This demonstrates how
      islands of SR-MPLS may be connected across a legacy network.  It
      may be particularly useful for joining sites (such as data
      centers).

   o  If encoding of entropy ([RFC6790] is desired, IP tunneling
      mechanisms that allow encoding of entropy, such as MPLS-in-UDP
      encapsulation [RFC7510] where the source port of the UDP header is
      used as an entropy field, may be used to maximize the utilization
      of ECMP and/or LAG, especially when it is difficult to make use of
      the entropy label mechanism.  This is to be contrasted with
      [RFC4023] where MPLS-in-IP does not provide for an entropy
      mechanism.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-mpls-spring-entropy-label]) for
      more discussion about using entropy labels in SR-MPLS.

   o  Tunneling MPLS over IP provides a technology that enables SR in an
      IPv4 and/or IPv6 network where the routers do not support SRv6
      capabilities [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] and where MPLS
      forwarding is not an option.  This is shown in Figure 2.

3.  Procedures of SR-MPLS over IP

   This section describes the construction of forwarding information
   base (FIB) entries and the forwarding behavior that allow the
   deployment of SR-MPLS when some routers in the network are IP only
   (i.e., do not support SR-MPLS).  Note that the examples in
   Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.2 assume that OSPF or ISIS is enabled: in
   fact, other mechanisms of discovery and advertisement could be used
   including other routing protocols (such as BGP) or a central
   controller.

3.1.  Forwarding Entry Construction

   This sub-section describes the how to construct the forwarding
   information base (FIB) entry on an SR-MPLS-capable router when some
   or all of the next-hops along the shortest path towards a prefix
   Segment Identifier (prefix-SID) are IP-only routers.  Section 3.1.1
   provides a concrete example of how the process applies when using
   OSPF or ISIS.

   Consider router A that receives a labeled packet with top label L(E)
   that corresponds to the prefix-SID SID(E) of prefix P(E) advertised
   by router E.  Suppose the i-th next-hop router (termed NHi) along the
   shortest path from router A toward SID(E) is not SR-MPLS capable
   while both routers A and E are SR-MPLS capable.  The following
   processing steps apply:



Xu, et al.              Expires November 24, 2019               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               SR-MPLS over IP                    May 2019


   o  Router E is SR-MPLS capable, so it advertises a Segment Routing
      Global Block (SRGB).  The SRGB is defined in [RFC8402].  There are
      a number of ways that the advertisement can be achieved including
      IGPs, BGP, configuration/management protocols.  For example, see
      [I-D.ietf-bess-datacenter-gateway].

   o  When Router E advertises the prefix-SID SID(E) of prefix P(E) it
      MUST also advertise the encapsulation endpoint and the tunnel type
      of any tunnel used to reach E.  This information is flooded domain
      wide.

   o  If A and E are in different routing domains then the information
      MUST be flooded into both domains.  How this is achieved depends
      on the advertisement mechanism being used.  The objective is that
      router A knows the characteristics of router E that originated the
      advertisement of SID(E).

   o  Router A programs the FIB entry for prefix P(E) corresponding to
      the SID(E) according to whether a pop or swap action is advertised
      for the prefix.  The resulting action may be:

      *  pop the top label

      *  swap the top label to a value equal to SID(E) plus the lower
         bound of the SRGB of E

   Once constructed, the FIB can be used by a router to tell it how to
   process packets.  It encapsulates the packets according to the
   appropriate encapsulation advertised for the segment and then it
   sends the packets towards the next hop NHi.

3.1.1.  FIB Construction Example

   This section is non-normative and provides a worked example of how a
   FIB might be constructed using OSPF and ISIS extensions.  It is based
   on the process described in Section 3.1.

   o  Router E is SR-MPLS capable, so it advertises a Segment Routing
      Global Block (SRGB) using
      [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] or
      [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].

   o  When Router E advertises the prefix-SID SID(E) of prefix P(E) it
      also advertises the encapsulation endpoint and the tunnel type of
      any tunnel used to reach E using [I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap]
      or [I-D.ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap].

Internet-Draft               SR-MPLS over IP                    May 2019


   o  If A and E are in different domains then the information is
      flooded into both domains and any intervening domains.

      *  The OSPF Tunnel Encapsulation TLV
         [I-D.ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap] or the ISIS Tunnel
         Encapsulation sub-TLV [I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap] is
         flooded domain-wide.

      *  The OSPF SID/label range TLV
         [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] or the ISIS SR-
         Capabilities Sub-TLV [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions]
         is advertised domain-wide so that router A knows the
         characteristics of router E.

      *  When router E advertises the prefix P(E):

         +  If router E is running ISIS it uses the extended
            reachability TLV (TLVs 135, 235, 236, 237) and associates
            the IPv4/IPv6 or IPv4/IPv6 source router ID sub-TLV(s)
            [RFC7794].

         +  If router E is running OSPF it uses the OSPFv2 Extended
            Prefix Opaque LSA [RFC7684] and sets the flooding scope to
            AS-wide.

      *  If router E is running ISIS and advertises the ISIS capability
         TLV (TLV 242) [RFC7981], it sets the "router-ID" field to a
         valid value or includes an IPV6 TE router-ID sub-TLV (TLV 12),
         or does both.  The "S" bit (flooding scope) of the ISIS
         capability TLV (TLV 242) is set to "1" .

   o  Router A programs the FIB entry for prefix P(E) corresponding to
      the SID(E) according to whether a pop or swap action is advertised
      for the prefix as follows:

      *  If the NP flag in OSPF or the P flag in ISIS is clear:

            pop the top label

      *  If the NP flag in OSPF or the P flag in ISIS is set:

            swap the top label to a value equal to SID(E) plus the lower
            bound of the SRGB of E

   When forwarding the packet according to the constructed FIB entry the
   router encapsulates the packet according to the encapsulation as
   advertised using the mechanisms described in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap] or

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap]).  It then sends the packets
   towards the next hop NHi.

3.2.  Packet Forwarding Procedures

   [RFC7510] specifies an IP-based encapsulation for MPLS, i.e., MPLS-
   in-UDP.  This approach is applicable where IP-based encapsulation for
   MPLS is required and further fine-grained load balancing of MPLS
   packets over IP networks over Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or Link
   Aggregation Groups (LAGs) is also required.  This section provides
   details about the forwarding procedure when UDP encapsulation is
   adopted for SR-MPLS over IP.  Other encapsulation and tunnelling
   mechanisms can be applied using similar techniques, but for clarity
   this section uses UDP encapsulation as the exemplar.

   Nodes that are SR-MPLS capable can process SR-MPLS packets.  Not all
   of the nodes in an SR-MPLS domain are SR-MPLS capable.  Some nodes
   may be "legacy routers" that cannot handle SR-MPLS packets but can
   forward IP packets.  An SR-MPLS-capable node MAY advertise its
   capabilities using the IGP as described in Section 3.  There are six
   types of node in an SR-MPLS domain:

   o  Domain ingress nodes that receive packets and encapsulate them for
      transmission across the domain.  Those packets may be any payload
      protocol including native IP packets or packets that are already
      MPLS encapsulated.

   o  Legacy transit nodes that are IP routers but that are not SR-MPLS
      capable (i.e., are not able to perform segment routing).

   o  Transit nodes that are SR-MPLS capable but that are not identified
      by a SID in the SID stack.

   o  Transit nodes that are SR-MPLS capable and need to perform SR-MPLS
      routing because they are identified by a SID in the SID stack.

   o  The penultimate SR-MPLS capable node on the path that processes
      the last SID on the stack on behalf of the domain egress node.

   o  The domain egress node that forwards the payload packet for
      ultimate delivery.

3.2.1.  Packet Forwarding with Penultimate Hop Popping

   The description in this section assumes that the label associated
   with each prefix-SID is advertised by the owner of the prefix-SID as
   a Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) label.  That is, if one of the IGP

   flooding mechanisms is used, the NP flag in OSPF or the P flag in
   ISIS associated with the prefix-SID is not set.

               Figure 3: Packet Forwarding Example with PHP

   In the example shown in Figure 3, assume that routers A, E, G and H
   are SR-MPLS-capable while the remaining routers (B, C, D and F) are
   only capable of forwarding IP packets.  Routers A, E, G, and H
   advertise their Segment Routing related information, such as via IS-
   IS or OSPF.

   Now assume that router A (the Domain ingress) wants to send a packet
   to router H (the Domain egress) via the explicit path {E->G->H}.
   Router A will impose an MPLS label stack on the packet that
   corresponds to that explicit path.  Since the next hop toward router
   E is only IP-capable (B is a legacy transit node), router A replaces
   the top label (that indicated router E) with a UDP-based tunnel for
   MPLS (i.e., MPLS-over-UDP [RFC7510]) to router E and then sends the
   packet.  In other words, router A pops the top label and then
   encapsulates the MPLS packet in a UDP tunnel to router E.

   When the IP-encapsulated MPLS packet arrives at router E (which is an
   SR-MPLS-capable transit node), router E strips the IP-based tunnel
   header and then processes the decapsulated MPLS packet.  The top
   label indicates that the packet must be forwarded toward router G.
   Since the next hop toward router G is only IP-capable, router E

Internet-Draft               SR-MPLS over IP                    May 2019


   replaces the current top label with an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel toward
   router G and sends it out.  That is, router E pops the top label and
   then encapsulates the MPLS packet in a UDP tunnel to router G.

   When the packet arrives at router G, router G will strip the IP-based
   tunnel header and then process the decapsulated MPLS packet.  The top
   label indicates that the packet must be forwarded toward router H.
   Since the next hop toward router H is only IP-capable (D is a legacy
   transit router), router G would replace the current top label with an
   MPLS-over-UDP tunnel toward router H and send it out.  However, since
   router G reaches the bottom of the label stack (G is the penultimate
   SR-MPLS capable node on the path) this would leave the original
   packet that router A wanted to send to router H encapsulated in UDP
   as if it was MPLS (i.e., with a UDP header and destination port
   indicating MPLS) even though the original packet could have been any
   protocol.  That is, the final SR-MPLS has been popped exposing the
   payload packet.

   To handle this, when a router (here it is router G) pops the final
   SR-MPLS label, it inserts an explicit null label [RFC3032] before
   encapsulating the packet in an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel toward router H
   and sending it out.  That is, router G pops the top label, discovers
   it has reached the bottom of stack, pushes an explicit null label,
   and then encapsulates the MPLS packet in a UDP tunnel to router H.

3.2.2.  Packet Forwarding without Penultimate Hop Popping

   Figure 4 demonstrates the packet walk in the case where the label
   associated with each prefix-SID advertised by the owner of the
   prefix-SID is not a Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) label (e.g., the
   the NP flag in OSPF or the P flag in ISIS associated with the prefix-
   SID is set).  Apart from the PHP function the roles of the routers is
   unchanged from Section 3.2.1.

              Figure 4: Packet Forwarding Example without PHP

   As can be seen from the figure, the SR-MPLS label for each segment is
   left in place until the end of the segment where it is popped and the
   next instruction is processed.

3.2.3.  Additional Forwarding Procedures

   Non-MPLS Interfaces:  Although the description in the previous two
      sections is based on the use of prefix-SIDs, tunneling SR-MPLS
      packets is useful when the top label of a received SR-MPLS packet
      indicates an adjacency-SID and the corresponding adjacent node to
      that adjacency-SID is not capable of MPLS forwarding but can still
      process SR-MPLS packets.  In this scenario the top label would be
      replaced by an IP tunnel toward that adjacent node and then
      forwarded over the corresponding link indicated by the adjacency-
      SID.

   When to use IP-based Tunnel:  The description in the previous two
      sections is based on the assumption that MPLS-over-UDP tunnel is
      used when the nexthop towards the next segment is not MPLS-
      enabled.  However, even in the case where the nexthop towards the
      next segment is MPLS-capable, an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel towards the
      next segment could still be used instead due to local policies.
      For instance, in the example as described in Figure 4, assume F is



Xu, et al.              Expires November 24, 2019              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               SR-MPLS over IP                    May 2019


      now an SR-MPLS-capable transit node while all the other
      assumptions remain unchanged: since F is not identified by a SID
      in the stack and an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel is preferred to an MPLS
      LSP according to local policies, router E replaces the current top
      label with an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel toward router G and send it
      out.  (Note that if an MPLS LSP was preferred, the packet would be
      forwarded as native SR-MPLS.)

   IP Header Fields:  When encapsulating an MPLS packet in UDP, the
      resulting packet is further encapsulated in IP for transmission.
      IPv4 or IPv6 may be used according to the capabilities of the
      network.  The address fields are set as described in Section 2.
      The other IP header fields (such as the ECN field [RFC6040], the
      DSCP code point [RFC2983], or IPv6 Flow Label) on each UDP-
      encapsulated segment SHOULD be configurable according to the
      operator's policy: they may be copied from the header of the
      incoming packet; they may be promoted from the header of the
      payload packet; they may be set according to instructions
      programmed to be associated with the SID; or they may be
      configured dependent on the outgoing interface and payload.

   Entropy and ECMP:  When encapsulating an MPLS packet with an IP
      tunnel header that is capable of encoding entropy (such as
      [RFC7510]), the corresponding entropy field (the source port in
      the case of a UDP tunnel) MAY be filled with an entropy value that
      is generated by the encapsulator to uniquely identify a flow.
      However, what constitutes a flow is locally determined by the
      encapsulator.  For instance, if the MPLS label stack contains at
      least one entropy label and the encapsulator is capable of reading
      that entropy label, the entropy label value could be directly
      copied to the source port of the UDP header.  Otherwise, the
      encapsulator may have to perform a hash on the whole label stack
      or the five-tuple of the SR-MPLS payload if the payload is
      determined as an IP packet.  To avoid re-performing the hash or
      hunting for the entropy label each time the packet is encapsulated
      in a UDP tunnel it MAY be desirable that the entropy value
      contained in the incoming packet (i.e., the UDP source port value)
      is retained when stripping the UDP header and is re-used as the
      entropy value of the outgoing packet.

   Congestion Considerations:  Section 5 of [RFC7510] provides a
      detailed analysis of the implications of congestion in MPLS-over-
      UDP systems and builds on section 3.1.3 of [RFC8085] that
      describes the congestion implications of UDP tunnels.  All of
      those considerations apply to SR-MPLS-over-UDP tunnels as
      described in this document.  In particular, it should be noted
      that the traffic carried in SR-MPLS flows is likely to be IP
      traffic.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA action.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of [RFC8354] (which redirects the reader
   to [RFC5095]) and [RFC7510] apply.  DTLS [RFC6347] SHOULD be used
   where security is needed on an MPLS-SR-over-UDP segment including
   when the IP segment crosses the public Internet or some other
   untrusted environment.  [RFC8402] provides security considerations
   for Segment Routing, and Section 8.1 of that document is particularly
   applicable to SR-MPLS.

   It is difficult for an attacker to pass a raw MPLS encoded packet
   into a network and operators have considerable experience at
   excluding such packets at the network boundaries, for example by
   excluding all packets that are revealed to be carrying an MPLS packet
   as the payload of IP tunnels.  Further discussion of MPLS security is
   found in [RFC5920].

   It is easy for a network ingress node to detect any attempt to
   smuggle an IP packet into the network since it would see that the UDP
   destination port was set to MPLS, and such filtering SHOULD be
   applied.  SR packets not having a destination address terminating in
   the network would be transparently carried and would pose no
   different security risk to the network under consideration than any
   other traffic.

   Where control plane techniques are used (as described in Section 3),
   it is important that these protocols are adequately secured for the
   environment in which they are run as discussed in [RFC6862] and
   [RFC5920].
