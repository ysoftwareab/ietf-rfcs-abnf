Abstract

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [1] defines a modified EUI-64
   format for interface identifiers. These interface identifiers may
   have global scope when a global token is available (e.g., IEEE 802
   48-bit MAC or IEEE EUI-64 identifiers). Such a global token, the
   IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment Identity), is defined
   for GSM and UMTS terminals [2, 3, 4] and has the same properties
   than identifiers based on IEEE standards.

   This document explains the construction of a global IPv6 interface
   identifier from an IMEI.

INTERNET-DRAFT          IMEI-based interface IDs              Jun 2004


1. Modified EUI-64 Interface Identifiers

   The modified EUI-64 format is required for all unicast addresses,
   except those that start with binary value 000. Two bits have a
   special role in IEEE EUI-64 and in modified EUI-64: the "u" bit,
   one means global scope, zero local scope, and the "g" bit which
   is the "individual/group" in IEEE standards and is always set to
   zero for any modified EUI-64 identifier derived from an IEEE 802
   identifier.

   So when both the "u" and "g" bits are set to one, a modified EUI-64
   identifier has a global scope (i.e. is universal) and is not
   derived from an IEEE identifier.

2. IMEIs

   The IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment Identities) is 14
   decimal digit number attached to the hardware of any GSM [2, 3]
   or UMTS [4] terminal. It is usually written on a label in the
   battery compartment of the handset, displayed when dialing the
   code *#06# (it can come with a spare digit and/or the software
   version number), returned by the AT+CGSN command [5], etc. The
   Mobile Station Equipment is uniquely defined by the IMEI.

   The EIR (Equipment Identity Register) is the database of all
   IMEIs, it can be used in order to block or trace stolen terminals
   even only some operators currently check IMEIs.

   The IMEI has been divided into a Type Approval Code (which begins
   by a country code) on 6 decimal digits followed by a Final Assembly
   Code on 2 decimal digits and the Serial Number on 6 decimal digits
   since 1/1/2003, and is now divided into a Type Allocation Code and
   the Serial Number, both on 6 decimal digits [7]. The IMEI has the
   same properties than an IEEE MAC-48 address, it is attached to the
   hardware and reveals only basic information like the producer and
   the model of the hardware (this is not always true for ESN
   (Electronic Serial Numbers) which are used in some USA mobile phone
   networks).

   IMEIs are globally unique, two different equipments can be
   assumed to have different IMEIs and when this is not true
   (manufacturer error, hardware problem, cloning) the problem can
   cause damage at a higher level than interface identifier
   collision, exactly as a MAC address collision is a very serous
   incident which has nothing in common with an interface identifier
   collision.

3. IMEI-based Interface Identifiers

   This document defines a method to create an interface identifier
   in the modified EUI-64 format from an IMEI. The first octet is 03
   in hexadecimal ("u" and "g" bits set to one, others to zero)
   followed by the 14 decimal digits of the IMEI in BCD (Binary
   Coded Decimal), i.e. with each decimal digit mapped to its value
   on 4 bits.

   The IMEI 330001 53 007826 gives the 0333:0001:5300:7826 (usually
   written 333:1:5300:7826) interface identifier.

4. MEIDs

   3GPP2 is adopting 3G Mobile Equipment Identifiers (MEIDs) [] which
   are very similar to IMEIs. The only major difference is that MEIDs
   use hexadecimal digits in place of binary coded decimal
   digits.
   This document can be directly applied to MEIDs as proposed in [].

5. Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IMEI-based interface identifiers
   are exactly the same than for IEEE EUI-64, EUI-48 or MAC-48
   based interface identifiers. The concerns about traceability
   and/or privacy are addressed in [6].

   The IMEI is supposedly used to report stolen terminals to telecom
   operators. It seems common sense that these operators are to
   perform some additional owner's identity verification before
   accepting such kind of report. Somebody capable of intercepting
   the IMEI of a terminal cannot easily report it as stolen.

6. Acknowledgments

   The idea came during an E-mail exchange about Marcelo Bagnulo's
   draft [10] on random generation of interface identifiers.
   Our GSM expert, Xavier Lagrange, provides in some seconds all the
   GSM and 3GPP references and the (real) IMEI of the example.
   The same idea was developped in the EU project "Moby Dick" [11]
   (signaled by Michelle Wetterwald). Pierre Dupont from Motorola
   warned about the format change. Bruno Stevant from Cyberte project
   gave the AT command to retrieve the IMEI. Wassim Haddad from
   Ericsson Canada proposed to extend the document to new 3GPP2's
   MEIDs. Thanks to Lila Madour for supportin the idea [12].

9. Changes from Previous Drafts

   The Security Considerations section was updated to answer to a
   concern raised at the 53th IETF at Minneapolis in March 2002.

   A reference to a conference paper which includes this idea was
   added in the Informative References section.

   The document was updated to take the IMEI format change into
   account. The AT command was added.
