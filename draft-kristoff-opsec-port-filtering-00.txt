Internet-Draft        Port Filtering Considerations           March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Many networks have implemented a variety of mechanisms to prevent or
   limit certain types of network traffic from traversing their networks
   or reaching certain classes of systems.  This activity, which we
   generically refer to simply as "filtering" can take many forms and be
   instituted for a number of purposes.  "Port filtering" is a specific
   class of stateless Internet packet filtering based on the port number
   fields found the protocols that provide an interface between the
   Internet Protocol (IP) below and application layers above.  Common
   protocols that implement these port identifiers include the
   transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP),
   stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) and the datagram
   congestion control protocol (DCCP).  We aim to offer high-level
   guidance to networks who are currently or are considering utilizing
   port filters.

   Filtering policies are often a contentious issue and can spark
   lengthy debates.  We avoid rehashing those discussions.  We do
   highlight architectural and technical issues where particular
   filtering policies have shown noteworthy side effects from practical
   experience.  Others have published extensively on architectural
   principles that are worthy of the reader's attention [TODO: ref to
   Salzer, Clark and Reed paper, IETF RFC 1958, IETF RFC 2775, IETF RFC
   3439, what credible anti-transparency or pro-filtering references are
   there?].

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  The first section
   outlines problems that can arise from port filtering, and where
   appropriate discusses how to mitigate them.  The remainder of the
   document outlines from a high-level, common port filtering scenarios
   are being widely implemented.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Perimeter-based Security

   The point in the network where port filtering is applied results in a
   defined perimeter, or delineation of a good "inside" and bad
   "outside" [ref RFC 3631 3.11].  Systems common to a particular area
   or "side" share an implicit trust relationship.  As the number of
   systems in an area grows, the number of implicit trust relationships
   in that area may grow expotentially.  With port filtering, in
   practice this only occurs if all systems are sharing a common set of
   applications and ports.  Likewise, as the number of systems in an
   area or side decreases, implicit trust relationships in shared
   applications and ports decline.  For large networks, filters may need
   to be applied throughout the infrastructure to be effective, yet may
   become an increasingly difficult distributed management challenge.

3.  Filter Placement

   Mechanisms exist in current Internet systems that perform filtering
   at almost any point in communications path.  In ISP networks, port
   filters are most often set in router configurations.  These routers
   also perform the route selection and packet formwarding duties of
   transit traffic.  In some cases, ISPs use specialized devices
   generically referred to as firewalls that inspect or intercept
   packets as they traverse the path.  Firewalls often reside next to or
   in some cases may be integrated into routing devices.  These devices
   are dedicated to filtering and related duties, but do not generally
   perform the routing and forwarding functions of the traditional
   routering system.

4.  Ingress Edge Host Shielding

   Edge networks consisting of only end hosts and are used primarily for
   client-based applications have been successfully put behind
   &shielding& filters and rate limits.  If it is known that these hosts
   will require limited stable server processes, the goal is to limit
   their exposure to server processes and minimize their ability to
   generate abusive traffic.  A balance between protection, support and
   transparency is a delicate balance.  Care must be taken to avoid
   preventing access to current or future client-based services through
   the use of filters.

5.  Ingress Shielding Rate Limits

   Rate limits artificially constrain the amount, optionally by type, of
   traffic that may be sourced by an edge host.  It is common for
   typical client-based hosts on the Internet to use TCP for the bulk of
   the source traffic, particularly for high-speed transfers and where a
   congestion-avoidance friendly protocol is desired.  Therefore, rate
   limits for other protocol types to an acceptable rate that leave the
   bulk of the available capacity to the TCP or TCP-like packets have
   been used.
