1.  Introduction

   The SCIM core schema [I-D.ietf-scim-core-schema] defines a platform
   neutral data and extension model for representing users of cloud
   services.  SCIM core also defines XML and JSON serialisations of the
   abstract schema.

   This document defines a mapping between SCIM and vCard [RFC6350].
   The mapping may serve several purposes:

   o  To provide a unified conversion mechanism between SCIM and vCard.

   o  To identify properties that are defined in vCard, but are missing
      in SCIM.

   o  To identify SCIM attributes that may be useful in vCard too.

Internet-Draft             SCIM/vCard mapping              February 2014


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Mapping from SCIM to vCard

   When mapping SCIM attributes to vCard, they may either become mapped
   to vCard properties or to vCard attribues associated with vCard
   properties.  Section 3.1 defines the mappings to the vCard
   properties, whereas Section 3.2 defines mappings to vCard attributes.

   In addition, in accordance to [RFC6350], the vCard representation
   MUST include the mandatory fields:

   o  VERSION

   o  FN

3.1.  Mapping of SCIM attributes to vCard properties

   Table 1 describes a mapping from SCIM attributes to the vCard
   properties.

   In the table, the cardinality of the SCIM attribute is prefixed by an
   "S", whereas the cardinality of the vCard property is prefixed by a
   "v".  The further notation has been adopted from [RFC6350] as
   follows:

   +-------------+----------------------------------------+
   |      1      | Exactly one instance MUST be present.  |
   |      *1     | Exactly one instance MAY be present.   |
   |      1*     | One or more instances MUST be present. |
   |      *      | One or more instances MAY be present.  |
   +-------------+----------------------------------------+

   SCIM fields that have no vCard equivalent MUST be omitted in the
   vCard result.

   The reverse mapping from vCard to SCIM is defined in Section 4.  The
   reason for having two tables is that some mappings are not
   invertible.

   +---------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+
   | SCIM attribute      | vCard property  | Cardinalit | Notes        |
   |                     |                 | y          |              |
   +---------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+

          Table 2: Mapping of SCIM attributes to vCard parameters

4.  Mapping from vCard properties to SCIM attributes

4.1.  Mapping of vCard properties

   Table 3 describes a mapping from vCard properties to SCIM attributes.
   For the cardinalities, the same notation from Section 3 is used.

   Notice that the attributes "uid" and "userName" are mandatory in a
   SCIM representation, whereas they may not be available in the vCard.
   It is left to the application to generate sensible values for these
   fields.

5.  Mapping between SCIM and vCard IDs

   A SCIM specific prefix could be used to indicate the conversion from
   SCIM IDs to vCard UIDs.  A "Service Provider" specific part would

Internet-Draft             SCIM/vCard mapping              February 2014


   need to be included in the vCard UID, as the SCIM ID is unique within
   the Service Provider's space only.  The following format is proposed:

   UID:scim:[serviceProviderID]:123456789

   Conversion from vCard to SCIM may be done similarly, i.e. by adding a
   prefix to the vCard UID.  The SCIM schema document mentions for the
   SCIM ID: "This identifier MUST be unique across the Service
   Provider's entire set of Resources", so as long as the vCard UID
   indeed is globally unique, and the service provider uses the prefix
   for vCard acquired resources only, the rule should hold.

   Notice that the above mechanism allows looping.  For example,
   converting SCIM -> vCard -> SCIM would lead to another SCIM ID in the
   second representation as in the first.  This indeed reflects the
   possible loss of information in the conversion process.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to avoid this kind of chained conversion.

   Because of the format of the vCard UID after conversion from SCIM,
   the SCIM service provider can detect above mentioned chained
   conversion, as well as the original vCard ID.  The actions the
   service provider may take upon such detection may for example include
   using the original SCIM data instead, or using smarter mapping by
   analysing the original and the new import.  This kind of mechanisms
   is left out of scope of this document.

6.  Differences between vCard and SCIM

   This section contains a non-exhaustive list of differences between
   vCard and SCIM.

   o  In vCard, a group property can be established.  This property
      contains the IDs of its members.  In SCIM however, the group/
      membership relation can be signalled in two directions: just like
      vCard the group object can signal its members through the
      "members" attribute, but the member objects can also point to the
      groups they are part of, through the "groups" attribute.

   o  In SCIM, relations between objects can be established either
      through their IDs or through their URIs.  vCard only uses IDs to
      signal relationships between entities.

7.2.  Mapping from vCard to SCIM

   Figure 4 contains the result after converting the vCard data from
   Figure 3 to SCIM.

   The following vCard attributes have been omitted in the SCIM
   representation:

   o  GENDER

   o  BDAY

   The mandatory "uid" and "userName" attributes have been added to the
   SCIM representation, although they have not been defined in the
   vCard.

8.  Open issues

   The following issues require further consideration:

   o  It may be feasible to leave out the conversion between SCIM ids
      and vCarD UIDs, as they may be dependent on the particular
      application that is importing the information.

   o  It is unclear on whether the SCIM ID can include alphanumeric
      characters or is restricted to numeric characters only.  The
      examples in [I-D.ietf-scim-core-schema] seem to indicate that they
      consist of hexadecimal numbers, with dashes at appropriate places.
      If this is the case, then during the conversion from vCard UIDs to
      SCIM IDs would include conversion of alphanumeric characters to
      hexadecimal values.

   o  For SCIM fields that have no equivalent vCard attributes, vCard
      attributes of the form "x-..." could be defined.  Alternatively,
      vCard attributes could be defined, and registered with IANA.

   o  The "id" and "userName" fields are mandatory in SCIM.  However, a
      vCard does not have to contain similar information.  Creating a
      sensible value of these fields may be left to the SCIM application
      that is importing the vCard, or guidelines could be defined.

9.  IANA Considerations

   A "manager" TYPE for the RELATED vCard property may need
   registration.

10.  Security Considerations

   The mapping between vCard and SCIM may be useful for easily
   transferring data for one system towards another.  However, it also
   has privacy implications.  Therefore, it is important that user
   consensus is acquired where applicable.

   For this document, some decisions were made concerning mapping
   between attributes and properties with similar, but not equal,
   semantics.  This was done in a best effort manner.  However one
   should realise that during the mapping process some accuracy from the
   original data may be lost.

   Conversion from SCIM to vCard and subsequently back to SCIM, as well
   as conversion from vCard to SCIM and subsequently back to vCard
   SHOULD be avoided.
