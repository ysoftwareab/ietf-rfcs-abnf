1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a method of sorting the interfaces of a
   monitored device according to values of parameters specific to this
   interface.

   The original RAQMON draft [SIDDIQUI1] was split into 3 parts to
   identify the RAQMON Framework, RAQMON QOS PDU and RAQMON MIB.

   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet community. The document
   proposes an extension to the Remote Monitoring MIB [RFC2819] to
   accommodate RAQMON solution.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the

INTERNET DRAFT                 RAQMON MIB                   January 2003


   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3. RAQMON Framework

   As outlined in [SIDDIQUI2] the RAQMON framework is based on three
   entities:

   - RAQMON Data Source (RDS) - RAQMON Report Collector (RRC) - RAQMON
   MIB Structure

   Figure 1 below shows various interfaces in RAQMON Framework. This
   draft specifies the Management Information Base (MIB) Modules used by
   the RAQMON Report Collectors to store data derived from RAQMON PDUs.

(3) Device State Specific Metrics

(4) RAQMON PDU transmitted over this interface (IP Address, port)

(5) RAQMON MIB running between RRCs and a RAQMON Application ('RAQMON manager')


4. Structure of the RAQMON MIB

The RAQMON MIB is composed of three MIB groups:

The raqmonSession MIB group incorporates the following tables:
- raqmonParticpantTable contains information about participants in open and closed (terminated) sessions
- raqmonQosTable contains historical information about QoS during sessions
- raqmonParticpantAddrTable maps particpant addresses into the index of the raqmonParticpantTable

The raqmonException MIB group includes a table of filters that trigger notifications for sessions with poor QoS.

The raqmonConfig MIB group includes object that define the configuration of the RAQMON collector.

All objects in the MIB MUST be implemented by the RAQMON collectors, with the exception of the raqmonPDUBasicPDU object and raqmonSNMPTransportNotification which MUST be implemented by a RAQMON device. This is reflected in the conformance clauses.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.


   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain



RMON MIB WG                 Expires July 2003                  [Page 26]





INTERNET DRAFT                 RAQMON MIB                   January 2003


   sensitive information. These are:

   raqmonParticipantAddr

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
   this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
   use of the User-based Security Model [RFC2274] and the
   View-based Access Control Model [RFC2275] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.
