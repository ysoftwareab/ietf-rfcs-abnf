Internet-Draft   MPTCP Implementation (Challenges) Usecases   June 2015


Abstract

  MPTCP Intends to address a wide range of issues, with minimal
  implementation tweaks. Though this works in a range of use cases,
  there are some use cases, where some standard implementation
  recommendations could help. The Purpose of this draft is to document
  the use cases, where there are opportunities for standard
  implementation recommendations.

Internet-Draft  MPTCP Implementation (Challenges) Usecases    June 2015


1. Introduction

  There are several existing MPTCP Implementations and no doubt there
  is a growing demand to adopt this in addressing a wide range of
  issues.

  This draft documents use cases where there are implementation
  challenges and would need standard recommendations. The Opportunities
  (design recommendations) to address one or set of use cases,
  independently is not in the scope of this document.

2. MPTCP Implementation Challenges -Usecases

2.1. Impact on existing monitoring and security tools

  If an endpoint sending data wants to add paths to an MPTCP session,
  it notifies the receiving server, which then opens up the new path.
  That's a contradiction -- it's meant to be a stream sending data
  (envision that as data being sent from "left" to "right" on a
  diagram), but the connection is originating in the other direction,
  right to left. From the point of view of a network tool, that new
  stream is "outbound, but incoming," That could cause confusion in
  some monitoring and security tools.

2.2. Fragmentation

  In MPTCP since the party can choose how to divide up data it can do
  fragmentation attacks very easily, for instance by sending every
  alternate byte down alternate paths vi different interfaces. Because
  of technical details of how the mapping occurs, this wouldn't be very
  efficient, however if both ends are doing this then there may be no
  single point on the network which can observe the traffic from both
  flows. This is the unique danger of a multipath fragmentation attack
  reassembly capability alone is not sufficient to observe all
  traffic.

2.3. Aggregation, Persistence & Resilience

  In the immediate term however, MPTCP is designed to provide reliable
  delivery over multiple paths and to  detect where interference
  happens and avoid that path. This may cause issues for organizations
  who use active or transparent security measures. If a client can find
  a path that supports MPTCP it will prefer it over the recommended
  path, leading to both avoidance of security measures and the
  potential for new forms of phishing attacks.

2.4. Address Hopping

  An endpoint can add and remove addresses at will throughout the
  connection, with no requirement that any connection remain available,
  just that the chain of connections remains so. This adds additional
  complexity for monitoring and state handling, for now, we need to
  watch every connection, every possible connection, and track every
  advertised address.

2.5. Security Issues

  Many organizations use network security which is highly dependent on
  tight perimeters, flow monitoring and data inspection. Where network
  security technology is not ready, it may be significantly less
  effective against MPTCP traffic



2.6. MPTCP for DATA CENTRES



2.7. MPTCP performance in presence and absence of proxies



3. Security Considerations

   None

4. IANA Considerations

   None

5. Conclusions

   None
