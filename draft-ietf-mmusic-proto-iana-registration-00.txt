 IANA registrations of SDP 'proto' attribute for transporting RTP Media
                  over TCP under various RTP profiles.
              draft-ietf-mmusic-proto-iana-registration-00

Abstract

   RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for
   applications transmitting real-time data such as audio, video or
   simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  The
   data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
   monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.

   The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes a registry of profile
   names for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the SDP, to
   refer to the transport methods.  This specification describes the
   following new SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP
   Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',
   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP',
   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.

Internet-Draft           SDP Proto Registrations               June 2015


1.  Overview

   SDP [RFC4566] provides a general-purpose format for describing
   multimedia sessions in announcements or invitations.  [RFC4145]
   specifies a general mechanism for describing media transport over TCP
   using SDP with [RFC4571] defining a method for framing Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets onto
   a connection-oriented transport (such as TCP) .  [RFC4572] extends
   [RFC4145] for describing TCP-based media streams that are protected
   using TLS [RFC5246].

   This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol
   identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP:

   TCP/RTP/AVPF: to describe RTP Media with RTCP-based Feedback
   [RFC4585] over TCP, as defined in Section 3.1.

   TCP/RTP/SAVP: to describe Secure RTP Media [RFC3711] over TCP, as
   defined in Section 3.2.

   TCP/RTP/SAVPF: to describe Secure RTP Media with RTCP-based Feedback
   [RFC5124] over TCP, as defined in Section 3.3.

   TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP: to describe Secure RTP Media [RFC3711] using DTLS-
   SRTP [RFC5764] over TCP, as defined in Section 3.4.

   TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF: to describe Secure RTP Media with RTCP-based
   Feedback [RFC5124] using DTLS-SRTP over TCP, as defined in
   Section 3.5.

   TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP: to describe RTP Media on top of TLS over TCP, as
   defined in Section 3.6.

   TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF: to describe RTP Media with RTCP-based Feedback
   [RFC5124] on top of TLS over TCP, as defined in Section 3.7.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Identifiers

   The 'm=' line in SDP specifies, among other items, the transport
   protocol to be used for the media in the session.  See the "Media
   Descriptions" section of SDP [RFC4566] for a discussion on transport
   protocol identifiers.

   The following is the format for an 'm=' line, as specified in
   [RFC4566]:

             m=<media> <port> <proto> <fmt> ...

   An 'm' line that specifies these new proto identifiers MUST further
   qualify the application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier.

3.1.  TCP/RTP/AVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/AVPF is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/AVPF stream over the TCP transport is realized using the
      framing method defined in [RFC4571].

3.2.  TCP/RTP/SAVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/SAVP is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVP stream over the TCP transport is realized using the
      framing method defined in [RFC4571].

3.3.  TCP/RTP/SAVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/SAVPF is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVPF stream over the TCP transport is realized using the
      framing method defined in [RFC4571].

3.4.  TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVP on top of DTLS is realized according to the procedures
      defined in [RFC5764]; and

   o  [RFC4571] framing is used to transport DTLS-SRTP packets over TCP.

3.5.  TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/SAVPF on top of DTLS is realized according to the procedures
      defined in [RFC5764]; and

   o  [RFC4571] framing is used to transport DTLS-SRTP packets over TCP.

3.6.  TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/AVP packets are framed using the procedures from [RFC4571];
      and

   o  [RFC4571] framed RTP/AVP packets are transported as Application
      data messages over the TLS association setup using the procedures
      from [RFC4572].

3.7.  TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF is realized as described below:

   o  RTP/AVPF packets are framed using the procedures from [RFC4571];
      and

   o  [RFC4571] framed RTP/AVPF packets are transported as Application
      data messages over the TLS association setup using the procedures
      from [RFC4572].

4.  ICE Considerations

   When procedures from [RFC6544] are used to setup ICE [RFC5245]
   candidates for a TCP transport, the framing mechanism from [RFC4571]
   is used for STUN keep-alive packets as well, as defined in section 3
   of [RFC6544].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol
   identifiers :'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',
   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP',
   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF', as defined in the Section 3.  These proto values
   should be registered by the IANA under the:

   o  "proto" subregistry in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      Parameters" registry; and

   o  "RTP Profile Names" subregistry in the "Real-Time Transport
      Protocol (RTP) Parameters" registry.

   Additionally the following proto values described in [RFC5764] should
   be registered under the "RTP Profile Names" subregistry in the "Real-
   Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Parameters" registry: 'UDP/TLS/RTP/
   SAVP' , 'DCCP/TLS/RTP/SAVP', 'UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'DCCP/TLS/RTP/
   SAVPF'.

6.  Security Considerations

   The new "proto" identifiers registered by this document in the SDP
   parameters registry maintained by IANA is primarily for use by the
   offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC3264] for
   the negotiation and establishment of RTP based Media over the TCP
   transport.  These additional SDP "proto" identifiers does not
   introduce any security considerations beyond those detailed in
   Section 7 of [RFC4566].
