Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   With rising energy costs and an increasing awareness of the
   ecological impact of running IT and networking equipment, active
   energy management is becoming an additional requirement for network
   management systems.

   The basic objective of energy management is operating communication
   networks and other equipment with a minimal amount of energy.  An
   energy management system should provide means for reducing power
   consumption of individual network components and IT components.

   An essential step to achieve this goal is setting all components to
   an operational mode that consumes as little power as possible while
   still providing sufficient performance to meet service level
   objectives.  The suitable performance level setting may vary over
   time-of-day and may depend on several circumstances.  There are three
   basic kinds of power saving modes for a component:
   o  reduced power modes (lower clock rate for processor, lower data
      rate on a link, etc.)
   o  stand-by modes (not functional, but immediately available)
   o  power off modes (requiring significant time for becoming
      operational)

   While the goal is quite clear, the way to get there is often
   complicated.  In many cases there is no way of reducing power
   consumption without an effective performance degradation.  Then a
   trade-off needs to be dealt with between service level objectives and
   energy efficiency.  In other cases a reduction of energy comsumption
   can easily be achieved while still maintaining all service level
   objectives, for exampe, by switching components to a lower power mode
   when higher performance is not needed.

   Network management systems can control such situations by
   implementing policies to achieve a certain degree of energy
   efficiency.  In order to make policy decisions properly, information
   about the energy consumption of network components in different modes
   is required.  Often this information is acquired best through
   monitoring.

   Monitoring operational power states and energy consumption is also
   needed for other purposes including but not limited to
   o  investigating of power saving potential
   o  evaluating the effectiveness of energy saving policies and
      measures
   o  deriving, implementing, and testing power management strategies

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   o  accounting the total power consumption of a network element, a
      network, a service, or subcomponents of those

   Energy efficiency, not only of networks, has received a lot attention
   recently.  Given the potential gains, there are numerous industry
   efforts that are concentrating on energy efficiency in several areas
   such as:
   o  Energy efficiency of communication networks and IT systems
   o  Energy efficiency of buildings
   o  Efficient delivery of electricity from suppliers to consumers
      (smart [power] grids)

   In this memo however, we focus on power monitoring only.
   Participating entities are monitoring systems that receive
   information and networked devices that provide information on energy
   consumption and power state information concerning themselves or
   potentially also concerning other devices.  Not in the scope of this
   memo are means for controlling the energy consumption and the power
   state of monitored devices.  But it is assumed that proprietary and
   standardized solutions for this purpose are (or will become)
   available.

   It should be noted that monitoring energy consumption and power
   states itself is obviously not in itself a means to reduce the energy
   consumption of a device.  On the contrary, it likely will slightly
   increase the power consumption of a device.  However, the acquired
   information is required to enable measures that in total lead to
   energy savings.

   It should further be noted that active power control is complimentary
   (but essential) to other energy savings measures such as low power
   electronics, energy saving protocols (e.g. 802.3az), and energy-
   efficient device design (for example, stand-by and low-power modes
   for individual components of a device), and energy-efficient network
   architectures.  Measurement of energy consumption may also provide
   input for developing these technologies.


2.  Monitoring Requirements

2.1.  Target Devices

   Considering the basic objective described in the previous section,
   energy monitoring should be applied to all components of a
   communication network including routers, switches, middleboxes,
   hosts, etc.

   Typically, the total power consumption of hosts is much larger than



Quittek, et al.          Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   the total consumption of all other kinds of network devices, but
   still the contribution of routers, switches, and middleboxes, etc. is
   not negligible.  Therefore, monitoring capabilities should be
   provided for all kinds of network devices.

   Monitoring support should also be provided for certain components
   that do not have means for measuring energy consumption by
   themselves, but for which their power supply can be monitored by
   other devices.  For examples see section Section 2.3.

2.2.  Granularity

   Often it is desirable to switch off individual components of a device
   but not the entire device.  The switch may need to continue serving a
   few ports (for example, the ports serving an email server or needed
   for server backup), but most other ports could be entirely switched
   off under some policies (for example at night or the weekend in an
   office).

   As illustrated by this example, it is often desirable to monitor
   power state and energy consumption on a granularity level that is
   finer than just the device level.  Monitoring should be available for
   individual components of devices, such as line cards, processor
   cards, hard drives, etc.  For example, for IP routers the following
   list of views of a router gives an idea of components that
   potentially should be monitored individually:
   o  physical view: chassis (or stack), central control engine, line
      cards, service cards, etc.
   o  component view: CPU, ASICs, fans, power supply, ports (single
      ports and port groups), storage and memory
   o  feature view: L2 forwarding, L3 routing, security features, load
      balancing features, network management, etc.
   o  logical view: system, data-plane, control-plane, etc.
   o  relationship view: line cards, ports and the correlation between
      transmission speed and power consumption, relationship of system
      load and total power consumption

   Instrumentation for measuring energy consumption of a device is
   potentially much more expensive than instrumentation for retrieving
   the devices power state.  It may be a reasonable compromise in many
   cases to provide power state information for all individually
   switchable components of a device separately, while the energy
   consumption is only measured for the entire device.

2.3.  Remote and Aggregated Monitoring

   Often it is sufficient and more cost efficient having a single device
   measuring and providing power state and energy consumption



Quittek, et al.          Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   information not just for itself but also for several further devices
   that are in some way attached to it.  If the measuring and reporting
   device has access to individual power supply lines for each device,
   then it can measure energy consumption per device.  If it only has
   access to a joint power supply for several devices, then it will
   measure aggregated values.

   One example for the first case is a switch acting as power sourcing
   equipment for several IP phones using Power over Ethernet (PoE).  The
   switch can measure the power consumption for each phone individually
   at the port the phone is connected to.  The phones do not need to
   provide means for energy consumption measurement and reporting by
   themselves.

   Another example is a smart meter that just measures and reports the
   energy transmitted through attached electric cables.  Such a smart
   meter can be used to monitor energy consumption of an individual
   device if connected to the devices' individual power supply.  But in
   many common cases it measures the aggregated energy consumption of
   several devices, for example, as part of an uninterruptible power
   supply (UPS) that serves several devices at a single power cord, or
   as a smart electric meter for a set of machines in a rack, in an
   office building or at a residence.

2.4.  Required Information

   This section lists requirements for information to be retrieved.
   Because of the different nature of power state monitoring and energy
   consumption monitoring, these are discussed separately.  In addition,
   a section on battery monitoring is included which again comes with a
   set of very different requirements.

   Not all of the individual requirements listed in subsections below
   are equally relevant.  A classification into 'required' and
   'optional' is still in progress.

2.4.1.  Power State Monitoring

   The power state of a device or component typically can only have a
   small number of discrete values such as, for example, full power, low
   power, standby, hibernating, off.  However, some of these states may
   have one or more sub-states or state parameters.  For example, in low
   power state, a reduced clock rate may be set to a large number of
   different values.  For the device power state, the following
   information is considered to be relevant:






Quittek, et al.          Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   o  the current state - the time of the last change
   o  the cause for the last transition
   o  time to transit from one stage to another
   o  the total time spent in each state
   o  the duration of the last period spent in each state
   o  the number of transitions to each state
   o  the current power source
   If the number of discreet sub-states is small, then is may be
   desirable to collect the same information as listed above for the
   main device state.

   For state parameters with many potential values, other information is
   more relevant:
   o  the current parameter value(s)
   o  the time of the last change (if parameters are to be adapted
      continuously)
   o  the average value(s) per state
   o  the standard deviation from the mean value(s) per state
   o  the number of policy-based changes of the parameter(s) (if not
      expected to be too many)

   For some network management tasks it may be desirable to receive
   notifications from devices when components or the entire device
   change their power state.

2.4.2.  Energy Consumption Monitoring

   Different to the power state, energy consumption of a device or a
   device's component is a quantity for which the value may change
   continuously.  Therefore, the information that needs to be retrieved
   concerning this quantity is quite different:
   o  the current real power (energy consumption rate) averaged over a
      short time interval
   o  total energy consumption
   o  energy consumption since the last report or for the last
      configured time interval
   o  total energy consumption per power state
   o  energy consumption per power state since the last report
   For some network management tasks it may be desirable to receive
   notifications from devices when the current power consumption of a
   component or of the entire device exceeds or falls below certain
   thresholds.

   For some network management tasks it is required to measure the power
   over time with a relatively high time resolution.  In such a case not
   just single values for the current power of a component is needed,
   but a series of power values reporting on consecutive time intervals.




Quittek, et al.          Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   In order to put measured data into perspective, the precision of the
   measured data, i.e. the potential error in the measured data, needs
   to be known as well.

2.4.3.  Battery State Monitoring

   An increasing number of networked devices are expected to be battery
   powered.  This includes e.g. smart meters that report meter readings
   and are installed in places where external power supply is not always
   possible or costly.  But also other devices might have internal/
   external batteries to power devices for short periods of time when
   the main power fails, to power parts of the device when the main
   device is switches off etc.  Knowing the state of these batteries is
   important for the operation of these devices and includes information
   such as:
   o  the current charge of the battery
   o  the age of the battery
   o  the state of the battery (e.g. being re-charged)
   o  last usage of the battery
   o  maximum energy provided by the battery
   It is possible for devices that are only battery-powered to send
   notifications when the current battery charge has dropped below a
   certain threshold in order to inform the management system of needed
   replacement.  The same applies for the age of a battery.


3.  Monitoring Models

   Monitoring of power states and energy consumption can be performed in
   pull mode (for example, SNMP GET [RFC3410]) or in push mode (for
   example SNMP notification [RFC3410], Syslog [RFC5424], or IPFIX
   [RFC5101]).

   Pull mode monitoring is often easier to handle for a network
   management systems, because it can determine when it gets certain
   information from a certain device.  However, the overhead of pull
   model monitoring is typically higher than for push model monitoring,
   particularly when large numbers of values are to be collected, such
   as time series of power values.

   In such cases, push model monitoring may be preferable with a device
   sending a data stream of values without explicit request for each
   value from the network management system.  For notifications on
   events, only the push model is considered to be appropriate.

   Applying these considerations to the required information leads to
   the conclusion that most of the information can appropriately be
   reported using the pull model.  The only exceptions are notifications

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   on power state changes and high volume time series of energy
   consumption values.


4.  Existing Standards

   This section analyzes existing standards for energy consumption and
   power state monitoring.  It shows that there are already several
   standards that cover some part of the requirements listed above, but
   even all together do not cover all of the requirements.

4.1.  Existing IETF Standards

   There are already RFCs available that address a subset of the
   requirements.

4.1.1.  ENTITY STATE MIB

   RFC 4268 [RFC4268] defines the ENTITY STATE MIB module.
   Implementations of this module provide information on entities
   including the standby status (hotStandby, coldStandby,
   providingService), the operational status (disabled, enabled,
   testing), the alarm status (underRepair, critical, major, minor,
   warning), and the usage status (idle, active, busy).  This
   information is already useful as input to policy decisions and for
   other network monitoring tasks.  However, it cover only a small
   subset of the requirements for power state monitoring and it does not
   provide means for energy consumption monitoring.  For relating
   provided information to components of a device, the ENTITY STATE MIB
   module makes use of the means provided by the ENTITY MIB module
   [RFC4133].

4.1.2.  ENTITY SENSOR MIB

   RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module.
   Implementations of this module offer a generic way to provide data
   collected by a sensor.  A sensor could be an energy consumption meter
   delivering measured values in Watt.  This could be used for reporting
   current power of a device and its components.  Furthermore, the
   ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the precision of the used
   power meter.

   However, there is no unit available for reporting energy quantities,
   such as, for example, watt seconds or kilowatt hours.

   Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module
   makes use of the means provided by the ENTITY MIB module [RFC4133]
   for relating provided information to components of a device.

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


4.1.3.  UPS MIB

   RFC 1628 [RFC1628] defines the UPS MIB module.  Implementations of
   this module provide information on the current real power of devices
   attached to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) device.  This
   application would require to identify which device is attached to
   which port of the UPS device.

4.1.4.  POWER ETHERNET MIB

   Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER ETHERNET MIB
   module defined in RFC3621 [RFC3621] provide information on the
   current power of individual devices that receive Power over Ethernet
   (PoE).  The information can be retrieved at the power sourcing
   equipment.  Like for the UPS MIB, it is required to identify which
   device is attached to which port of the power source equipment.

4.2.  Existing standards of other bodies

4.2.1.  DMTF

   The DMTF has defined a power state management profile [DMTF.DSP1027]
   that is targeted at computer systems.  It is based on the DMTF's
   Common Information Model (CIM) and rather a device profile than an
   actual energy consumption monitoring standard.

   The power state management profile is used to describe and to manage
   the power state of computer systems.  This includes e.g. means to
   change the power state of a device (e.g. to shutdown the device)
   which is an aspect of but not sufficient for active energy
   managagement.


5.  Suggested Actions

   Based on the analysis of requirements in section Section 2 and the
   discussion of monitoring models in section Section 3 this memo
   proposes to develop a standard for pull-based monitoring of power
   state montoring and energy consumption.  Particularly, it suggest to
   develop a MIB module for this purpose.  Such a MIB module could also
   cover push-based reporting of power state changes using SNMP
   notification.  The analysis of existing MIB modules in the previous
   section shows that they are not sufficient to meet the requirements
   discussed in section Section 2.

   The only aspect that is not covered well by a MIB/SNMP solution is
   the reporting of large time series of energy consumption values.  For
   this purpose SNMP does not appear to be an optimal choice.

Internet-Draft      Requirements for Power Monitoring       October 2009


   Particularly for supporting smart meter functionality, a push-based
   protocol appears to be more appropriate.  Within the IP protocol
   family the Syslog and IPFIX protocols seem to be the most suitable
   candidates.  There are more standard protocols with the capability to
   transfer measurement series, for example, DIAMETER, but these
   protocols are designed and well suited for other application areas
   than network monitoring.

   Comparing the two candidates (Syslog and IPFIX), IPFIX seems to be
   the better suited one.  While Syslog is optimized for the
   transmission of text messages, IPFIX is better equipped for
   tranmitting sequences of numerical values.  Encoding numerical values
   into syslog is well feasible, see, for example, the mapping of SNMP
   notifications to Syslog messages in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-syslog-snmp],
   but IPFIX provides better means.  With the extensible IPFIX
   information model [RFC5102] no protocol extension would be required
   for transmitting energy consumption information.  Only a set of new
   information elements would need to be registered at IANA.  However,
   this memo suggest that the definition of such information elements
   should be conducted within the IETF and they should be documented in
   a standards track RFC.
