Abstract 

   Optical networks which support a large number of emerging 
   applications, such as 5G, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of 
   things, autonomous driving, etc., play an increasingly important 
   role in the current world. All the time spectrum resources in 
   optical networks have been treated equally. All spectrum resources 
   form a resource pool which is allocated to applications bit by bit 
   until it is all used up. Although this pattern reduces the 
   complexity of resource maintenance, it has poor flexibility and high 
   operation complexity for different types of applications. This draft 
   proposes a framework of centralized control and distributed function 
   slicing for fast connection establishment and fault recovery in 
   optical networks. The proposed framework divides all spectrum 
   resources into four functional areas, i.e., optical channel area, 
   fault recovery area, resource pool area, and the reserved functional 
   area. A functional area is responsible for a specific network 
   function. This framework improves the flexibility of optical 
   networks and can achieve fast connection establishment and fault 
   recovery for the request with a highest service level.

1. Introduction 
   This document describes the framework of centralized control and 
   distributed function slicing for fast connection establishment and 
   fault recovery in optical networks. Recently, a large number of 
   emerging applications, such as 5G, Cloud Computing, Big Data, 
   Internet of things, autonomous driving, etc., are emerging. Optical 
   networks which take advantages of large-capacity, high-speed, and 
   low energy consumption play an increasingly important role while 
   accommodating these applications. Meanwhile, optical networks have 
   been developed gradually from the point-to-point transmission to 
   multi-layer and multi-domain networking. In the process of 
   development, some important architectures and protocols have been 
   proposed, such as automatically switched optical network (ASON), 
   generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS), path computation 
   element (PCE), software defined optical network (SDON), etc. ASON is 
   to facilitate fast configuration of both switched and soft permanent 
   connections. The GMPLS protocol is proposed to realize the control 
   plane. The PCE is proposed to conduct the constraint-based light-
   path computation in multi-domain and multi-layer optical networks 
   [Pao2013]. SDON adopts the centralized control mode and supports 
   multiple novel applications such as bandwidth on demand (BoD), 
   virtual optical network (VON), dynamic path protection, etc 
   [Thy2016]. These architectures and protocols help to reduce the 
   operation complexity of optical networks. However, all the time 
   spectrum resources for these architectures and protocols have been 
   treated equally. For example, when a user request arrives, spectrum 
   resources are equally allocated whether this request has a high 
   service level or not. No matter the request has a high service level 
   or a low high service level, the control plane equally conducts the 
   process of routing and spectrum allocation. In other words, all 
   spectrum resources form a resource pool which is equally allocated 
   to applications bit by bit until it is all used up. Although this

Internet-Draft Centralized Control and Distributed Function Slicing for 
Fast Connection Establishment and Fault Recovery in Optical Networks  
                                 November 2020 
    

   pattern reduces the complexity of resource maintenance, it has poor 
   flexibility and high operation complexity for different types of 
   applications. For example, the establishment and removal of an end-
   to-end light-path is implemented by the centralized controller in 
   SDONs. When a user request arrives at an optical network, the 
   controller needs to compute the path and distribute the cross 
   connection message by southbound protocol for optical networks. The 
   process will consume a lot of time and is difficult to achieve the 
   fast connection establishment. For some user requests with the 
   highest service level, this time consumption may be intolerable. If 
   some light-paths or light-trees are pre-established, then these 
   light-paths can be used directly. This new mechanism can save a lot 
   of path computation time for some services with the highest level. 
   This draft proposes a framework of centralized control and 
   distributed function slicing for fast connection establishment and 
   fault recovery in optical networks. The proposed framework divides 
   all spectrum resources into four functional areas. A functional area 
   is a range of spectrum in the resource pool. Some particular pre-
   configured functions have been reserved in each functional area. A 
   functional area or multiple functional areas can be allocated to an 
   application. The first functional area is the optical channel area 
   in which a group of light-paths or light-trees have already been 
   established and can be used directly. The second functional area is 
   the fault recovery area in which all interrupted light-paths or 
   light-trees are recovered in this area. The third functional area is 
   the resource pool area where spectrum resources are allocated to 
   applications equally. The fourth functional area is the reserved 
   functional area where new function can be explored in this area. 
   This framework improves the flexibility of optical networks and can 
   achieve fast connection establishment and fault recovery.

3. Motivation of Centralized Control and Distributed Function Slicing 
   All the time spectrum resources in optical networks have been 
   treated equally. All spectrum resources form a resource pool which 
   is used in the same way. Although this pattern reduces the 
   complexity of resource maintenance, it has poor flexibility and high 
   operation complexity for different types of applications. It is 
   difficult to achieve fast connection establishment and fault 
   recovery based on this organization form of spectrum resources. The 
   disadvantage of SDON is decoupling the control function from 
   physical optical devices. The next research will focus on how to 
   make better use of all spectrum resources. Therefore, in order to 
   resolve this problem, this draft proposes a framework of centralized 
   control and distributed function slicing for fast connection 
   establishment and fault recovery in optical networks. It divides all 
   spectrum resources into four functional areas, i.e., optical channel 
   area, fault recovery area, resource pool area, and the reserved 
   functional area. A functional area is responsible for a specific 
   network function, especially for fast connection establishment and 
   fault recovery. This framework improves the flexibility of optical 
   networks and can achieve fast connection establishment and fault 
   recovery for the request with a highest service level. From the 
   perspective of time consuming of connection establishment and fault 
   recovery, the centralized control and distributed function slicing 
   framework will get enormous benefits.

        Figure 1 Centralized Control and Distributed Function Slicing 
   Figure 1 shows the framework of centralized control and distributed 
   function slicing. It contains two parts, i.e., control plane and 
   physical plane. Control plane is realized by a centralized 
   controller. Being different from conventional controller, this 
   controller supports the lightweight operating on some functional 
   areas. Therefore, conventional complex operations can be simplified. 
   All spectrum resources in physical plane are divided into four 
   functional areas, i.e., optical channel area, fault recovery area, 
   resource pool area, and the reserved functional area. Figure 2 
   presents four functional areas. Since physical plane contains 
   different types of resources, this draft only focus on spectrum 
   resource slicing. A functional area is responsible for a specific 
   network function. For the optical channel area, some optical 
   channels have been already established. These optical channels can 
   be used directly without routing and spectrum allocation. Therefore, 
   only lightweight operating is required in the optical channel area.

   This area supports fast connection establishment. The fault recovery 
   area can continue to be divided into sub-area. When faults occur in 
   the optical networks, all interrupted services can be recovered in 
   these sub-areas in parallel. It avoids the traffic congestion caused 
   by resource competition. This area supports fast fault recovery. For 
   the resource pool area, all spectrum resources are treated equally 
   and can be allocated to applications bit by bit until it is all used 
   up. For the reserved functional area, this area is reserved for 
   developing other novel network functions.

4.2. Optical Channel Area 

   In the optical channel area, some optical channels have been already 
   established. These optical channels can be used directly. The type 
   and the number of established optical channels are determined by the 
   real network environment. Each established optical channels contain 
   four parts, i.e., source, destination, bandwidth, and path.

4.3. Fault Recovery Area 
   The fault recovery area is divided into multiple sub-areas. When 
   faults occur in the optical networks, all interrupted services can 
   be recovered in these sub-areas in parallel. It avoids the traffic 
   congestion caused by resource competition. This area supports fast 
   fault recovery.

              Figure 3 Multiple Sub-Areas in Fault Recovery Area 
   Once a fault occurs in an optical network, all interrupted services 
   are sorted and organized into several groups. Each group is 
   allocated to a sub-area. These groups can conduct service recovery 
   in parallel. Therefore, the fault recovery area supports fast fault 
   recovery. 
4.4. Resource Pool Area 

   In the resource pool area, all spectrum resources are treated 
   equally and can be allocated to applications bit by bit until it is 
   all used up. 
4.5. Reserved Functional Area 

   This area is reserved for developing other novel network functions.
