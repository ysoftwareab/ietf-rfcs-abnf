2.  Introduction

   The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation
   Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM) [RFC3761] transforms E.164
   [E164] numbers into DNS names and the use of DNS services like
   delegation through NS records, and use of NAPTR records in DNS.
   Using this system, one can look up what services are available for a
   specific domain name in a decentralized way with distributed
   management of the different levels in the lookup process.

   IAX [ID-IAX] is an "all in one" protocol for handling streaming media
   in Internet Protocol (IP) networks.  IAX combines both control and
   media services in the same stream which decreases bandwidth usage and
   allows for Network Address Translation (NAT) transparency.  These
   design decisions have made IAX accel at handling Internet telephony.
   The 'iax2:' URI scheme is also defined in the IAX protocol document.

   This document registers the IAX2 Enumservice according to the
   guidelines given in RFC3761 [RFC3761] to be used for provisioning in
   the services field of a NAPTR resource record to indicate what class
   of functionality a given end point offers.  The registration is
   defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System
   [RFC3401] [RFC3402] [RFC3403] [RFC3404] ) hierarchy, for use with the
   "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC3761.  [RFC3761]

3.  IAX2 Service Registration

   Enumservice Name: "IAX2"

   Enumservice Type: "iax"

   Enumservice Subtype: N/A

   URI Scheme: "iax2:"

   Functional Specification:

      The IAX2 Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
      associated URI scheme is capable of being contacted using the IAX2
      protocol to provide a communication session.

      A client selecting this NAPTR will have support for originating a
      call utilizing the IAX2 protocol [ID-IAX].

   Security Considerations:

      There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.
      However, the general considerations of Section 5 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author:

      Ed Guy (For contact detail, see the Authors' Address section
      below)

      None

4.  Examples

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

   $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax" "!^.*$!iax2:example.com/charlie!"

   The next example demonstrates that the domain
   3.8.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa. is preferably contacted by IAX2,
   secondly via SIP, and then H.323 for voice, and lastly by SMTP for
   messaging.  Note that the tokens "iax", "sip", "h323", and "msg" are
   Types registered (or to be registered) with IANA, and they have no
   implicit connection with the protocols or URI schemes with the same
   names.

   In each case, the next step in the resolution process is to use the
   resolution mechanism appropriate to each of the protocols, (specified
   by the URI schemes iax, sip, h323 and mailto).

   $ORIGIN 3.8.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @ IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax" "!^.*$!iax2:example.com/mccarthy!" .
   @ IN NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+sip" "!^.*$!sip:mccarthy@example.com!" .
   @ IN NAPTR 10 101 "u" "E2U+h323" "!^.*$!h323:mccarthy@example.com!" .
   @ IN NAPTR 10 102 "u" "E2U+msg" "!^.*$!mailto:mccarthy@example.com!"
   .

5.  Security Considerations

   The IAX Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues beyond
   any already present in the DNS and IAX protocols except that this
   Enumservice provides another fact that may be harvested and possibly
   exploited.

   The use of DNSSEC [RFC2535] is recommended to improve operational
   security.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the "iax" Enumservice with no
   sub-types according to the guidelines and specifications in RFC 3761
   [RFC3761] and the definitions in this document.
