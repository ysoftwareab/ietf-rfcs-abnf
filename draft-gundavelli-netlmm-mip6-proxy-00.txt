Abstract

   Localized Mobility Management (LMM) requires mobility support for a
   mobile station within a restricted and topologically localized
   portion of the network.  Mobile IPv6 is a standardized mobility
   protocol for IPv6 that can be extended to address the local mobility
   management requirements.  This document describes a solution based on
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 scheme by introducing new functional entities and
   extensions to the protocol and by restricting the mobility signaling
   to only certain entities in the network.

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


1.  Introduction

   The need for Localized Mobility Management is justified in [5] and
   the issues are identified in [4].  In brief, a solution is needed to
   provide mobility for a Mobile Station that minimizes handover
   latency, avoids signaling overhead on the air-link, and hides
   handover event within LMM domain from global mobility.  These
   objectives should be achieved without host support in the mobility
   signaling or complex security interactions between the host and
   network.

   The solution described in this document accomplishes the feats by
   introducing a proxy Mobility Agent, called Mobile Proxy Agent (MPA),
   that signals to a Local Mobility Agent Point (a.k.a.  Home Agent) to
   set up a tunnel between them for traffic to and from the Mobile
   Station.  An crude analogy is a Mobile Router - which happens to be
   the fixed Access Router with MPA function - that registers a Host-
   Specific-Prefix (i.e. ::/128) to its Home Agent whenever the Mobile
   Router detects a Local Fixed Node with a different prefix than the
   attached Mobile Network Prefix [14].  In this case, the host has no
   idea that it is moving.  In actuality, the MPA is spoofing the host
   (to believe that it remains on the same network) and updating the
   host's location to the Local Mobility Agent Point, a node that is
   typically dynamically assigned by the network to be near the host.

      The following new terminology and abbreviations are introduced in
      this document and all other general mobility related terms as
      defined in Mobile IPv6 specification [2].

      Mobility Station (MS)

         Any IPv6 host that has the ability to physically roam across
         different networks.  The Mobile Station is not required to have
         the Mobile IPv6 protocol stack.

      Local Mobility Anchor Point (LMAP)

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


         The Mobile IPv6 entity which functions as a local Home Agent to
         anchor data traffic for a Mobile Station.

      Mobility Proxy Agent (MPA)

         The Mobile IPv6 entity that offers proxy mobility service for a
         Mobile Station by performing registration function on the
         host's behalf.  The MPA function is provided by the Access
         Router, which the Mobile Station is attached to in the access
         network.

      Base Station (BS)

         A Layer 2 bridging device connected to the MPA offering
         wireless connectivity to the Mobile Station.

      Local Network Prefix (LNP)

         The network prefix that is assigned to a mobile station in a
         LMM domain.  This prefix is attached to the interface of the
         Mobile Station's LMA.  Note that the LNP is analogous to the
         Home Link Prefix in MIPv6.

      Local Address (LoA)

         The address that is owned by the Mobile Station in a LMM
         domain.  The address belongs to the prefix owned by the Mobile
         Station's LMAP.  The Mobile Station will be able to use this
         address for roaming within the LMM domain.  Note that the LoA
         is analogous to the Home Address in MIPv6.

      Local Home Network (LHN)

         The Mobile Station in a LMM domain is logically anchored to a
         LMAP and the Local Address of the Mobile Station belongs to a
         prefix owned by the LMA.  The prefix is attached to the
         interface of the LMAP and that is the Local Home Network for
         the Mobile Station.  Note that the LHN is analogous to the Home
         Link in MIPv6.

      Proxy Binding Update (PBU)

         A Binding Update message from the MPA instructing the Mobile
         Station's LMAP to register the current location information.

      Proxy Binding Acknowledgment(PBA)

         response to the PBU message.



3.  Overview of Proxy Mobile IPv6

3.1.  Design Goals

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is designed to satisfy the requirements of LMM [5].
   In addition, the solution leverages well-studied specification and
   highly available implementations.  Only incremental enhancements are
   added to Mobile IPv6 protocol to enrich its breadth to support both
   global mobility and local mobility.  For example, a Home Agent can
   anchor Mobile Stations roaming within an LMM domain and Mobile Nodes
   roaming into other domains.

   The Localized Mobility Management solution defined in this document
   has the following design goals:

      1.  Handover Performance Improvement

      The Layer 1 and Layer 2 issues involved in handover should be
      covered in IEEE 802.21 which interacts with the IETF Detecting
      Network Attachment WG.  It is assumed that these layers can
      provide optimized handover performance, and such functions are
      outside the scope of this document.

      From the network layer perspective, the Mobile Station is always
      authenticated when accessing the network (ASSUMPTION).  When
      authentication completes for access or handover, this triggers the
      MPA to notify the LMAP.  The important factor is the proximity of
      the LMAP to the MPA.  In this scheme, the LMAP is dynamically
      assigned based on the location of the MS.  The AAA Server can
      index the MPA's address to find the nearest LMAP for assignment,
      or the MPA is provisioned with its nearest LMAP, or some other
      scheme.  Further optimization such as MPA to MPA tunneling is not
      required in the base LMM solution.

      2.  Reduction in Handover-related Signaling Volume

      Mobility-related signaling over the air-link is eliminated.  The
      Mobile Station performs normal IPv6 network attachment activities
      and learns that it remains on the same network, the Local Home
      Network which is anchored by LMAP.

      3.  Location Privacy

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


      The corresponding nodes that are communicating or have established
      flows with the Mobile Station must not be able to determine the
      current location information of the Mobile Station.  Since the
      LMAP is anchoring the Local Address, movement within the LMM
      domain is hidden from the corresponding node.

      4.  Efficient Use of Wireless Resources

      There is no mobility signaling or tunneling header on the air-
      link.  All signaling and tunneling are inside the network and only
      the original packet traverse the air-link.

      5.  Reduction of Signaling Overhead in the Network

      When a Mobile Station moves to a new MPA, the minimal number of
      messages are used to update the location on the LMAP and release
      the resources on the previous MPA.  Due to the event driven states
      (e.g.  MS is at MPA or arrived at another MPA), there is no need
      for chatty binding refresh messages.  This method can
      significantly reduce the number of signaling messages compared to
      Mobile IPv6.

      6.  No Extra Security Between the Mobile Node and Network

      Because the Mobile Station is not participating in the mobility
      signaling, there is no need to set up any security credentials to
      mobility authorization.  The network nodes, MPA and LMAP, are in
      the same LMM domain and securing the signaling is simplified.

      7.  Support for Heterogeneous Wireless Link Technologies

      Proxy Mobile IPv6 is based on a heterogeneous mobility protocol.

      8.  Support for Unmodified Hosts

      The Mobile Station should use DHCP to obtain an IP address and
      network prefix and operate as a compliant IPv6 host.  The MPA and
      LMAP spoofs the MS to believe it is stationary, while allowing
      movement within the LMM network.

      9.  Support for IPv4 and IPv6

      Another advantage of leveraging a standard protocol is adapting
      new ideas which goes through judicious debates in a public forum.
      Supporting an IPv4 host with Proxy Mobile IPv6 involves adapting
      the works in [14].

3.2.  LMM Domain Architecture

   The following illustration represents the LMM Domain model.  A LMM
   domain have the following properties:

      a.  A LMM domain is a topologically localized portion of the
      network.  Movement by the Mobile Station within a LMM domain will
      get full mobility support and the mobility agents in the LMM
      network exchange control messages for mobility without the need
      for the MS to participate in the signaling.

      b.  As the Mobile Station move outside the boundary of the LMM
      domain, global mobility is required.  The Mobile Station can
      function as a Mobile Node in accordance to Mobile IPv6 [2].

      d.  Each Mobile Station in its home LMM domain is anchored by a
      LMAP.  The security credentials and the policy data for it will be
      typically managed by a AAA Server residing locally in that LMM
      domain.  When a Mobile Station moves out of its LMM domain, it may
      be assigned a new LMAP in the visiting domain and that entity will
      manage the mobility within the new LMM domain.

      e.  Each LMM domain will have the following functional elements,
      LMAP, MPA, MS and AAA.

      The following illustrates a LMM domain model:

3.3.  New Functional Elements

   The LMM scheme introduces two new functional elements, Local Mobility
   Anchor Point (LMAP) and Mobility Proxy Agent (MPA).  The following
   section explains the scope and the role of these entities.

   Local Mobility Anchor Point

      LMAP functionally is a MIPv6 Home Agent as per the base Mobile
      IPv6 specification [3].  It is the logical anchor point for the
      Mobile Station.  The Local Address of the Mobile Station belongs
      to the Local Network Prefix owned by the LMAP.  When the Mobile
      Station is roaming in the LMM network, its LMAP intercepts all

      packets destined to the Mobile Station and tunnels them to its
      attached MPA.  The packets from the MS are decapsulated and routed
      normally.


   Mobile Proxy Agent

      The MPA is the Proxy Mobility Agent.  This is the entity that
      enables the Mobile Station on one of its link to use the assigned
      Local Address and roam in the LMM network without having to
      participate in mobility related signaling.  It registers the
      location of the MS to the LMAP and establishes a tunnel for
      receiving packets sent to the Mobile Station.  Packets from the MS
      are put into the tunnel to the LMAP.

   Figure 3: Proxy Binding Update Message



   A new flag, the 'P' flag, is added to the Binding Update message.
   The P flag indicates that the registration is a Proxy registration.
   When a MPA sends a registration with the LMAP, the P flag MUST be set
   to 1 indicate to the LMAP that this registration is a proxy
   registration sent by a MPA on behalf of a Mobile Station.

   Binding Update sent by the MPA when it does not know the Local
   Address of the Mobile Station.  Typically, this happens after network
   access authentication informs that the Mobile Station arrived at the
   MPA and triggers the registration.



5.  Error Codes

5.1.  Binding Acknowledgement Status Values

   The following status code values are defined for using them in the
   Binding Acknowledgement message when using LMM protocol.

   140: Proxy Registration not supported

   141: Binding Cache Entry missing

   The value allocation for this usage needs to be approved by the IANA
   and must be updated in the IANA registry.



6.  Proxy Mobile IPv6

   This section describes Local Mobility Management using Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 support.  In this model, a Mobile Station roaming in a LMM
   network is not involved in any mobility related signaling.

   The following sequence of steps happens when a Mobile Station
   attaches to the network: network access authentication and
   authorization, Router and Neighbor Discovery, and address
   acquisition.

   During network access authentication, the MPA obtains the Mobile
   Station's profile from the AAA server.  The attributes may include
   the IP address and virtual MAC address of the LMAP, Local Network
   Prefix (for dynamic LMAP resolution), assigned Local Address, and
   DHCP server.

   The MPA attempts to register the Mobile Station with its LMAP
   immediately after successful network access authentication and when
   the address acquisition is detected.  A Mobile Station that boots up
   on the network will be anchored after obtaining a Local Address.
   Whereas a roaming Mobile Station's location is registered when
   network access authentication completes.  Mobility support for the
   Mobile Station is achieved by the registration message exchange
   between MPA and LMAP.

   For Router and Neighbor Discovery, the Mobile Station is spoofed by
   the MPA to be on the same link, which is the Local Network Prefix,
   when attached to the LMM network even if the MPA changed during
   handovers.  The virtual LMAP MAC address is used by the MPA in Router
   Advertisement and Neighbor Advertisement to the Mobile Station.  The
   Router Advertisement contains the Local Network Prefix.

   There are several methods for the Mobile Station to obtain an IP
   address: manual configuration, stateless auto-configuration, and
   stateful DHCP.  For DHCP, the MPA tags the DHCP Request with the
   Local Network Prefix to ensure address allocation from the designated
   address pool.  When DHCP Reply is received, the MPA registers the
   assigned IP address as the Local Address with the LMAP.  For
   stateless auto-configuration, the MPA registers the IP address when
   Neighbor Solicit DAD message is received from the Mobile Station.  In
   addition, any packet from the Mobile Station can trigger a
   registration with Local Address set to the Source IP address.  This
   would be the same case for manually configured MS.  Typically, this
   type of trust relationship with the Mobile Station (i.e. allowing MS
   to dictate its Local Address) would not be permitted or only when
   authorized by the AAA server.

   When the Mobile Station obtains an IP address (used for all
   communication sessions), the tunnel between MPA and LMAP is set up.
   All packets sent to the Mobile Station from the corresponding nodes
   will get intercepted at the LMAP and tunneled to the MPA, the MPA
   will decapsulate the packet and forward to the MN.  Any packets sent
   to the corresponding node from the Mobile Station will get
   intercepted at the MPA and will be tunneled to the LMAP, where the
   packet is decapsulated the packet before being routed to the
   corresponding node.

   The network access authentication and authorization procedure permits
   a valid Mobile Station connectivity in the network.  Upon successful
   authentication by the AAA server, the MPA retrieves the MS's profile
   containing NAI and the assigned LMAP (steps #1 through #5).  It's
   possible that such information is obtained by some other methods, but
   that is out of scope of this document.  Note that the LMAP is on the
   Local Network Prefix, so Once the NAI of the Mobile Station and
   assigned LMAP are known, the MPA sends a Proxy Binding Update to the
   LMAP (in step #6).  The message includes the Mobile Node Identifier
   Option [11] to deliver the NAI information to the LMAP.  If the Local
   Address or Local Network Prefix is assigned by the AAA server, the
   Assigned Home Address Option [10]is also included in the Proxy
   Binding Update.  Otherwise, the Binding Cache Confirmation Option is
   appended in the message to request the LMAP to check if BCE exists
   (indexed by the NAI) for the Mobile Station (in step #7).  In the
   case of Home Address Option, the LMAP creates or updates the BCE and
   sets up tunnel to the MPA for the Mobile Station before acknowledging
   the MPA.  When Binding Cache Confirmation Option is received, the
   LMAP checks if the BCE exists or not.  If the BCE is found, the LMAP
   adds the Assigned Home Address Option to the successful Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement.  Otherwise, the error code "Binding Cache Entry
   missing" is set in the reply message.  The Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement is sent to the MPA (in step #8).  When MPA receives a
   successful reply, the tunnel and routing is set up for the Mobile
   Station (in step #9).  Note when LMAP is on the Local Network Prefix,
   so the MPA is aware of the Local Network Prefix for the Mobile
   Station to partake in the Router and Neighbor Discovery process.

   Figure 7: MPA Behavior in Router and Neighbor Discovery



   Router and Neighbor Discovery between the Mobile Station and MPA is
   different than conventional IPv6 because the MPA is spoofing as the
   LMAP is advertising the Local Network Prefix directly to the Mobile
   Station.  When MS sends Neighbor Solicitation for Link-Local Address
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) [RFC 2462], MPA performs normal DAD
   functions and responds accordingly (in steps #1 through #3).  When
   duplicate addresses are detected on the link, recovery mechanisms are
   specified in RFC 2462.  The Mobile Station sends a Router
   Solicitation to MPA (in step #4).  The MPA sets the link prefix
   information in the advertisement message to the Local Network Prefix
   for the Mobile Station.  The Router Advertisement contains the Prefix
   Information option with the "on-link" (L) flag set to zero to inform
   the Mobile Station to send to packets to the default router, which is
   the LMAP [RFC 2461].  The Router Advertisement is sent directly to
   the MAC address of the Mobile Station (in step #5).  The Mobile
   Station sends Neighbor Solicitation to learn the MAC address of the
   default gateway (i.e.  LMAP).  MPA sends Neighbor Advertisement with
   the virtual MAC address of the LMAP which it uses to receive packets
   from MS.

6.3.  Address Configuration

   The LMM scheme allows the Mobile Station to operate as a normal IPv6

   host using the standard IPv6 address configuration schemes.

   From the Mobile Station's perspective, there are three methods to
   obtain an IP address: manual configuration, DHCP, or stateless auto-
   configuration.

   1.  Manual Configuration:

   In this case, the Local Address, Local Network Prefix, and the LMAP
   address are manually configured on the Mobile Station as the IP
   address, Link Prefix, and Default Gateway, respectively.  The Mobile
   Station does not depend on the Router Advertisements or on DHCP for
   address configuration.  The static IP address of the Mobile Station
   is used for network connectivity.  The configuration must match the
   parameters assigned to the Mobile Station in the LMM network for
   mobility support.  This method is detected by the network in the same
   manner as the stateless auto-configuration.



   2.  Stateless Address Auto Configuration:

   Upon receiving a Router Advertisement with the "Managed" bit not set,
   the Mobile Station (operating as a normal IPv6 host) performs
   Stateless Auto-Configuration to obtain the host configuration.  The
   LMM network detects the IP address of the Mobile Station from DAD or
   IP packets received from the MS.  Figure 8 illustrates this scenario.

   3.  Using DHCPv6 for Address Configuration:

   Upon receiving a Router Advertisement with the "Managed" bit set, the
   Mobile Station (operating as a normal IPv6 host) uses DHCP to obtain
   the host configuration.  The LMM network assigns the IP address using
   AAA server, DHCP server, or LMAP.  When Local Address is assigned by
   a non-DHCP server, renewal still requires DHCP server to interact
   with the DHCP client in the MS.

   (in step #2).  The former option contains the Local Address and the
   latter option contains the NAI.  LMAP creates the BCE and sets up

   Figure 9: Stateful DHCP



   The Mobile Station initiates the DHCP process after link comes up.
   The MPA operates as a normal DHCP Relay Agent and forwards requests
   from the Mobile Station to the DHCP Server.  The DHCP Relay-Forward
   message is tagged with Local Network Prefix information for the DHCP
   Server to assign the IP address from the designated address pool.
   The DHCP server sends DHCP Reply to the MPA, which forwards to the MS
   (in steps #1 through #4).  When MPA learns the assigned IP address,
   it sends a Proxy Binding Update with Assigned Home Address Option and
   Mobile Node Identifier Option (in step #5).  The former option
   contains the Local Address and the latter option contains the NAI.
   LMAP creates the BCE and sets up tunnel for the MS (in step #6).  The
   Proxy Binding Acknowledgement is sent to the MPA (in step #7).

   Figure 10: Binding Revocation for Previous MPA



   MPA which no longer serve the Mobile Station needs to remove any
   associated mobility states and relinquish resources which are no
   longer needed.

   When LMAP receives a Proxy Binding Update for a Mobile Station with
   an existing BCE, a Registration Revocation [13] is sent to the
   previous MPA (in steps #1 through #3).  The MPA removes the visitor
   entry for the Mobile Station before sending acknowledgement to the
   LMAP (in steps #4 and #5).  In parallel, the LMAP sends the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement to the new MAP (in step #6).  At the end of
   sequence of events, only states in the LMM network are in the MPA

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


   where MS is attached and the LMAP.


7.  Mobility Proxy Agent Operation

   The MPA function has two parts.  For data path, MPA provides the same
   role as a Foreign Agent in Mobile IPv4 [RFC 3344].  It encapsulates
   and decapsulates packets to and from the LMAP, respectively.  The
   other function of this entity is to signal to the LMAP to set up the
   tunnel for the data path when the Mobile Station is visiting.

   When the mobile station using a wireless link attaches to a LMM
   network, it attempts to authenticate to the network using the
   enforced Layer-2 authentication protocol and the MPA on the link on
   detecting this new mobile station will trigger the Layer-3 mobility
   signaling.  The MPA on the link will identify the mobile station and
   will download its profile from the Policy Enforcement Point.  The
   profile typically will contain the contain the Local Network Prefix,
   Local Address and the supported IPv6 Address Configuration mode and
   the Default Router on its link.

   Following is the typical configuration that is maintained by the AAA
   server for each Mobile Station:

   1.  NAI

   2.  Authentication Credentials

   3.  LMAP Address

   4.  Local Network Prefix (Optional)

   5.  Local Address (Optional)

   6.  Default Gateway Address (Optional)



   Once the MPA downloads the Mobile Station's profile, it will respond
   to the Router Solicitation messages received from the Mobile Station
   with a Router Advertisement reflecting the Mobile Station's home link
   and thus making the Mobile Station to believe it's on the home link.

7.1.  Conceptual Data Structures at the MPA

   Each MPA must maintain a Visitor List.  Each entry in the list
   represents an attached Mobile Station and its parameters:




Gundavelli & Leung        Expires May 12, 2006                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


   o  The NAI of the Mobile Station.  This is obtained from the network
      access authentication messages.  The NAI is the identifier that
      will be used by the MPA to download the MS's profile.

   o  MAC Address of the Mobile Station, obtained by the MPA during the
      network access authentication procedure.

   o  Local Address of the Mobile Station, obtained by the MS using
      DHCP.  However, the network can assign the Local Address using one
      of the following methods: downloaded from the AAA server along
      with other attributes, assigned by the LMAP in the registration
      process, and learned from DAD sent by the Mobile Station.

   o  Local Network Prefix of the Mobile Station obtained from either
      the AAA or LMAP.

   o  IP address and virtual MAC address of the LMAP obtained from the
      AAA as part of the profile download.

   o  Source address of the tunnel between the MPA and LMAP.  This is
      either the Source Address field in the IPv6 header or by the
      Alternate Care-of Address option, if present in the Proxy Binding
      Update.

   o  Destination address of the tunnel between the MPA and LMAP.  This
      is the Destination Address field in the IPv6 header of the Proxy
      Binding Update.

   o  Registration lifetime that is established with the Mobile
      Station's LMAP.

   o  DHCP Server address assigned by the AAA server.  MPA sends DHCP
      messages to this DHCP Server when the Mobile Station performs
      either stateless or stateful DHCP procedure.

7.2.  Mobility Signaling for Mobile Station

   After network access authentication, MPA sends Proxy Binding Update
   to the LMAP.

   The MPA uses the Local Network Prefix for the Mobile Station to
   advertise the link prefix information to the Mobile Station.  The
   Router Advertisement contains the Prefix Information option with the
   "on-link" (L) flag set to zero to inform the Mobile Station to send
   packets to the default router, which is the LMAP [RFC 2461].

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


7.3.  Establishment of Bi-Directional Tunnel

   After receiving a successful Binding Acknowledgement for the Proxy
   Binding Update, the MPA sets up a tunnel to the Mobile Station's
   LMAP.

   The bi-directional tunnel between the MPA and the LMAP allows packets
   to flow in both directions, while the mobile station is connected to
   its visited link.  The tunnel endpoints are the LMAP and the MPA.
   All IPv6 traffic to and from the Mobile Station is sent through this
   bi-directional tunnel.

   While the MPA is serving a Mobile Station, it MUST be able to
   intercept all packets sent from the Mobile Station and forward them
   out the MPA-LMAP tunnel created for supporting that Mobile Station.

   Any packets received on the tunnel from LMAP, the MPA decapsulates
   before forwarding to the Mobile Station on its link.



8.  Mobile Station Operation


   As per this specification, a mobile station present in a LMM domain
   would function as a normal IPv6 host.  The required behavior of the
   node will be consistent with the base IPv6 specification [1].  The
   mobile station in a LMM domain will have the ability to retain its
   IPv6 address as it moves from one point of network attachment to the
   other with out ever requiring it to participate in any mobility
   related signaling.

   The mobile station when boots up for the first time in a LMM domain,
   would be assigned a Local Home Network prefix and can obtain an IPv6
   address from that Prefix in one or more ways.  Once the mobile
   station obtains an IPv6 address, it will have the ability to move
   with in this LMM network and with out having to obtain a new address.
   The LMM network entities will ensure the mobile station gets seamless
   mobility with in the boundaries of this LMM network.  However, the
   mobile station when roaming across LMM domains MAY use Mobile IPv6
   signaling, if it requires IPv6 mobility.

   As the mobile station roams with in the LMM network, moving from one
   link to the other, it always detects its local home network.  The MPA
   on the attached link emulates the home link behavior for the mobile
   station.  It makes the mobile station believe its on its home link.
   The Router Solicitation messages will result in a Router
   Advertisement with its home prefix, default router and other



Gundavelli & Leung        Expires May 12, 2006                 [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


   configuration parameters that the LMM entities make sure remain
   consistent with the home link properties.  If the node address
   configuration policy on the mobile station's home link requires the
   mobile station to depend on DHCP for obtaining address configuration,
   LMM entities will ensure, the mobile station using DHCP protocol will
   obtain its assigned local address.  Further, the mobile station will
   be able to use the Neighbor discovery protocol as it would on its
   home link.

8.1.  Booting up in a LMM Domain

   When the Mobile Station enters a LMM domain for the first time and
   attaches to a link on the MPA, it will present its identity in the
   form of NAI to the network as part of the network access
   authentication process.  After a succesful authentication, the mobile
   station will send a Router Solicitation message.  The MPA on the link
   will respond to the Router Solicitation message with a Router
   Advertisement.  The Router Advertisement will have the mobile
   station's home prefix, default router and other configuration
   parameters.  The address configuration parameters such as Managed
   Address Configuration, Stateful Configuration flag values will be
   consistent with the home link policy.

   If the Router Advertisement has the Managed Address Configuration
   flag set, the mobile station, as it would normally do, will send a
   DHCP Request and again the LMM entities will ensure, the mobile
   station gets its local address as a lease from the DHCP server.

   If the Router Advertisement does not have the Managed Address
   Configuration flag set, the mobile station can autoconfigure itself
   by appending its link-layer address (EUI-64 format) to the advertised
   local home network prefix.

   Once the address configuration is complete, the Mobile Station will
   always be able to use that IP address anywhere in that LMM domain.
   Further, the Mobile Station may get the same Local Address even after
   a reboot.  In the current context, usage of the word "Local Address"
   is not related to "Link-Local Address", but instead refers to an
   invariant IPv6 address that the Mobile Station owns throughout its
   presence in the LMM domain.


8.2.  Moving to a New MPA

   When a Mobile Station moves to a new MPA from another MPA, the
   following occurs:

   The Mobile Station will perform a network access authentication with



Gundavelli & Leung        Expires May 12, 2006                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


   the attached MPA.  If the authentication fails, the Mobile Station
   will not be able to use the link.  After a succesful authentication,
   the MPA will have the identifier and the other profile data of the
   Mobile Station.

   Once the network access authentication process is complete, the
   Mobile Station sends a multicast Router Solicitation message to the
   All-Routers multicast address on that new link, either using the
   Link-Local address or the using the unspecified address (::) as the
   Source Address in the IPv6 header.

   The Access Router with the MPA function on receiving this Router
   Solicitation message will respond with a Router Advertisement.  The
   reply is sent to the unicast Link-Local Address or All-Nodes
   Multicast Address depending if the Source Address is Link-Local
   Address or unspecified address, respectively.  The Destination
   Address is in compliance to IPv6.  However, the Destination MAC
   address in the Router Advertisement MUST always be set to the Source
   MAC address of the Router Solicitation.

   If the Router Advertisement has the Managed Address Configuration
   flag set, the mobile station, as it would normally do, will send a
   DHCP Request and again the LMM entities will ensure, the mobile
   station gets its local address as a lease from the DHCP server.

   If the Router Advertisement does not have the Managed Address
   Configuration flag set, the mobile station can autoconfigure itself
   by appending its link-layer address (EUI-64 format) to the advertised
   local home network prefix.


8.3.  Packet forwarding

   All packets that are be sent from the Mobile Station to the
   corresponding node will be sent as normal IPv6 packets setting the
   Source Address of the IPv6 header to the Local Address and the
   Destination Address to the corresponding node's IP address.  The
   default gateway for the Mobile Station will always be its LMAP.  The
   Neighbor Cache Entry for LMAP address is a pseudo LMAP MAC address.

   Similarly, all packets sent to the Mobile Node's Local Address by the
   corresponding node will be received by the Mobile Station in the
   original form (without any tunneling overhead) on its link.

   No special operation is required by the Mobile Station to either send
   or receive packets.

8.4.  Moving to a New LMM Domain

   The LMM scheme defined in this document, provides mobility support to
   the Mobile Station within that LMM domain.  Once the Mobile Station
   obtains an assigned Local Address, it can continue to use the same
   address roaming between MPAs in the network with its LMAP providing
   the topological anchor point for that address.  However, the Mobile
   Station while roaming across LMM domains is required to have the
   Mobile IPv6 stack and operate as a normal MIPv6 mobile node to
   achieve mobility across LMM domains.




9.  LMAP Operation

   LMAP is functionally a MIPv6 Home Agent.  It is the topological
   anchor point for the Mobile Station's Local Network Prefix.  When a
   Mobile Station enters a LMM domain for the first time, a LMAP and a
   Local Network Prefix gets assigned to that Mobile Station.  The
   following section explains the LMAP function:



9.1.  Processing Proxy Binding Update


   Upon the receipt of a Proxy Binding Update from a MPA, the LMAP
   checks if the Binding Cache Confirmation Option is included.  If so,
   LMAP looks up the BCE indexed by the NAI.  If BCE exists, LMAP sends
   a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement with Assigned Home Address Option.
   The Local Address in the BCE is set in the appended option.  The
   Local Home Prefix is in the prefix length field of the option.  In
   this case, LMAP updates the Care-of Address in the BCE to the MPA
   that sent the PBU.  If there is no BCE for the MS, then LMAP sends
   PBA with error code "Binding Cache Entry missing" in the message.


9.2.  Packet interceptions

   When the LMAP intercepts a packet sent to the mobile station's home
   address, it tunnels the packet to the attached MPA of the mobile
   station.  The encapsulated packet will contain the following.

   Outer IPv6 Header:






Gundavelli & Leung        Expires May 12, 2006                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               LMM using MIPv6               November 2005


      The source address is the LMAP's address and the destination
      address is the Mobile Station's Care-of Address (i.e. the MPA's
      address).

   Inner IPv6 Header:

      The source address is the corresponding node's address and the
      destination address is the Mobile Station's Local Address.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Mobility Header Option, the Binding Cache
   Confirmation Option.  The type value for this option MUST be assigned
   from the same space used by the mobility options defined in [1].

   This document defines a new flag (P) to the Binding Update and
   Binding Acknowledges messages specified in [2].

   This document also defines new Binding Acknowledgement status values
   as described in Section 4.5.  The status values MUST be assigned from
   the same space used for Binding Acknowledgement status values in [2].



11.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces new mobility entities, LMAP and MPA.  These
   are the entities that are involved in the signaling for providing
   Layer-3 mobility to a Mobile Station.  The protocol requires these
   entities to have established security associations for securing the
   signaling traffic.  The messages MUST be protected by IPSec or using
   an Authentication Option [12].
