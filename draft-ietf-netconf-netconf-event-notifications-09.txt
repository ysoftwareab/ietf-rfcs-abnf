1.  Introduction

   This document provides a binding for events streamed over the NETCONF
   protocol [RFC6241] as per
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  In addition, as
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] is itself built upon
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], this document
   enables a NETCONF client to request and receive updates from a YANG
   datastore located on a NETCONF server.

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                     May 2018


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]: notification
   message, event stream, publisher, receiver, subscriber, subscription,
   configured subscription.

3.  Interleave Capability

   To support multiple subscriptions on a single session, a NETCONF
   publisher MUST support the :interleave capability as defined in
   [RFC5277].  Advertisement of both the :interleave capability and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications" within a
   NETCONF capability exchange MUST indicate that a NETCONF publisher is
   able to receive, process, and respond to NETCONF requests and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] subscription
   operations.

4.  Compatibility with RFC-5277's create-subscription

   A publisher is allowed to concurrently support configured
   subscriptions and dynamic subscription RPCs of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] at the same time as
   [RFC5277]'s "create-subscription" RPC.  However a single NETCONF
   transport session cannot support both this specification and a
   subscription established by [RFC5277]'s "create-subscription" RPC.
   To protect against any attempts to use a single NETCONF transport
   session in this way:

   o  A solution must reply with the [RFC6241] error "operation-not-
      supported" if a "create-subscription" RPC is received on a NETCONF
      session where any other
      [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or [RFC5277]
      subscription exists.
   o  It is a prohibited to send updates or state change notifications
      for a configured subscription on a NETCONF session where the
      create-subscription RPC has successfully [RFC5277] created
      subscription.
   o  A "create-subscription" RPC MUST be rejected if any
      [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
      [RFC5277]subscription is active across that NETCONF transport
      session.

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                     May 2018


   If a publisher supports this specification but not subscriptions via
   [RFC5277], the publisher MUST NOT advertise
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0".

5.  Mandatory XML, event stream and datastore support

   The "encode-xml" feature of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] is mandatory to
   support.  This indicates that XML is a valid encoding for RPCs, state
   change notifications, and subscribed content.

   A NETCONF publisher supporting event stream subscription via
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] MUST support the
   "NETCONF" event stream identified in that draft.

   A NETCONF publisher supporting [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] MUST
   support the operational state datastore as defined by
   [I.D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

6.  NETCONF connectivity and the subscription lifecycle

   This section describes how the availability of NETCONF transport
   impacts the establishment and lifecycle of different types of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] subscriptions.

6.1.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   For dynamic subscriptions, if the NETCONF session involved with the
   "establish-subscription" terminates, the subscription MUST be
   deleted.

6.2.  Configured Subscriptions

   For a configured subscription, there is no guarantee a transport
   session is currently in place with each associated receiver.  In
   cases where a configured subscription has a receiver in the
   CONNECTING state as described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], section 2.5.1, and
   the "transport" for that subscription is "NETCONF", but no NETCONF
   transport session exists to that receiver (or all existing NETCONF
   transport sessions are currently supporting [RFC5277] subscriptions),
   then the publisher MUST initiate a transport session via NETCONF call
   home [RFC8071], section 4.1 to that receiver.  Until NETCONF
   connectivity is established and a "subscription-started" state change
   notification is successfully sent, that receiver MUST remain in
   either the CONNECTING or the TIMEOUT state.

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                     May 2018


   If the call home fails because the publisher receives receiver
   credentials which are subsequently declined per [RFC8071],
   Section 4.1, step S5 authentication, then that receiver MUST be
   placed into the TIMEOUT state.

   If the call home fails to establish for any other reason, the
   publisher MUST NOT progress the receiver to the ACTIVE state.
   Additionally, the publisher SHOULD place the receiver into the
   TIMEOUT state after a predetermined number of either failed call home
   attempts or NETCONF sessions remotely terminated by the receiver.

   NETCONF transport session connectivity SHOULD be verified via
   Section 4.1, step S7.

   If a NETCONF session is disconnected but the "stop-time" of a
   subscription being transported over that session has not been
   reached, the publisher restarts the call home process and return the
   receiver to the CONNECTING state.

7.  Notification Messages

   Notification messages transported over the NETCONF protocol will be
   identical in format and content to those encoded using one-way
   operations defined within [RFC5277], section 4.

8.  Dynamic Subscriptions and RPC Error Responses

   Management of dynamic subscriptions occurs via RPCs as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  When an RPC error
   occurs, the NETCONF RPC reply MUST include an "rpc-error" element per
   [RFC6241] with the error information populated as follows:

   o  an "error-type" node of "application".
   o  an "error-tag" node of "operation-failed".
   o  an "error-severity" of "error" (this MAY but does not have to be
      included).
   o  an "error-app-tag" node with the value being a string that
      corresponds to an identity associated with the error, as defined
      in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] section 2.4.6
      for general subscriptions, and [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]
      Appendix A.1, for datastore subscriptions.  The tag to use depends
      on the RPC for which the error occurred.  Viable errors for
      different RPCs are as follows:

            RPC                     use base identity
            ----------------------  ----------------------------
            establish-subscription  establish-subscription-error
            modify-subscription     modify-subscription-error
            delete-subscription     delete-subscription-error
            kill-subscription       kill-subscription-error
            resynch-subscription    resynch-subscription-error

   o  In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or
      "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an
      "error-info" node.  This node may contain XML-encoded data with
      hints for parameter settings that might lead to successful RPC
      requests in the future.  Following are the yang-data structures
      which may be returned:

      establish-subscription returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   establish-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      establish-subscription-datastore-error-info

      modify-subscription    returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "error-reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error as a result of a "delete-subscription", a
      "kill-subscription", or a "resynch-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.

   Note that "error-path" does not need to be included with the "rpc-
   error" element, as subscription errors are generally not associated
   with nodes in the datastore but with the choice of RPC input
   parameters.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URI in the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-subscribed-
   notifications
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC6020]:

   Name: ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications
   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-subscribed-
   notifications
   Prefix: nsn
   Reference: RFC XXXX: NETCONF Support for Event Notifications

11.  Security Considerations

   Notification messages (including state change notifications) are
   never sent before the NETCONF capabilities exchange has completed.

   If a malicious or buggy NETCONF subscriber sends a number of
   establish-subscription requests, then these subscriptions accumulate
   and may use up system resources.  In such a situation, subscriptions
   MAY be terminated by terminating the underlying NETCONF session.  The
   publisher MAY also suspend or terminate a subset of the active
   subscriptions on that NETCONF session.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section is non-normative.

A.1.  Event Stream Discovery

   As defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] an
   event stream exposes a continuous set of events available for
   subscription.  A NETCONF client can retrieve the list of available
   event streams from a NETCONF publisher using the "get" operation
   against the top-level container "/streams" defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] Section 3.1.

   The following example illustrates the retrieval of the list of
   available event streams:

<rpc message-id="101"
  xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <get>
    <filter type="subtree">
      <streams
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"/>
    </filter>
  </get>
</rpc>

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                     May 2018


   After such a request, the NETCONF publisher returns a list of event
   streams available, as well as additional information which might
   exist in the container.

A.2.  Dynamic Subscriptions

A.2.1.  Establishing Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following figure shows two successful "establish-subscription"
   RPC requests as per
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  The first request
   is given a subscription identifier of 22, the second, an identifier
   of 23.

      +------------+                 +-----------+
      | Subscriber |                 | Publisher |

          Figure 2: Multiple subscriptions over a NETCONF session

   To provide examples of the information being transported, example
   messages for interactions (a) and (b) in Figure 2 are detailed below:

<rpc message-id="102" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <establish-subscription
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
    <stream>NETCONF</stream>
    <stream-xpath-filter xmlns:ex="http://example.com/events">
      /ex:foo/
    </stream-xpath-filter>
    <dscp>10</dscp>
  </establish-subscription>
</rpc>

               Figure 3: establish-subscription request (a)

   As NETCONF publisher was able to fully satisfy the request (a), the
   publisher sends the subscription identifier of the accepted
   subscription within message (b):

  <rpc-reply message-id="102"
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
    <identifier
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
      22
    </identifier>
  </rpc-reply>

               Figure 4: establish-subscription success (b)

   If the NETCONF publisher had not been able to fully satisfy the
   request, or subscriber has no authorization to establish the
   subscription, the publisher would have sent an RPC error response.
   For instance, if the "dscp" value of 10 asserted by the subscriber in
   Figure 3 proved unacceptable, the publisher may have returned:

   <rpc-reply message-id="102"
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <rpc-error>
      <error-type>application</error-type>
      <error-tag>operation-failed</error-tag>
      <error-severity>error</error-severity>
      <error-app-tag>dscp-unavailable</error-app-tag>
     </rpc-error>
   </rpc-reply>

             Figure 5: an unsuccessful establish subscription

   The subscriber can use this information in future attempts to
   establish a subscription.

A.2.2.  Modifying Dynamic Subscriptions

   An existing subscription may be modified.  The following exchange
   shows a negotiation of such a modification via several exchanges
   between a subscriber and a publisher.  This negotiation consists of a
   failed RPC modification request/response, followed by a successful
   one.

      +------------+                 +-----------+
      | Subscriber |                 | Publisher |

   Figure 6: Interaction model for successful subscription modification

   If the subscription being modified in Figure 6 is a datastore
   subscription as per [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], the modification
   request made in (c) may look like that shown in Figure 7.  As can be
   seen, the modifications being attempted are the application of a new
   xpath filter as well as the setting of a new periodic time interval.

              Figure 7: Subscription modification request (c)

   If the NETCONF publisher can satisfy both changes, the publisher
   sends a positive result for the RPC.  If the NETCONF publisher cannot
   satisfy either of the proposed changes, the publisher sends an RPC
   error response (d).  The following is an example RPC error response
   for (d) which includes a hint.  This hint is an alternative time
   period value which might have resulted in a successful modification:

   <rpc-reply message-id="303"

A.2.3.  Deleting Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following demonstrates deleting a subscription.  This
   subscription may have been to either a stream or a datastore.

  <rpc message-id="103"
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
    <delete-subscription
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
      <identifier>22</identifier>
    </delete-subscription>
  </rpc>

                       Figure 9: Delete subscription

   If the NETCONF publisher can satisfy the request, the publisher
   replies with success to the RPC request.

   If the NETCONF publisher cannot satisfy the request, the publisher
   sends an error-rpc element indicating the modification didn't work.
   Figure 10 shows a valid response for existing valid subscription
   identifier, but that subscription identifier was created on a
   different NETCONF transport session:

   <rpc-reply message-id="103"
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <rpc-error>
       <error-type>application</error-type>
       <error-tag>operation-failed</error-tag>
       <error-severity>error</error-severity>

A.3.  Configured Subscriptions

   Configured subscriptions may be established, modified, and deleted
   using configuration operations against the top-level subtree of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

   In this section, we present examples of how to manage the
   configuration subscriptions using a NETCONF client.

A.3.1.  Creating Configured Subscriptions

   For subscription creation, a NETCONF client may send:

<rpc message-id="201" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <edit-config>
    <target>
      <running/>
    </target>

          <transport xmlns:nsn=
    "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications">
            nsn:netconf

      </subscriptions>
    </config>
  </edit-config>
</rpc>

                Figure 11: Create a configured subscription

   If the request is accepted, the publisher will indicate this.  If the
   request is not accepted because the publisher cannot serve it, no
   configuration is changed.  In this case the publisher may reply:

   Figure 12: Response to a failed configured subscription establishment

   After a subscription has been created, NETCONF connectivity to each
   receiver will be established if it does not already exist.  This will
   be accomplished via [RFC8071].

   The following figure shows the interaction model for the successful
   creation of a configured subscription.

A.3.2.  Modifying Configured Subscriptions

   Configured subscriptions can be modified using configuration
   operations against the top-level container "/subscriptions".

   For example, the subscription established in the previous section
   could be modified as follows, here a adding a second receiver:

<rpc message-id="202" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <edit-config>
    <target>
      <running/>
    </target>

      <subscriptions
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
        <subscription>
          <identifier>
            1922
          </identifier>
          <receivers>
            <receiver>
              <name>receiver2</name>
              <address>1.2.3.5</address>

          </receivers>
        </subscription>
      </subscriptions>
    </config>
  </edit-config>
</rpc>

                 Figure 14: Modify configured subscription

   If the request is accepted, the publisher will indicate success.  The
   result is that the interaction model described in Figure 13 may be
   extended as follows.

   Figure 15: Interaction model for configured subscription modification

   Note in the above that in the specific example above, modifying a
   configured subscription actually resulted in "subscription-started"
   notification.  And because of an existing NETCONF session, no
   additional call home was needed.  Also note that if the edit of the
   configuration had impacted the filter, a separate modify-subscription
   would have been required for the original receiver.

A.3.3.  Deleting Configured Subscriptions

   Configured subscriptions can be deleted using configuration
   operations against the top-level container "/subscriptions".
   Deleting the subscription above would result in the following flow
   impacting all active receivers.

A.4.  Subscription State Notifications

   A publisher will send subscription state notifications according to
   the definitions within
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]).

A.4.1.  subscription-started and subscription-modified

   A "subscription-started" over NETCONF encoded in XML would look like:

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                     May 2018


<notification xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
  <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
  <subscription-started
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
    <identifier>39</identifier>
    <transport xmlns:nsn=
    "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications">
      nsn:netconf
    <transport>
    <stream-xpath-filter xmlns:ex="http://example.com/events">
      /ex:foo
    </stream-xpath-filter>
    <stream>NETCONF</stream>
  </subscription-started>
</notification>

      Figure 17: subscription-started subscription state notification

   The "subscription-modified" is identical to Figure 17, with just the
   word "started" being replaced by "modified".

A.4.2.  subscription-completed, subscription-resumed, and replay-
        complete

   A "subscription-completed" would look like:

  <notification
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
    <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
    <subscription-completed
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
      <identifier>39</identifier>
    </subscription-completed>
  </notification>

           Figure 18: subscription-completed notification in XML

   The "subscription-resumed" and "replay-complete" are virtually
   identical, with "subscription-completed" simply being replaced by
   "subscription-resumed" and "replay-complete".

A.4.3.  subscription-terminated and subscription-suspended

   A "subscription-terminated" would look like:

      <error-id>
         suspension-timeout
      </error-id>
    </subscription-terminated>
  </notification>

    Figure 19: subscription-terminated subscription state notification

   The "subscription-suspended" is virtually identical, with
   "subscription-terminated" simply being replaced by "subscription-
   suspended".
