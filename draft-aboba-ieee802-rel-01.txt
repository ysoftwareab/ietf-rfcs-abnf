Abstract

   Since the mid 1990s, IEEE 802 and IETF have cooperated in the
   development of SNMP MIBs and AAA applications. This document
   describes the history of that cooperation, and the policies and
   procedures that have developed in order to coordinate between the two
   organizations.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


1.  Introduction

   Since the late 1980s, participants in IEEE 802 and the IETF have
   cooperated in the development of MIBs and AAA applications relating
   to IEEE standards.  This has included the Bridge MIB [RFC1493], the
   Hub MIB [RFC2108], MAU MIB [RFC2668], revisions to the Ethernet-like
   Interfaces MIB [RFC2665], the WAN Interfaces Sublayer MIB [WISMIB],
   the Power Ethernet MIB [PETH], multicast filtering and VLAN extension
   MIB [RFC2674], the IEEE 802.1X MIB [8021XMIB], IEEE 802.1X RADIUS
   usage guidelines [RFC3580], RADIUS/EAP [RFC3579], the revised EAP
   specification [RFC2284bis], and the EAP State Machine specification
   [EAPSTATE].  This document describes the history of the IEEE 802/IETF
   relationship, as well as the policies and procedures that have been
   put in place to encourage cooperation.

2.  MIB Development

2.1.  Bridge MIB

   The relationship between IETF and IEEE 802 began in the late 1980s
   with SNMP MIBs developed for the original IEEE 802.1D standard.
   Because the IEEE specification [IEEE8021D] contained only a
   functional definition of the counters and operations, the IETF's
   Bridge MIB WG took on the role of defining the Bridge MIB [RFC1493]
   which was published as an RFC.

   Coordination between IETF and IEEE 802.1 was largely handled by the
   IETF Bridge WG chairs Keith McCloghrie and Fred Baker, as well as
   Anil Rijsinghani, one of the authors of the Bridge MIB.

2.2.  MAU and Hub MIBs

   In the early 1990s when IEEE 802.3 was completing the first Ethernet
   standards, SNMP was not yet the dominant network management protocol.
   As a result, a 'protocol independent' MIB is included in Clause 30 of
   the IEEE 802.3 standard [IEEE8023], which is updated each time the
   Ethernet standard is enhanced to support higher speeds.  In parallel,
   IEEE 802 participants interested in network management were active in
   the formation of the IETF HUBMIB WG, which took on the task of
   transforming IEEE 802 definitions into SNMP MIBs documented as
   Standards Track RFCs.  This included Dan Romascanu, Chair of the IETF
   HUBMIB WG since 1996.

   The Charter of the HUBMIB WG explicitly mentions that the IEEE 802.3
   standard is the starting point for the Ethernet MIB, but at the same
   time reserves the right to deviate from the IEEE model - either to
   cover only part of the capabilities offered by the standard, or add
   MIB objects that are not directly derived from the IEEE model (mostly



Bell, Romascanu & Aboba       Informational                     [Page 2]





INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


   implemented in software).   If management needs lead to requirements
   for hardware support, the IETF HUBMIB WG is to provide this input to
   IEEE 802.3 in a timely manner.

   Cooperation between the IETF HUBMIB WG and IEEE 802.3 has continued
   for more than a decade until today, mostly based on the work of a few
   editors supported by their companies, who are taking the IEEE
   standards and mapping them into a management data model and MIBs.
   Work items include:

   - The Hub MIB [RFC2108], which has gone through three iterations,
     and is probably ending its evolution, as repeaters are less used
     in Ethernets.
   - The MAU MIB, which has been updated each time a new Ethernet speed
     is developed, with [RFC2668] now being revised to accommodate
     10 Gbps Ethernet.
   - The Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB was not originally a work item
     of the HUBMIB WG, but since the publication of [RFC2665] the WG
     has taken responsibility for a revision, which is now in progress.
   - The WAN Interfaces Sublayer MIB [WISMIB], and the Power Ethernet MIB
     [PETH] are relatively new items in IEEE 802.3 and the IETF HUBMIB WG,
     and are currently under review by the IESG.

   In 2000, an official liason was established between IEEE 802.3 and
   the IETF HUBMIB WG, and Dan Romascanu was appointed IETF liason.  The
   conditions of the liason agreement allows editors and other
   participants in the IETF HUBMIB WG access to work-in-progress drafts
   in IEEE 802.3 on a personal basis, for the purpose of working on MIBs
   before the release of the standard.  However, the username and
   password for IEEE 802.3 document access are not for publication on
   any IETF Web site or mail list.

2.3.  802.1p/Q MIB

   In 1996 as the 802.1p and 802.1Q standards were being completed, a
   need was perceived for development of an SNMP MIB, based on the
   management clauses of those standards.  IEEE 802 management clauses
   are written in a manner that was independent of any protocol that may
   be used to implement them.

   At that time, there were a number of proprietary VLAN management MIBs
   which were both inadequate and difficult to understand.  As a result
   there was a need for a more comprehensive, simpler model for VLAN
   management, along with the priority and multicast filtering
   management also defined by these standards.

   A small group of participants from the 802.1 WG began working on the
   problem independently, then combined their work.  The original

INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


   authors of the Bridge MIB, on which some of the work was based,
   reviewed the initial work.

   By the end of 1997, the work was ready for review by a larger
   audience.  Andrew Smith worked with Keith McCloghrie, chair of the
   Bridge MIB WG (dormant at the time) to obtain a meeting slot at the
   March 1998 IETF Meeting.  After this, review and development of the
   MIB continued on the IETF standards track.

   During the development of [RFC2674], there was no official inter-
   working between the IETF Bridge-MIB and IEEE 802.1 groups.
   Development of this MIB was successful, because the main developers
   (Andrew Smith and Les Bell) were involved in both IEEE 802.1 as well
   as the IETF Bridge MIB WGs.

2.4.  802.3ad and 802.1X MIBs

   As part of the IEEE 802.3ad and IEEE 802.1X standards work, it was
   decided that it would better to develop a MIB as part of the
   standards, rather than wait until an IETF WG was formed, and develop
   the MIBs separately, so as to avoid a significant time lag in their
   development.

   As Les Bell was the participant in IEEE 802.3ad and IEEE 802.1 most
   familiar with SNMP MIB development, he put together the initial MIBs
   based on the management framework the groups had come up with.
   Additional assistance was then received for both MIBs from within the
   IEEE 802.3ad and IEEE 802.1X groups.  Tony Jeffree, editor of both
   standards, acted as editor of the MIBs as well.

   The problem with IEEE 802 developing these MIBs without IETF
   involvement was the lack of review.  IEEE 802 members are generally
   not familiar with MIBs and very few comments were received as part of
   the balloting process for either MIB.

   In the case of the IEEE 802.3ad MIB, this meant that basic errors
   were not discovered until just before publication.  Unfortunately by
   then it was too late, and the corrections submitted to the IEEE
   802.3ad chair and document editor did not get applied to the
   published version.

   To solicit additional review, the IEEE 802.1X MIB was re-published as
   an Internet-Draft [8021XMIB] within the Bridge WG.  This occurred
   after publication of [IEEE8021X].

INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


2.5.  802.1t, 802.1u, 802.1v and 802.1w MIBs

   802.1t and 802.1u were minor amendments to the 802.1D and 802.1Q
   standards, requiring some additions to the MIB published in
   [RFC2674].  802.1v was a new feature extending the VLAN
   classification schemes of 802.1Q, also requiring extensions to
   [RFC2674].  802.1w was a new version of Spanning Tree, requiring re-
   writing of part of [RFC1493].

   When Les Bell took on the role of Chair of the IETF Bridge-MIB WG in
   2001, these issues were raised as new work items and two volunteers
   were found to become editors of the Internet Drafts.  A work item was
   also included to publish the IEEE 802.1X MIB as an Informational RFC.

   This approach worked well for a while, but it then became difficult
   for the participants, including the editors and the Chair, to sustain
   a level of interest sufficient to overcome the difficulties
   introduced by budget cut-backs.  As a result, the drafts have now
   expired, although there are no significant technical issues
   outstanding.

3.  AAA/EAP

   Since the late 1990s, IEEE 802.1 has been involved in work relating
   to authentication and authorization [IEEE8021X], which has lead to
   uncovering of issues in several IETF specifications, including
   [RFC2284], and [RFC2869].  Similarly, IETF participants have
   uncovered issues in early versions of the RADIUS usage specifications
   such as [RFC3580], as well as the IEEE 802.1X state machine [Mishra].

   In order to address these issues and ensure synchronization between
   IEEE 802.1 and the IETF EAP and AAA WGs, a liason arrangement has
   been devised that has so far been relatively successful.

   More recently, IEEE 802.11 groups such as IEEE 802.11i and IEEE
   802.11f have also become dependent on EAP and AAA work.  This
   relationship is still evolving, but is somewhat more challenging
   since IEEE 802.11 has a need for features such as RADIUS extensions,
   new EAP methods and an EAP Keying Framework that represent
   substantial new IETF work, as opposed to the clarifications and
   updates that have been required by IEEE 802.1.  As a result, the
   likelihood of IETF process delays affecting completion of IEEE
   standards is considerably greater.  Going forward, the IETF and IEEE
   802 will need to work to resolve the tension between timely delivery
   of standards and the need for thorough IETF review.






Bell, Romascanu & Aboba       Informational                     [Page 5]





INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


3.1.  IEEE 802.1X

   IEEE 802.1X-2001 [IEEE8021X] defined the encapsulation of EAP
   [RFC2284] over IEEE 802, as well as a state machine for the joint
   operation of IEEE 802.1X and EAP.

   During the development of [IEEE8021X], several problems were
   discovered in the specification for RADIUS/EAP [RFC2869], and as a
   result, work was begun on a revision which was eventually published
   as [RFC3579].  In addition, clarifications were required on how
   RADIUS attributes defined in [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2867],
   [RFC2868], [RFC2869], and [RFC3162] would be interpreted by IEEE
   802.1X implementations, and so a non-normative RADIUS usage appendix
   was added to [IEEE8021X], and subsequently published as [RFC3580].

   Subsequent to the publication of [IEEE8021X], a formal analysis of
   the IEEE 802.1X state machine by the University of Maryland disclosed
   several security issues [Mishra].  After discussion within IEEE
   802.1aa, the group chartered to revise IEEE 802.1X, it was decided
   that the issues were the result of lack of clarity in [RFC2284], and
   the absence of an EAP state machine document.

   At that time, work on EAP was handled within the IETF PPPEXT WG,
   which was largely inactive.  In order to handle work on a revised EAP
   specification [RFC2284bis] as well as an EAP state machine document,
   the IETF EAP WG was formed in July 2002.  Bernard Aboba, a
   participant in IEEE 802.1X and IEEE 802.1aa, was named co-chair.

   Work on the EAP state machine [EAPSTATE] and [RFC2284bis]
   specifications have proceeded in parallel within EAP WG, with issues
   or changes in one document requiring changes to the other document,
   as well as in some cases revisions to IEEE 802.1X [IEEE8021aa].  The
   revised RADIUS/EAP specification [RFC3579] has been reviewed within
   EAP WG, although it is not a WG work item.

   A revision to IEEE 802.1X [IEEE8021aa] is now in progress, which
   includes the following:

      - a revised RADIUS usage appendix based on [RFC3580]
      - clarifications based on [RFC3579]
      - a revised IEEE 802.1X state machine
      - an EAP state machine, based on [EAPSTATE] and [RFC2284bis]

   Due to the deep dependencies between IEEE 802.1aa and EAP WG, a
   liason was established between the two groups in August 2002.  This
   enables members of the IETF EAP WG to obtain access to IEEE 802.1aa
   work-in-progress.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


   IEEE 802 groups are duty bound to consider all comments received,
   regardless of their origin. This allows IETF participants to comment
   as part of the IEEE 802 ballot process, regardless of their voting
   status within IEEE 802.  Where there is active cooperation, IETF WGs
   may be made aware that IEEE 802 ballots are occurring and that their
   comments are welcome.  Currently IEEE 802.1aa and IEEE 802.11i
   ballots are announced on the EAP WG mailing list, as are IEEE 802
   interim meeting arrangements.

   Similarly, during the IEEE 802.1aa ballot process, comments have been
   received relating to [RFC2284bis], [EAPSTATE], and [RFC3579]. These
   comments are tracked on the EAP WG Issues List, and are reflected in
   the documents.

   In April 2003 [RFC3580] was approved by the IESG for publication as
   an RFC, and in May 2003 [RFC3579] was approved for publication as an
   RFC.  The review process for both drafts involved bringing the
   documents to IETF last call, and then reposting the IETF last call
   announcement on the IEEE 802.1 mailing list. While ballot comments in
   IEEE 802.1aa were also reflected in changes to both documents, it was
   necessary for both documents to be approved for publication as RFCs
   well in advance of IEEE 802.1aa Sponsor Ballot, in order to ensure
   that RFC #s would be assigned in time, so as to avoid delaying
   publication of IEEE 802.1aa.

   Overall, despite the complex inter-dependencies between IEEE 802.1aa
   and IETF specifications, the relationship has been relatively
   successful. This is largely due to the work of a group of
   contributors who have been joint participants in IEEE 802.1aa and the
   IETF EAP WG.

3.2.  IEEE 802.11i

   IEEE 802.11i is chartered with security enhancements to IEEE 802.11.
   Since IEEE 802.11i has chosen to utilize IEEE 802.1X, IEEE 802.11i
   depends on the IEEE 802.1X revision-in-progress [IEEE8021aa].  As a
   result, IEEE 802.11i and IEEE 802.1aa have in the past held joint
   meetings at IEEE 802 plenaries and have established a liason
   arrangement that permits members of either group (as well as EAP WG
   participants) access to IEEE 802.11i work-in-progress.

   Since IEEE 802.11i depends on IEEE 802.1aa, IEEE 802.11i inherits
   IEEE 802.1aa dependencies on IETF work, including work on EAP, EAP
   methods, and AAA support for EAP.  In addition, since IEEE 802.11i
   uses EAP for key management whereas [IEEE8021X] does not, there is an
   additional dependency on EAP Key management [EAPKey].

   In February 2002, IEEE 802.11 sent a liason letter to the IESG



Bell, Romascanu & Aboba       Informational                     [Page 7]





INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


   [IEEE802Liaison1] requesting additional work on EAP, EAP methods, and
   EAP key management. This letter was presented at the second EAP BOF
   at IETF 53, and was used as input to the EAP WG charter.  In March
   2003, another liason letter was presented, providing further
   clarifications on requirements for EAP method work [IEEE802Liaison2].
   This included a request from IEEE 802.11i for the EAP WG to consider
   changing the mandatory-to-implement EAP method within [RFC2284bis],
   so as to provide a method meeting the security requirements of IEEE
   802.11i.

   During IETF 56, the request for changing the mandatory-to-implement
   method was considered by the EAP WG.  A recommendation was made by
   the Internet Area Director Erik Nordmark that the IEEE 802.11i
   requirements be documented in an Internet Draft and that the EAP WG
   consider the security requirements for EAP methods in various
   situations.  These requirements were subsequently included within
   [RFC2284bis].  It was recommended not to change the mandatory-to-
   implement method, since the EAP WG was not chartered to do work on
   methods.  However, work on additional methods may be included in a
   future version of the EAP WG charter.

   Most recently, IEEE 802.11i has been involved in discussions relating
   to fast handoff, which may potentially require RADIUS extensions
   [Arbaugh] as well as changes to the EAP Key hierarchy [EAPKey].
   However, the direction of this work has not yet been determined so
   that no liason request has been formulated yet.

   In April 2003 Dorothy Stanley was appointed liason from IEEE 802.11
   to the IETF, in order to help coordinate between IEEE 802.11 and the
   IETF EAP and AAA WGs.

3.3.  IEEE 802.11f

   IEEE 802.11f is chartered with development of a recommended practice
   for Inter-Access Point Communications.  As part of development of an
   Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP), it was necessary to secure
   communications between the access points, as well as to support the
   reverse resolution of the MAC address of the previous access point to
   its IP address, so as to allow the two access points to communicate
   via IAPP. Since the two access points might not be on the same link,
   Inverse ARP [RFC2390], was not considered sufficient in all cases.

   IEEE 802.11f elected to extend the RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] to
   provide inverse address resolution as well as IPsec key management.
   This was accomplished via use of vendor-specific attributes, as well
   as new RADIUS commands, defined through definition of additional
   values for the RADIUS Service-Type attribute.  As a result, IETF
   review was not required under the IANA considerations included in



Bell, Romascanu & Aboba       Informational                     [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


   [RFC2865]. Subsequently, the RADIUS IANA considerations were revised
   so as to require IETF review [RFC3575] in most cases.

   No liason arrangement was developed between IEEE 802.11f and relevant
   IETF WGs such as AAA WG or SEAMOBY WG, so as to allow IETF
   participants access to the IEEE 802.11f specifications prior to
   publication.  Once IEEE 802.11f entered into Recirculation ballot,
   only comments relating to changes in the specification could be
   considered.  As a result, issues raised relating to the IEEE 802.11f
   RADIUS extensions were rejected.

   Currently the plan is to handle issues in the IEEE 802.11f RADIUS
   extensions via the IEEE 802.11 interpretation process, and
   subsequently, if warranted, by a group chartered to revise IEEE
   802.11f.

4.  Summary and Recommendations

   Based on the above history, the following changes are recommended:

[a]  Increased reliance on online communication.  In these times of
     travel restriction it is important to be able to conclude IETF/IEEE
     802 cooperative projects successfully without requiring physical
     attendance at both IETF and IEEE 802 meetings.  This is somewhat of
     a challenge because in the past having participants attend both
     standards bodies has been an important contributor to success.

[b]  Development of a framework agreement.  Access to IEEE work-in-
     progress documents has frequently arisen as an issue in cooperation
     between IETF and IEEE 802.  The IEEE and IETF follow very different
     models with respect to document access.  While IETF Internet-Drafts
     are freely available, IEEE 802 keeps documents restricted to the
     participants in the IEEE 802 standards process.  Within IEEE 802, a
     participant is required to physically attend at least one IEEE
     meeting.  While in the past IETF WGs have successfully negotiated
     access to IEEE work-in-progress, each instance has been handled
     separately and may take significant time to set up.  Going forward
     it would be helpful to develop a framework agreement between the
     IEEE 802 and IETF so that this process could be concluded quickly
     and a new negotiation would not be required each time cooperation
     is required.

[c]  Increased review of IEEE MIBs.  It would be helpful to encourage
     wider review of MIBs developed by IEEE 802 WGs, via liaisons with
     the IETF and by permitting access to relevant IEEE 802 draft
     documents to IETF WG members.  Were IEEE 802 draft documents to be
     made more readily available, IETF WG chairs could encourage WG
     members to review the MIBs as soon as the drafts are considered



Bell, Romascanu & Aboba       Informational                     [Page 9]





INTERNET-DRAFT            IEEE 802/IETF History         18 November 2003


     stable enough.

     It is recommended that SNMP MIBs written in the IEEE follow the MIB
     guidelines [GUIDELINES] and be reviewed as part of the SNMP quality
     control process ('MIB Doctors').

[d]  Increased review of IEEE AAA applications. It would be helpful to
     encourage wider review of AAA applications developed by IEEE 802
     WGs. This can be accomplished via a liaison with the IETF AAA WG,
     and by permitting access to IEEE 802 work-in-progress to IETF WGs
     with a demonstrated need.  The newly approved RADIUS IANA
     Considerations document [RFC3575] now requires such a review in
     most cases.

[e]  Preference for IETF standard AAA attributes, and a single IEEE
     Vendor-Specific attribute format.  Currently several standards
     organizations, including IEEE, have taken to allocating their own
     vendor-specific AAA attributes.  As noted in [RFC3575]:

        RADIUS defines a mechanism for Vendor-Specific extensions
        (Attribute 26) and the use of that should be encouraged instead
        of allocation of global attribute types, for functions specific
        only to one vendor's implementation of RADIUS, where no
        interoperability is deemed useful.

     Since IEEE vendor-specific attributes are not specific to only one
     vendor's implementation of RADIUS and interoperability is generally
     deemed useful, use of vendor-specific attributes represents a last
     resort.  For AAA attributes of general utility, and particularly
     those useful in multiple potential applications, allocation from
     the IETF standard attribute space is preferred.

     Where allocation of Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) is required,
     it is recommended that IEEE 802 create a uniform format for all of
     IEEE 802, rather than letting each IEEE 802 WG create their own
     format.  The format defined in IEEE 802.11f is inappropriate for
     this, since it only defines a single octet Type field, allowing for
     only 255 attributes.

5.  Security considerations

   As IEEE 802 becomes increasingly involved in the specification of
   standards for link-layer security, experience has shown that it is
   helpful to obtain outside review of work-in-progress prior to
   publication.  This has proven somewhat challenging since access to
   IEEE 802 work-in-progress documents are often tightly controlled.
   For example, special permission had to be obtained for IEEE 802.11i
   to be able to circulate a version of its security standard-in-

   progress for review.  A liason between an IEEE 802 group and a
   relevant IETF WG can assist in obtaining the necessary level of
   review.

   In addition, experience has shown that IETF standards may not be
   written to the level of clarity required by the IEEE 802 standards
   process.  In the case of EAP [RFC2284], the process of developing the
   EAP state machine specification has proven useful in uncovering
   aspects requiring clarification, and the joint review process has
   exposed by IEEE and IETF documents-in-progress to wider review than
   might otherwise have been possible.

   Due to weaknesses in the RADIUS specification [RFC2865], it is
   relatively easy for protocol extensions to introduce serious security
   vulnerabilities.  As a result, IETF review of RADIUS extensions is
   advisable, and the RADIUS IANA Considerations [RFC3575] have been
   revised so as to require such a review in most cases.

   parameters.
