Abstract

   Elliptic curves with pairings are useful tools for constructing
   cryptographic primitives.  In this memo, we specify domain parameters
   of Barreto-Naehrig curves (BN-curves) [8].  The BN-curve is an
   elliptic curve suitable for pairings and allows us to achieve high
   security and efficiency of cryptographic schemes.  This memo
   specifies domain parameters of four 254-bit BN-curves [1] [2] [5]
   which allow us to obtain efficient implementations.

1.  Introduction

   Elliptic curves with a special map called a pairing or bilinear map
   allow cryptographic primitives to achieve functions or efficiency
   which cannot be realized by conventional mathematical tools.  There
   are identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption
   (ABE), ZSS signature, broadcast encryption (BE) as examples of such
   primitives.  IBE realizes powerful management of public keys by
   allowing us to use a trusted identifier as a public key.  ABE

   provides a rich decryption condition based on boolean functions and
   attributes corresponding to a secret key or a ciphertext.  The ZSS
   signature gives a shorter size of signature than that of ECDSA.  BE
   provides an efficient encryption procedure in a broadcast setting.

   Some of these cryptographic schemes based on elliptic curves with
   pairings were proposed in the IETF (e.g. [9], [10], and [11]) and
   used in some protocols (e.g. [12], [13], [14], [15], and [16]).
   These cryptographic primitives will be used actively more in the IETF
   due to their functions or efficiency.

   We need to choose an appropriate type of elliptic curve and
   parameters for the pairing-based cryptographic schemes, because the
   choice has great impact on security and efficiency of these schemes.
   However, an RFC on elliptic curves with pairings has not yet been
   provided in the IETF.

   In this memo, we specify domain parameters of Barreto-Naehrig curve
   (BN-curve) [8].  The BN-curve allows us to achieve high security and
   efficiency with pairings due to an optimum embedding degree for
   128-bit security.  This memo specifies domain parameters of four
   254-bit BN-curves ([1] and [2]) because of these efficiencies ([5]).
   These BN-curves are known as efficient curves in academia and
   particularly provide efficient pairing computation which is generally
   slowest operation in pairing-based cryptography.  There are optimized
   source codes of ([1] and [2]) as open source software ([20] , [21],
   and [23]), respectively.  This memo describes domain parameters of
   224, 256, 384, and 512-bit curves which are compliant with ISO
   document [3] and organizes differences between types of elliptic
   curves which are compliant with ISO document [3] in Appendix A.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [4].

3.  Preliminaries

   In this section, we introduce the definition of elliptic curve and
   bilinear map, notation used in this memo.

3.1.  Elliptic Curve

   Throughout this memo, let p > 3 be a prime, q = p^n, and n be a
   natural number.  Also, let F_q be a finite field.  The curve defined
   by the following equation E is called an elliptic curve.

Internet-Draft                  BN-Curves                      July 2015


   E : y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B such that A, B are in F_q,
             4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 != 0 mod F_q

   Solutions (x, y) for an elliptic curve E, as well as the point at
   infinity, are called F_q-rational points.  The additive group is
   constructed by a well-defined operation in the set of F_q-rational
   points.  Typically, the cyclic additive group with prime order r and
   the base point G in its group is used for the cryptographic
   applications.  Furthermore, we define terminology used in this memo
   as follows.

      O_E: the point at infinity over elliptic curve E.

      #E(F_q): number of points on an elliptic curve E over F_q.

      cofactor h: h = #E(F_p)/r.

      embedding degree k: minimum integer k such that r is a divisor of
      q^k - 1

3.2.  Bilinear Map

   Let G_1 be an additive group of prime order r and let G_2 and G_T be
   additive and multiplicative groups, respectively, of the same order.
   Let P, Q be generators of G_1, G_2 respectively.  We say that (G_1,
   G_2, G_T) are asymmetric bilinear map groups if there exists a
   bilinear map e: (G_1, G_2) -> G_T satisfying the following
   properties:

   1.  Bilinearity: for any S in G_1, for any T in G_2, for any a, b in
       Z_r, we have the relation e([a]S, [b]T) = e(S, T)^{a * b}.

   2.  Non-degeneracy: for any T in G_2, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if S =
       O_E.  Similarly, for any S in G_1, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if T =
       O_E.

   3.  Computability: for any S in G_1, for any T in G_2, the bilinear
       map is efficiently computable.

   For BN-curves, G_1 is a r-order cyclic subgroup of E(F_p) and G_2 is
   a subgroup of E(F_{p^k}), where k is the embedding degree of the
   curve.  The group G_T is the set of r-th roots of unity in the finite
   field F_{p^k}.

4.  Domain Parameter Specification

   In this section, this memo specifies the domain parameters for four
   254-bit elliptic curves which allow us to efficiently compute the
   operation of a pairing at high levels of security.

4.1.  Notation for Domain Parameters and Types of Sextic Twists

   Here, we define notations for specifying domain parameters and
   explain types of pairing friendly curves.

   The BN-curves E over F_p satisfy following equation.

   y^2 = x^3 + B for B in F_p

   The values p and r are computed from a suitable integer t.

   p is a characteristic of a prime field F_p: p = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 +
   24 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1.

   r is order of group E over F_p: r = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 18 * t^2 +
   6 * t + 1.

   Also, the value b in the constant of the irreducible field polynomial
   u^2 + b in F_{p^2}.

   Domain parameters of the elliptic curve E(F_p) and E(F_{p^12}) are
   needed for computation of the pairing.  In the pairing over BN-
   curves, we usually use a sextic twist curve group E'(F_{p^2}) and a
   map I from the sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}) to E(F_{p^12}) instead of
   E(F_{p^12}).  Hence, this memo follows the group and the map.  For
   the details of the group and the map, refer to [8].

   The sextic twist curves are classified in two types, which are called
   D-type and M-type respectively [22].  The D-type sextic twist curve
   is defined by equation E': y'^2 = x'^3 + B/s when elliptic curve
   E(F_p) is set to be y^2 = x^3 + B and represent of F_{p^12} is set to
   be F_{p^2}[u]/(u^6 - s), where s is in F_{p^2}^*.  Let z be a root of
   u^6 - s, where z is in F_{p^12}. The corresponding map I: E'(F_{p^2})
   -> E(F_{p^12}) is (x', y') -> (z^2 * x', z^3 * y').  The M-type
   sextic twist curve is defined by equation E': y^2 = x^3 + B * s when
   elliptic curve E(F_p) is set to be y^2 = x^3 + B and represent of
   F_{p^12} is set to be F_{p^2}[u]/(u^6 - s), where s is in F_{p^2}^*.
   The corresponding map I: E'(F_{p^2}) -> E(F_{p^12}) is (x', y') ->
   (x' * s^{-1} * z^4, y' * s^{-1} * z^3), with z^6 = s.

   For the pairing, the group G_1 is defined as the subgroup of order r
   in E(F_p).  Then, the group G_2 is defined as the subgroup of order r

   in E'(F_{p^2}).  The group G_T is subgroup of order r in the
   multiplicative group F_{p^12}^*.  The output of pairing is an element
   on G_T.  The order of F_{p^12}^* can be decomposed into (p^12 - 1) =
   (p^6 - 1) * (p^2 + 1) * (p^4 - p^2 + 1)/r.  Let the cofactor h'' of r
   on F_{p^12} be h''_1 * h''_2, where h''_1 = (p^4 - p^2 + 1)/r and
   h''_2 = (p^6 - 1) * (p^2 + 1).

   These domain parameters are described in the following way.

      can be referenced.

      p_b is a prime specifying a base field.

      defining E'.

      being its x'- and y'-coordinates in E', respectively.

      r' is the prime order of the group generated by G'.

      e12 is the constant of the irreducible polynomial of F_{p^12} =
      F_{p^6}[w]/(w^2 - e12).

      h'' is the cofactor of r in F_{p^12}^* s.t. h'' = h''_1 * h''_2

      Curve-ID and GT-Field-ID.

4.2.  Efficient Domain Parameters for 254-Bit-Curves

   This section specifies the domain parameters for four 254-bit
   elliptic curves.  All twisted domain parameters specified in this
   section are D-type.

4.2.1.  Domain Parameters by Beuchat et al.

   The domain parameters by Beuchat et al. [1] generated by t =
   3fc0100000000000.

   The domain parameters described in this subsection are defined by
   elliptic curve E(F_p) : y^2 = x^3 + 5 and sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}) :
   x'^3 + 5/s = x'^3 - u, where F_{p^2} = F_p[u]/(u^2 + 5), F_{p^6} =
   F_{p^2}[v]/(v^3 - u), F_{p^12} = F_{p^6}[w]/(w^2 - v), s = - 5/u.  We
   describe domain parameters of elliptic curves E and E'.  The
   parameter p_b is 1 mod 8.  For the details of these parameters, refer
   to [1].

4.2.2.  Domain Parameters by Nogami et al. / Aranha et al.

   The domain parameters by Nogami et al. [2] generated by t =
   -0x4080000000000001.  Aranha et al. presented an open source library
   of the pairing using this parameter [2].

   The domain parameters described in this subsection are defined by
   elliptic curve E(F_p) : y^2 = x^3 + 2 and sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}) :
   x'^3 + 2/s = x'^3 + 1 - u, where F_{p^2} = F_p[u]/(u^2 + 1), F_{p^6}
   = F_{p^2}[v]/(v^3 - (1 + u)), F_{p^12} = F_{p^6}[w]/(w^2 - v), 1/s =
   1/(1 + u).  We describes domain parameters of elliptic curves E and
   E'.  The parameter p_b is 3 mod 4.  For the details of these
   parameters, refer to [2].

6.  Security Considerations

   For above sections, G_1 is a r-order cyclic subgroup of E(F_p) and
   G_2 is a subgroup of E'(F_{p^2}), where k is the embedding degree of
   the curve and the group G_T is the set of r-th roots of unity in the
   finite field F_{p^12}^*. In this section, G_1, G_2 and G_T imply
   E(F_p), E'(F_{p^2}) and F_{p^12}^* respectively.

   Pairing-based cryptographic primitives are often based on the
   hardness of the following problems, so when the elliptic curves from
   this document are used in such schemes, these problems would apply.

      The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in G_1 and G_2
      (ECDLP)

      The finite field discrete logarithm problem in G_T (FFDLP)

      The elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem in
      G_1 and G_2

      The elliptic curve computational co-Diffie-Hellman problem in G_1
      and G_2

      The elliptic curve decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem in G_1

      The bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem

   Algorithms to efficiently solve the problems above, aside from
   special cases, are unknown.  Mainly, there are Pollard-rho algorithm
   [18] against point of an elliptic curve G_1 and G_2, and Number Field
   Sieve method [17] against G_T which is output of pairing as generic
   attacks against elliptic curve with pairing .

   G_T to be larger than G_1 and G_2, because FFDLP can be computed more
   efficiently than ECDLP in most cases.  Security level of schemes
   based on pairing depends most weak level for each problems.  Thus
   implementors should necessary to ensure adequate security level for
   both of problems.

   Table 1 shows the security level of elliptic curves described in this
   memo Schemes based on the elliptic curves (i.e.  G_1 and G_2) and the
   finite fields (i.e.  G_T) must be combined with cryptographic
   primitives which have similar or greater security level than the
   scheme.

6.1.  Subgroup Security (OPTIONAL requirement)

   For BN-curves, G_1 is cryptographic group of large prime order and
   cofactor h is always 1.  On the other hand, G_2, G_T are consisted of
   subgroup of order h' and h'' that are not equal to 1 in addition to
   subgroup of order r , resp.  Thus implementors who provided groups in
   G_2 and G_T, MUST check element of those groups included in subgroup
   of order r (see [7]) .

   The order check of G_T can be performed by exponentiation of h''_1
   and h''_2.  The exponentiation of h''_2 can be easily computed by
   using Frobenius map.  Whereas the exponentiation of h''_1 is
   complicated.

   For simplification of the order check which is the smallest prime
   factor of h' and h''_1 will be greater than r, of element, we define
   OPTIONAL security G_2-strong and G_T-strong security.  G_2-strong and
   G_T-strong means those order of cryptographic group MUST have the
   smallest prime factor greater than r.  Therefore implementors could
   not check of order, G_2-strong and G_T-strong cryptographic group
   will not be insecure

   Table 2 shows the G_2, G_T-strong security of parameters described in
   this memo.

Appendix A.  Domain Parameters Based on ISO Document

   We describe the domain parameters for 224, 256, 384, and 512-bit
   elliptic curves which are compliant with the ISO document and are
   based on M-type twisted curve.  The domain parameters described in
   below subsections are defined by Elliptic curve E(F_p): y^2 = x^3 + 3
   and sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}): y'^2 = x'^3 + 3 * s, where F_{p^2} =
   F_p[u]/(u^2 + 1), F_{p^12} = F_{p^2}[w]/(w^6 - s), s = 1 + u.  We
   describe domain parameters of elliptic curves E.  Detailed
   information on these domain parameters is given in [3].
