                   IP Address Privacy Considerations
               draft-ip-address-privacy-considerations-00

Abstract

   This document provides an overview of privacy considerations related
   to user IP addresses.  It includes an analysis of some current use
   cases for tracking of user IP addresses, mainly in the context of
   anti-abuse.  It discusses the privacy issues associated with such
   tracking and provides input on mechanisms to improve the privacy of
   this existing model.  It then captures requirements for proposed
   'replacement signals' for IP addresses from this analysis.  In
   addition, existing and under-development techniques are evaluated for
   fulfilling these requirements.

1.  Introduction

   The initial intention of this draft is to capture an overview of the
   problem space and research on proposed solutions.  The draft is
   likely to evolve significantly over time and may well split into
   multiple drafts as content is added.

Internet-Draft      IP Address Privacy Considerations          July 2021


   Tracking of user IP addresses is common place on the Internet today,
   and is particularly widely used in the context of anti-abuse, e.g.
   anti-fraud, DDoS management, child protection activities.  IP
   addresses are currently used as a source of "reputation" in
   conjunction with other signals to protect against malicious traffic,
   since they are a relatively stable identifier of the origin of a
   request.  Servers use these reputations in determining whether or not
   a given packet, connection, or flow corresponds to malicious traffic.

   However, identifying the activity of users based on IP addresses has
   clear privacy implications e.g. user fingerprinting and cross site
   identity linking.  Many technologies exist today to allow users to
   hide their IP address to avoid such tracking, e.g.  VPNs, Tor.
   Several new technologies are also emerging in the landscape e.g.
   Gnatcatcher, Apple iCloud Private Relay and Oblivious techologies
   (OHTTPS, ODoH).

   This draft attempts to capture the following aspects of the tension
   between valid use cases for user identification and the related
   privacy concerns including:

   *  An analysis of the current use cases, attempting to categorize/
      group such use cases where commonalities exist

   *  Find ways to enhance the privacy of existing uses of IP addresses.

   *  Generating requirements for proposed 'replacement signals' from
      this analysis (these could be different for each category/group of
      use cases)

   *  Research to evaluate existing technologies or propose new
      mechanisms for such signals

2.  Terminology

   (Work in progress)

   *  Reputation: A random variable with some distribution.  A
      reputation can either be "bad" or "good" with some probability
      according to the distribution.

   *  Reputation signal: A representative of a reputation.

   *  Reputation proof: A non-interactive zero knowledge proof of a
      reputation signal.

   *  Reputation context: The context in which a given reputation
      applies.

   *  Identity: Any identifying information about an end-user or
      service, be it a client or server, including IP addresses.

3.  IP address tracking

3.1.  IP address use cases

3.1.1.  Anti-abuse

   Account abuse, financial fraud, ad fraud, child abuse...

3.1.2.  DDoS and Botnets

3.2.  Privacy implications of IP addresses

   IP addresses provide a relatively stable identifier
   (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02435622), and are an important attribute
   in tracking people as they load web pages across sites.  While the
   stable identifier is important in the above anti-abuse cases, this
   fact threatens a user's privacy because it allows for profiling of
   behavior.  This profiling may occur anywhere on the path between the
   client and the server, inclusive.  In addition, IP addresses
   passively leak meta information about the user, such as their rough
   geographical location.  This may be beneficial, but not always as the
   default.

   Some mitigations are discussed below, however any holistic solution
   must ensure privacy is available with no additional cost.

3.3.  Mitigations for IP address tracking

   The ability to track individual people by IP address has been well
   understood for decades.  Commercial VPNs and Tor are the most common
   methods of mitigating IP address-based tracking.

   Commerical VPNs offer a layer of indirection between the user and the
   destination, however if the VPN endpoint's IP address is static then
   this simply substitutes one address for another.  In addition,
   commerial VPNs replace tracking across sites with a single company
   that may track their users' activities.

   Tor is another mitigation option due to its dynamic path selection
   and distributed network of relays, however its current design suffers
   from degraded performance.  In addition, correct application
   integration is difficult and not common.

Internet-Draft      IP Address Privacy Considerations          July 2021


   Recent interest has resulted in new protocols such as Oblivious DNS
   (ODoH (https://www.ietf.org/staging/draft-pauly-oblivious-doh-
   02.html)) and Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/
   draft-thomson-http-oblivious-00.html)).  While they both prevent
   tracking by individual parties, they are not intended for the
   general-purpose web browsing use case.

   Finally, Gnatcatcher (https://github.com/bslassey/ip-
   blindness/blob/master/README.md) is a single-hop proxy providing more
   protection than a traditional commercial VPN; and iCloud Private
   Relay is described as using two proxies and would provide a level of
   protection somewhere between a commercial VPN and Tor.

4.  Replacement signals for IP addresses

   Fundamentally, the current ecosystem operates by making the paths of
   a connection accountable for bad traffic, rather than the sources of
   the traffic itself.  This is problematic because in some cases IP
   addresses are shared by multiple clients (e.g., VPNs, Tor, carrier-
   grade NATs (CGNATs)) and any misbehavior may be impermanent.
   Ideally, clients could present proof of reputation that is separate
   from the IP address, and uniquely bound to a given connection.

4.1.  Requirements

4.1.1.  Client requirements

   *  Clients MUST be able to request and present new reputation proofs
      on demand.

   *  A reputation signal MUST NOT be linkable to an Identity for which
      the signal corresponds.

   *  Clients MUST be able to demonstrate good faith and improve
      reputation if needed.

   *  Clients MUST be able to dispute their reputation.

   *  Clients MUST be able to determine and verify the context in which
      a given reputation applies.

   *  Reputation signals MUST NOT remain valid indefinitely.  (Clients
      must obtain new reputation signals periodically.)

4.1.2.  Server requirements

   *  Reputation signals MUST be bound to a context, and MUST NOT be
      transferrable across contexts.
