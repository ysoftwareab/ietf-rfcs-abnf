Internet-Draft           16ng Problem Statement           September 2005


1.  Introduction

   Broadband Wireless Access Network was invented to overcome the low
   bandwidth wireless communication which was not appropriate for the
   user requirements such as high quality data/voice service, fast
   mobility, wide coverage and etc.  To achieve these requirements, the
   IEEE 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless Access Standards
   develops standards and recommended practices to support the
   development and deployment of broadband Wireless Metropolitan Area
   Networks [IEEE802.16].  In addition, IEEE 802.16e supports mobility
   over IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16e] as an amendment of the IEEE 802.16
   specification.

   Recently, much work is in progress by the WiMAX Forum.  In
   particular, its NWG (Network Working Group) is responsible for the
   IEEE 802.16(e) network architecture (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Mobility,
   Interworking with different networks, AAA, etc).  The NWG is thus
   taking on work at layers above those defined by IEEE 802 standard
   (typically limited to the physical and link layers only).

   IEEE 802.16(e) is significantly different from existing wireless
   access technology such as IEEE 802.11, and there are lots of
   considerable aspects to be resolved by IETF when applying Internet
   Protocol Version 6 [RFC1883] for IEEE 802.16(e) link.  This document
   will describe the problems introduced in deploying IPv6 over IEEE
   802.16(e) networks.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .


3.  Problem Statement

   The first problem introduced in deploying IPv6 over IEEE 802.16(e)
   networks is that an IEEE 802.16(e) network currently does not provide
   native multicasting for IPv6 packet transfer.  The IEEE 802.16's
   connection is a unidirectional mapping between BS (Base Station) and
   SS (Subscriber Station) medium access control peers for the purpose
   of transporting a service flow's traffic in point-to-point manner
   [IEEE802.16].  This lacking of facility for native multicasting for
   IPv6 packet transfer results in inappropriateness in applying
   conventional host-side operation of the standard IPv6 Neighbor
   Discover protocol specially regarding, address resolution, router
   discovery, duplicated address detection.

   The second problem introduced in deploying IPv6 over IEEE 802.16(e)
   networks is applying the stateless auto-configuration mechanism which
   is a key feature of IPv6 standard.  Even though network nodes in IEEE
   802.16(e) can configure its link local address using the 48-bit MAC
   address, they undergo in guaranteeing the uniqueness of the
   configured address because the standard IPv6 stateless auto-
   configuration [RFC2462] mandates the multicasting DAD procedure.

   The third problem introduced in deploying IPv6 over IEEE 802.16(e)
   networks is applying the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4068]
   owing to the difficulty in utilizing the layer 2 handover
   information.  From RFC 4068, mobile node is recommended to send FBU
   (Fast Binding Update) message to the PAR (Previous Access Router)
   based on the accurate target BS information on the connected link to
   operate as predictive mode.  In IEEE 802.16e [IEEE 802.16e], the
   mobile subscriber station decides the ultimate target base station
   and sends the MOB_HO-IND message to the serving BS to notify the
   decided target BS information which results in disabling any IPv6
   packet transfer on that link.  Therefore, fast handover processing
   needs to intervene between the layer 2's target decision and the
   MOB_HO-IND message transfer.  Note that, this kind of intervention
   can be achieved only through special implementations probably
   delaying layer 2 processing.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
