Abstract

   Intent was defined as an abstract high-level policy (or instruction)
   used to trigger network operations (not only configuration aspects,
   but also continuous tuning to adjust the measured/actual network
   state to an expected state). This document describes the intent-
   driven management architecture, its key elements, and interfaces.

1. Introduction

   The digital transformation and booming applications and new services
   (e.g., AR/VR) lead to a rapid growth in the variety and volume of
   traffic forwarded by underlying networks (including data centers).
   Existing network technologies and the limited operation and
   management manpower,  make it more challenging. To support efficient
   and faster service delivery (by means of high level of automation) ,

   the network must evolve from a static resource management system to
   a more dynamic system that consistently and continuousily meets
   business goals.

   The concept of Intent-driven management was proposed to deal with
   this issue. This is a networking model in which high level
   abstracted business requirements or business request, i.e.,
   "intents", are formally defined and then the network continuously
   monitors whether these "intentions" are met. Such high-level
   abstracted business request are translated into actions (including
   configuration) and maintained by a set of management function blocks
   in one or more network management systems.



    [RFC7575] defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to
   operate the network.  Intent management system includes an interface
   for users/applications to input requests and an engine to translate
   the intents into the network actions and manage their lifecycle.
   This document describes an Intent-driven architecture, its elements,
   and interfaces.

                Figure 1 Intent-driven Management Framework

   In the architecture of intent-driven management, the intent
   orchestration layer (hereinafter referred to as intent layer)
   consists of four functional modules, which are "intent management",
   "translation", "verification", and "decision" module.



Sun, et al.            Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Intent-based management framework          July 2019


   Combined with the request/experience from upper layer (including
   operators, administrators,users or applications. The different roles
   of identities in the network may cause different levels of
   abstraction involved in the intent request. The term "user" in this
   framework refers to all the entities who make intent requests), the
   intent-driven management system can collect the intent request, map
   out appropriate policy, verify correctness and then deploy
   configuration automatically.

   When the configuration is executed in the network (i.e. network
   element) the verification module should verify the validity of
   configuration implementation based on real-time statu. Therefore,
   the effectiveness of the configuration is repeatedly verified and
   monitored to ensure that the user's intent is effectively processed
   and implemented. In case of any unexpected situation is encountered,
   it can automatically make remedial measures instantly, and provide
   feedback to the user to achieve a complete lifecycle.

   In the intent-driven networking, the application layer or service
   layer no longer directly interacts with network layer, but
   communicates indirectly with the network layer through the
   intermediate intent layer with certain technical agreement.

            Figure 2 The Model Process of Intent Transformation

   Figure 2 presents the overall intent transformation process. At the
   entrance, the user or administrator needs to express their desired
   "intent" according to the intent model, which is collected by
   management module in a high-level language.

Internet-Draft    Intent-based management framework          July 2019


   With the help of policy database, the translation module and
   decision module can analyze the intent model and transform it into
   specific strategy or policy, namely service / policy model.

   Eventually the policy will be mapped into concrete configuration
   action which can be deployed and executed in device level, therefore
   referred as device model.

   The network elements used in this framework are:

   Control Layer, which represents one or more entities that are able
   to control the operation and management of a network infrastructure
   (e.g., a network topology that consists of Network Elements).

   Network Element, which can interact with local or remote Control
   Layer in order to exchange information, such as configuration
   information, policy enforcement capabilities, and network status.



3.2. Sample Operation

   3.2.1 Intent layer

   (1) Intent management

   After receiving the user/application intent from the business layer,
   the intent orchestration layer needs to manage and coordinate these
   intents  eligible intent will be further submitted to the intent
   translation module for analysis and processing, and the ineligible
   intent will be fed back to the user by the management module, for
   further modification and adjustment; the management module also
   needs to interact with the decision module, and may receive the
   negative feedback from decision module when the configuration
   execution does not work as expected, in which cases the management
   module would require translation module to do secondary processing
   (take optimization procedure or remedial solution).

   In the process of intent demand, the module of the intent layer not
   only processes once, but continuously verifies and updates the
   configuration in the closed loop to finally realize the user's
   intent demand, so the management module also needs to regulate the
   life cycle of the intent demand.

   In addition, because the intent needs to be from different
   identities, they contain different levels of demands and


Sun, et al.            Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Intent-based management framework          July 2019


   abstractions. The abstraction level of the intent demand can be
   roughly divided into the following levels:

   Device level (Level 0): In a traditional networking, the
   configuration of the device can be manually performed by the network
   administrator, such as configuring the ACL (Access Control List) of
   the device to allow an IP X to access a port of the server;

   Network level (level 1): In some partially automated networking,
   network administrators usually do not manually configure specific
   commands on specific underlying devices. Instead, they set
   corresponding network permission settings through the controller,
   such as setting an IP X can access a port of the server through an
   access point AP

   Abstract intent level 1 (level 2): In a fully automated networking,
   we hope that the network configuration can be completed in the form
   of intent demands, but the intent demands should include specific
   details, for example: set " a user A can access a specific service
   of a server in the campus from the internal network or the external
   network. "

   Abstract intent level 2 (level 3): In this level, we hope that the
   network can be optimized spontaneously, and the intent defined at
   this level is more abstract than the previous level, for example, a
   specific group of users can access a specific service in any way;

   Abstract intent level 3 (level 4): In this level, the network
   belongs to a part of the autonomous network, and the network can
   automatically decide a more appropriate configuration scheme, and
   the expression of the intention can be more abstract, for example, "
   Every user can access a service in a suitable way ";

   Abstract intent level 4 (level 5): At the highest level of the
   intent abstraction model, we hope that the network can achieve full
   autonomy, automatically decision-making and spontaneous optimization
   based on real-time network state information anytime and anywhere.
   This level expresses the expectation that the network will decide
   the solution autonomously and never fail.

   According to different levels of intent demands, the configuration
   should also be classified into different levels. Therefore, the
   management module needs to handle and treat the levels of "intent"-
   "configuration" one by one.

   (2) Intent translation



Sun, et al.            Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Intent-based management framework          July 2019


   The translation module needs to analyze the intent and formulate the
   corresponding configuration based on network status and analysis
   results in the intent-policy repository, and then output the
   configuration plan to the verification module. When the negative
   feedback of the management module is received subsequently, the
   intent analysis and translation module is also responsible for the
   dynamic adjustment and re-enactment of the strategy to finally
   achieve the user's intention; if the positive feedback is received,
   the configuration is handed over to the control layer. The scope of
   intent includes several aspects including access control, bandwidth
   management, QoS levels, security issue, energy consumption control,
   etc., which enables application providers and users to reasonably
   mobilize resources and self-service as needed.

   In the process of analyzing intent demands, first,the translation
   module needs to translat and split the semantics contained in the
   intent demand, because user-initiated intent demands are often
   complex and more natural-oriented, and to facilitate subsequent
   processing, the translation module needs to be translated and
   splited according to a specific model. In this step, the method and
   result of natural language processing (NLP) in the field of
   artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to train the AI agent as an
   auxiliary, and the analysis result of the AI auxiliary module is
   used as a reference for the translation module.

   (3) Verification module

   The verification module has two functions: one is the execution
   verification of the configuration, that is, the configuration plan
   obtained during the translation process needs to be verified whether
   it can be executed in the actual network environment according to
   the real-time network status, and provide relevant information to
   the decision module as feedback; the second function is validity
   verification, for the reason that, when the configuration is
   actually executed, the network status may not change as expected, in
   which cases, it is necessary to verify whether the execution of the
   configuration works out as expected and whether the configuration
   meets the user's intent. If the expected effect is achieved, the
   verification result is fed back to the decision module; if the
   verification fails, the "intent"-"configuration" translation
   procedure needs to be performed again.

   The network is dynamically changing, so network verification should
   be continuous in real time. The verification module is responsible
   for monitoring the global information in the network, especially
   those that have an impact on the intent of the implementation. The


Sun, et al.            Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Intent-based management framework          July 2019


   verification module needs to quickly reflect the monitoring
   information to the decision module to ensure that the execution of
   the configuration does not cause conflicts.

   (4) Decision module

   The decision module is responsible for the overall monitoring of the
   network status and configuration. It can process the data
   transmitted by the verification module, and then decide whether the
   configuration can be delivered to control layer. The decision module
   supports empirical knowledge from top administrators to help make
   decisions. When the user's intent is not implemented or the network
   status is getting abnormal, the decision module needs to make
   optimization or remedial measures by notifing the intent management
   module and the translation module to make prompt response.

     5 Policy repository

   Regarding the storage of the intent model and the policy model by
   the policy repository, we must consider the different levels of the
   intent model and the policy model, and also consider under what
   conditions the data will be updated. Policy repository as a database
   of "intent" - "configuration" information should be able to interact
   with the intent management module and the translation module,
   provide relevant data for the intent model for the intent management
   module, and provide mapping between the "intent" and "configuration"
   for the translation module. According to the identity of the user,
   the abstraction level involved in different intent demands also
   needs to be graded. For the policy repository, the mapping between
   "intent" and "configuration" should be one-to-one correspondence at
   the abstract level.

   When the translation module finds that an "intent"-"configuration"
   mapping relationship exists in the policy repository, it cannot be
   directly deployed to the network layer, but also through the
   executable verification of the verification module, and then the
   decision-making module makes a decision whether to issue the
   decision, because the execution of the configuration needs to
   consider the actual network environment and state. When the
   management module or the translation module obtains the intent model
   or the configuration model that is not in the policy repository,
   after the intent demand is implemented, the new mapping information
   should also be updated by the management module into the policy
   repository to ensure subsequent use.

   3.2.2 Control layer

Internet-Draft    Intent-based management framework          July 2019


    (1) Configuration delivery

   In an intent-driven networking, in consideration of the
   configuration set of the intent layer output, the intent layer
   performs configuration control and further delivery to the control
   layer through the downward interface to ensure that the
   configuration can be smoothly delivered to the network layer for
   execution. The configuration delivery module requires further fine-
   grained distribution, according to different network structures such
   as wired access or wireless access, virtual network infrastructure
   or physical network facilities, to achieve the ability of different
   networks to work together.

    (2) Network status collection

   The downward interface of the control layer should be able to
   perceive the physical or logical topology of the underlying network
   layer, network traffic, network device status, etc., and the upward
   interface can transmit information to the intent layer to assist the
   intent orchestration layer to formulate a reasonable scheduling
   strategy and better utilize the capabilities of the intelligent
   communication network.

    3.2.3 Network layer

    (1) Configuration execution

   The configuration execution function can be configured with pre-
   defined rules and templates, or can be fully dynamically configured
   according to the controller: for example, through the control
   protocol between the controller and the network forwarding device,
   the network layer receives the result of the configuration control
   function and performs the forwarding and processing of the
   configuration.

   (2) Network status awareness

   In an intent-driven intelligent communication networking, the
   sensing information collection function supports the collection of
   network topology information, network traffic information, and
   business path information, and can interact in real time through
   dynamic protocols. Especially when the configuration is actually
   executed, feedback information can be output to the network state
   collection function for subsequent verification.
