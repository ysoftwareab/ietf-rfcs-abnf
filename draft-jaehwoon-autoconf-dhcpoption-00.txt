Internet-Draft       DHCP options for MANET prefix     Febraury 18, 2009


Abstract 

   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a wireless network composed of
   mobile nodes which can communicate with each other via multiple
   wireless links. The modified MANET architecture is now standardizing
   that can resolve the multi-link subnet issue. In this draft, we 
   define two DHCP options in order that a MANET Router (MR) gets the 
   network prefix assigned to the connected MANET. The one is the MANET
   prefix request option used by a MR when it wants to know the network
   presix allocated to the MANET. The other is the MANET prefix option
   that DHCP server provides the MANET prefix to the requesting MR.

Internet-Draft       DHCP options for MANET prefix     Febraury 18, 2009


1. Introduction 


   The Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a wireless network composed of
   mobile nodes which can communicate with each other via multiple 
   wireless links[1]. When two nodes not within their transmission range
   want to communicate, they have to communicate via wireless multiple 
   hops. Thus a routing mechanism that can determine an end-to-end 
   multi-hop wireless route between two nodes is required. However, it 
   is also important an address auto-configuration mechanism that a node
   can automatically configure its address by itself.
   
   From the extenal connectivity point of view, the MANET can be 
   classified into the standalone MANET and the connected MANET[2]. 
   Standalone MANET is the MANET not connected to the global Internet.
   On the other hand, the connected MANET is the MANET connected to the
   global Internet by using the MANET border router (MBR). In the 
   connected MANET, one communicating with an end host is a MANET node 
   and the other end can be a MANET node within the same MANET or a host 
   within the Internet. Nodes in a connected MANET should be allocated 
   with Internet topologically correct global IP addresses.
   
   Previous researches on the MANET have considered an MANET as a single
   subnetwork, so all nodes in a MANET are assigned the same subnet 
   prefix, which is the multi-link subnet model. Recently, an Internet 
   document considering the issues that can occur in a multi-link subnet 
   was standardized[3]. In accordance with the documnet, the modified 
   MANET architecture that defines a MANET node (MN) as a composite of 
   one MANET router (MR) and zero or more hosts is currently on the 
   standardization process[4]. That is, a MANET is defined as a network
   composed of multiple MRs connected via wireless links. An MR should 
   know the network prefix allocated to the MANET that it is connected. 
   However, till now there is no method to define how to know the 
   MANET's network prefix.
   
   In this draft, we define the DHCP options for an MR to get network 
   prefix allocated to the connected MANET.

         Figure 1. An example of address configuration in the MANET

   Figure 1 shows an address autoconfiguration example of a MANET based 
   on the modified MANET architecture. An MR has two types of 
   interfaces, one or more MANET interfaces and zero or more IP 
   interfaces. The MANET interface is used to communicate with other MRs
   and the IP interface is connected to the hosts. The MANET and the 
   IP interfaces should be allocated with different network prefixes.
   How to assign a network prefix to a MANET interface is out of the 
   scope of this draft. One possible method is to use the scope-extended 
   Router Advertisement (SERA) ICMP message[5]. Moreover, different IP 
   interfaces should be allocated with different network prefixes. How 
   to assign a network prefix to an IP interface is out of the scope of 
   this draft. One possible method is to use the DHCP prefix option[6].
   
   The network prefixes allocated to IP interfaces should be subset of 
   the network prefix allocated to the MANET, that is, MANET prefix. 
   How an MR gets the MANET prefix is described in this draft.
   
   An MR send an DHCP request message containing MANET prefix request 
   option in order to get the network prefix allocated to the MANET. 
   The option format is defined in Section 3.1. The DHCP server sends a 
   DHCP reply message including the MANET prefix option containing the 
   MANET prefix in response to the MANET prefix request option. The 
   option format for the MANET prefix option is defined in Section 3.2. 
   How to use the MANET prefix by an MR is out of the scope of this 
   draft. One possibility is that an MR within an MANET can decide 
   whether the destination host resides in the same MANET based on the
   destination address of the received IP packet.
