Abstract

   The Control and maintenance protocol for providing various Layer 1
   and Layer 2 services over a Packet Switched Network has been
   described in [1]. This document pre-allocates the fixed Pseudo-wire
   identifier , and other fixed protocol values that are to be assigned
   by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119


2. IANA Considerations

   Unless otherwise noted in this document, the value of 0 is reserved,
   and MUST not be used.


2.1. Pseudowire Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Type".  These are 15-
   bit values.  PW Type values 1 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA
   using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. PW Type values
   128 through 32767 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come
   First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. In addition to the "First
   Come First Served" policy, an internet draft describing the intended
   use for the code point to be allocated, MUST exists at the time of
   allocation. This internet draft MAY be targeted to become an
   informational RFC, but in any case the allocation will not depend in
   any way on the status of the internet draft.  A Pseudowire Type
   description of up to 65 characters is required for any assignment
   from this registry. The registry MUST contain the name of the

2.2. Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Interface Parameter
   Sub-TLV types". Sub-TLV types 1 through 127 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. Sub-TLV
   types 128 through 255 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First
   Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. In addition to the
   "First Come First Served" policy, an internet draft describing the
   intended use for the code point to be allocated, MUST exists at the
   time of allocation. This internet draft MAY be targeted to become an
   informational RFC, but in any case the allocation will not depend in
   any way on the status of the internet draft.  The registry MUST
   contain the name of the internet draft at the time of code point
   allocation.

   Any assignments requested from this registry require a description up
   to 54 characters. Furthermore a length specified as follows:
     - A decimal integer
     - Text as follows:"up to X", where X is a decimal integer
     - Up to 3 different decimal integers.

   is also required for assignment from this registry.

   Initial Pseudowire Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type allocations are
   specified below:
   Parameter ID Length    Description

      0x01        4       Interface MTU in octets
      0x02        4       Maximum Number of concatenated ATM cells
      0x03     up to 82   Optional Interface Description string
      0x04        4       CEP/TDM Payload Bytes
      0x05        4       CEP options
      0x06        4       Requested VLAN ID
      0x07        6       CEP/TDM bit-rate
      0x08        4       Frame-Relay DLCI Length
      0x09        4       Fragmentation indicator
      0x0A        4       FCS retention indicator
      0x0B      4/8/12    TDM options
      0x0C        4       VCCV parameter

   Note that the Length field is defined as the length of the Sub-TLV
   including the Sub-TLV type and length field itself.

2.3. Attachment Identifiers

2.3.1. Attachment Individual Identifier Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Attachment Individual Identifier
   (AII) Type". These are 8-bit values. AII Type values 1 through 127
   are to be assigned by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined
   in RFC2434. AII Type values 128 through 255 are to be assigned by
   IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434.
   In addition to the "First Come First Served" policy, an internet
   draft describing the intended use for the code point to be allocated,
   MUST exists at the time of allocation. This internet draft MAY be
   targeted to become an informational RFC, but in any case the
   allocation will not depend in any way on the status of the internet
   draft. The registry MUST contain the name of the internet draft at
   the time of code point allocation. An AII Type description of up to
   65 characters is required for any assignment from this registry.


2.3.2. Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Attachment Group Identifier (AGI)
   Type".  These are 8-bit values. AGI Type values 1 through 127 are to
   be assigned by IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in
   RFC2434. AGI Type values 128 through 255 are to be assigned by IANA,
   using the "First Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. In
   addition to the "First Come First Served" policy, an internet draft
   describing the intended use for the code point to be allocated, MUST
   exists at the time of allocation. This internet draft MAY be targeted
   to become an informational RFC, but in any case the allocation will
   not depend in any way on the status of the internet draft.  The
   registry MUST contain the name of the internet draft at the time of
   code point allocation. AGI Type description of up to 65 characters is
   required for any assignment from this registry.


2.4. Pseudo Wire Status

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Status Codes". These
   are bitstrings of length 32. Status bits 0-23 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in RFC2434. PW Status
   Bits 24 through 31 are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come
   First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. In addition to the "First
   Come First Served" policy, an internet draft describing the intended
   use for the code point to be allocated, MUST exists at the time of
   allocation. This internet draft MAY be targeted to become an
   informational RFC, but in any case the allocation will not depend in
   any way on the status of the internet draft. The registry MUST

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-iana-allocation-11.txt        June 2005


   contain the name of the internet draft at the time of code point
   allocation.  Any requests for allocation from this registry must
   include a 65 character description.  Initial Pseudowire Status Codes
   value allocations are as follows:

      0x00000000 - Pseudo Wire forwarding ( clear all failures )
      0x00000001 - Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding
      0x00000002 - Local Attachment Circuit ( ingress ) Receive Fault
      0x00000004 - Local Attachment Circuit ( egress ) Transmit Fault
      0x00000008 - Local PSN-facing PW ( ingress ) Receive Fault
      0x00000010 - Local PSN-facing PW ( egress ) Transmit Fault


3. Security Considerations

   This document specifies only fixed identifiers, and not the protocols
   used to carry the encapsulated packets across the network.  Each such
   protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those issues
   are not affected by the identifiers specified herein.
