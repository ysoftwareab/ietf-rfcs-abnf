1.  Introduction

   Optimized Mobile IPv6 [OMIPv6] protocol specifies a new route
   optimization (RO), which reduces the amount of signaling messages,
   the handover latency and improves the overall security.

   However, OMIPv6 protocol lacks privacy support, namely anonymity or
   pseudonymity, and unlinkability aspects.  Supporting these privacy
   aspects in OMIPv6 would allow a mobile user to move outside its home
   network without disclosing its real IPv6 home address nor linking its
   different moves together, and thereby preventing eavesdroppers from
   the ability to correlate its actions at the IP layer.

   This document describes privacy extensions to the OMIPv6 protocol.

3.  Glossary

   Anonymity

      Anonymity ensures that a user may use a resource or service
      without disclosing the user's identity.

      Anonymity in wireless networks means that neither the mobile node
      nor its system software shall by default expose any information,
      that allows any conclusions on the owner or current use of the
      node.

      Consequently, in scenarios where a device and/or network
      identifiers are used (e.g., MAC address, IP address), neither the
      communication partner nor any outside attacker should be able to
      disclose the relationship between the respective identifier and
      the user's identity.

   Pseudonymity

      Pseudonymity is a weaker property related to anonymity.  It means
      that one cannot identify an entity, but it may be possible to
      prove that two pseudonymous acts were performed by the same
      entity.

   Unlinkability

      Two events are unlinkable if they are no more and no less related
      than they are related concerning the a-priori knowledge.

      Unlinkability ensures that a user may make use of resources or
      services without others being able to link the use of these
      services together.

      In hiding the mobile node's current location, unlinkability
      feature removes any possible correlation between two successive IP
      handovers performed by the same mobile node.

   For more information about privacy aspects and location privacy
   please refer to [MOMIPRIV].

4.  Problem Statement

   OMIPv6 protocol introduces a new route optimization (RO) mode, which
   significantly reduces the load of signaling messages, i.e., mainly by
   eliminating the HoTI/HoT messages, offers a semi-permanent security
   association (SA) between the mobile node (MN) and the correspondent
   node (CN) and improves the overall security of the communication.

   However, OMIPv6 allows the CN and any potential eavesdropper located
   on the path between the MN and the CN to first identify the mobile
   node via its IPv6 Home Address (HoA) and to trace its movements in
   real time across the Internet, thus seriously violating its privacy.
   Such scenario is feasible by simply looking into the Binding Update
   (BU) message(s) sent by the MN to the CN, which carries among other
   parameters, the MN's IPv6 Home Address (HoA) and its new current
   topological location, i.e., disclosed in its IPv6 care-of address
   (CoA).

   In addition to the BU message(s), the eavesdropper can learn and
   trace the MN's movements by looking into the data packets exchanged
   with the CN.  In fact, the main RO mode (detailed in [MIPv6]) defined
   two mobility extension headers, which carry the MN's home address.
   The first one is the Home Address Option (HAO) and is inserted in
   each data packet sent by the MN to the CN on the direct path.  The
   second one is a Routing Header (RH) and is inserted in each data
   packet sent by the CN to the MN on the direct path.

   Based on the above, it appears that in order to keep the exchange of
   data packets between the two endpoints flowing on the direct path,
   only the home address can be hidden from both the CN and any
   potential eavesdropper(s) located on the direct path.

   Consequently, any solution for the privacy problem in OMIPv6 MUST
   prevent the CN from falling back to the bidirectional (BT) mode
   (detailed in [MIPv6]) under any circumstance(s), since data packets
   sent by the CN are addressed to the MN's HoA.

   However, replacing the real MN's HoA with a static/dynamic pseudo-HoA
   does not solve the entire privacy problem as described above.  In
   fact, using static/dynamic pseudo-HoA(s) can still allow the
   eavesdropper to correlate between MN's movements across the Internet,
   thus easily breaking the unlinkability feature.  Such correlation can
   be accomplished by simply tracing the sequence number carried by each
   BU message.  The seriousness of such correlation is tightly related
   to how difficult is for the eavesdropper to discover the MN's real
   HoA (e.g., based on prior knowledge and/or other identifier(s), which
   are already known or can be discovered at a further stage, etc).  In
   fact, learning the MN's HoA can reveal all its pseudo-HoAs and their



Haddad, et al.          Expires September 6, 2006               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              OMIPv6 Anonymity                  March 2006


   corresponding CoAs as well as the exact time of each movement.

   The unlinkability feature can also be broken if an eavesdropper is
   able to correlate between two data packets exchanged between the MN
   and the CN and carrying different CoAs, but associated with the same
   pseudo-HoA.  In this case, the correlation may also reveal the exact
   time of the MN's movement(s), regardless of the BU message content.

   In addition to the correlation based on tracing data packets only,
   which provides the possibility to correlate between different
   movements, another correlation becomes possible between the signaling
   messages and the data packets.  In fact, tracing the BU messages in
   addition to the data packets can also help the eavesdropper correlate
   between the MIPv6 signaling messages and the data packets (namely the
   pseudo-HoA and/or CoA carried by the BU message with the address(es)
   and/or pseudo-address(es) carried by the data packet).

   Consequently, we argue that any solution for privacy related to the
   network layer mobility only should also offer the unlinkability
   feature by fulfilling the following requirements:

   o  prevent disclosing the MN's HoA in any BU message.

   o  prevent any correlation between BU messages by avoiding using the
      same pseudo-HoA in more than one BU message.

   o  prevent any correlation between the BU messages via the sequence
      number.

   o  prevent any correlation between data packets exchanged with the
      current CoA and the next BU message sent after performing an IP
      handover.

   o  prevent any correlation between data carried by the BU message and
      data packets exchanged directly after sending/receiving BU/BA
      message(s).

   Finally, it should be noted that any potential solution, which
   addresses privacy as motivated above, should take into consideration
   the scenario where a mobile node starts communicating with a CN from
   its home network before switching to a foreign network(s).

5.  Proposed Solution

   Our suggested solution can be used regardless of whether the MN is
   establishing its session from its home network or from a visited
   network.  It consists of three components:

   1.  the "P" bit that is carried in the Pre-Binding Update (PBU), the
       Pre-Binding Test (PBT) and the Binding Update (BU) message; this
       bit demands additional processing guidelines (including special
       sequence number handling).

   2.  replacing the home address inserted in the HAO with an ephemeral
       identifier.

   3.  associating the interface identifier (iid) of the MN's home
       address with the statistically unique cryptographically-Based
       Identifiers (described in [CBID]).

   As a first step, a Pre-Binding Update (PBU) message is sent directly
   from the MN to the CN.  The PBU message carried a newly introduced
   Privacy (P) bit set and thereby asks the CN to skip any home address
   test, and also to avoid any possible fallback to the BT mode during
   the subsequent data packets exchange.

   The MN MUST set the "P" bit in the PBU message, regardless of the
   MN's location (i.e., also if located in its home network), and in the
   BU message sent after receiving the Pre-Binding Test (PBT) message
   from the CN.

   Additionally, the MN MUST replace the home address inserted in the
   Home Address Option (HAO) with a "Virtual Home Address" (VHoA).  The
   VHoA sent in the first BU message MUST be a statistically unique
   crypto-based identifier (CBID).  Note that using the CBID technology
   in Mobile IPv6 for privacy purposes has been introduced in [MIPriv].

   During the initial signaling messages exchange between the two
   endpoints, and in order to enable the CN to check if it is still
   talking to the same MN when receiving the first BU message, the MN
   MUST insert in the PBU message the value obtained from hashing the
   VHoA (note that for the initial case, the VHoA is the CBID, thus the
   value sent in the PBU message is equal to SHA1(CBID)).

   After receiving the PBU message, the CN computes a challenge from the
   MN's CoA, the content of the HAO and a local secret.  Then it inserts
   the challenge in the PBT message and sends it to the MN.  When the MN
   gets the PBT message, it sends a BU message carrying the "P" bit, the
   challenge and the real CBID (i.e., the CBID is inserted in the HAO).
   Note that the iid of the MN's CoA sent in the PBU and the BU messages



Haddad, et al.          Expires September 6, 2006               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              OMIPv6 Anonymity                  March 2006


   SHOULD be generated from hashing the CBID in the following way:

   iid(CoA) = First(64, SHA1(CBID))

   Where:

   o  SHA1 is a hashing function

   o  CBID is a crypto-based identifier

   o  First(size,input) is a function used to indicate truncation of the
      input data so that only the first bits remain to be used.

   o  iid is the interface identifier

   Upon receiving the first BU message with the "P" bit set, the CN
   starts by checking its validity, which is done by hashing the content
   of the HAO, i.e., the CBID, and comparing the first 64 bits of the
   resulting hash with the CoA's iid.  After that, it will re-compute
   the challenge and compare it to the one sent in the BU message.  The
   third step after a successful validation would be to create an entry
   in the BCE for the MN's VHoA and CoA.  The CN MUST also generate a
   long lifetime shared secret (i.e., SKbm) and sends it to the MN in
   the BA message as described in [OMIPv6].

   The presence of the "P" bit in the BU message serves another purpose,
   which is to request the CN to replace the sequence number carried by
   the BU message, in its BCE with the "next" value, i.e., the value
   expected in the next BU message sent by the MN.  Such value is called
   the "Sequence Value" SQV and is used to prevent replay attacks and to
   allow the CN to identify the MN's corresponding entry in its BCEs
   when processing a BU message carrying the "P" bit.

   In OMIPv6, each time the MN sends a BU message, it MUST increase the
   32-bit sequence number value.  When the privacy extensions introduced
   in this document are used, then both endpoints MUST increment the SQV
   with a constant value equal to the one obtained from hashing the
   SKbm.  Finally, the increased SQV is hashed, inserted by the MN into
   the BU message and sent it to the CN.

   The two entities MUST compute the next SQV (nSQV) in the following
   way:

   Khbm = SHA1(SKbm)

   nSQV = First(32, SHA1((pSQV) | Khbm))

   Where:



Haddad, et al.          Expires September 6, 2006               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              OMIPv6 Anonymity                  March 2006


   o  SKbm is a long lifetime binding management key

   o  Khbm is the hashed binding management key

   o  pSQV is the previous SQV, i.e., SQV sent in the last BU message
      sent bythe MN and already processed by the CN.

   o  nSQV is the hash value of the next SQV computed during updating
      the BCE with the BU message carrying the pSQV.

   The CN MUST compute and store the nSQV during creating or updating
   the MN's corresponding entry in its BCE, and the MN MUST compute and
   send a new SQV in all subsequent BU messages sent to the CN.

   In addition, all subsequent BU messages sent after the first one
   SHOULD carry each a different VHoA, which is generated from hashing
   the nCoA, i.e., nVHoA is equal to SHA1(nCoA), sent in the message.

   However, it should be noted that the CN SHOULD NOT store in the MN's
   corresponding entry the new CoA (nCoA) and new VHoA (nVHoA) carried
   in the BU message.  In fact, besides computing the nSQV and storing
   it in the corresponding entry, the CN SHOULD also compute another
   pair of addresses (CoA, VHoA) to be used in the data packets exchange
   following the BCE creation or update.  These two addresses are called
   "expected CoA" (eCoA) and "expected VHoA" (eVHoA).

   The two expected addresses are computed in the following way:

   iid(eCoA) = First(64, SHA1(Khbm | nCoA Subnet Prefix))

   eVHoA = SHA1(eCoA)

   Where:

   o  nCoA is the MN's care-of address sent in the BU message.

   o  eVHoA is the pseudo-home address carried in the HAO and RH headers
      in all data packets.

   The subnet prefix of the nCoA MUST be the same as the one sent by the
   MN in the BU message (note that this technique is similar to the one
   defined in [HBA]).  As mentioned above, the CN MUST update the MN's
   entry in its BCE with the eCoA and eVHoA.  However, the BA message
   sent to the MN MUST carry the nCoA and nVHoA.

   When the MN sends a BU message carrying the "P" bit, the SQV MUST be
   used alone by the CN to detect the presence of an entry corresponding
   to the MN in its BCE.  If an entry containing the same SQV is found,

   then the CN SHOULD proceed to check the signature before updating the
   corresponding entry with the eCoA, eVHoA and nSQV.

6.  Packet Format

   This proposal defines a new bit called the Privacy (P) bit to be
   added to the Pre-BU and BU messages.  The MN MUST set the "P" bit in
   both messages and in all subsequent BU messages as long as it needs
   to keep its real home IP address undisclosed.

   When used in the Pre-BU message, the "P" bit indicates to the CN to
   limit the address test to the CoA only and also to include the VHoA
   in computing the nonce value sent in the Pre-Binding Test (PBT)
   message.

   When used in the BU message, the "P" bit is used for three different
   purposes.  The first one is to ask the CN to use the sequence number
   to locate the MN's corresponding BCE.  The second one is to notify
   the CN to NOT send any data packet carrying the MN's home pseudo-
   address, i.e., VHAO, as destination address.

   The third purpose is to ask the CN to compute the eCoA, the eVHoA,
   the new SQV and store them in the MN's corresponding BCE.

   When used in the Pre-BU message, the structure of the message will be
   as it follows:

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This memo describes an extension, which makes the MN's real identity
   anonymous for both the CN and any malicious eavesdropper(s) located
   on the path between the MN and the CN.

   Our solution aims to present the MN's HoA as any other CoA that the
   MN may use during its movements across the Internet.  However, our
   solution is based on the assumption that the BU messages exchanged
   between the MN and its HA are protected with an ESP tunnel according
   to [MIPv6-IKE] and [MIPv6-IKEv2].

   The suggested solution provides the anonymity feature to the MN
   during exchanging data packets and signaling messages with the CN.
   It also provides the unlinkability feature during and after
   performing IP handovers, by making it difficult for an eavesdropper
   to correlate between two successive IP handoffs performed by the same
   MN.  The unlinkability between these events aims to enhance the
   anonymity feature.

   However, it should be noted that the unlinkability protection is
   limited against eavesdroppers located on the path between the MN and
   the CN and does not prevent the CN to trace the MN's movements in
   real time.

   The suggested solution allows the MN to select when and where the
   anonymity feature should be activated.  But it should be noted that
   it works only when the MN initiates the session.  Actually, when the
   CN initiates the session, it uses the MN's home address (HoA).  In
   such scenario, the MN can hide its current location from the CN by
   switching to the bidirectional tunneling mode.

   It is worth mentioning that the anonymity concept is very much
   context dependent.  In order to quantify anonymity with concrete
   situations, one would have to describe the system context, which is
   practically not always possible for large open systems [ANON].

   Consequently, the efficiency of the suggested solution is tightly
   related to two key factors: the diversity and load of the traffic
   circulating in parallel with the MN's traffic, on the same portion(s)
   of the direct path, which is monitored by an eavesdropper(s).

   Finally, the suggested solution strongly recommends using the Privacy
   Extension proposal [PRIVACY], in configuring the care-of address(es)
   sent by the MN in all BU messages except for the BU message sent
   after receiving a PBT message, i.e., in which the CoA is derived from
   the CBID.

8.  Security Considerations

   The suggested solution does not introduce new attacks nor does it
   amplify existing threats.  However, it is important to mention that
   it makes the switch to the MIPv6 BT mode impossible.

   The suggested solution aims to hide the mobile user's real identity
   when moving outside its home network or from its home network to
   foreign networks.  Making the MN anonymous (with regard to the used
   home address) to potential eavesdroppers may help to prevent attacks,
   thus improves the overall security.
