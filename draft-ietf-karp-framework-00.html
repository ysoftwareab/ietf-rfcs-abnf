<h1><br />Framework for Cryptographic Authentication of
    Routing Protocol Packets on the Wire<br />draft-ietf-karp-framework-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of
      "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop is documented
      in <a class='info' href='#RFC4948'>RFC 4948<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Davies, E., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Report from the IAB workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4948]. Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls
      for "[t]ightening the security of the core routing infrastructure." Four
      main steps were identified for improving the security of the routing
      infrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routing protocols'
      packets on the wire." One mechanism for securing routing protocol
      packets on the wire is the use of per-packet cryptographic message
      authentication, providing both peer authentication and message
      integrity. Many different routing protocols exist and they employ a
      range of different transport subsystems. Therefore there must
      necessarily be various methods defined for applying cryptographic
      authentication to these varying protocols. Many routing protocols
      already have some method for accomplishing cryptographic message
      authentication. However, in many cases the existing methods are dated,
      vulnerable to attack, and/or employ cryptographic algorithms that have
      been deprecated. This document is one of a series concerned with defining a roadmap of protocol
      specification work for the use of modern cryptogrpahic mechanisms and
      algorithms for message authentication in routing protocols. In particular, it
      defines the framework for a key management protocol that may be used to
      create and manage session keys for message authentication and integrity.
      The overall roadmap reflects the input of both the security area and routing
      area in order to form a jointly agreed upon and prioritized work list
      for the effort.

Introduction</h3>

<p>In March 2006 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop
      on the topic of "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that
      workshop is documented in <a class='info' href='#RFC4948'>RFC 4948<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Davies, E., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Report from the IAB workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4948].
      Section 8.1 of that document states that "A simple risk analysis would
      suggest that an ideal attack target of minimal cost but maximal
      disruption is the core routing infrastructure." Section 8.2 calls for
      "[t]ightening the security of the core routing infrastructure." Four
      main steps were identified for that tightening:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>More secure mechanisms and practices for
          operating routers. This work is being addressed in the OPSEC Working
          Group.
</li>
<li>Cleaning up the Internet Routing Registry repository [IRR], and
          securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
          for routing verifications. This work should be addressed through
          liaisons with those running the IRR's globally.
</li>
<li>Specifications for cryptographic validation of routing message
          content. This work will likely be addressed in the SIDR Working
          Group.
</li>
<li>Securing the routing protocols' packets on the wire
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document addresses the last bullet, securing the packets on the
      wire of the routing protocol exchanges. The document addresses Keying
      and Authentication for Routing Protocols, aka "KARP".

Terminology</h3>

<p>Within the scope of this document, the following words, when
        beginning with a capital letter, or spelled in all capitals, hold the
        meanings described to the right of each term. If the same word is used
        uncapitalized, then it is intended to have its common english
        definition.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>PSK</dt>
<dd>Pre-Shared Key. A key used by both peers in a
            secure configuration. Usually exchanged out-of-band prior to a
            first connection.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Routing Protocol</dt>
<dd>When used with capital "R" and "P"
            in this document the term refers the Routing Protocol for which
            work is being done to provide or enhance its peer authentication
            mechanisms.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>PRF</dt>
<dd>Pseudorandom number function, or sometimes
            called pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). An algorithm for
            generating a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties
            of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random, in that it is
            completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values
            that are passed into the function. An example is SHA-256.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>KDF</dt>
<dd>Key derivation function. A particular specified
            use of a PRF that takes a PSK, combines it with other inputs to
            the PRF, and produces a result that is suitable for use as a
            Traffic Key.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Identifier</dt>
<dd>The type and value used by one peer of an
            authenticated message exchange to signify to the other peer who
            they are. The Identifier is used by the receiver as a lookup index
            into a table containing further information about the peer that is
            required to continue processing the message, for example a
            Security Association (SA) or keys.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Identity Proof</dt>
<dd>A cryptographic proof for an asserted
            identity, that the peer really is who they assert themselves to
            be. Proof of identity can be arranged between the peers in a few
            ways, for example PSK, raw assymetric keys, or a more
            user-friendly representation of assymetric keys, such as a
            certificate.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Security Association or SA</dt>
<dd>The parameters and keys
            that together form the required information for processing secure
            sessions between peers. Examples of items that may exist in an SA
            include: Identifier, PSK, Traffic Key, cryptographic algorithms,
            key lifetimes.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>KMP</dt>
<dd>Key Management Protocol. A protocol used between
            peers to exchange SA parameters and Traffic Keys. Examples of KMPs
            include IKE, TLS, and SSH.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>KMP Function</dt>
<dd>Any actual KMP used in the general KARP
            solution framework
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Peer Key</dt>
<dd>Keys that are used between peers as the
            identity proof. These keys may or may not be connection specific,
            depending on how they were established, and what form of identity
            and identity proof is being used in the system.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Traffic Key</dt>
<dd>The actual key used on each packet of a
            message.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

        authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation. The focus for
        this effort, and the scope for this framework document, will be message
        authentication and packet integrity only. This work explicitly
        excludes, at this point in time, the other two tactics: privacy and
        non-repudiation. Since the objective of most routing protocols is to
        broadly advertise the routing topology, routing messages are commonly
        sent in the clear; confidentiality is not normally required for
        routing protocols. However, ensuring that routing peers truly are the
        trusted peers expected, and that no rogue peers or messages can
        compromise the stability of the routing environment is critical, and
        thus our focus. The other two explicitly excluded tactics, privacy and
        non-repudiation, may be addressed in future work.
</p>
<p>It is possible for routing protocol packets to be transmitted
        employing all four security tactics mentioned above using existing
        standards. For example, one could run unicast, layer 3 or above
        routing protocol packets through <a class='info' href='#RFC4303'>IPsec
        ESP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., &ldquo;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4303]. This would provide the added benefit of privacy, and
        non-repudiation. However, router platforms and systems have been fine
        tuned over the years for the specific processing necessary for routing
        protocols' non-encapsulated formats. Operators are, therefore, quite
        reluctant to explore new packet encapsulations for these tried and
        true protocols.
</p>
<p>In addition, at least in the case of BGP and LDP, these protocols
        already have existing mechanisms for cryptographically authenticating
        and integrity checking the packets on the wire. Products with these
        mechanisms have already been produced, code has already been written
        and both have been optimized for the existing mechanisms. Rather than
        turn away from these mechanisms, we want to enhance them, updating
        them to modern and secure levels.
</p>
<p>There are two main work phases for the roadmap, and for any
        Routing Protocol work undertaken as part of the roadmap.
        The first is to enhance the Routing Protocol's current authentication
        mechanism, ensuring it employs modern cryptographic algorithms and
        methods for its basic operational model, fulfilling the requirements
        defined in the Requirements section of the Design Guidelines document [**need reference**], and
        protecting against as many of the threats as possible as defined in
        the Threats section of the same dcoument. Many of the
        Routing Protocols' current mechanisms use manual keys, so the first
        phase updates will focus on shoring up the manual key mechanisms that
        exist.
</p>
<p>The second work phase is to define the use of a key management
        protocol (KMP) for creating and managing session keys used in the
        Routing Protocols' message authentication and data integrity
        functions. It is intended that a general KMP framework -- or a small
        number of frameworks -- can be defined and leveraged for many Routing
        Protocols.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the scope of this roadmap of work includes:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>

<p>The work also serves as an agreement between the Routing Area and
        the Security Area about the priorities and work plan for incrementally
        delivering the above work. This point is important. There will be
        times when the best-security-possible will give way to
        vastly-improved-over-current-security-but-admittedly-not-yet-best-security-possible,
        in order that incremental progress toward a more secure Internet may
        be achieved. As such, this document will call out places where
        agreement has been reached on such trade offs.
</p>
<p>This document does not contain protocol specifications. Instead, it
        defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed and sets
        a direction, a set of requirements, and a relative priority for
        addressing that specification work.
</p>
<p>There are a set of threats to routing protocols that are considered
        in-scope for this document/roadmap, and a set considered out-of-scope.
        These are described in detail in the Threats section of  [**somewhere**].

Goals</h3>

<p>The goals and general guidance for this work roadmap follow:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Provide authentication and integrity protection
            for packets on the wire of existing routing protocols
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Deliver a path to incrementally improve security
            of the routing infrastructure. The principle of crawl, walk, run
            will be in place. Routing protocol authentication mechanisms may
            not go immediately from their current state to a state containing
            the best possible, most modern security practices. Incremental
            steps will need to be taken for a few very practical reasons.
            First, there are a considerable number of deployed routing devices
            in operating networks that will not be able to run the most modern
            cryptographic mechanisms without significant and unacceptable
            performance penalties. The roadmap for any one routing protocol
            MUST allow for incremental improvements on existing operational
            devices. Second, current routing protocol performance on deployed
            devices has been achieved over the last 20 years through extensive
            tuning of software and hardware elements, and is a constant focus
            for improvement by vendors and operators alike. The introduction
            of new security mechanisms affects this performance balance. The
            performance impact of any incremental step of security improvement
            will need to be weighed by the community, and introduced in such a
            way that allows the vendor and operator community a path to
            adoption that upholds reasonable performance metrics. Therefore,
            certain specification elements may be introduced carrying the
            "SHOULD" guidance, with the intention that the same mechanism will
            carry a "MUST" in the next release of the specification. This
            gives the vendors and implementors the guidance they need to tune
            their software and hardware appropriately over time. Last, some
            security mechanisms require the build out of other operational
            support systems, and this will take time. An example where these
            three reasons are at play in an incremental improvement roadmap is
            seen in the improvement of <a class='info' href='#RFC4271'>BGP's<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Li, T., and S. Hares, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4271]
            security via the update of the TCP Authentication Option <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt'>(TCP-AO)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Touch, J., Mankin, A., and R. Bonica, &ldquo;The TCP Authentication Option,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;auth&#8209;opt] effort. It
            would be ideal, and reflect best common security practice, to have
            a fully specified key management protocol for negotiating TCP-AO's
            authentication material, using certificates for peer
            authentication in the keying. However, in the spirit of
            incremental deployment, we will first address issues such as
            cryptographic algorithm agility, replay attacks, TCP session
            resetting in the base TCP-AO protocol before we layer key
            management on top of it.

<dd>The deploy-ability of the improved security
            solutions on currently running routing infrastructure equipment.
            This begs the consideration of the current state of processing
            power available on routers in the network today.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>Operational deploy-ability - The
            acceptability of a solution will also be measured by how deployable the solution
            is by common operator teams using common deployment processes and
            infrastructures, i.e., we will try to make these solutions fit as
            well as possible into current operational practices or router
            deployment. This will be heavily influenced by operator input, to
            ensure that what we specify can -- and, more importantly, will --
            be deployed once specified and implemented by vendors. Deployment
            of incrementally more secure routing infrastructure in the
            Internet is the final measure of success. Measurably, we would
            like to see an increase in the number of surveyed respondents who
            report deploying the updated authentication mechanisms anywhere
            across their network, as well as a sharp rise in usage for the
            total percentage of their network's routers.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Interviews with operators show several points about routing
            security. First, over 70% of operators have deployed transport
            connection protection via TCP-MD5 on their EBGP <a class='info' href='#ISR2008'>[ISR2008]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McPherson, D. and C. Labovitz, &ldquo;Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> . Over 55% also deploy MD5 on their IBGP
            connections, and 50% deploy MD5 on some other IGP. The survey
            states that "a considerable increase was observed over previous
            editions of the survey for use of TCP MD5 with external peers
            (eBGP), internal peers (iBGP) and MD5 extensions for IGPs." Though
            the data are not captured in the report, the authors believe
            anecdotally that of those who have deployed MD5 somewhere in their
            network, only about 25-30% of the routers in their network are
            deployed with the authentication enabled. None report using IPsec
            to protect the routing protocol, and this was a decline from the
            few that reported doing so in the previous year's report.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>From my personal conversations with operators, of those using
            MD5, almost all report deploying with one single manual key
            throughout the entire network. These same operators report that
            the one single key has not been changed since it was originally
            installed, sometimes five or more years ago. When asked why,
            particularly for the case of BGP using TCP MD5, the following
            reasons are often given:
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Changing the keys triggers a TCP reset, and thus bounces
                the links/adjacencies, undermining Service Level Agreements
                (SLAs).
</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd>For external peers, difficulty of coordination with the
                other organization is an issue. Once they find the correct
                contact at the other organization (not always so easy), the
                coordination function is serialized and on a per peer/AS
                basis. The coordination is very cumbersome and tedious to
                execute in practice.
</dd>
<dt>C.</dt>
<dd>Keys must be changed at precisely the same time, or at
                least within 60 seconds (as supported by two major vendors) in
                order to limit connectivity outage duration. This is
                incredibly difficult to do, operationally, especially between
                different organizations.
</dd>
<dt>D.</dt>
<dd>Relatively low priority compared to other operatoinal
                issues.

<dt>E.</dt>
<dd>Lack of staff to implement the changes device by
                device.
</dd>
<dt>F.</dt>
<dd>There are three use cases for operational peering at play
                here: peers and interconnection with other operators, Internal
                BGP and other routing sessions within a single operator, and
                operator-to-customer-CPE devices. All three have very
                different properties, and all are reported as cumbersome. One
                operator reported that the same key is used for all customer
                premise equipment. The same operator reported that if the
                customer mandated, a unique key could be created, although the
                last time this occurred it created such an operational
                headache that the administrators now usually tell customers
                that the option doesn't even exist, to avoid the difficulties.
                These customer-uniqe keys are never changed, unless the
                customer demands so.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The main threat at play here is that a terminated employee from
            such an operator who had access to the one (or few) keys used for
            authentication in these environments could easily wage an attack
            -- or offer the keys to others who would wage the attack -- and
            bring down many of the adjacencies, causing destabilization to the
            routing system.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Whatever mechanisms we specify need to be easier than the
            current methods to deploy, and should provide obvious operational
            efficiency gains along with significantly better security and
            threat protection. This combination of value may be enough to
            drive much broader adoption.

<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>Address the threats enumerated above in the "Threats" section [**somewhere**] for each routing
            protocol, along a roadmap. Not all threats may be able to be
            addressed in the first specification update for any one protocol.
            Roadmaps will be defined so that both the security area and the
            routing area agree on how the threats will be addressed completely
            over time.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd>Create a re-usable architecture, framework, and
            guidelines for various IETF working teams who will address these
            security improvements for various Routing Protocols. The crux of
            the KARP work is to re-use that framework as much as possible
            across relevant Routing Protocols. For example, designers should
            aim to re-use the key management protocol that will be defined for
            BGP's TCP-AO key establishment for as many other routing protocols
            as possible. This is but one example.

Common Framework</h3>

<p>Each of the categories of routing protocols above will require
        unique designs for authenticating and integrity checking their
        protocols. However, a single underlying framework for delivering
        automatic keying to those solutions will be pursued. Providing such a
        single framework will significantly reduce the complexity of each step
        of the overall roadmap. For example, if each Routing Protocol needed
        to define its own key management protocol this would balloon the
        total number of different sockets that need to be opened and
        processes that need to be simultaneously running on an
        implementation. It would also significantly increase the run-time
        complexity and memory requirements of such systems running multiple
        Routing Protocols, causing perhaps slower performance of such systems.
        However, if we can land on a very small set (perhaps one or two) of
        automatic key management protocols, KMPs, that the various Routing
        Protocols can use, then we can reduce this implementation and run-time
        complexity. We can also decrease the total amount of time implementers
        need to deliver the KMPs for the Routing Protocols that will provide
        better threat protection.
</p>
<p>The components for the framework are listed here, and described
        in the next section:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Common Routing Protocol security mechanisms
</li>
<li>Specific Routing Protocol security mechanisms
</li>

<li>RoutingProtocol-to-KMP API

<p>The framework is modularized for how keys and security association
        (SA) parameters generally get passed from a KMP to a transport
        protocol. It contains three main blocks and APIs.

Framework Elements</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>Each element of the framework is described here:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  Common Routing Protocol security mechanisms -</dt>
<dd>In each case, the Routing Protocol will contain one or more 
            mechanism(s) for using session keys in their security option. The common mechanisms part will allow
            a routing protocol to receive updates from the KeyStore and to poll for updates from the KeyStore, including the passing of all possible required attributes relevant to that Routing Protocol.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o Specific Routing Protocol security mechanisms -</dt>
<dd>These parts will be specific to a
            particular Routing Protocol.  When
            the Routing Protocol uses a transport substrate, e.g., the way BGP,
            LDP and MSDP use TCP, then this applies to the security mechanism
            the includes that substrate.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>NOTE: the point of this two-layer approach is that there will be one generic abstraction layer that can sit on top of any/all Routing Protocols.  The hope is that the Routing Protocol Demon development teams can write this part once, and use it for any routing Protocol.  There may be evolution over time of the abstraction layer so as to contain capabilities and attribute definitions as needed by routing Protocols yet-to-be-addressed in this architecture.  However, the new Routing Protocol would still leverage all that had gone into the abstraction layer before.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  KeyStore -</dt>
<dd>Each implementation will also contain
            a protocol independent mechanism for storing keys, called the
            KeyStore. The KeyStore will have multiple different logical
            containers, one container for each Session Association or Multicast Session Association that any given
            Routing Protocol will need. The container will store the parameters needed for the SA or the MSA, for example, detalis of the authentication/encryption algorithms employed, the valid lifetime of the keys, the direction in which the key needs to be applied (inward/outward/both), the group SPI, a KeyID, etc.  A key stored here may be a Peer Key or
            a Traffic Key. Further details may be found in <a class='info' href='#I-D.polk-saag-rtg-auth-keytable'>[I&#8209;D.polk&#8209;saag&#8209;rtg&#8209;auth&#8209;keytable]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Polk, T. and R. Housley, &ldquo;Routing Authentication Using A Database of Long-Lived Cryptographic Keys,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#I-D.housley-saag-crypto-key-table'>[I&#8209;D.housley&#8209;saag&#8209;crypto&#8209;key&#8209;table]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R. and T. Polk, &ldquo;Database of Long-Lived Symmetric Cryptographic Keys,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Note that a specific Routing Protocol may utilize both communication between two peers and communication among groups of peers.  As an example, PIM-SM sends distant messages (Register and Register-Stop) using unicast, and "link-local" messages (Hello, Assert, Join/Prune) using multicast <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pim-sm-linklocal'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pim&#8209;sm&#8209;linklocal]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atwood, W., Islam, S., and M. Siami, &ldquo;Authentication and Confidentiality in PIM-SM Link-local Messages,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  Peer Key -</dt>
<dd>A key used between peers from which a
            traffic key is derived. An example is a Pre-Shared Key.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  Traffic Key -</dt>
<dd>The actual key used on each packet of
            a message. This key may be derived from the key existing in the
            KeyStore. This will depend on whether the key in KeyStore was a
            manual PSK for the peers, or whether a connection-aware KMP
            created the key. Further, it will be connection specific, so as to
            provide inter- and intra-connection replay protection.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  KMP -</dt>
<dd>There will be an automated key management
            protocol, KMP. This KMP will run between the peers. The KMP serves
            as a protected channel between the peers, through which they can
            negotiate and pass important data required to exchange proof of
            key identifiers, derive session keys, determine re-keying,
            synchronize their keying state, signal various keying events,
            notify with error messages, etc. As an analogy, in the IPsec
            protocol (<a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>RFC4301<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4301], <a class='info' href='#RFC4303'>RFC4303<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., &ldquo;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4303] and <a class='info' href='#RFC4306'>RFC4306<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4306]) IKEv2 is the KMP that runs
            between the two peers, while AH and ESP are two different base
            protocols that take session keys from IKEv2 and use them in their
            transmissions. In the analogy, the Routing Protocol, say BGP and
            LDP, are analogous to ESP and AH, while the KMP is analogous to
            IKEv2 itself.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o Identifiers - </dt>
<dd>A KMP is fed by identities. The
            identities are text strings used by the peers to indicate to each
            other that each are known to the other, and authorized to
            establish connections. Those identities must be represented in
            some standard string format, e.g. an IP address -- either v4 or
            v6, an FQDN, an RFC 822 email address, a Common Name [RFC PKI],
            etc. Note that even though routers do not normally have email
            addresses, one could use an RFC 822 email address string as a
            formatted identifier for a router. They would do so simply by
            putting the router's reference number or name-code as the "NAME"
            part of the address, left of the "@" symbol. They would then place
            some locational context in the "DOMAIN" part of the string, to the right
            of the "@" symbol. An example would be
            "rtr0210@sf.ca.us.company.com". This document does not suggest
            this string value at all. Instead, the concept is used only to
            clarify that the type of string employed does not matter. It also
            does not matter what specific text you chose to place in that
            string type. It only matters that the type of string -- and its
            format -- must be agreed upon by the two endpoints. Further, the
            string can be used as an identifier in this context, even if the
            string is not actually provisioned in its source domain. For
            example, the email address "rtr0210@sf.ca.us.company.com" may not
            actually exist as an email address in that domain, but that string
            of characters may still be used as an identifier type(s) in the
            routing protocol security context. What is important is that the
            community decide on a small but flexible set of Identifiers they
            will all support, and that they decide on the exact format of
            those string. The formats that will be used must be standardized
            and must be sensible for the routing infrastructure.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  Identity Proof - </dt>
<dd>Once the form of identity is
            decided, then there must be a cryptographic proof of that
            identity, that the peer really is who they assert themselves to
            be. Proof of identity can be arranged between the peers in a few
            ways, for example pre-shared keys, raw assymetric keys, or a more
            user-friendly representation of assymetric keys, such as a
            certificate. Certificates can be used in a way requiring no
            additional supporting systems -- e.g. public keys for each peer
            can be maintained locally for verification upon contact.
            Certificate management can be made more simple and scalable with
            the use of minor additional supporting systems, as is the case with
            self-signed certificates and a flat file list of "approved
            thumbprints". Self-signed certificates will have somewhat lower
            security properties than Certificate Authority signed certificates
            [RFC Certs]. The use of these different identity proofs vary in
            ease of deployment, ease of ongoing management, startup effort,
            ongoing effort and management, security strength, and consequences
            from loss of secrets from one part of the system to the rest of
            the system. For example, they differ in resistance to a security
            breach, and the effort required to remediate the whole system in
            the event of such a breach. The point here is that there are
            options, many of which are quite simple to employ and deploy.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  Profiles - </dt>
<dd>Once the KMP, Identifiers and Proofs
            mechanisms are converged upon, they must be clearly profiled for
            each Routing Protocol, so that implementors and deployers alike
            understand the different pieces of the solution, and can have
            similar configurations and interoperability across multiple
            vendors' devices, so as to reduce management difficulty. The
            profiles SHOULD also provide guidance on when to use which various
            combinations of options. This will, again, simplify use and
            interoperability.

<p>[after writing this all up, I'm not sure we really need the
        key_store in the middle. As long as we standardize fully all the calls
        needed from any Routing Protocol to any KMP, then there can be a
        generic hand-down function from the KMP to the Routing Protocol when
        the key and parameters are ready. Let's sleep on it.]
</p>
<p>[will need state machines and function calls for these APIs, as one
        of the work items. In essence, there is a need for a core team to
        develop the APIs out completely in order for the Routing Protocol
        teams to use them. Need to get this team going asap.]

<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  KMP-to-RoutingProtocol API - </dt>
<dd>There will be an API
            for the Routing Protocol to request a session key of the KMP, and
            be notified when the keys are available for it. The API will also
            contain a mechanism for the KMP to notify the Routing Protocol
            that there are new keys that it must now use, even if it didn't
            request those keys. The API will also include a mechanism for the
            KMP to receive requests for session keys and other parameters from
            the routing protocol. The KMP will also be aware of the various
            Routing Protocols and each of their unique parameters that need to
            be negotiated and returned.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  KeyStore-to-RoutingProtocol API -</dt>
<dd>There will be an
            API for Routing Protocol to retrieve (or receive; it could be a
            push or a pull) the keys from the KeyStore. This will enable
            implementers to reuse the same API calls for all their Routing
            Protocols. The API will necessarily include facility to retrieve
            other SA parameters required for the construction of the Routing
            Protocol's packets, such as key IDs or key lifetimes, etc.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o  KMP-to-KeyStore API -</dt>
<dd>There will be an API for the
            KMP to place keys and parameters into the KeyStore after their
            negotiation and derivation with the other peer. This will enable
            the implementers to reuse the same calls for multiple KMPs that
            may be needed to address the various categories of Routing
            Protocols as described in the section defining categories in the Design Guidelines document [**need reference**].
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to other business, administrative, and operational
        terms they must already exchange prior to forming first adjacencies,
        it is assumed that two parties deploying message authentication on
        their routing protocol will also need to decide upon acceptable
        security parameters for the connection. This will include the form and
        content of the identity each use to represent the other. It will also
        include the type of keys to be used, e.g. PSK, raw assymetric keys,
        certificate. Also, it will include the acceptable cryptographic
        algorithms, or algorithm suite. This agreement is necessary in order
        for each to properly configure the connection on their respective
        devices. The manner in which they agree upon and exchange this policy
        information is normally via phone call or written exchange, and is
        outside the scope of the KARP effort, but assumed to have occured. We
        take as a given that each party knows the identity types and values,
        key types and values, and acceptable cryptographic algorithms for both
        their own device and the peer that form the security policy for
        configuration on their device.
</p>
<p>Common Mechanisms - In as much as they exist, the framework will
        capture mechanisms that can be used commonly not only within a
        particular category of Routing Protocol and Routing Protocol to KMP,
        but also between Routing Protocol categories. Again, the goal here is
        simplifying the implementations and runtime code and resource
        requirements. There is also a goal here of favoring well vetted,
        reviewed, operationally proven security mechanisms over newly brewed
        mechanisms that are less well tried in the wild.

Key Management Protocol</h3>

<p>[[The following text needs a home.]]
</p>
<p>[[Manav]] Should there be some text on key rollover or keys expiring?  Who takes care of these events, the KMP or the Routing Protocol?  I believe that it should be the former.

</p>
<p>[[Greg]] If there is a kmp, then the kmp can put the new SA parameters (including keys) into the KeyStore. However, based on our experience with TCP-AO, there are several things that the base RoutingProtocol needs to do to handle key rollover so that no routing messages are dropped. Allowing for overlapping or multiple, simulatneously valid KeyIDs is one requirements. polling for updates, or receiving updates from, KeyStore is another requirement.  For now, however, it would be better to capture these in the threats-requirements document, and then let each routing protocol category design team figure out the details as apporpriate for their protocol(s).

KeyStore</h3>

<p>[[The following text needs a home.]]
</p>
<p>[[Greg]] If one continues down this thought exercise, one could imagine an IANA registry filled with attributes as would be required for any SA parameters that any KARP-following protocol would want / need to use, such that both the KMP-to-KeyStore API and the KeyStore-to-RtgProto API would reference that registry, and it would grow over time as new categories of RoutingProtocols find need for this or that attribute to make their specific SA's complete.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Routing Protocol Mechanisms</h3>

<p>[[Issue to be resolved]]
</p>
<p>[[Manav]] I am not sure I completely understand what would get into Common RtgProto auth mechanisms?
</p>
<p>[[Manav]] Is it some infrastructure that protocols like OSPF and ISIS can use, or all RPs (PIM, OSPFv3, etc) using IPSec may want to use?
</p>
<p>[[Greg]] Probably only those protocols taking keys from IKE directly (assuming IKEv2 would be the KMP, whic is still up for discussion), and not relevant to keys created from IKE for IPsec (IKE already knows how to pass keys SA parameters to IPsec).
</p>
<p>[[Manav]] If so, then some protocols (BGP?) may want KMP to directly speak to them, in which case KMP-to-RoutingProtocol API should also have a direct connection to Specific routing protocol auth security mechanism.
</p>
<p>[[Greg]] We discussed this on the planning call for the first draft. We decided that there are times when, as the routing protocol kicks-off, it sees that the protocol config calls for authentication. In this case, the routing protocol needs to tell the KMP that it needs keys and SA parameters. Also, though this isn't the exchange I agree with, we might decide that it is the RoutingProtocol's responsibility to tell the KMP when active keys are approaching expiry, and ask for new keys. (On this point, I favor the KMP keeping track of this, and negotiating new Keys for the RoutingProtocol when needed.) But we aren't done with that discussion yet. As we get into the detailed work on RoutingProtocol(s) categories, we may find other uses for the direct KMP-to-RoutingProtocol-Auth-Mechanism abstraction layer, so we decided to keep it.
</p>
<p>[[Manav]] On second thoughts, wouldnt KMP only interact with the KeyStore and RPs with Keystore - why would we want the RPs to speak to KMP?
</p>
<p>[[Greg]] See explanation directly above.
</p>
<p>[[Manav, later]] Would be extremely helpful if we can have a section with the pros and cons of having IKEv2 as the KMP as against defining a new KMP for RPs.
</p>
<p>[[Bill]] Unicast relationships may well use something such as IKEv2; multicast relationships will need to use a group key management protocol, such as GDOI some variant of GDOI.

<p>kmart-framework-00- (original submission, based on draft-lebovitz-karp-roadmap-00)
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>removed sections of the roadmap that are not part of the framework.
</li>
<li>promoted subsection on "Common Framework" to section, and separated part of it into a subsection on "Framework Elements".
</li>
<li>added section on Framework Components and three subsections for specific components.  Inserted "notes" on points that need to be resolved.
</li>
<li>added (empty) section on Framework APIs and three (empty) subsections for the specific APIs.
</li>
<li>made arrows in Figure 1 bi-directional.
</li>
<li>added "Manual Configuration" in Figure 1, so that the routing protocol's use of keys is decoupled from the mechanism used to derive and place those keys.
</li>
<li>made explicit the fact that the KeyStore contains various parameters for Security Associations (or Multicast Security Associations), not just keys.
</li>
<li>broke the Routing Protocol security mechanisms into "common" and "specific" parts
</li>
<li>re-ordered and augmented the "list of components" and the "list of framework elements" so that they contained the same components
</li>
<li>marked internal references that need to become external references, pending creation of the external documents.
</li>
<li>general grammatical corrections.
</li>
