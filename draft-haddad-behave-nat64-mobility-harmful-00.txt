1.  Introduction

   NAT64 technology described in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful],
   enables rapid IPv4 network conversion to a pure IPv6 stack while
   keeping possible the contact with the remaining IPv4 networks.  It
   follows that nodes attached to a NAT64-powered network operate with
   an IPv6 stack only.

   This memo aims to highlight potential NAT64 repercussions for mobile
   nodes using Mobile IPv6 ([I-D.ietf-mext-rfc3775bis]) and operating
   from behind a NAT64.

3.  NAT64 Incompatibility with Mobile IPv6

   It is interesting to start this section by mentioning that NAT
   technology in general has had from its infancy the rare feature of
   being incompatible with the Internet.  Hence, the described new
   incompatibility should not come as a surprise!

   NAT64 mechanism relies on DNS64 technology described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] to provide the querying host with a synthetic
   DNS response in which, the queried FQDN is locally translated to an
   IPv6 address using the v6 prefix assigned to the NAT64 v6 interface.
   By inserting the translated IPv6 address in the synthetic DNS
   response, the querying node is tempted to believe that the
   destination is also using an IPv6 stack which in turn, enables
   establishing a session between the two nodes.

   As NAT64 technology may have the potential of becoming widely
   deployed, we are tempted to study its behavior in the presence of a
   v6 mobility dimension.  For this purpose, we assume that a mobile
   node (MN) configured with an IPv6 home address (HoA) leaves its
   NAT64-powered home network and attaches to a foreign NAT64-powered
   network where it configures a new IPv6 address, i.e., care-of address
   (CoA).  In the following, we look into two scenarios which require
   using MIPv6 either to establish a new session or to try to switch the
   data packets exchange to the optimal path via using MIPv6 route
   optimization (RO) mode.

   In a first scenario, we consider that before detaching from its home
   network, the MN has established a session with a corresponding node
   (CN) which is attached to an IPv4 network.  However, due to the NAT64
   presence in the home network, the MN believes that it is talking with
   an IPv6-enabled CN and hence, it decides upon attaching to the new
   NAT64-powered foreign network, to run MIPv6 return routability (RR)
   procedure with the CN by sending first a home test init (HoTI)
   message via its home agent.  It is clear that such message will be
   discarded either by a "more" intelligent NAT64 (i.e., in which case
   it may be followed by an ICMP message sent to the MN) or by the CN.
   In both cases, the MN will correctly realize at some point that the
   RR procedure cannot succeed.  Consequently, there is no harm
   inflicted to the MN and more importantly, no data packet loss since
   the MN will keep using MIPv6 bidirectional tunneling (BT) mode.

   However, the situation becomes problematic when we consider another
   scenario in which, the MN decides to establish a session with the
   same CN from the foreign NAT64-powered network.  In such case, the MN
   will first obtain a synthetic DNS reply which presents the CN as
   being an IPv6-enabled node.  Based on that, the MN may either try to
   create a binding at the CN by running first the RR procedure which

   will ultimately fail (i.e., for the same reasons as in the first
   scenario) or more likely, will initiate the session with the CN by
   using the BT mode then switching to the RO mode.  In this case, the
   MN tunnels first its data packets to its HA without having them being
   intercepted by the foreign NAT64.  However, after reaching the HA,
   the data packets will most likely be dropped at some point.  This is
   due to the presence of the foreign NAT64 IPv6 prefix in the CN's IPv6
   address.

4.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes scenarios where a NAT64 can inflict harm to a
   mobile node visiting the associated network.
