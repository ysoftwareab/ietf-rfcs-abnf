                       Stitching LSP Association
               draft-hu-pce-stitching-lsp-association-01

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] proposed an association mechanism
   for a set of LSPs.

   This document defines the stitching LSP association type and
   stitching LSP association TLV for the inter-domain scenairo.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   which is used between a Path Computation Element (PCE) and a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) to enable computation of
   Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label
   Switched Path (TE LSP).  [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] proposed an
   association mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs in the context of
   a PCE.

   [I-D.xiong-pce-stateful-pce-sr-inter-domain] introduces the procedure
   and the PCEP extension to form the inter-domain MPLS data entries and
   the multiple LSPs from multiple contiguous domains need to be
   stitched to an end-to-end LSP in SR inter-domain scenario.

   This document proposes a new association object type called
   "stitching Association LSP type" and TLV called "Stitching LSP
   Association TLV" to associate a grouping of LSPs from multiple
   domains for inter-domain scenario.

2.  Conventions used in this document

2.1.  Terminology

   The terminology is defined as [RFC5440],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and
   [I-D.xiong-pce-stateful-pce-sr-inter-domain].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Stitching LSPs in SR-MPLS Inter-domain Scenario

   As described in [I-D.xiong-pce-stateful-pce-sr-inter-domain], the
   domains of the networks may be IGP Areas in stitching inter-domain
   scenario.  As Figure 1 shown, the multiple SR-MPLS domains may be
   interconnect with a ABR within areas.  The multiple LSPs in each
   domain can be stitched to an end-to-end LSP.  The LSP-1, LSP-2 and
   LSP-3 can be associated to a group.

4.1.  Stitching LSP Association Type and Group

   An association ID will be used to identify the group and a new
   Association Type is defined in this document, based on the generic
   Association object :

   Association Type (TBD) = Stitching LSP Association Group (SLAG).

   SLAG may carry optional TLVs including but not limited to :

   STITCHING-LSP-ASSOCIATION-TLV: Used to identify the role of stitching
   LSPs, described in Section 4.2.

   As [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] specified, the capability
   advertisement of the association types supported by a PCEP speaker is
   performed by defining a ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an
   OPEN object.  The association type which defined in this document
   should be added in the list and be advertised between the PCEP
   speakers before the stitching LSP association.

   Stitching LSP Association could be created dynamically or configured
   by the operator when operator-configured association is needed.

4.2.  Stitching LSP Association TLV

   The format of the Stitching LSP Association TLV is shown in Figure 1.

                  Figure 2: Stitching LSP Association TLV

   The fields of the Stitching LSP Association TLV are following:

   Type:16bits, it indicates the stitching LSP Association Group

   TLV: TBD2, the value is assigned by IANA).

   Length: the value is 4, it indicates the length of the TLV is 4
   bytes.

   Reserved: it is reserved for future use.

   Stitching LSP Association Flags-S:1bit, indicates stitching LSP of
   the source domain when it is set.

   Stitching LSP Association Flags-T:1bit, indicates stitching LSP of
   the transit domain when it is set.

   Stitching LSP Association Flags-D:1bit, indicates stitching LSP of
   the destination layer when it is set.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Association Object Type

   This document defines a new association type and TLV in Association
   object which originally defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].
   IANA is requested to make allocations from the registry, as follows:

      +--------+---------------------------------+------------------+
      | Value  |               Name              |    Reference     |
