                End Point Properties for Peer Selection
                       draft-deng-alto-p2p-ext-01

Abstract

   The initial purpose for ALTO protocol is to provide better than
   random peer selection for p2p networks.  The peer selection method
   does not only depend on the peer location, but also on other
   properties of a peering node.  In this document, we define endpoint
   property extensions besides peer location that will impact peer
   selection.

1  Introduction

   The initial purpose for ALTO protocol is to provide better than
   random peer selection for p2p networks.  The peer selection method
   does not only depend on the peer location, but also on other
   properties of a peering node.  In this document, we define extended
   endpoint property extensions that will impact peer selection.

2  Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   ALTO: Application Layer Traffic Optimization.  For ALTO protocol,
   please refer to [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

   DSL: Digital subscriber line, is a family of technologies that
   provides Internet access by transmitting digital data over the wires
   of a local telephone network.

   FTTB: Fiber To The Building, refers to fiber that reaches the
   boundary of the building.

   FTTH: Fiber To The Home, refers to fiber that reaches the the
   boundary of the living space.

3 End Point Extensions

   This document defines three endpoint property extensions for ALTO
   protocol for peer selection other than peer location.

3.1.  Endpoint Property Type: p2p_caching

   As described in [I-D.draft-deng-alto-p2pcache], P2P caching node can
   also act as p2p peers in a p2p network.  If a p2p caching peer is
   located near the edge of the network, it will reduce the backbone
   traffic, as well as the uploading traffic.  [RFC7069] provides one
   example of such caching nodes.  P2P caching peers are usually
   expected to be given higher priority than the ordinary peers for
   serving a content request so as to optimize the network traffic.  So
   it's necessary for the endpoint property to support this indication.

   The value for this property is either "true" or "false", in ASCII. If
   the peer in question is actually a caching node, the value of this
   property wrt the peer is set to "true".

3.2.  Endpoint Property Type: battery_limited

   Another important endpoint property that will impact peer selection
   is what kind of power supply the peer has.  It can be either the
   electric power or the battery supply.  And for most of the time, it
   is safe to bet that electric power supplied nodes would stay online
   longer than those battery supplied nodes.  And most of the nowadays
   intelligent equipments are aware of their power supply type.  But it
   is necessary that whether or not the power supply of a peer is
   limited by its battery can be queried through some method.

   The value for this property is either "true" or "false", in ASCII. If
   the peer in question is actually battery-limited, the value of this
   property wrt the peer is set to "true".

3.3.  Endpoint Property Type: network_access

   The third important endpoint property that will impact peer selection
   is the node access type.  If it is a node owned by a home subscriber,
   the access type can be DSL, FTTB, or FTTH.  If it is deployed in a
   data center, one may prefer to specify a special access type for it,
   because it is likely to be more robust, and have more network
   resources than home users.  A p2p application may have its own
   algorithm for peer selection if the node access type information can
   be provided.

   The value for this property can be enumerated as "adsl", "ftth",
   "fttb", "dc", and etc.

4 Security Considerations

   The indication of new endpoint properties to the ALTO clients may set
   targets for the malicious nodes to hack.


5.  IANA Considerations

      This document adds the following new endpoint property types to
   the existing registry created by ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-
   protocol].

   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |Identifier     |Intended Semantics                     |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |p2p_caching    |Whether the peer is a network cache,   |
   |               |value is "true" or "false", in ASCII.  |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |power_supply   |Whether the peer is battery-limited,   |
   |               |value is "true" or "false", in ASCII.  |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------+
   |network_access |The type of access network of the peer,|
   |               |value is enumerated as "adsl", "ftth", |
   |               |"fttb", "dc", in ASCII.                |
