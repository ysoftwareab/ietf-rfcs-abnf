Abstract

   The temporary addresses described by RFC4941 makes it more difficult
   for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to track the 
   hosts,but also bring trouble to the network administrators:"when the 
   network is in trouble,it is difficult to find out which host is 
   attacking the other hosts."So some network administrators don't hope
   that the hosts use the temporary addresses. This document provides a 
   solution to these network administrators,and they can specify whether
   the prefixes can be used to generate the temporary addresses.

2.  Protocol Specification

2.1.  Modified Prefix-information Option

   In order to implement the solution, a "Privacy" indication bit is 
   added to the Reserved1 section of the prefix-information option in 
   the router advertisement.Figure 1 shows the format of the modified 
   prefix-information option,and "P" stands for "Privacy".

2.2.  Router Specification

   A router MUST allow the following autoconfiguration-related variable
   to be configured by system management for each interface:
 
   (1)DefEnablePrivacyOnIf  This variable specifies the default value 
   for each prefix on the interface.The default value of this variable 
   is true.
     
   (2)PrefixEnablePrivacy  The network administrator can explicitly 
   specify whether the specific prefix can be used to generate the 
   temporary addresses.
   
   If the variable DefEnablePrivacyOnIf is true and the variable 
   PrefixEnablePrivacy for the prefix is not specified explicitly, or 
   if the variable PrefixEnablePrivacy for the prefix is true,when the 
   router sends the router advertisement,set the Privacy flag of the 
   prefix-information option.
   
2.3.  Host Specification

   A host MUST allow the following autoconfiguration-related variable to
   be configured by system management:
   
   EnablePrivacyAddr  It means whether the host can generate the 
   temporary addresses.The default value is true.
      
   When a host receives a valid router advertisement, for each Prefix
   -information option in the router advertisement,if the Autonomous 
   flag is set,and the variable EnablePrivacyAddr is true,do as 
   follows:

Internet-Draft  Privacy Flag of Prefix Information Option  February 2011

   (1)If the Privacy flag is set,the host can use the prefix to
   generate a temporary address.
   
   (2)If the Privacy flag is not set,and the prefix is same with the 
   prefix of a temporary address configured by stateless 
   autoconfiguration already in the list of addresses associated with 
   the interface,do asfollows:
      
   (2.1)If the temporary address is in preferred state,the host SHOULD
   change the state of the temporary address to deprecated.
   
   (2.2)If the temporary address is in tentative or duplicate state,the
   host SHOULD delete the temporary address at once.
