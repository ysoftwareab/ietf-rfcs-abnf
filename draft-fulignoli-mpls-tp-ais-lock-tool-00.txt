   the requirements for Alarm Suppression functionality as required in 
   [3]. 

   One packet format with two different function codes is here defined 
   in order to distinguish among packets with Alarm Indication 
   information and packets with Lock Indication Information.

1. Introduction 

   The aim of this draft is to define an MPLS-TP OAM mechanism to meet 
   the requirements for Alarm Suppression functionality as required in 
   [3]. 

   One packet format, with two different function codes, is here defined 
   in order to distinguish among packets with Alarm Indication 
   information and packets with Lock Indication Information. 

   Packets with Alarm Indication (AIS) information enable a server 
   (sub-)layer MEP to notify a failure condition to its client 
   (sub-)layer MEPs, while packets with Lock Indication (LOCK) 
   Information notify an administrative traffic locking condition. 

   Upon receiving a packet with AIS or LOCK information, a MEP detects 
   an AIS/LOCK defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity alarms 
   associated with all its peer MEPs. Both AIS and LOCK defect 
   contribute to the signal fail condition of the receiving MEPs that 
   may result, in turn, in the transmission of AIS packets to its own 
   client MEPs.

   For the detailed behavior description of the Alarm Indication Signal 
   function and Lock Indication function please refer to [5]. 

   The periodicity of AIS and LOCK packet is fixed to one second. 

   The first packet is sent as soon as the associated event (defect 
   condition or administrative traffic locking) occurs.

2. Fault Location TLV  

   One or more Fault Location TLV MAY be included, under operator 
   configuration, in the AIS or LOCK packet; the DEFAULT mode is not to 
   include it.  

   When a MEP receives an AIS/LOCK with the Fault Location TLV and it is 
   configured to (re)generate the AIS packet to its client MEP (in the 
   forward direction) the following cases can occur: 

   1. The MEP is configured to(re)generate AIS messages with no Fault  
      Location TLV    

   2. The MEP is configured to(re)generate AIS messages with the Fault 
      TLV carrying its own identifier; this can occur when the server 
      and client MEs are under different administrative domains such 
      that the client ME needs to know that the failure is located 
      within that specific server ME (i.e. it is not under its 
      responsibility to recover the failure) but not exactly where, 
      within the server ME, the failure is located 

   3. The MEP is configured to(re)generates AIS messages with the Fault 
      Location TLV copied from the received AIS/LOCK message; this is 
      useful when both the server and client MEs are under the same 
      administrative domain so the administrator can quickly identify 
      where is the failure to fix 

   The mechanism is applicable to TCM as well as to different 
   hierarchical (sub-)layer. 

   This section will be completed in the next version of the draft.


   The Fault Location TLV has the following format: 

      
       0                   1                   2                   3

   (octets) in case of MAC Address 

Fault Location 

   Set to the IPv4/IPv6/MAC port/node address of the (Server)MEP
