1.  Introduction

   This draft identifies criteria to be used in evaluating and selecting
   Control and Reporting Protocols described by
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].  Both mandatory and comparative criteria
   are identified for these protocols.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Control Protocol Criteria

2.1.  Mandatory Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that a Control Protocol is required
   to support.  Protocols that do not support these criteria will not be
   considered appropriate for selection as a Control Protocol.  Note
   that although the protocol may support the criterion, it is not
   necessarily the case that the criterion is mandatory to implement
   according to the protocol specification.

   CP-MUST-1  There must be a mechanism that allows a Controller to
              cause a session to be established with a MA.

   CP-MUST-2  There must be a mechanism that allows a MA to cause a
              session to be established with a Controller.

   CP-MUST-3  The protocol session must be capable of being secured
              using certificates, as described in
              [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].

2.2.  Comparative Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that can be used to differentiate
   among Control Protocol candidates.  For each criterion, it is also
   indicated what is considered "better" for a candidate protocol to
   support.

   CP-DIFF-1   How many exchanges are required to send a complete
               instruction set? (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-2   How many exchanges are required to send a status update?
               (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-3   Is it possible to provide partial updates? (yes is
               better)

   CP-DIFF-4   Are there any special mechanisms (other than STUN/TURN/
               ICE or using port forwarding pinholes, PCP, UPnP IGD,
               etc.) for NAT/firewall traversal?  (asked out of
               curiosity, but not expecting anything)

   CP-DIFF-5   How many bytes of overhead are required to send a
               complete instruction set? (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-6   How many bytes of overhead are required to send a status
               update? (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-7   How widely used is the protocol and/or its protocol
               elements in mass market devices? (widely is better)

   CP-DIFF-8   What mechanisms exist to ensure interoperability of MA
               and Controller implementations? (existence of something
               is better)

   CP-DIFF-9   Are the components of the protocol available as open
               source? (yes is better)

   CP-DIFF-10  What ecosystem of tools exists for developers
               implementing the protocol (include tools for data model
               creation)? (existence of useful tools is better)

   CP-DIFF-11  Is the protocol versionable? (yes is better, or is this
               mandatory?)

   CP-DIFF-12  If yes, what is the process for extending the protocol?
               (for information)

   CP-DIFF-13  What are the encodings supported by the protocol (SOAP,
               JSON, XML, etc.)? (for information)

3.  Report Protocol Criteria

3.1.  Mandatory Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that a Report Protocol is required to
   support.  Protocols that do not support these criteria will not be
   considered appropriate for selection as a Report Protocol.  Note that
   although the protocol may support the criterion, it is not
   necessarily the case that the criterion is mandatory to implement
   according to the protocol specification.

   RP-MUST-1  There must be a mechanism that allows a MA to cause a
              session to be established with a Collector.

   RP-MUST-2  The protocol session must be capable of being secured
              using certificates, as described in
              [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].

3.2.  Comparative Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that can be used to differentiate
   among Report Protocol candidates.  For each criterion, it is also
   indicated what is considered "better" for a candidate protocol to
   support.

   RP-DIFF-1   How many exchanges are required to send a report? (less
               is better)

   RP-DIFF-2   Does it allow for sending multiple reports in a session?
               (yes is better)

   RP-DIFF-3   Is there a capability for long-lived sessions. (yes is
               better)

   RP-DIFF-4   Is compression supported? (yes is better, or is this
               mandatory?)

   RP-DIFF-5   How many bytes of overhead are required to send a report?
               (less is better)

   RP-DIFF-6   How widely used is the protocol and/or its protocol
               elements in mass market devices? (widely is better)

               creation)? (existence of useful tools is better)

               JSON, XML, etc.)? (for information)
