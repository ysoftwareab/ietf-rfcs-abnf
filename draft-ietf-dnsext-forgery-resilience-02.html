<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	The current Internet climate poses serious threats to the
	Domain Name System. In the interim period before the DNS protocol can be secured 
	more fully, measures can already be taken to harden the DNS to make 'spoofing' a recursing
      nameserver many orders of magnitude harder.
</p>
<p>
	Even a cryptographically secured DNS benefits from having the ability to discard bogus answers
	quickly, as this potentially saves large amounts of computation.
      
</p>
<p>
	By describing certain behaviour that has previously not been
	standardised, this document sets out how to make the DNS more
	resilient against accepting incorrect answers. This document updates
	RFC 1034.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	    This document describes several common problems in DNS implementations which, although previously 
	    recognized, remain largely unsolved. Besides briefly recapping these problems, this RFC contains rules 
	    that, if implemented, make complying resolvers vastly more resistant to the attacks described.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    The words below are aimed at authors of resolvers: it is up to
	    operators to decide which nameserver implementation to use, or which options to
	    enable. Operational constraints may override the security
	    concerns described below. However, implementations are expected
	    to allow an operator to enable functionality described in this
	    document.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Almost every transaction on the Internet involves the Domain Name System, which is
	    described in <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC1035'>[RFC1035]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - implementation and specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> and beyond.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Additionally, it has recently become possible to acquire SSL/TLS certificates with no other confirmation of identity
	    than the ability to respond to a verification email sent via SMTP (<a class='info' href='#RFC2821'>[RFC2821]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Klensin, J., &ldquo;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>) - which generally 
	    uses DNS for its routing.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    In other words, any party that (temporarily) controls the Domain Name System is in a position to 
	    reroute most kinds of Internet transactions, including the verification steps in acquiring an SSL/TLS certificate 
	    for a domain. This in turn means that even transactions protected by SSL/TLS could be diverted.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    It is entirely conceivable that such rerouted traffic could be used to the disadvantage of Internet users. 
	  
</p>
<p>
	    These and other developments have made the security and trustworthiness of DNS of renewed importance. Although the
	    DNS community is working hard on finalising and implementing a cryptographically enhanced DNS protocol, 
	    steps should be taken to make sure that the existing use of DNS is as secure as possible within the bounds
	    of the relevant standards.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    It should be noted that the most commonly used resolver currently does not perform as well as possible
	    in this respect, making this document of urgent importance.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    A thorough analysis of risks facing DNS can be found in <a class='info' href='#RFC3833'>[RFC3833]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atkins, D. and R. Austein, &ldquo;Threat Analysis of the Domain Name System (DNS),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
	  
</p>
<p>
	    This document expands on some of the risks mentioned in RFC 3833, especially those outlined in the sections on
	    'ID Guessing and Query Prediction' and 'Name Chaining'. Furthermore, it emphasises a number of
	    existing rules and guidelines embodied in the relevant STDs and RFCs. The following also specifies
	    new requirements to make sure the Domain Name System can be relied upon until a more 
	    secure protocol has been standardised and deployed.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    It should be noted that even when all measures suggested below are implemented, protocol users
	    are not protected against third parties with the ability to intercept, change or inject packets
	    sent to the resolver. 
	  
</p>
<p> 
	    For protocol extensions under development that offer protection against these scenarios, see <a class='info' href='#RFC4033'>[RFC4033]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arends, R., Austein, R., Larson, M., Massey, D., and S. Rose, &ldquo;DNS Security Introduction and Requirements,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and

Description of DNS spoofing</h3>

<p>
	    When certain steps are taken it is feasible to 'spoof' the current deployed majority of caching resolvers
	    with carefully crafted and timed DNS packets. Once spoofed, a caching server will repeat the data
	    it wrongfully accepted, and make its clients contact the wrong, and possibly malicious, servers. 
	  
</p>
<p>
	    To understand how this process works it is important to know what makes a resolver (and more specifically
	    a caching server) accept an answer.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    The following sentence in section 5.3.3 of <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> presaged the present problem:
	    
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  The resolver should be highly paranoid in its parsing of responses.
  It should also check that the response matches the query it sent
  using the ID field in the response.
</pre></div>
<p>DNS data is accepted by a resolver if and only if:
	    </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The question section of the reply packet is identical to that of a question packet currently waiting for an answer
</li>
<li>The ID field of the reply packet matches that of the question packet
</li>
<li>The answer comes from the same network address the question was sent to
</li>
<li>The answer comes in on the same network address, including port number, as the question was sent from
</li>
<li>It is the first answer to match the previous four conditions.
</li>
</ol><p>
	  
</p>
<p>
	    If a third party succeeds in meeting the first four conditions before the answer from the authentic answer does so, 
	    it is in a position to feed a resolver fabricated data. When it does so, we dub it an attacker, 
	    attempting to spoof in fake data.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    All conditions mentioned above can theoretically be met, with the difficulty being a 
	    function of the resolver implementation and zone configuration.

<p>
	    The previous paragraph discussed a number of requirements an attacker must match in order to spoof in 
	    manipulated (or fake) data. This section discusses the relative difficulties and how implementation defined
	    choices impact the amount of work an attacker has to perform to meet said difficulties.

Matching the question</h3>

<p>
	      Formally, there is no need for a nameserver to perform service except for its operator, its customers
	      or more generally its users. Recently, open recursing nameservers have been used to amplify denial of service
	      attacks.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      In spite of this, many resolvers perform at least partial service for the whole world. This is partially out of 
	      lack of concern, and is reminiscent of the open relay SMTP service the net enjoyed up to the early 1990s.
	      Some access providers may serve so many subnets that it is hard to enumerate these all in the DNS configuration.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Providing full service enables the third party to send the target resolver a question for the domain 
	      name it intends to spoof. On receiving this question, and not finding the answer in its cache, the resolver
	      will transmit questions to relevant authoritative nameservers. This opens up a window of opportunity 
	      for getting fake answer data accepted.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Some operators restrict access by not recursing for unauthorised IP addresses, but only respond with data from the
	      cache. This makes spoofing harder for a third party as it cannot then force the exact moment a question will be asked.
	      It is still possible however to determine a time range when this will happen, because nameservers helpfully
	      publish the decreasing TTL of entries in the cache, which indicate from which absolute time onwards a new query
	      could be sent to refresh the expired entry.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      The time to live of the 'target domain' determines how often a window of opportunity is available, which
	      implies that a short TTL makes spoofing far more viable.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Note that the attacker might very well have authorised access to the target resolver by virtue of being a customer
	      or employee of its operator.

Matching the ID field</h3>

<p>
	      The DNS ID field is 16 bits wide, meaning that if full use is made of all these bits, and if their 
	      contents are truly random, it will require on average 32768 attempts to guess. Anecdotal evidence 
	      suggests there are implementations utilising only 14 bits, meaning on average 8192 attempts will suffice.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Additionally, if the target nameserver can be forced into having multiple identical questions outstanding,
	      the 'Birthday Attack' phenomenon means that any
	      fake data sent by the attacker is matched against multiple outstanding questions, significantly raising
	      the chance of success. Further details in <a class='info' href='#birthday'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Birthday attacks</span><span>)</span></a>.

Matching the source address of the authentic answer</h3>

<p>
	      Most domains have two or three authoritative nameservers, which make matching the 
	      source address of the authentic answer very likely with even a naive choice having 
	      a double digit success rate. 
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Most recursing nameservers store relative performance indications of authoritative nameservers,
	      which may make it easier to predict which nameserver would originally be queried - the one most likely
	      to respond the quickest.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Generally, this condition requires at most two or three attempts before it is matched.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      It should be noted that meeting this condition entails being able to transmit packets
	      on behalf of the address of the authoritative nameserver. While several important
	      documents (<a class='info' href='#RFC2827'>[RFC2827]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ferguson, P. and D. Senie, &ldquo;Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC3013'>[RFC3013]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Killalea, T., &ldquo;Recommended Internet Service Provider Security Services and Procedures,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> specifically) direct
	      Internet access providers to prevent their customers from assuming IP addresses

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
Matching the destination address of the authentic answer</h3>

<p>
	      Note that the destination address of the authentic answer is the source address of the original question.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      The actual address of a recursing nameserver is generally known; the port used for asking questions
	      is harder to determine. Most current resolvers pick a random port at startup and use this for all
	      outgoing questions. In quite a number of cases the source port of outgoing questions is fixed at 
	      the traditional DNS assigned server port number of 53.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      If the source port of the original question is random, but static, any authoritative nameserver under observation 
	      by the attacker can be used to determine this port. This means that matching this conditions often requires 
	      no guess work.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      If multiple ports are used for sending questions, this enlarges the effective address space by 
	      a factor equal to the number of ports used.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      Less common resolving servers choose a random port per outgoing question. If this strategy is followed,
	      this port number can be regarded as an additional ID field, again containing up to 16 bits.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      If the maximum ports range is utilized, on average, around 32128 source ports would have to be tried 
	      before matching the source port of the original question as ports below 1024 may be unavailable for use, 
	      leaving 64512 options. 
	    
</p>
<p>
	      It should be noted that a firewall will not prevent the matching of this address, as it will accept
	      answers that (appear) to come from the correct address, offering no additional security.

Have the answer arrive before the authentic answer</h3>

<p>
	      Once any packet has matched the previous four conditions, no further answers should be accepted. 
	    
</p>
<p>
	      This means that the third party has a limited time in which to inject its spoofed answer, typically in the 
	      order of at most 100ms.
	    
</p>
<p>
	      This time period can be far longer if the authentic authoritative nameservers are (briefly) overloaded
	      by queries, perhaps by the attacker.

Birthday attacks</h3>

<p>
	    A curious mathematical phenomenon means that a group of 22 people suffices to have a more than
	    even chance at having two or more members of the group share a birthday. 
	  
</p>
<p>
	    An attacker can benefit from this phenomenon if it can force the target resolver to have multiple
	    outstanding questions at any one time for the same domain to the same authoritative server.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Any packet the attacker sends then has a much higher chance of being accepted because it only has to
	    match any of the outstanding queries for that single domain. Compared to the birthday analogy above,
	    of the group composed of questions and answers, the chance of having any of these share an ID rises 
	    quickly.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    As long as small numbers of questions are sent out, the chance of successfully spoofing an answer
	    rises linearly with the number of outstanding questions for the exact domain and nameserver.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    For larger numbers this effect is less pronounced.

Accepting only in-zone answers</h3>

<p>
	    Answers from authoritative nameservers often contain information that
	    is not part of the zone for which we deem it authoritative. As
	    an example, a query for the MX record of a domain might get as its answer a
            mail exchanger in another domain, and additionally the IP address of this
            mail exchanger.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    If accepted uncritically, the resolver stands the chance of
            accepting data from an untrusted source. Care must be taken to
            only accept data if it is known that the originator is authoritative for
            that data.
          
</p>
<p>
            One very simple way to achieve this is to only accept data if it
            is part of the domain we asked the question for.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;
Combined difficulty</h3>

<p>
	    Given a known or static destination port, matching ID field, source and destination address requires
	    on average in the order of 2 * 2^15 = 65000 packets, assuming a domain has 2 authoritative nameservers.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    If the window of opportunity available is around 100ms, as assumed above, an attacker would need to be able 
	    to briefly transmit 650000 packets/s to have a 50% chance to get spoofed data accepted on the first attempt.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    A realistic minimal DNS answer consists of around 80 bytes, including IP headers, making the packet rate above
	    correspond to a respectable burst of 416Mb/s.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    As of mid-2006, this kind of bandwidth was not common but not scarce either, especially among those
	    in a position to control many servers.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    These numbers change when a window of a full second is assumed, possibly because the arrival of the authentic answer
	    can be prevented by overloading the bonafide authoritative hosts with decoy questions. This reduces the 
	    needed bandwidth to 42 Mb/s.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    If in addition the attacker is granted more than a single chance and allowed up to 60 minutes of work on a domain
	    with a time to live of 300 seconds, a meagre 4Mb/s suffices for a 50% chance at getting fake data accepted. Once 
	    equipped with a longer time, matching condition 1 mentioned above is straightforward - any popular domain will 
	    have been queried a number of times within this hour, and given the short TTL, this would lead to questions
	    to authoritative nameservers, opening windows of opportunity.

Calculation</h3>

<p>
	    The probability of spoofing a resolver is equal to the amount of fake packets that arrive within the window of opportunity, 
	    divided by the size of the problem space.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    When the resolver has 'D' multiple identical outstanding questions, each fake packet has a proportionally higher 
	    chance of matching any of these questions. This assumption only holds for small values of 'D'.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    
<p>
		In symbols, if the probability of being spoofed is denoted as P_s:
	      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
           D * F
P_s =    ---------
         N * P * I
</pre></div>
	  

<p>
	    It is more useful to reason not in terms of aggregate packets but to convert to packet rate, which can easily
	    be converted to bandwidth if needed.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    
<p>
		If the Window of opportunity length is 'W' and the attacker can send 'R' packets per second, 
		the number of fake packets 'F' that are candidates to be accepted is:
	      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
                       D * R * W
F = R * W  -&gt;   P_s  = ----------
                       N * P * I
</pre></div>
	  

<p>
	    Finally, to calculate the combined chance 'P_cs' of spoofing over a chosen time period 'T',
	    it should be realised that the attacker has a new window of opportunity each time 
	    the TTL 'TTL' of the target domain expires. This means that the number of attempts 'A' is equal
	    to 'T / TTL'.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    
<p>
		To calculate the combined chance of at least one success, the following formula holds:
	      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
                                                     (T / TTL)
                      A          (       D * R * W )
P_cs = 1 - ( 1 - P_s )    =  1 - ( 1  -  --------- )
                                 (       N * P * I )
</pre></div>
	  

<p>
	    
<p>
		When common numbers (as listed above) for D, W, N, P and I are inserted, this formula reduces to:
	      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
                            (T / TTL)
           (         R    )
P_cs = 1 - ( 1 -  ------- )
           (      1638400 )
</pre></div>
	  

<p>
	    From this formula it can be seen that, if the nameserver implementation is unchanged, only raising
	    the TTL offers protection. Raising N, the number of authoritative nameservers, is not feasible beyond
	    a small number.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    For the degenerate case of a zero-second TTL, a window of opportunity opens for each question asked,
	    making the effective TTL equal to 'W' above, the response time of the authoritative server.

Discussion</h3>

<p>
	  The calculations above indicate the relative ease with which DNS data can be spoofed. 
	  For example, using the formula derived earlier on a domain with a 3600 second TTL, 
	  an attacker sending 7000 fake answer packets/s (a rate of 4.5Mb/s),
	  stands a 10% chance of spoofing a record in the first 24 hours, which rises to 50% after a week.
	
</p>
<p>
	  For a domain with a TTL of 60 seconds, the 10% level is hit after 24 minutes, 50% after less than 3 hours, 90% after
	  around 9 hours.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Note that the attacks mentioned above can be detected by watchful server operators - an unexpected incoming
	  stream of 4.5mbit/s of packets might be noticed.
	
</p>
<p>
	  An important assumption however in these calculations is a known or static destination port of the authentic answer.
	
</p>
<p>
	  If that port number is unknown and needs to be guessed as well, the problem space expands by a factor of 64000, 
	  leading the attacker to need in excess of 285Gb/s to achieve similar success rates.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Such bandwidth is not generally available, nor expected to be so in the foreseeable future.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Note that some firewalls may need reconfiguring if they are currently setup to only allow
	  outgoing queries from a single DNS source port.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
	    This document provides clarification of the DNS specification to decrease the probability that DNS answers can be successfully forged.
	    Recommendations found above should be considered complementary to possible cryptographical enhancements of the domain name system.
	  
</p>
<p> 
	    A resolver that does not implement the recommendations outlined above can easily be forced to accept spoofed answers, which 
	    in turn are passed on to client computers - misdirecting (user) traffic to possibly malicious entities.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    This document directly impacts the security of the 
	    Domain Name System, implementers are urged to follow its 
	    recommendations.
	  
</p>
<p>
		Most security considerations can be found in <a class='info' href='#birthday'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Birthday attacks</span><span>)</span></a>, while proposed

<p> 
	  For brevity's sake, in lieu of repeating the security considerations references, the reader is referred to these sections.
		
	
</p>
<p>
		Nothing in this document specifies specific algorithms for operators to use; it does specify algorithms 
		implementations SHOULD or MUST support.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The above notwithstanding, it should be noted that using a low Time To Live for DNS records raises the chances
