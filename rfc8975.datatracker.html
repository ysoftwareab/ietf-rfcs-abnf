<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document is a product of and represents the collaborative work
   and consensus of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
   Research Group (NWCRG); while it is not an IETF product and not a
   standard, it is intended to inform the SATellite COMmunication
   (SATCOM) and Internet research communities about recent developments
   in Network Coding.  A glossary is included in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> to clarify
   the terminology used throughout the document.

   As will be shown in this document, the implementation of Network
   Coding techniques above the network layer, at application or
   transport layers (as described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1122" title="&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers&quot;">RFC1122</a>]), offers an opportunity
   for improving the end-to-end performance of SATCOM systems.
   Physical- and link-layer coding error protection is usually enough to
   provide quasi-error-free transmission, thus minimizing packet loss.
   However, when residual errors at those layers cause packet losses,
   retransmissions add significant delays (in particular, in
   geostationary systems with over 0.7 second round-trip delays).
   Hence, the use of Network Coding at the upper layers can improve the
   quality of service in SATCOM subnetworks and eventually favorably
   impact the experience of end users.

   While there is an active research community working on Network Coding
   techniques above the network layer in general and in SATCOM in
   particular, not much of this work has been deployed in commercial
   systems.  In this context, this document identifies opportunities for
   further usage of Network Coding in commercial SATCOM networks.

   The notation used in this document is based on the NWCRG taxonomy
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8406" title="&quot;Taxonomy of Coding Techniques for Efficient Network Communications&quot;">RFC8406</a>]:

   *  Channel and link error-correcting codes are considered part of the
      error protection for the PHYsical (PHY) layer and are out of the
      scope of this document.

   *  Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) (also called &quot;Application-Level
      FEC&quot;) operates above the link layer and targets packet-loss
      recovery.

   *  This document considers only coding (or coding techniques or
      coding schemes) that uses a linear combination of packets; it
      excludes, for example, content coding (e.g., to compress a video
      flow) or other non-linear operations.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  A Note on the Topology of Satellite Networks</span>

   There are multiple SATCOM systems, for example, broadcast TV, point-
   to point-communication, and Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring.
   Therefore, depending on the purpose of the system, the associated
   ground segment architecture will be different.  This section focuses
   on a satellite system that follows the European Telecommunications
   Standards Institute (ETSI) Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standards
   to provide broadband Internet access via ground-based gateways
   [<a href="#ref-ETSI-EN-2020">ETSI-EN-2020</a>].  One must note that the overall data capacity of one
   satellite may be higher than the capacity that one single gateway
   supports.  Hence, there are usually multiple gateways for one unique
   satellite platform.

   In this context, Figure 1 shows an example of a multigateway
   satellite system, where BBFRAME stands for &quot;Base-Band FRAME&quot;, PLFRAME
   for &quot;Physical Layer FRAME&quot;, and PEP for &quot;Performance Enhancing
   Proxy&quot;.  More information on a generic SATCOM ground segment
   architecture for bidirectional Internet access can be found in
   [<a href="#ref-SAT2017" title="&quot;Software-defined satellite cloud RAN&quot;">SAT2017</a>] or in DVB standard documents.

<span class="h2">    Coding</span>

   This section details use cases where Network Coding techniques could
   improve SATCOM system performance.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Two-Way Relay Channel Mode</span>

   This use case considers two-way communication between end users
   through a satellite link, as seen in Figure 2.

   Satellite terminal A sends a packet flow A, and satellite terminal B
   sends a packet flow B, to a coding server.  The coding server then
   sends a combination of both flows instead of each individual flow.
   This results in non-negligible capacity savings, which has been
   demonstrated in the past [<a href="#ref-ASMS2010" title="&quot;Demonstration at opening session of ASMS 2010&quot;">ASMS2010</a>].  In the example, a dedicated
   coding server is introduced (note that its location could be
   different based on deployment use case).  The Network Coding
   operations could also be done at the satellite level, although this
   would require a lot of computational resources onboard and may not be
   supported by today&#x27;s satellites.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Reliable Multicast</span>

   The use of multicast servers is one way to better utilize satellite
   broadcast capabilities.  As one example, satellite-based multicast is
   proposed in the Secure Hybrid In Network caching Environment (SHINE)
   project of the European Space Agency (ESA) [<a href="#ref-NETCOD-FUNCTION-VIRT">NETCOD-FUNCTION-VIRT</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-SHINE" title="&quot;SHINE: Secure Hybrid In Network caching Environment&quot;">SHINE</a>].  This use case considers adding redundancy to a multicast
   flow depending on what has been received by different end users,
   resulting in non-negligible savings of the scarce SATCOM resources.
   This scenario is shown in Figure 3.

       Figure 3: Network Architecture for a Reliable Multicast Using
                               Network Coding

   A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and
   B.  M is composed of packets Nk (not shown in Figure 3).  Packet Ni
   (respectively Nj) gets lost at terminal A (respectively B), and
   terminal A (respectively B) returns a negative acknowledgment Li
   (respectively Lj), indicating that the packet is missing.  Using
   coding, either the access gateway or the multicast server can include
   a repair packet (rather than the individual Ni and Nj packets) in the
   multicast flow to let both terminals recover from losses.

   This could also be achieved by using other multicast or broadcast
   systems, such as NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5740" title="&quot;NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) Transport Protocol&quot;">RFC5740</a>] or
   File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6726" title="&quot;FLUTE - File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport&quot;">RFC6726</a>].  Both
   NORM and FLUTE are limited to block coding; neither of them supports
   more flexible sliding window encoding schemes that allow decoding
   before receiving the whole block, which is an added delay benefit
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8406" title="&quot;Taxonomy of Coding Techniques for Efficient Network Communications&quot;">RFC8406</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8681" title="&quot;Sliding Window Random Linear Code (RLC) Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) Schemes for FECFRAME&quot;">RFC8681</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Hybrid Access</span>

   This use case considers improving multiple-path communications with
   Network Coding at the transport layer (see Figure 4, where DSL stands
   for &quot;Digital Subscriber Line&quot;, LTE for &quot;Long Term Evolution&quot;, and SAT
   for &quot;SATellite&quot;).  This use case is inspired by the Broadband Access
   via Integrated Terrestrial Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has
   been published as an ETSI Technical Report [<a href="#ref-ETSI-TR-2017">ETSI-TR-2017</a>].

   To cope with packet loss (due to either end-user mobility or
   physical-layer residual errors), Network Coding can be introduced.
   Depending on the protocol, Network Coding could be applied at the
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), the concentrator, or both.  Apart
   from coping with packet loss, other benefits of this approach include
   a better tolerance for out-of-order packet delivery, which occurs
   when exploited links exhibit high asymmetry in terms of Round-Trip
   Time (RTT).  Depending on the ground architecture [<a href="#ref-5G-CORE-YANG">5G-CORE-YANG</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-SAT2017" title="&quot;Software-defined satellite cloud RAN&quot;">SAT2017</a>], some ground equipment might be hosting both SATCOM and
   cellular network functionality.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  LAN Packet Losses</span>

   This use case considers using Network Coding in the scenario where a
   lossy WiFi link is used to connect to the SATCOM network.  When
   encrypted end-to-end applications based on UDP are used, a
   Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP) cannot operate; hence, other
   mechanisms need to be used.  The WiFi packet losses will result in an
   end-to-end retransmission that will harm the quality of the end
   user&#x27;s experience and poorly utilize SATCOM bottleneck resources for
   traffic that does not generate revenue.  In this use case, adding
   Network Coding techniques will prevent the end-to-end retransmission
   from occurring since the packet losses would probably be recovered.

   The architecture is shown in Figure 5.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Varying Channel Conditions</span>

   This use case considers the usage of Network Coding to cope with
   subsecond physical channel condition changes where the physical-layer
   mechanisms (Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM)) may not adapt the
   modulation and error-correction coding in time; the residual errors
   lead to higher-layer packet losses that can be recovered with Network
   Coding.  This use case is mostly relevant when mobile users are
   considered or when the satellite frequency band introduces quick
   changes in channel condition (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.).  Depending
   on the use case (e.g., bands with very high frequency, mobile users),
   the relevance of adding Network Coding is different.

   The system architecture is shown in Figure 6.

   This use case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost
   during gateway handover.  Whether for off-loading a given equipment
   or because the transmission quality differs from gateway to gateway,
   switching the transmission gateway may be beneficial.  However,
   packet losses can occur if the gateways are not properly synchronized
   or if the algorithm used to trigger gateway handover is not properly
   tuned.  During these critical phases, Network Coding can be added to
   improve the reliability of the transmission and allow a seamless
   gateway handover.

   Figure 7 illustrates this use case.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Research Challenges</span>

   This section proposes a few potential approaches to introducing and
   using Network Coding in SATCOM systems.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Joint Use of Network Coding and Congestion Control in SATCOM</span>
<span class="h3">      Systems</span>

   Many SATCOM systems typically use Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3135" title="&quot;Performance Enhancing Proxies Intended to Mitigate Link-Related Degradations&quot;">RFC3135</a>].  PEPs usually split end-to-end connections and forward
   transport or application-layer packets to the satellite baseband
   gateway.  PEPs contribute to mitigating congestion in a SATCOM system
   by limiting the impact of long delays on Internet protocols.  A PEP
   mechanism could also include Network Coding operation and thus
   support the use cases that have been discussed in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this
   document.

   Deploying Network Coding in the PEP could be relevant and independent
   from the specifics of a SATCOM link.  This, however, leads to
   research questions dealing with the potential interaction between
   Network Coding and congestion control.  This is discussed in
   [<a href="#ref-NWCRG-CODING">NWCRG-CODING</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Efficient Use of Satellite Resources</span>

   There is a recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems: how much overhead
   from redundant reliability packets can be introduced to guarantee a
   better end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) while optimizing capacity
   usage?  At which layer should this supplementary redundancy be added?

   This problem has been tackled in the past by the deployment of
   physical-layer error-correction codes, but questions remain on
   adapting the coding overhead and added delay for, e.g., the quickly
   varying channel conditions use case where ACM may not be reacting
   quickly enough, as discussed in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.  A higher layer with
   Network Coding does not react more quickly than the physical layer,
   but it may operate over a packet-based time window that is larger
   than the physical one.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Interaction with Virtualized Satellite Gateways and Terminals</span>

   In the emerging virtualized network infrastructure, Network Coding
   could be easily deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).  The
   next generation of SATCOM ground segments will rely on a virtualized
   environment to integrate with terrestrial networks.  This trend
   towards Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is also central to 5G
   and next-generation cellular networks, making this research
   applicable to other deployment scenarios [<a href="#ref-5G-CORE-YANG">5G-CORE-YANG</a>].  As one
   example, Network Coding VNF deployment in a virtualized environment
   has been presented in [<a href="#ref-NETCOD-FUNCTION-VIRT">NETCOD-FUNCTION-VIRT</a>].

   A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service
   function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other
   SATCOM-specific functions, in order to guarantee efficient radio-link
   usage and provide easy-to-deploy SATCOM services.  Moreover, another
   challenge related to virtualized SATCOM equipment is the management
   of limited buffered capacities in large gateways.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN)</span>

   Communications among deep-space platforms and terrestrial gateways
   can be a challenge.  Reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over
   such paths must cope with very long delays and frequent link
   disruptions; indeed, E2E connectivity may only be available
   intermittently, if at all.  Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking
   (DTN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4838" title="&quot;Delay-Tolerant Networking Architecture&quot;">RFC4838</a>] is a solution to enable reliable internetworking
   space communications where neither standard ad hoc routing nor E2E
   Internet protocols can be used.  Moreover, DTN can also be seen as an
   alternative solution to transfer data between a central PEP and a
   remote PEP.

   Network Coding enables E2E reliable communications over a DTN with
   potential adaptive re-encoding, as proposed in [<a href="#ref-THAI15" title="&quot;Enabling E2E reliable communications with adaptive re-encoding over Delay Tolerant Networks&quot;">THAI15</a>].  Here, the
   use case proposed in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a> would encourage the usage of Network
   Coding within the DTN stack to improve utilization of the physical
   channel and minimize the effects of the E2E transmission delays.  In
   this context, the use of packet erasure coding techniques inside a
   Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) architecture
   has been specified in [<a href="#ref-CCSDS-131.5-O-1">CCSDS-131.5-O-1</a>].  One research challenge
   remains: how such Network Coding can be integrated in the IETF DTN
   stack.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Conclusion</span>

   This document introduces some wide-scale Network Coding technique
   opportunities in satellite telecommunications systems.

   Even though this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
   pointing out that some scenarios proposed here may be relevant to
   other wireless telecommunication systems.  As one example, the
   generic architecture proposed in Figure 1 may be mapped onto cellular
   networks as follows: the &#x27;network function&#x27; block gathers some of the
   functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the &#x27;access
   gateway&#x27; and &#x27;physical gateway&#x27; blocks gather the same type of
   functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network.
   This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this document,
   since they may also be relevant for cellular networks.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This document has no IANA actions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Security considerations are inherent to any access network, in
   particular SATCOM systems.  As with cellular networks, over-the-air
   data can be encrypted using, e.g., the algorithms in [<a href="#ref-ETSI-TS-2011">ETSI-TS-2011</a>].
   Because the operator may not enable this [<a href="#ref-SSP-2020" title="&quot;A Tale of Sea and Sky On the Security of Maritime VSAT Communications&quot;">SSP-2020</a>], the applications
   should apply cryptographic protection.  The use of FEC or Network
   Coding in SATCOM comes with risks (e.g., a single corrupted redundant
   packet may propagate to several flows when they are protected
   together in an interflow coding approach; see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  While this
   document does not further elaborate on this, the security
   considerations discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>] apply.
