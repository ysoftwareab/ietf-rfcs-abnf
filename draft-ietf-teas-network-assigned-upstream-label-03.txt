 Abstract 

    This document discusses a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching 
    (GMPLS) Resource reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering 
    (RSVP-TE) mechanism that enables the network to assign an upstream 
    label for a bidirectional LSP.  This is useful in scenarios where a 
    given node does not have sufficient information to assign the 
    correct upstream label on its own and needs to rely on the 
    downstream node to pick an appropriate label.

 1. Introduction 

    The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Resource 
    reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions 
    for setting up a bidirectional LSP are specified in [RFC3473].  The

    bidirectional LSP setup is indicated by the presence of an 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL Object in the PATH message.  As per the existing 
    setup procedure outlined for a bidirectional LSP, each upstream node 
    must allocate a valid upstream label on the outgoing interface 
    before sending the initial PATH message downstream.  However, there 
    are certain scenarios where it is not desirable or possible for a 
    given node to pick the upstream label on its own.  This document 
    defines the protocol mechanism to be used in such scenarios.  This 
    mechanism enables a given node to offload the task of assigning the 
    upstream label for a given bidirectional LSP onto the network.  

 2. Use-Case: Wavelength Setup for IP over Optical Networks 

    Consider the network topology depicted in Figure 1.  Nodes A and B 
    are client IP routers that are connected to an optical WDM transport 
    network.  F, H and I represent WDM nodes.  The transponder sits on 
    the router and is directly connected to the add-drop port on a WDM 
    node. 
      
    The optical signal originating on "Router A" is tuned to a 
    particular wavelength.  On "WDM-Node F", it gets multiplexed with 
    optical signals at other wavelengths.  Depending on the 
    implementation of this multiplexing function, it may not be 
    acceptable to have the router send signal into the optical network 
    unless it is at the appropriate wavelength.  In other words, having 
    the router send signal with a wrong wavelength may adversely impact 
    existing optical trails.  If the clients do not have full visibility 
    into the optical network, they are not in a position to pick the 
    correct wavelength up-front.

 3. The "Crankback Signaling" Approach 

    There are currently no GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol mechanisms that an 
    upstream node can use for indicating that it does not know what 
    upstream label to use and that it needs the downstream node to pick 
    the label on its behalf.  

    The "Crankback Signaling" [RFC4920] approach can be applied to 
    address the above use-case as shown in the following setup sequence: 

         

      +---+                 /-\             /-\                 +---+ 
      | A |----------------( F ) ~~~~~~~~~ ( I )----------------| B | 
      +---+                 \-/             \-/                 +---+

           Acceptable Label Set (L1, L2 .. Ln) 
         <--------------------- 
         PATH  
           Upstream Label (L2) 
         ---------------------> 
                               -- ~~ -- ~~ --> 
                                               PATH   
                                               --------------------> 
                                               RESV 
                                               <-------------------- 
                               <-- ~~ -- ~~ --

           Label (Assigned) 
         <--------------------- 

              Figure 2: Setup Sequence - Crank-back Approach  

    The above approach does work, but there are a few obvious concerns: 

    - Since "Router-A" does not know which upstream label to use, it 
      picks some random label and signals it without programming its 
      data-plane (this is a deviation from the UPSTREAM_LABEL processing 
      procedures outlined in [RFC3473]).  As a result, the outgoing PATH

      message has no indication of whether the upstream label has been 
      installed along the data-path or not. 
    - Even if "Router-A" somehow correctly guesses an acceptable 
      upstream label upfront, the network may end up finding a path 
      which is suboptimal (there could be a different acceptable 
      upstream label which corresponds to a better path in the network) 
    - The "PATH-ERR with Acceptable Label Set" retry approach is usually 
      used for exception handling.  The above solution uses it for 
      almost every single setup request (except in the rare scenario 
      where the appropriate upstream label is guessed correctly). 
    - There is an awkward window between the time the network sends out 
      the PATH-ERR message (with the ACCEPTABLE_LABEL_SET) and receives 
      the corresponding PATH message (with the selected UPSTREAM_LABEL); 
      this window opens up the possibility of the selected 
      UPSTREAM_LABEL to be stale by the time the network receives the 
      retry PATH. 
    - The above solution assumes the use of "symmetric labels" by 
      default.  

    The rest of the sections in this draft present a solution proposal 
    that is devoid of any of the above concerns. 

 4. Symmetric Labels 

    As per [RFC3471], the upstream label and the downstream label for an 
    LSP at a given hop need not be the same.  The use-case discussed in 
    this document pertains to Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) LSPs and it is 
    an undocumented fact that in practice, LSC LSPs always have 
    symmetric labels at each hop along the path of the LSP.  

    The use of the protocol mechanism discussed in this document 
    mandates "Label Symmetry".  This mechanism is meant to be used only 
    for bidirectional LSPs that assign symmetric labels at each hop 
    along the path of the LSP.  

 5. Unassigned Upstream Label 

    This document proposes the use of a special label value - 
    "0xFFFFFFFF" (for a 4-byte label) - to indicate an Unassigned 
    Upstream Label.  Similar "all-ones" patterns are expected to be used 
    for labels of other sizes.  The presence of this value in the 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a PATH message indicates that the upstream 
    node has not assigned an upstream label on its own and has requested 
    the downstream node to provide a label that it can use in both 
    forward and reverse directions.  The presence of this value in the 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a PATH message MUST also be interpreted by

    the receiving node as a request to mandate "symmetric labels" for 
    the LSP. 

 5.1. Processing Rules 

    The Unassigned Upstream Label is used by an upstream node when it is 
    not in a position to pick the upstream label on its own.  In such a 
    scenario, the upstream node sends a PATH message downstream with an 
    Unassigned Upstream Label and requests the downstream node to 
    provide a symmetric label.  If the upstream node desires to make the 
    downstream node aware of its limitations with respect to label 
    selection, it MUST specify a list of valid labels via the LABEL_SET 
    object as specified in [RFC3473]. 

    In response, the downstream node picks an appropriate symmetric 
    label and sends it via the LABEL object in the RESV message.  The 
    upstream node would then start using this symmetric label for both 
    directions of the LSP.  If the downstream node cannot pick the 
    symmetric label, it MUST issue a PATH-ERR message with a "Routing 
    Problem/Unacceptable Label Value" indication.  

    The upstream node will continue to signal the Unassigned Upstream 
    Label in the PATH message even after it receives an appropriate 
    symmetric label in the RESV message.  This is done to make sure that 
    the downstream node would pick a different symmetric label if and 
    when it needs to change the label at a later point in time.

 5.2. Backwards Compatibility 

    If the downstream node is running an older implementation and 
    doesn't understand the semantics of an Unassigned UPSTREAM LABEL, it

    will either (a) reject the special label value and generate an error 
    as specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC3473] or (b) accept it and treat 
    it as a valid label.  
    If the behavior that is exhibited is (a), then there are obviously 
    no backwards compatibility concerns.  If there is some existing 
    implementation that exhibits the behavior in (b), then there could 
    be some potential issues.  However, at the time of publication, 
    there is no documented evidence of any existing implementation that 
    uses the "all-ones" bit pattern as a valid label.  Thus, it is safe 
    to assume that the behavior in (b) will never be exhibited.  

 6. Applicability 

    The use-case discussed in Section 2 is revisited to examine how the 
    mechanism proposed in this document allows the optical network to 
    select and communicate the correct wavelength to its clients.

    Steps:

         appropriate client wavelength.  It sends a PATH message 
         downstream requesting the network to assign an appropriate

         symmetric label for its use.  Since the client wavelength is 
         unknown, the laser is off at the ingress client. 
       - The downstream node (Node F) receives the PATH message, chooses 
         the appropriate wavelength values and forwards them in 
         appropriate label fields to the egress client ("Router B") 
       - "Router B" receives the PATH message, turns the laser ON and 
         tunes it to the appropriate wavelength (received in the 
         UPSTREAM_LABEL/LABEL_SET of the PATH) and sends out a RESV 
         message upstream.  
       - The RESV message received by the ingress client carries a valid 
         symmetric label in the LABEL object.  "Router A" turns on the 
         laser and tunes it to the wavelength specified in the network 
         assigned symmetric LABEL.  
      
    For cases where the egress-node relies on RSVP signaling to 
    determine exactly when to start using the LSP, this draft recommends 
    integrating the above sequence with any of the existing graceful 
    setup procedures: 
      - "RESV-CONF" setup procedure (or) 
      - 2-step "ADMIN STATUS" based setup procedure ("A" bit set in the 
        first step; "A" bit cleared when the LSP is ready for use). 
         
 6.2. Wavelength Change 

    After the LSP is set up, the network MAY decide to change the 
    wavelength for the given LSP.  This could be for a variety of 
    reasons - policy reasons, restoration within the core, preemption 
    etc.  

    In such a scenario, if the ingress client receives a changed label 
    via the LABEL object in a RESV modify, it MUST retune the laser at 
    the ingress to the new wavelength.  Similarly, if the egress client 
    receives a changed label via UPSTREAM_LABEL/LABEL_SET in a PATH 
    modify, it MUST retune the laser at the egress to the new 
    wavelength.  If the node receiving the changed label in a PATH/RESV 
    message does not find the label acceptable, then the corresponding 
    error procedures defined in [RFC3473] MUST be followed. 

 7. Security Considerations 

    This document defines a special label value to be carried in the 
    UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a PATH message.  This special label value 
    is used to enable the function of requesting network assignment of 
    an upstream label.  The changes proposed in this document pertain to 
    the semantics of a specific field in an existing RSVP object and the 
    corresponding procedures.  Thus, there are no new security

    implications raised by this document and the security considerations 
    put together by [RFC3473] still applies.
