              draft-krishnan-6man-header-reserved-bits-00

Abstract

   The IPv6 header does not contain any reserved bits for future
   expansion.  This document sets aside 4 bits from the flow label field
   for future expansion.

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Reserved Bits               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 header does not contain any reserved bits and all bits in
   the header are currently accounted for.  This means that it is not
   possible to develop any future extension mechanisms that require bits
   in the IPv6 header.  Mechanisms such as ECN were possible in IPv4
   because there were bits available in the IPv4 header. e.g.  Re-ECN is
   a proof of concept mechanism for ConEx that uses an unused bit (Bit
   48) in the IPv4 header.  It cannot be implemented analogously in the
   IPv6 header.  This document proposes reducing the size of the flow
   label field from 20 bits to 16 bits and setting aside 4 bits for
   future use.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  New IPv6 header format

   This document updates Section 3 of [RFC2460] to reduce the length of
   the flow label field from 20 bits to 16 bits, and in the process
   creating a 4 bit reserved field.  All other fields in the IPv6 header
   remain unchanged from [RFC2460].

      Resvd                4-bit reserved field.

      Flow Label           16-bit flow label.

      All other fields are same as those defined by [RFC2460]




                   Figure 1: Modified IPv6 header format

   Senders MUST set the bits in the reserved field to zero and receivers
   MUST ignore them.


4.  Future use of the reserved bits

   New mechanisms that require allocation of one or more of the reserved
   bits MUST require Standards Action as specified in [RFC5226].


5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to Pekka Savola, Christian Huitema, and
   Ingemar Johansson for the discussions that led to this document.
