1.  Introduction

   This document describes EDNS Tags, a mechanism by which DNS clients
   and servers [RFC1034] can transmit an opaque data field which has no
   defined semantic meaning other than as previously agreed between the
   client and server operators.

   The tag is a single 16 bit field stored within the RDATA of an
   EDNS(0) OPT RR as described in [RFC6891].

   Two EDNS options are defined to allow for the detection of servers
   that incorrectly echo responses verbatim.  The EDNS-Client-Tag option
   may only appear in client requests, and the EDNS-Server-Tag may only
   appear in responses from servers.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Description

   The values of the individual bits within a tag are not defined to
   have any semantic meaning in this specification.  Their
   interpretation is defined entirely by bi-lateral agreement between
   client and server operators.  The definitions for EDNS-Client-Tag and
   EDNS-Server-Tag values MAY be different.

Internet-Draft                DNS EDNS Tags                   March 2019


   Operators are free to partition the bits within that field as they
   see fit; for example it could be used to transmit up to 16 separate
   boolean flags, or perhaps to transmit a 10 bit numeric value combined
   a 2 bit value and four boolean flags.

   Possible use cases for EDNS-Client-Tags include:

   o  client-controlled selection of a DNS-based security filter

   o  marking a packet passing through a proxy with transport-related
      information

   Use cases for EDNS-Server-Tags are still to be determined.  The
   option is specified here for symmetry and in anticipation of new use
   cases being discovered.

3.1.  Packet Validation Rules

   The OPT RR in a DNS request packet (QR = 0) MUST NOT contain an EDNS-
   Server-Tag option.  A request packet MUST NOT contain more than one
   EDNS-Client-Tag option.

   The OPT RR in a DNS response packet (QR = 1) MUST NOT contain an
   EDNS-Client-Tag option.  A response packet MUST NOT contain more than
   one EDNS-Server-Tag option.

   An EDNS-Server-Tag option MUST NOT be sent unless the corresponding
   client query contained an EDNS-Client-Tag option.

3.2.  Error Handling

   Clients MUST discard any response packet that breaches any applicable
   packet validation rule.

   Servers MUST respond with a FORMERR in accordance with Section 7 of
   [RFC6891] on receipt of a request that breaches any applicable packet
   validation rule.

3.3.  Wire Format

   The format of the EDNS options are as follows, to be stored within
   the RDATA of an OPT RR as specified in [RFC6891]:

                   +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   OPTION-CODE: The option code identifier (TBD2).

   OPTION-LENGTH: Size (in octets) of OPTION-DATA.  MUST be 2.

   SERVER-TAG-DATA: The tag field sent from server to client.

4.  Security Considerations

   Client tags are under the control of the client software and as such
   (and in the absence of any other mechanism to authenticate the
   client's identity) this mechanism is not appropriate for applications
   where the DNS server operator wishes to contractually differentiate
   service based on the presence (or absence) of any particular tag.

5.  Implementation status

   TBC.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   Tags are opaque fields that encode only a limited amount of
   information.  The size of the data field in this specification is
   chosen to offer a compromise between offering sufficient content to
   be technically useful while also limiting the scope for it to be used
   to transmit Personally Identifiable Information.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following EDNS(0) Option Codes:

   Value    Name                  Status         Reference
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   TBD1     EDNS-Client-Tag       Standard       RFCXXXX
   TBD2     EDNS-Server-Tag       Standard       RFCXXXX

   << Note to IANA - please assign an even value to TBD1, and the next
   consecutive odd value to TBD2.  This allows the least-significant bit
   of the option value to be compared against the packet's QR bit >>
