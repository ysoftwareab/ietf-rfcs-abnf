Internet-Draft       Multicast Anchoring in DMM           October 2015


Abstract

   In this draft, we define multicast support functions in a
   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) environment. Based on the
   decomposed mobility management functions in [RFC7429], each defined
   multicast support function can be located and operated with DMM
   functions.

1. Introduction

   Based on [RFC7333], a multicast solution in Distributed Mobility
   Management (DMM) should be considered early in the process of
   designing protocol and deployment models. Multicast support in DMM
   should avoid inefficient methods, such as non-optimal forwarding or
   tunnel convergence.

   To support IP multicasting, we need several functions: a multicast
   routing protocol, membership management, etc. When we consider
   multicast support in DMM, we should determine how efficiently these
   functions can be operated with the mobility management functions in
   DMM. Possible use cases are already described in [Use Case for
   Multicast DMM]. However, since current DMM research considers
   control/data separation and functional decomposition, we need to
   define multicast support functions following decomposed DMM anchor
   functions and operate with them.

Internet-Draft       Multicast Anchoring in DMM           October 2015


   In this draft, we define multicast mobility management functions
   that enable us to deploy the DMM functions defined in [RFC7429]. We
   define multicast mobility management functions in a similar way
   because it is easier to deploy multicast mobility management
   functions with DMM functions.

2. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5213], [RFC3810],
   and [RFC4601]. New entities are defined by relying on the DMM
   functions specified in [RFC7429]:

   1. Anchoring Function (AF) is an allocation to a mobile node of an
   IP address (e.g. Home Address (HoA))) or prefix (e.g. Home Network
   Prefix (HNP)), topologically anchored by the advertising node.

   2. Internetwork Location Management (LM) function manages and keeps
   track of the internetwork location of an Mobile Node (MN). The
   location information may be a binding of the advertised IP
   address/prefix (e.g. HoA or HNP) to the MN's IP routing address, or
   it may be a binding of a node that can forward packets destined for
   the MN.

   3. Forwarding Management (FM) function intercepts and forwards a
   packet to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN based on the
   internetwork location information, either to the destination or to
   some other network element that knows how to forward the packets to
   their destinations.

3. Multicast Support Functions in DMM

   In this chapter, we define functions to support multicasting in DMM
   environment. The multicast support of previous mobility management
   schemes (e.g., MIP and PMIP) deployed multicast router or MLD proxy
   functions into their mobility entities (e.g., HA, LMA, and MAG).
   According to the decomposition of previous mobility management
   functions and considering the separation of the control and data
   planes, a multicast support function also could be decompose into
   several functions.

3.1. Multicast Anchoring Function (Multicast AF)

   A multicast AF is able to advertise multicast subscriptions into the
   DMM network. It also connects directly to the multicast
   infrastructure and runs multicast routing protocols (e.g., IGMP/MLD
   and PIM-SM). With a multicast AF, the network entity may be part of
   multicast tree. That is, multicast AFs have a Tree Information Base
   (TIB).

   To support multicast listeners, a multicast AF collects MLD report
   messages from mobile nodes or network entities. To provide an
   appropriate multicast subscription, a multicast AF should join/prune
   multicast channels based on MLD reports from mobile nodes. To
   support the multicast sender, this function forwards the source
   information of the sender to the Rendezvous Point (RP) in the
   multicast infrastructure.

   A multicast AF could be separated into the control and data planes.
   For example, the control plane of multicast anchoring can manage
   multicast tree information and share source information through the
   multicast infrastructure. The data plane of multicast anchoring can
   provide a multicast upstream/downstream interface and forward
   multicast packets based on multicast routing protocol.

   A multicast AF can be co-located and co-operated with a DMM AF.
   In this case, an AF can deliver multicast-related information when
   IP address of mobile node is assigned from the DMM AF.

3.2. Multicast Group Management Function (Multicast GM) 

   A multicast GM function is an MLD proxy function defined in
   [RFC4605]. This function manages multicast subscriber and channel
   information. According to [RFC4605], MDL proxy devices maintain a
   membership database, which considers merging all subscriptions on
   the downstream interface. A membership database is presented a set
   of membership records, multicast addresses, filter modes and source
   lists. A multicast group management function can be extensible from
   the LM function or co-located with it in a DMM environment. In this
   case, group and membership information could be changed according to
   the location management entry in the LM function. Similarly, in
   [RFC6224], MAG sends MLD query messages directly to the MN and
   connects the appropriate uplink interface based on information
   received from the MN.

3.3. Multicast Forwarding Management Function (Multicast FM)

   A multicast FM function manages a forwarding state that is used to
   forward packets from a source to a multicast group. In addition,
   multicast FM for DMM should redirect multicast traffic when the MN
   moves to another attach point. This means that a multicast FM
   function should work with the FM function in DMM. To support
   mobility, MN multicast traffic can be forwarded by using a unicast
   traffic tunnel or by creating a dedicated multicast tunnel. An
   example of the former case is described in [RFC6224]. LMA
   establishes, maintains, and removes group- and source-specific
   multicast forwarding states in its corresponding downstream
   interfaces. Similar to the FM function in DMM, this function
   forwards multicast traffic according to its multicast forwarding
   information base.
   
   Multicast FM function may be split into the control and data plane.
   Control plane of multicast FM function may perform multicast routing
   mechanism, make forwarding rules for multicast traffic and command
   to the data plane of the multicast FM. For communication between
   control and data plane, [dmm-fpc-cpdp] may be used.

4. Considering multicast functions into current approaches
  
   In this section, we consider DMM anchor deployment models to combine
   multicast anchor functions. DMM deployment models are referred from
   [sijeon-dmm-deployment-models].
  
4.1. Distributed AM, LM, and FM : All-in-One

   In this model, all of DMM anchor functions (AF, FM, LM) are combined
   into one physical entity and such physical entities are distributed
   at the edge of network. This model is presented in [seite-dmm-dma]
   and [bernardos-dmm-pmip] To support multicast, multicast anchor
   functions may be deployed together in mobility router. Optionally,
   in case of central LM usage, multicast GM entity also may be
   centralized. On the other hand, one or more multicast entity also
   may be deployed independently. For example, in case of deploying
   multicast AF functions separately, Signaling messages for supporting
   mobility are required between All-in-One DMM entity and multicast
   AF. In this example, DMM entity which includes multicast FM function
   can perform as multicast proxy.

4.2. Distributed AF-DP, LM and FM with centralized AF-CP
  
   This model separates AF function into control and data plane. AF-DP
   is distributed with LM and FM while AF-CP is centralized in a single
   entity. In this model, centralized AF-CP can determine AF-DP based
   on policy or network condition. As presented in [RFC7389], specific
   routing protocol, such as GTP or GRE, can be used to forward MN's
   traffic between AF-DPs.
   To support multicast in this model, multicast AF-CP may be co-
   located where DMM AF-CP is placed. Multicast AF-DP may deploy
   together with DMM AF-DP or separately. In the latter case, like as
   Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) gateway in
   [3GPP TS 36.440], specific AF-DP gateway can be used. Centralized
   AF-CP which includes multicast AF-CP can determine multicast AF-DP
   for forwarding multicast traffic of MN.
  
4.3. Distributed AF-DP and FM-DP with centralized AF-CP, LM, and FM-CP
  
   This model considers separation of FM-CP and FM-DP with separation
   of AF-CP and AF-DP. In this model, forwarding path between AF-DP can
   be provided more flexible. [matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc] is
   one example of this model. To support multicast in this model,
   multicast FM-CP, AF-CP and GM may be implemented in centralized
   control plane of DMM. In this case, signaling messages between
   control and data plane can be used by extending messages which could
   be used in normal DMM. For example, [dmm-fpc-cpdp] can be extended
   to make rule for multicast traffic by defining group forwarding
   rules.
