Abstract          

   The current OSPF link-state database (LSDB) flooding mechanism
   involves control-plane processing and forwarding at each hop. The
   delay due to the involvement of the control-plane adversely affects
   OSPF convergence. This document describes a mechanism to transmit
   link-state advertisements (LSA)  multiple hops away without involving
   control-plane processing at the intermediate routers. This helps to
   achieve faster convergence. It complements the current LSDB flooding
   mechanism.

Internet Draft           OSPF Fast Notification           March 14, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The LSDB flooding mechanism of OSPF is described in [OSPF]. On
   receiving a LSA from an adjacent neighbor, the router performs
   several consistency checks and also compares it with the LSA instance
   in its LSDB to determine the more recent version. The next step in
   the flooding procedure involves sending the LSA to its adjacent
   neighbors and that includes acknowledgements and retransmission to
   ensure reliability. These procedures involve the control-plane and
   are therefore gated by the processing and forwarding speed of the
   control-plane at each hop.

   The solution described in this document does not involve control-
   plane processing at the intermediate nodes. Details are provided in
   section 3.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Solution

   The document describes a mechanism to quickly notify a LSA to all the
   routers within an OSPF area. This does not require control-plane
   processing at an intermediate hop and such a mechanism is also
   referred to as a fast notification (FN) as described in [FN-FRWK].
   The solution in this document uses such a fast-notification mechanism
   and makes it work with the OSPF procedures (including its flooding
   mechanism) and is henceforth referred to as OSPF-FN. OSPF-FN does not
   aim to replace the current OSPF flooding mechanism. The details of
   this solution are described below.

   A variety of mechanisms to encode and transport FN messages are
   described in [FN-TRNS]. For message encoding, this document uses the
   minimal extra encapsulation i.e, it uses the multicast FN address
   'MC-FN' as the destination address of a OSPF-FN link-state update
   (LSU) packet. Note that when the redundant-tree mode as described in
   [FN-TRNS] is used, there will be two such multicast addresses. Such
   an LSU packet is henceforth referred to as the OSPF-FN-LSU packet.
   This LSU packet contains LSAs that need to be quickly notified to all
   routers within the OSPF area. At this time the redundant-tree mode of
   transporting OSPF-FN-LSU packets is the preferred method.

   OSPF-FN works in conjunction with the OSPF flooding mechanism as
   follows. An OSPF router that originates a LSA that is determined to
   require FN, creates a OSPF-FN-LSU packet containing the LSA and

   transports it using a method chosen from [FN-TRNS]. Note that this is
   in addition to any OSPF procedures and specifically does not change
   the current flooding mechanism in OSPF. If the redundant tree mode is
   used then an OSPF-FN-LSU packet is sent on each of the redundant
   trees. When a LSA is received through a OSPF-FN-LSU packet, the
   normal OSPF procedures on receiving a LSU packet should be executed
   with the exception that there is no acknowledgement for the LSU
   packet. Also, the LSA is noted as received by OSPF-FN and the older
   instance of the LSA MUST be retained. The older LSA instance is
   discarded only if the current OSPF flooding mechanism confirms that
   the LSA from the OSFP-FN-LSU is the correct instance. This
   confirmation should occur within a short time of receiving the OSPF-
   FN-LSU packet. This time period is henceforth called T-discard-FN-LSA
   time and has a recommended default of 5 seconds. If this timer
   expires then the LSA received via the OSPF-FN-LSU packet is discarded
   and the older instance is used as the correct instance.

   After updating the LSDB with the LSA received from the OSPF-FN-LSA as
   described above, all the route processing is performed except that
   the new and changed routes are not activated in the forwarding plane.
   The activation is done on receiving the the LSA via the current OSPF
   flooding procedures. 

   It is desirable for OSPF-FN-LSU packets to use area-wide
   authentication parameters so that OSPF-FN-LSU messages can be
   forwarded by intermediate routers similar to any normal data packet.
   The LSA sequence number can provide protection against replay
   attacks. A separate per-link (or network) authentication parameter
   introduces the complexity of rewriting the packet at each hop as
   described in [FN-TRNS]. This is an area for further study.

   The determination of which LSAs require a fast notification is
   dependent on the event that caused the LSA update. The benefits of
   using FN for a link or adjacency going down is straightforward. Other
   cases require further study.

4.  Security Considerations

   Area wide authentication (if used) parameters could bring associated
   security concerns. This is an area for further study.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A TLV id to identify this capability and multicast IP addresses to
   transport the OSPF-FN-LSU messages are required.
