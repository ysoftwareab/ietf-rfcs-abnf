1. Abstract
   
   This memo describes Textual Conventions and OBJECT-
   IDENTITIES used for managing MPLS networks.


2. Introduction
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community. In particular, it defines Textual
   Conventions used in IETF MPLS and MPLS-related MIBs.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list
   at mpls@uu.net.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in RFC 2119, reference [RFC2119].
   
   For an introduction to the concepts of MPLS, see [RFC3031].


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
      [RFC2571].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
      for the purpose of management.  The first version of
      this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is
      called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155
      [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
      [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is
      described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC
      2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message

IETF Draft                   MPLS TC MIB                  August 2001



      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of
      the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in
      RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
      [RFC2574].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157
      [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
      [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
      described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no translation
   is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
   However, this loss of machine readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

5. Security Considerations
   
   This memo defines textual conventions and object identities
   for use in MPLS MIB modules. Security issues for these MIB
   modules are addressed in the memos defining those modules.
