             Figure 1: Capabilities of NSFs in I2NSF Framework

   A use case of an NSF with the capabilities of firewall and web filter
   is described as follows.

   o  If a network administrator wants to apply security policy rules to
      block malicious users with firewall and web filter, it is a
      tremendous burden for a network administrator to apply all of the
      needed rules to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by
      managing the capabilities of NSFs as described in this document.

   o  If a network administrator wants to block IPv4 or IPv6 packets
      from malicious users, the network administrator sends a security
      policy rule to block the users to the Network Operator Management
      System (i.e., Security Controller) using the I2NSF Consumer-Facing
      Interface.
   o  When the Network Operator Management System receives the security
      policy rule, it automatically sends that security policy rule to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer's Management System A
      and NSF-1 in Developer's Management System B) which can support
      the capabilities (i.e., IPv6).  This lets an I2NSF User not
      consider which specific NSF(s) will work for the security policy
      rule.

   o  If NSFs encounter the suspicious IPv4 or IPv6 packets of malicious
      users, they can filter the packets out according to the configured
      security policy rule.  Therefore, the security policy rule against
      the malicious users' packets can be automatically applied to
      appropriate NSFs without human intervention.
