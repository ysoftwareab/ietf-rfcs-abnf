Registry Specification for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Security Label
                                Formats
                draft-quigley-nfsv4-lfs-registry-00.txt

Abstract

   In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very
   rigid policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and
   platform.  As MAC systems are more widely deployed additional
   flexibility in mechanism and policy is required.  Where traditional
   trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security (MLS) and integrity
   models, modern systems have expanded to include technologies such as
   type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms
   it has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible to
   accomodate all parties in one security label format and model.

   To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats in a network, this
   document proposes a registry of label format specifications.  This
   registry contains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and
   string preferences and associates those identifiers with an extensive
   document outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular label
   format.

1.  Introduction

   With the acceptance of security labels in several mainstream
   operating systems the need to communicate labels between these
   systems becomes more important.  In a typical client and server
   scenario, the client request to the server acts as a subject trying
   to access an object on the server [RFC7204].  Unfortunately these
   systems are diverse enough that attempts at establishing one common
   label format have been unsucessful.  The reason for this is that
   systems implement different Mandatory Access Control (MAC) models,
   which typically do not share any common ground.

   One solution is to define a single label format which consists of the
   union of the requirements of all MAC models/implementations.  This is
   not ideal because it introduces an environment where many MAC models
   would either have blank fields for many of the label's components or
   will ignore the values that are present all together.  This
   environment introduces waste and complexity where it is not needed.
   Additionally if a policy authority or identifier field is specified
   in the label format it would require a robust description that could
   be implemented which would lock policy administration into the
   described model.

   Ideally a mechanism to address this problem should allow the most
   flexibility possible in terms of policy administration while
   providing a specification that is suffient to allow for
   implementation of the label format and understanding of the semantics
   of the label.  This means that the label format specification would
   ideally contain a syntactic description of the label format and a
   description of the semantics for each component in the label.  This
   allows protocols to specify the type of label and label semantics
   that it requires while leaving policy and policy administration to
   the individual organizations using the protocol in their environment.

   Policy administration within an organization is a difficult problem.
   This should not be made even more difficult by having to request
   permission from external entities when crafting new policy or just
   making department specific modifications to existing policies.  The
   policy authority field would allow an label format specification to
   specify a scheme for policy administration without forcing it on all
   users of security labels.  However by agreeing to implement a
   particular label format specification, the protocol agrees to that
   policy administration mechanism when processing labels of that type.

2.  Definitions

   Label Format Specification:  an identifier used by the client to
      establish the syntactic format of the security label and the
      semantic meaning of its components.

   Multi-Level Security (MLS):  a traditional model where objects are
      given a sensitivity level (Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret, etc.)
      and a category set [RH_MLS].

   Object:  a passive resource within the system that we wish to
      protect.  Objects can be entities such as files, directories,
      pipes, sockets, and many other system resources relevant to the
      protection of the system state.

   Subject:  an active entity, usually a process, that is requesting
      access to an object.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Exisiting Label Format Specifications

4.1.  Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO)

   The Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) label format specification
   is documented in [CIPSO].  While this draft has expired a long time
   ago, it is the defacto standard for labeled networking.  It is also
   documented in [FIPS-188].

4.2.  Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option (CALIPSO)

   The Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option (CALIPSO) [CIPSO]
   is a successor to CIPSO.

4.3.  Flux Advanced Security Kernel (FLASK)

   The Flux Advanced Security Kernel (FLASK) is an impelementation of an
   architecture to provide flexible support for security policies.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a mechanism to associate LFS identifier with a
   document outlining the syntax and format of a label.  There is no
   security consideration in such an association.  The label
   specification documents referenced by each registration entry should
   state security considerations for the label mechanism it specifies.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding creation of a new registry in accordance
   with [RFC5226].

   This submission requests the creation of a new registry called
   "Security Label Format Selection Registry".  The new registry has the
   following fields:






Quigley, et al.         Expires October 23, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Labeled NFS Registry                April 2014


   Label Format Selector:  An integer number that maps to a particular
      label format, e.g., the CALIPSO label format defined by [RFC5570].
      The name space of this identifier has the range of 0..65,535.

   Label Description:  A human readable ASCII text string that describes
      the label format, e.g., "Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security
      Option (CALIPSO)".  The length of this field is limited to 128
      bytes.

   Status:  A short ASCII text string indicating the status of an entry
      in the registry.  The status field for most entries should have
      the value "active".  In the case that a label format selection
      entry is obsolete, the status field of the obsoleted entry should
      be "obsoleted by entry NNN".

   Label Format Specification:  A reference to a stable, public document
      that specify the label format, e.g., an URL to [RFC5570].

6.1.  Initial Registry

   The initial assignments of the registry are as follows:

   +-----------------+------------------+--------+---------------------+
   | Label Format    | Description      | Status | Reference           |
   | Selector        |                  |        |                     |
   +-----------------+------------------+--------+---------------------+
   | 0               | Reserved         | -      | -                   |
   | 1 - 127         | Private Use      | -      | -                   |
   | 128 - 255       | Experimental Use | -      | -                   |
   | 256             | CIPSO (tag type  | active | [[CIPSO] URL]       |
   |                 | #1)              |        |                     |
   | 257             | CALIPSO (RFC     | active | [[RFC5570] URL]     |
   |                 | 5570)            |        |                     |
   | 258             | FLASK Security   | active | [[FLASK] URL]       |
   |                 | Context          |        |                     |
   | 258 - 65535     | Unassigned       | -      | -                   |
   +-----------------+------------------+--------+---------------------+

6.2.  Adding a New Entry to the Registry

   A label format specification document is required to add a new entry
   to this registry.  If the label format document is inside the RFC
   path, then The IANA Consideration section of the label format
   document should clearly reference the Label Format Selection registry



Quigley, et al.         Expires October 23, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Labeled NFS Registry                April 2014


   and request allocation of a new entry.  The well-known IANA policy,
   Specification Required, as defined in section 4.1 of [RFC5226], will
   be used to handle such requests.  Note that "Specification Required"
   policy implies this process requires a Designated Expert reviewer,
   i.e., adding a new entry to this registry requires both a published
   label format specification and a Designated Expert review.

6.3.  Obsoleting a Label Format Selector

   In the case that a label format selector number is assigned to a
   label format and the label format specification is changed later, a
   new selector assignment should be requested.  The same Specification
   Required IANA policy applies to such requests.  The IANA
   Consideration section of the updated label format specification
   should be explicit in which old label selector assignment it
   obsoletes.  Below is an example of obsoleted entry in the registry:

   +---------------+-------------------+------------+------------------+
   | Label Format  | Description       | Status     | Reference        |
   | Selector      |                   |            |                  |
   +---------------+-------------------+------------+------------------+
   | 0             | Reserved          | -          | -                |
   | 1 - 127       | Private Use       | -          | -                |
   | 128 - 255     | Experimental Use  | -          | -                |
   | 256           | CIPSO (tag type   | active     | [[CIPSO] URL]    |
   |               | #1)               |            |                  |
   | 257           | CALIPSO (RFC      | active     | [[RFC5570] URL]  |
   |               | 5570)             |            |                  |
   | 258           | FLASK Security    | obsoleted  | [[FLASK] URL]    |
   |               | Context           | by 263     |                  |
   | ...           |                   |            |                  |
   | 263           | FLASK Security    | active     | [new spec URL]   |
   |               | Context (v2)      |            |                  |
   | 264 - 65535   | Unassigned        | -          | -                |
