           An Authorization Information Format (AIF) for ACE
                     draft-bormann-core-ace-aif-00

Abstract

   Constrained Devices as they are used in the "Internet of Things" need
   security.  One important element of this security is that devices in
   the Internet of Things need to be able to decide which operations
   requested of them should be considered authorized, need to ascertain
   that the authorization to request the operation does apply to the
   actual requester, and need to ascertain that other devices they place
   requests on are the ones they intended.

   On the ACE mailing list, an activity to create specifications for
   such authenticated authorization for constrained devices is
   contemplated.

   One potential work item is an Authorization Information Format (AIF).

   This document provides a strawman for such a format that is intended
   to enable further discussion of the objectives for its development.

1.  Introduction

   (See Abstract.)

1.1.  Terminology

   This memo uses terms from [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and [RFC4949].

   The term "byte", abbreviated by "B", is used in its now customary
   sense as a synonym for "octet".

2.  Information Model

   Authorizations are generally expressed through some data structures
   that are cryptographically secured (or transmitted in a secure way).
   This section discusses the information model underlying the payload
   of that data (as opposed to the cryptographic armor around it).

   For the purposes of this strawman, the underlying access control
   model will be that of an access matrix, which gives a set of
   permissions for each possible combination of a subject and on object.

   For the objects, we simply use the URI of a resource on a CoAP
   server.  More specifically, the parts of the URI that identify the
   server ("authority" in [RFC3986]) are considered to be the realm of
   the authentication mechanism (which are handled in the cryptographic
   armor); we therefore focus on the "path-absolute" and "query" parts
   of the URI (URI "local-part" in this specification, as expressed by
   the Uri-Path and Uri-Query options in CoAP).  Similarly, we do not
   concern the AIF format with the subject for which the AIF object is
   issued, focusing the AIF object on a single row in the access matrix
   (such a row traditionally is also called a capability list).

   At the information model level, this leaves a set of pairs of local
   URIs and related permissions.  We simplify the model for the
   permissions to simply giving the subset of the CoAP methods
   permitted.  This model is summarized in Table 1 (what is a row in an
   access matrix is now just a set of pairs, so it looks like a pair of
   columns):

                      +------------+----------------+
                      | local-part | Permission Set |
                      +------------+----------------+
                      | /s/light   | GET            |
                      |            |                |
                      | /a/led     | PUT, GET       |
                      |            |                |
                      | /dtls      | POST           |
                      +------------+----------------+

      Table 1: An authorization instance in the AIF Information Model

   In this example an authenticated subject is authorized to access
   three resources on the server to which this authorization information
   applies.  Different operations are allowed on the individual objects,
   e. g. read access (CoAP method GET) to /s/light, or create access
   (CoAP method POST) on /dtls.

2.1.  Limitations

   This simple information model only allows granting permissions for
   static URIs.  It is probably necessary to extend the model towards
   URI templates [RFC6570], however, that requires some considerations
   of the ease and unambiguity of matching a given URI against a set of
   templates in an AIF object.

   This simple information model also doesn't allow conditionalizing
   access (e.g., "opening a door is allowed if that isn't exhibiting the
   state 'locked'").

   Finally, the model does not provide any dynamic functions such as
   enabling special access for a set of resources that are specific to a
   subject, e.g. those that the subject created itself by previous
   operations (PUT, POST) or that were specifically created for the
   subject by others.

3.  Data Model

   For representing the AIF object discussion in Section 2, the
   permission set is reduced to a single number by the following steps:

   o  The entries in the table that specify the same local-part are
      merged into a single entry that specifies the union of the
      permission sets

   o  The methods in the permission sets are converted into their CoAP
      method numbers

   o  The set of numbers is converted into a single number by taking
      each number to the power of two and computing the inclusive OR of
      the binary representations of all the numbers.

   This strawman data model could be interchanged in the JSON [RFC4627]
   representation given in Figure 1 (more extensible/more compact
   representations are possible).

   [["/s/light", 1], ["/a/led", 5], ["/dtls", 2]]

      Figure 1: An authorization instance encoded in JSON (46 bytes)

   A straightforward representation of the same information in CBOR
   [RFC7049] is given in Figure 2; again, several optimizations/
   improvements are possible.

   This document makes no requirements on IANA.  (This section to be
   removed by RFC editor.)

   considerations of [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and in
