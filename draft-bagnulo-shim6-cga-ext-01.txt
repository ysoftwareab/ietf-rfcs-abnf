Internet-Draft         CGA Extension Field Format           October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) specification [1] defines
   Extension Fields that allow including additional information into the
   CGA Parameter Data Structure.  So far there seems to be enough
   interest in including additional data items into the CGA Parameter
   Data Structure through these Extension Fields that it seems
   reasonable to expect that more than one mechanism will require its
   usage.  In order to simplify the addition of multiple data items,
   this document defines a Type-Length-Value format for the Extension
   Fields.


2.  CGA Extension Field Format

   Data items to be included in Extension Fields of the CGA Parameter
   Data Structure MUST be encoded using the following Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) format:



      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Extension Type        |   Extension Data Length       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     ~                       Extension Data                          ~
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                                                    .


   Extension Type: 16-bit identifier of the type of the Extension Field.

   Extension Data Length: 16-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
      Extension Data field of this option, in octets.

   Extension Data: Variable-length field.  Extension-Type-specific data.


3.  IANA considerations

   This document introduces a new Extension Type name space for use as
   type tags when new Extensions are defined for CGAs.  The values in
   this name space are 8-bit unsigned integers.  Values in this name
   space are allocated according to the Standards Actions or IESG
   approval policies defined in RFC2434 [2].

   This document does not define any new values in any name space.


4.  Security considerations

   No security concerns are raised by the adoption of the CGA Extension
   format described in this document.
