1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
   [[I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]] provides read and write access to the
   information and state within the routing process within routing
   elements.  The I2RS client interacts with one or more I2RS agents to
   collect information from network routing systems.  This security
   architecture expands on the the security issues involved in the i2rs
   client - i2rs agent exchange described in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

2.  Definitions

   This document utilizes the definitions found the following drafts:
   [RFC4949], and [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

   Specifically, this document utilize the following definitions:

   Access control

      [RFC4949] describes access control as: a) protection of system
      resources against unauthorized access, b) process controlled by a
      security policy that permits access only by authorized entities
      (users, programs, process, or others) according to that policy, c)
      preventing unauthorized use of resource, d) using human controls
      to identify or admit properly authorized people to a SCIF, and e)
      limitations on between subjects and objections in a system.  I2RS
      focuses on role-based access control (RBAC).

   Authentication

      [RFC4949] describes authentication as the process of verifying
      (i.e., establish the truth of) an attribute value claimed by or
      for a system entity or system resource.  Authentication has two
      steps: identify and verify.

   Data Confidentiality

      [RFC4949] describes data confidentiality has having two
      properties: a) data is not disclosed to system entities unless
      they have been authorized to know, and b) data is not disclosed to
      unauthorized individuals, entities or processes.  The key point is
      that confidentiality implies that the originator has the ability
      to authorize where the information goes.  Confidentiality is
      important for both read and write scope of the data.

   Data confidentiality service

      [RFC4949] also describes data confidentiality service as a
      security service that protects data against unauthorized
      disclosure.  Please note that a user can designated that the all
      people are authorized to view a piece of data which would mean a
      data confidentiality service would be essentially a null function.

   Data Privacy

      [RFC4949] describes data privacy as a synonym for data
      confidentiality.  This I2RS document will utilize data privacy as
      a synonym for data confidentiality.

   Mutual Authentication

      [RFC4949] implies that mutual authentication between two
      interacting system entities.  Mutual authentication in I2RS
      implies that both sides move from a state of mutual suspicion to

Internet-Draft                I2RS Security                   March 2014


      mutually authenticated communication after having identified and
      validated.

   Mutual Suspicion

      [RFC4949] defines mutual suspicion as a state that exist between
      two interacting system entities in which neither entity can trust
      the other to function correctly with regard to some security
      requirement.

   Role

      [RFC4949] describes role as a job function or employment position
      to which people or other system entities may be assigned in a
      system.  In the I2RS interface, the I2RS agent roles relate to the
      roles that the I2RS client is utilizing.  In the I2RS interface,
      the I2RS client exercises a particular agent role.  The
      negotiation is over the client ability to exercise the agents role
      as a resource.  Please refere to diagram below.  Existing work
      includes IETF work in ABFAB and HTTP related SAML work.

   Role-based Access control

      [RFC4949] describes role-based access control as an identity-based
      access control herein the system entities that are identified and
      controlled are functional positions in an organization or process.
      This document discusses the roles and identities that allow read,
      write or read-write access to I2RS agent functions.

   Role-based Access control

      [RFC4949] describes role-based access control as an identity-based
      access control herein the system entities that are identified and
      controlled are functional positions in an organization or process.
      This document discusses the roles and identities that allow read,
      write or read-write access to I2RS agent functions.

   Role certificate

      [RFC4949] describes a role certificate as an organizational
      certificate that is issued to a system entity that is a member of
      the set of users that have identities that are assigned to the
      same role.

   Security audit trail

      [RFC4949] describes a security audit trail as a chronological
      record of system activity that is sufficient to enable the

      reconstruction and examination of the sequence environments and
      activities surrounding or leading to an operation, procedure, or
      event in a security-relevant transaction from inception to final
      results.  To apply this to the I2RS system, this implies that the
      processes on the I2RS client-I2RS Agent protocol and related
      actions on the I2RS-Agent can record a set of activity that will
      allow the reconstruction and examination of the sequence of
      environments and activities around actions caused by the I2RS
      protocol data streams.

   I2RS integrity

      The data transfer as it is transmitted between client and agent
      cannot be modified by unauthorized parties.

3.  Security Issues

   The following diagram is a variation of the [RFC4949] diagram on
   role-based security, and provides the context for the assumptions of
   security on the role-based work.

3.1.  Security roles for the I2RS client-agent

   Role is the Agent's Potential Read Scope plus the Potential write
   Scope.  The potential read scope is the Routing Attributes/variables
   (for example BGP peer information) that an agent may potential read.
   A notification or an event stream is a flow that an agent may
   potential read.  A write scope is something the client may write.
   Examples are is a RIB entry or a PBR entry or protocol variables
   (BGP, LDP).

   Question: Does role by client will lead to proliferation of clients?

3.2.  Transport requirements

   The architecture provides the ability to have multiple transports
   sessions providing protocol and data communication between the I2rs
   Agent and the I2RS client.  These transports can be TCP or secure
   (SCTP) or any form of transport.

   The following are questions to address regarding the transport:

   o  Do we have mandatory-to-implement transport protocols?

   o  Are there concerns about opening the mandatory-to-implement
      transport from either the Client or the Server side?




Hares, et al.           Expires September 5, 2014               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                I2RS Security                   March 2014


   o  How would that work with a publication or subscription model?

   o  Is a publishing broker feasible or does that cause security
      issues?

3.3.  Auditable Data streams

   This section discusses how we can get data streams which have a
   security audit trail (see definitions) for the I2RS Client to I2RS
   AGent interactions.  Agent audit trail could be the logging of what
   variables written by which client (id of client) on behalf of
   reported application (ID).  Since the reported application id is not
   valid, all the audit stream states is that the Client told the agent
   this is the application I'm acting for.

   Out of scope for this work is the ability to audit the application to
   I2RS-Client interfaces, or the I2RS Agent to I2RS routing system.

   Questions to be answered:

   o  I2RS client to I2RS Agent is being able to audit a requirement for
      all I2RS agents or an option?

   o  What is scope of audit (full stream, partial stream, specific
      functions)?

   o  Does the ability to audit mean the ability to verify?

   o  How does the filtering of Event data impact the audit process?
      For example if BGP event changes are only taken from 50 out of 300
      BGP peers, does this stop any ability to audit the session?  Or if
      the read filters only watch for key prefixes to be received on a
      specific set of interfaces, does this stop the ability to audit?

   o  How do you handle read filtering and auditing?  The last section
      in this document has a read filtering example.  Would some
      conditions such as auditing and read-filtering be not allowed on
      the policy match?

3.4.  Encryption and Integrity

   Encryption is used to provide data privacy.  The real question is do
   we need to encrypt the data to retain its data.

   o  I2RS Client to Agent: Is encryption a recommendation or
      requirement?

      (pro/con)

   o  I2RS environment: I2RS client to Routing System: discuss (pro/con)

3.5.  stacked I2RS agents

   It is possible to have the following hierarchical scenario:

   I2RS client---->I2RSAgent=I2RSclient---I2RSAGent(nodes)

   Questions:

   o  Does this scenario bring unique security issues?

   o  Is this scenario outside the I2RS venue
