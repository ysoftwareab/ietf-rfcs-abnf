Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Proposed is an additional usage of Explicit Congestion Notification
   (ECN) for real-time inelastic flows such as voice, video
   conferencing, and multimedia streaming.  RFC 3168 [7] specifies the
   incorporation of ECN for IP, including ECN's use of two bits in the
   IP header.  This document builds on the concepts of RFC 3168, "The
   Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification to IP", and applies them
   to real-time inelastic flows in DiffServ enabled networks to perform
   admission control and session preemption.

   To address a wider usage of this mechanism, it is necessary to
   introduce new semantics for the ECN field of the IP header (bits 6
   and 7 of byte two in IPv4 header) that can provide two levels of
   congestion indication for real-time inelastic flows.  There are
   applications and services that need to provide different treatment at
   the application level based on the importance or precedence of the
   flow for a given level of congestion experienced.  For example,
   situation critical or life threatening VoIP flows within a service
   class used for real-time traffic may need to get priority access to
   the network resources over regular VoIP traffic.  In the
   specification of the required behavior for network nodes and end-
   systems that are configured to provide ECN-capability for real-time
   flows, we factor in the requirements specified in Specifying
   Alternate Semantics for the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   Field [17].

   The operating environment is discussed first, then a framework is
   provided, and then functions are defined that need to be performed in
   the network for real-time flows.  Specifically, this includes (1)
   congestion detection through the use of flow measurement, (2) marking
   of ECN bits in the IP header of real-time packets for a given DSCP-
   marked service class and (3) actions that the end-systems needs to
   take based on the ECN bits marking.  Since real-time inelastic flows
   like voice and video conferencing are very delay sensitive, a
   different method than what is described in RFC 3168 for determining
   levels of congestion needs to be used.

   The proposal is to use ECN as a method to notify the end-systems that
   packets flowing on this path are above the engineered capacity of the
   service class that is used for real-time traffic in the network.
   Based on this information, the end-system needs to take action to
   reduce its sending rate by whatever means is appropriate; for example
   stop sending packets, or reduce its rate, or not admit new flows
   while the path remains congested.  The detailed mechanism used in the
   end-system to achieve the required behavior to the ECN marking is not
   specified in this document as it will depend on the application.  It
   is left up to application designers to define how applications in

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   end-systems should perform the required actions to conform to ECN bit
   marking in the network.  It is expected that application specific
   documents will be produced to explain the application's usage of this
   real-time ECN mechanism, one such example is Real-time ECN Use Cases
   [11] which defines admission control and preemption procedures for
   VoIP flows.  For illustration purposes, a high level example of
   admission control is provided in this document.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

1.2.  Applicability and Operating Environment

   Networks that need to support real-time inelastic services may need
   to provide a controlled environment that allows for a high level of
   guarantees on the quality of service to be honored.  We suggest the
   use of DiffServ service classes [12] to separate the real-time
   inelastic traffic from the other traffic for such a controlled
   environment, and applying the Real-Time ECN process discussed in this
   document.

   This document addresses the use of the ECN markings in a DiffServ
   controlled environment, with both marking as defined herein and in
   RFC 3168 [7] co-existing in the same network but in different service
   classes.  As well, there may be network segments that do not deploy
   any ECN processing at all, or there may be a router in the path that
   does not support DiffServ but performs ECN marking as defined in RFC
   3168.  These operating environments are explored and discussed
   herein.  But in all cases, DiffServ separation of the real-time
   inelastic traffic from the other traffic should be supported.  With
   the basic rules of:

   o  No mixing of Real-Time ECN and RFC 3168 ECN marking in the same
      service class.

   o  Allow mixing of traffic from Real-Time ECN capable and incapable
      end-systems in the same service class and using ECN bits to
      provide the differentiation.

   o  Allow traffic from both Real-Time ECN capable and RFC 3168
      conformant end-systems as long as the traffic is marked with
      different DSCP values (using different service classes).

2.  Framework

   When the packet forwarding network is used to support Session Based
   Real Time Application usage, the application behavior requires
   different support from the network.  For example, random packet drops
   does not trigger application to lessen the offered load to the
   network, it just degrade the session service the application needs.
   The mechanism described by this document is used within a framework
   where we try to achieve the following goals:

   1.  Allow the application control and signaling be separate from the
       packet forwarding network control and signaling.

   2.  Keeping the packet forwarding network and its control simple.

   3.  Allow application features be controlled in the application
       layer.

   The above set of goals point us to an architecture where:

   1.  The network plays a role of providing current network information
       concerning the availability of network resource to support the
       application needs.

   2.  The application uses the information provided by the network to
       make application level decisions.

   In the context of Session Admission Control for Real Time traffic
   with Voice Over IP as an example, we will discuss the framework in
   the following sections.

2.1.  Application Decisions based on Network Information

   For this document the application decisions is for support of real
   time traffic session admission control.  This includes the decision
   of:

   1.  should normal priority real time sessions be admitted.

   2.  should higher priority real time sessions be admitted.

   3.  should normal priority real time sessions be terminated.

   4.  should higher priority real time sessions be terminated.

   Notice these are decisions local to the application and the actual
   actions can be controlled by the use of local application level
   policies.

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   For normal priority real time session admission control, the goal is
   to make sure the additional offered load by the new normal priority
   real time session does not push the network resource utilization into
   a state that will negatively affect the packet delay, delay
   variation, loss requirements of the already admitted real time
   sessions.  Hence the application decision is to admit or not to admit
   a new real time session based on a set of network information.

   For higher priority real time session admission control, the goal is
   to make sure the additional offered load by the new higher priority
   real time session does not push the network resource utilization into
   a state that will negatively affect the packet delay, delay
   variation, loss requirements of the already admitted real time
   sessions.  Hence the application decision is to admit or not to admit
   a new real time session based on a set of network information.
   Notice by the nature of higher priority real time session, the
   decision can be to admit higher priority session when not admitting
   normal priority sessions while approaching fuller utilization of
   network resources.  With the notion of normal priority and higher
   priority sessions being application level notions and the decisions
   be application level decisions, possibly determined using local
   application policies.

   For normal priority real time session termination decision, the goal
   is to have a method to decrease the offered load to the network when
   the network resource utilization approaches the level of affecting
   the packet delay, delay variation, loss requirements of the already
   admitted real time sessions.  This action is taken due to the fact
   that for real time sessions like VoIP, the affect will be on all real
   time sessions that shares the limiting network resource.  This
   decision is to sacrifice a single (or limited number of) real time
   session on behave of all the other affected real time sessions.

   For higher priority real time session termination decision, the goal
   is to have a method to decrease the offered load to the network when
   the network resource utilization approaches the level of affecting
   the packet delay, delay variation, loss requirements of the already
   admitted real time sessions.  This action is taken due to the fact
   that for real time sessions like VoIP, the affect will be on all real
   time sessions that shares the limiting network resource.  This
   decision is to sacrifice a single (or limited number of) real time
   session on behave of all the other affected real time sessions.  By
   the nature of higher priority, the normal priority sessions are
   sacrificed/terminated before higher priority sessions.  This can be
   controlled using local application level policies.

   Notice the action of the decisions are controlled by local
   application policies, one example is to do nothing when higher

   priority real time session termination decision needs to be made,
   hence not supporting the higher priority session termination
   function.

   We call this Session Admission Control at the application layer.

2.2.  Network Information for Supporting Application Decisions

   For Session Admission Control of Real Time traffic, due to the nature
   of real time traffic like VoIP, the network information needs to
   indicate will the offered load introduced by the to-be-admitted
   session affect the existing admitted sessions.  The application also
   requires the network to indication when more aggressive action is
   needed by the application to allow acceptable network service be
   provided to the admitted sessions.  Hence we propose the following
   network information:

   1.  Network information for session admission control.  This
       information is used to assist the application to decide if a new
       application session should be admitted to use the packet
       forwarding network resource.  For real time in-elastic session,
       this information needs to indicate the on-set of additional
       packet delay/delay-variation/loss that affects the real time in-
       elastic sessions sharing the packet forwarding network resource.
       For normal priority session admission control, we allow the
       network device along the session's packet forwarding path to
       indicate if a certain level of resource utilization is reached.
       We call this Admission-Level, and uses bits per second as the
       basic measurement unit at the network device.  When the network
       resource utilization at a network device exceeds Admission
       -Level, the network device indicates this condition by using some
       field in the packet (proposing the use of the ECN field) being
       forwarded to the session end point.  Please notice that the
       setting of Admission -Level is a local network provisioning
       policy for the network device.  And it may depend on the link
       speed being used, other traffic sharing the link resource, and
       other local network device provisioning criterion.  This approach
       allows the network devices' local provisioning policy to control
       the allocation of resources of the network device, allowing
       network devices with different capabilities be used in the
       session packet forwarding path, and providing the information to
       the application to assist the making of session admission control
       decision.

   2.  Network information for session termination.  This information is
       used to assist the application to decide if the network load
       offered by the application should be lessened to allow existing
       application sessions to receive acceptable service from the

       packet forwarding network.  For real time in-elastic session,
       this information needs to indicate a more severe on-set of
       additional packet delay/delay-variation/loss that affects the
       real time in-elastic sessions sharing the packet forwarding
       network resource, as compared with session admission control
       information.  For normal priority session termination, we allow
       the network device along the session's packet forwarding path to
       indicate if a certain level of resource utilization is reached.
       We call this Termination-Level, and uses bits per second as the
       basic measurement unit at the network device.  When the network
       resource utilization at a network device exceeds Termination-
       Level, the network device indicates this condition by using some
       field in the packet (proposing the use of the ECN field) being
       forwarded to the session end point.  Please notice that the
       setting of Termination-Level is a local network provisioning
       policy for the network device.  And it may depend on the link
       speed being used, other traffic sharing the link resource, and
       other local network device provisioning criterion.  This approach
       allows the network devices' local provisioning policy to control
       the allocation of resources of the network device, allowing
       network devices with different capabilities be used in the
       session packet forwarding path, and providing the information to
       the application to assist the making of session termination
       decision.  The Termination-Level indication can also be used for
       higher priority sessions' admission control decision.  For
       example, when Termination-Level indication is received by the
       application session decision point, higher priority sessions may
       not be admitted but their session initiation request being
       queued, depending on the application level higher priority session
       admission control policy.  There are also mechanisms for
       smoothing out the session termination process and to provide
       network information to allow multiple higher level session
       termination.  These will be discussed in the detail mechanism
       sections of this document.

   In the following section, we provide an operational overview using
   SIP to show how the above information are used together.  In later
   sections we provide the details of the packet forwarding network
   mechanism itself.

2.3.  Operational Overview with SIP Applications

   This operational overview section provides some high level indication
   of how the goals and ideas of previous sections of the framework can
   be used together in a SIP application environment.  We separated the
   overview into subsections, each describing session admission control
   operation and session preemption operation.

2.3.1.  Session Admission Control

   For session admission control application level decisions, the
   application requires the knowledge of "will the offered load of the
   new session push the network resource utilization along the
   application media packet forwarding path (called media path for
   short) beyond the network resource's ability to support the required
   service".

   The network provides this information by performing a measurement of
   packet traffic along the media path and comparing the measurement
   with a preset Admission-Level.  Notice that this Admission-Level can
   be setup using static or dynamic network device configuration.  The
   mechanism described by this document is independent from network
   control, provisioning, signaling.  Hence allowing network devices
   freedom to setup Admission-Level based on its capability and local
   network control/provisioning policy.

   Since this measurement is performed prior to any application media
   traffic can flow, we use a pre-media probing method to allow the
   application to learn this information for session admission control
   decision.  For SIP environment this is described in "RTP Payload
   Format for ECN Probing" [15].  We also use the SIP application level
   signaling pre-condition mechanism to indicate the use of this method.
   Please see A Congestion Status Precondition for the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [18] for details.

   We provided a simple high level operational walk through below, with
   the presumption that probing starts at a point during session setup
   when the Receiver endpoint addressing information is known by the
   Sender.  As the immediate application is admission control, the
   endpoints involved SHOULD NOT begin alerting or otherwise notifying
   the user of a new session until the admission control procedures
   determine whether to admit the new session.

   With an unidirectional probing mechanism, after the Sender knows
   addressing information specific to the Receiver, it can begin
   generating probe packets to the Receiver.  When the probe packets are
   received at the Receiver, an admission decision can be made based on
   the congestion level indicated by the probe packets and the priority
   associated with the session.  The process of making this decision may
   involve a unilateral decision made in the Receiver, or it may involve
   communication either back to the Sender, or to another device
   responsible for making the session admission decision.

   Figure 1: Session Admission Control

   1.  Endpoint (EP) A starts the process.  It creates a Probe Packet
       and sends it to the address and port it has for EP B.


   2.  Router A receives the Probe Packet, and applies a metering and
       marking mechanism for real-time inelastic traffic.


   3.  Router A re-marks the ECN field in the IP header of the Probe
       Packet based on the metering and marking mechanism being used,
       then forwards the packet.


   4.  EP B receives the Probe Packet.  The ECN value received in the
       Probe Packet in the IP header indicates exceeding the admission
       control level of congestion on the path towards EP B.


   5.  EP B inspects the ECN value received in the IP header, and uses
       it to begin the decision process on whether to admit the session.


   In the context of admission control, application level session
   admission policy may dictate that higher priority sessions may get
   admitted when the Probe Packets indicate pre-congestion level that
   prevent normal priority sessions from being admitted.

2.3.2.  Session Preemption

   For application level session preemption decisions, the application
   requires the knowledge of "is the current offered load of network
   traffic pushing the network resource utilization along the
   application media packet forwarding path beyond the network
   resource's ability to support the required service for the admitted
   sessions?".  This condition can occur even when session admission
   control have been applied.  For example, packet network routing
   change can cause previously different session packet forwarding paths
   to merge at some points in the network and pushed the network

   resource utilization at these points to beyond their ability to
   support the required service.  These packet network routing change
   may be caused by router failures or other reasons, this framework
   allows the packet forwarding network to use whatever method it
   chooses to provide the best packet forwarding network service without
   getting in its way.  The application just need to know if it needs to
   take action based on the resulting packet forwarding network
   conditions.

   The above knowledge can be provided to the application by the
   network.  As with the probe packets described in the context of
   session admission control, endpoints can similarly monitor the ECN
   value of RTP media packets and react accordingly, initiating
   preemption mechanisms when necessary.  If the preemption threshold
   level is exceeded, as indicated by the ECN value of the media
   packets, application level local policy may dictate session
   preemption as a required action to keep bandwidth resource usage
   within engineered limits.

   The example provided here shows only a unidirectional media flow.  A
   bidirectional session would operate similarly, but with two
   unidirectional flows in opposite directions.

   The example provided here describes an application level local policy
   dictating that preemption occurs when the preemption threshold level
   has been exceeded, as indicated by the ECN value of the media
   packets.

   1.  Endpoint (EP) A starts the process.  It creates an RTP media
       packet and sends it to the address and port it has for EP B. Each
       media packet is marked with default ECN value to indicate no
       congestion.


   2.  Router A receives the RTP media packets, and applies a metering
       and marking mechanism for real-time inelastic traffic.

   3.  Router A re-marks the ECN field in the IP header of the RTP media
       packets based on the metering and marking mechanism being used,
       then forwards the packet.  For the purposes of this example, it
       is presumed the network resource condition is such that Router A
       marks the ECN bits to indicate that the preemption level of
       congestion has been exceeded.


   4.  EP B receives the RTP media packets.  EP B monitors the ECN value
       of RTP media packets, and upon receiving packets marked with the
       ECN value indicating that the preemption level of congestion has
       been exceeded somewhere along the path in the network, it follows
       local application level session preemption policy to initiate
       session preemption.


   5.  The specific actions taken to carry out preemption may vary, as
       they are local application level session preemption policy.


2.3.3.  Operational Overview Summary

   The simple high level walk through of operational overview for
   session admission control and session preemption in previous sections
   provided some overview of how we:

   1.  Keep the application features being controlled in the application
       layer using application level session policies.

   2.  Keep the packet forwarding network and its control simple by just
       adding simple network condition indication to the forwarded
       packet with existing packet header field.

   3.  Allow the application control and signaling be separate from the
       packet forwarding network control and signaling.  And allowing
       the packet forwarding network to do what it does best without
       adding application level baggage to it.  And allowing the
       application layer to do what it does best on utilizing the packet
       forwarding network resources.


3.  General Principles

   In this section, some of the important design principles and
   assumptions guiding the development of this proposal are described.

   o  Because ECN for real-time flows is likely to be adopted gradually
      and selectively in nodes, accommodating migration and selective



Babiarz, et al.          Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 13]


Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


      deployment is essential.  Some nodes may not be able to detect
      congestion or mark the ECN bits within IP packet headers.  Also
      there may be parts of the network where congestion is very
      unlikely and therefore there is no need for an ECN function.  The
      most viable strategy is one that accommodates selective or
      incremental deployment in a network with both ECN-capable and non-
      ECN-capable nodes.

   o  Asymmetric routing is likely to be a normal occurrence within IP
      networks.  That is, the path (the sequence of links and nodes)
      taken by forward and reverse packet flows may be different.

   o  Many nodes process the "regular" header in IP packets more
      efficiently than they process the header information in IP
      options.  This suggests that the ideal approach is to keep
      "congestion experienced" information in the regular header of an
      IP packet.

   o  A specific DiffServ service class would be implemented for real-
      time traffic.  The assumption is that a signaling protocol (SIP,
      H.323, MGCP, H.248, etc.) will be used to determine if the end-
      systems are capable of understanding ECN bit marking and thus, are
      willing to participate in congestion control prior to marking
      packets as ECN-Capable Transport (ECT).

   o  Flow measurement and marking of ECN bits as defined herein is
      performed on flows from ECN-capable end-systems that is mapped to
      a ECN-enabled service class, and may be performed on selected node
      links in the network where congestion is likely to occur.  Other
      traffic flows are not affected by this function.  Nodes that do
      not support this function forward packets without modifying the
      ECN field of the IP header.

   o  ECN procedure as defined in RFC 3168 [7] may also be applied to
      DiffServ service classes in the IP network.  Both methods may co-
      exist in the network, but in different DiffServ service classes.


4.  Definition of Congestion for Real-Time Traffic

   Real-time traffic generated by applications such as voice, video
   conferencing, and multimedia streaming have different performance
   requirements when compared with non-real-time elastic applications
   that use a protocol such as TCP.  One such requirement is that end-
   to-end delay be bounded to a small value, and that packets should not
   be dropped.

   It is generally accepted that such performance requirements can be



Babiarz, et al.          Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 14]


Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   achieved when the real-time flows are serviced by the nodes in their
   path through a real-time service class such as one based on the
   Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB [8] treatment.  This treatment can be
   provided only when the real-time service class is not overloaded
   (i.e., when the aggregate of input traffic never exceeds the class'
   capacity, and thus no congestion condition occurs).  It should also
   be noted that when the overloaded condition occurs, all real-time
   traffic flows within the real-time service class at the congestion
   point will be affected, not just the offending traffic flow.  Hence,
   it is desirable to avoid the overloaded condition as much as
   possible.

   With the above performance requirements for real-time inelastic
   traffic in mind, "congestion of real-time inelastic traffic" is
   defined to be the network condition when aggregated packet flows
   within the service class exceed an engineered traffic level.  The
   engineering of the network is such that traffic exceeding this
   engineered traffic level by a defined and limited amount does not
   generally cause an increase in packet queuing or packet dropping
   (service class overload) in the network.  Instead, the ECN field is
   used to provide an indication that traffic is above the engineered
   traffic level.  This can be viewed as explicit notification to
   prevent congestion.  However, uncontrolled or prolonged increase in
   traffic above the defined amount may result in an increase in packet
   queuing and/or packet dropping, and therefore may cause overload of
   the real-time service class.

4.1.  Avoiding Congestion for Real-Time Traffic

   Congestion notification can be utilized in a flow admission control
   scheme to ensure sufficient forwarding resources (bandwidth), hence
   for Real-Time Traffic, ECN is used to prevent congestion.  In this
   scheme, a continuous process at selected link(s)/node(s) measures the
   traffic going through a specified real-time service class and
   indicates a level of congestion (such as "not congested", "mildly
   congested" or "severely congested").  This congestion indication as
   described in Section 4.4.2 is then used by the application to select
   the action that will be taken by the application controlling the
   service.  The action could be to admit or not to admit a new flow
   into that real-time service class in the network, or have the sending
   rate of ECN marked flows reduced or stopped, or terminate a flow.
   All with the effect of reducing level of offered traffic.  Based on
   the performance requirements of real-time traffic, it is desirable
   that the measurement process indicate congestion of real-time traffic
   before any significant packet accumulates in the queue occurs.  This
   is such that no significant queuing delay is added to existing real-
   time flows' end-to-end delay.

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   An alternative method to avoid the overloaded condition of a service
   class is through resource reservation and admission control.  A
   (centralized or distributed) database maintains a record of available
   resources (bandwidth) for the real-time service class on each link in
   the network and a new flow is admitted only if there are enough
   resources on the links in its path so that the overloaded condition
   is avoided.  Checking for available resources can be done with a
   reservation protocol or through a policy based protocol.  An
   important issue is that the maintenance and per-flow querying of the
   resource database in conjunction with the routing database is an
   important overhead that is undesirable in many implementations.

4.2.  Congestion Detection for Real-Time Traffic

   One of the goals is to keep the amount of processing that is
   performed in the network to be very small and not require any other
   computations or state information to be kept in network nodes.  One
   way to achieve this is through monitoring the aggregate rate of
   traffic in the specified real-time service class and to indicate
   congestion when a certain traffic threshold is exceeded.  Hence the
   network nodes need only to perform flow measurement of packets marked
   with specific DS codepoint and with ECN indication that the end-
   system is ECN-capable.  Another policy that may be used is where
   network nodes perform flow measurement of packets marked with a
   specific DS codepoint and if the rate is exceeded, only ECN mark
   packets that indicate that they are ECN-capable.  The application
   monitors the ECN field, and takes an appropriate action based on the
   marking.

   Figure 3 below shows a block diagram of the traffic measurement and
   ECN marking function.

   Figure 3: Block Diagram of Meter and Marker Function

   The Meter meters each packet within the real-time service class and
   passes the packet and the metering result to the ECN Marker.

   The Marker sets the ECN congestion level for each packet that is
   marked as ECN-capable within the real-time service class based on the
   results of the Meter.

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   The traffic rate of the specified service class may be measured with
   a simple token bucket meter, an exponentially weighted moving average
   meter, or other methods.  The goals of a rate measuring method are
   simplicity and minimum or no added delay to traffic forwarding.

   The specification of the traffic measurement mechanism is outside the
   scope of this document.  The intention is that an existing traffic
   measurement mechanisms may be used.  In Appendix A, an example of a
   simple token bucket method for measurement and marking is provided.

4.3.  Behavior of Meter and Marker

   When the measured rate exceeds the engineered traffic level for ECN-
   capable marked packets, the Meter sets its result flag and passes it
   to the Marker.  The Marker, sets the appropriate ECN value for all
   ECN-capable marked packets belonging to the service class that is
   measured until the result flag from the Meter is cleared.

   When the measured traffic rate is reduced below the engineered rate
   the Meter clears the result flag if set.  The clearing of the result
   flag output from the Meter stops marking ECN bits by the Marker.  The
   metering function has built-in hysteresis for setting and clearing
   the result flag.  The amount of hysteresis is controlled by the
   configuration parameters (example size of the token bucket) of the
   traffic measurement mechanism and should be configured to meet the
   characteristics of the real-time inelastic traffic that is being
   measured.  See report, Simulation of RT-ECN based Admission Control
   and Preemption [13] for results of the above metering and marking as
   well analysis of different metering approaches in Discussion of
   Congestion Marking with RT-ECN [14].

4.4.  Marking for Congestion Notification

   Marking for Explicit Congestion Notifications is done through the use
   of the two ECN bits in the IP header.

   Bits 6 and 7 in the IPv4 octet are designated as the ECN field.  This
   octet of the IPv4 header corresponds to the Traffic Class octet in
   IPv6, and the ECN field is defined identically in both cases.  The

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   definitions for the IPv4 TOS octet RFC 791 [1] and the IPv6 Traffic
   Class octet have been superseded by the six-bit Differentiated
   Services (DS) field RFC 2474 [4], RFC 2780 [6].  Bits 6 and 7 are
   listed in RFC 2474 [4] as Currently Unused, and are specified in RFC
   2780 as approved for experimental use for ECN.  Finally, RFC 3168 [7]
   standardizes the use of the ECN bits.

4.4.1.  ECN Marking of Real-Time Inelastic Flows

   Marking of ECN bits for real-time inelastic flows is defined so that
   nodes in the path need only to perform an ECN set function when an
   engineered rate is exceeded for packets that are marked as ECN-
   capable.  With this approach there is no need to perform a test to
   determine the congestion level marking of the received packet before
   a node performs ECN marking.  Other approaches could be used, but for
   simplicity we have chosen this one.  In Section 7 we discuss the
   different marking approaches that were studied.

   Network nodes that are configured to support congestion notification
   for real-time flows need to provide the following capability:

   o  Congestion detection of packets marked indicating that the end-
      system is ECN-capable (ECT) SHOULD be performed using a real-time
      measurement mechanism (e.g., flow metering).

   o  When the flow rate exceeds configured rate "A" (i.e., the first
      level of congestion), ECN bit 7 of ECT marked packets is set to
      '1'.

   o  When the flow rate exceeds configured rate "B" (i.e., the second
      level of congestion), ECN bits 6 and 7 of ECT market packets are
      set to '01'.

   o  Measured rate "B" SHOULD be greater than rate "A".

4.4.2.  ECN Semantics for Real-Time Traffic

   Some real-time applications or services need the indication of two
   levels of congestion experienced, CE(1) and CE(2), for first and
   second level respectively.  Other applications may only need a single
   indication.  To address a wide range of usage, we have selected the
   following ECN semantics for real-time inelastic traffic.

   ECN Marking:

   Bits 6 and 7 values
        0     0      Not-ECT - End-system is Not ECN-Capable Transport
        1     0      ECT(0) - End-system is ECN-Capable Transport
        1     1      CE(1) - Congestion Experienced at 1st level
        0     1      CE(2) - Congestion Experienced at 2nd level

   Figure 5: ECN Semantics for Real-Time Flows

4.5.  End-System Behavior

   Listed below are reactions to ECN marking that needs to be supported
   by end-systems that indicated that they are ECN-capable:

   o  Under normal (non emergency or situation critical) conditions
      during new flow establishment, ECN-capable end-system that receive
      packets marked indicating that congestion was experienced at 1st
      level CE(1), SHOULD NOT proceed with the session setup.  New flows
      that indicate that they are "emergency or situation critical"
      SHOULD be allowed admission at CE(1).  The definition and
      verification of what flow is classified as "emergency or situation
      critical" is left up to the application.

   o  Once a flow has been admitted and the path experience 1st level of
      congestion CE(1), ECN-capable end-systems that have ability to
      dynamically react to ECN marking, SHOULD reduce their sending rate
      as agreed to during session setup.

   o  During new flow establishment, ECN-capable end-systems that
      receive packets marked indicating that congestion was experience
      at 2nd level CE(2) SHOULD NOT proceed with session setup.

   o  Systems with established flows that experience the 2nd level of
      congestion CE(2) SHOULD terminating sessions or reduce sending
      rate in a controlled manner, and continue until the congestion
      level drops below the 2nd level of congestion.

   Generally, at 1st level of congestion, no additional traffic should
   be added with the exception for flows that are identified as being
   potentially life threatening i.e., E911 or situation critical.  End-
   systems that have the ability to reduce their sending rate should do
   so.  At 2nd level of congestion, no additional traffic is added to
   the congested path plus selected flows on the congested path are
   removed to reduce congestion below 2nd level.

5.  Detection of Inappropriate Changes to the ECN Field

   This section discusses in detail some of the possible inappropriate
   changes to the ECN field in the network, such as reducing level of
   congestion, falsely reporting no congestion, or modifying ECN bits to
   indicate that the path is or is not Real-Time ECN compliant.
   Reducing the level of congestion or falsely reporting no congestion
   will be referred to here as "cheating".

   The Real-Time ECN mechanism provides two levels of congestion
   indication.  Therefore, the cheating detection mechanism as defined
   in RFC 3168 [7] and RFC 3540 [10] that uses ECT(0) and ECT(1) states
   can not be used.  Instead, the procedure outlined in this memo SHOULD
   be used to detect if inappropriate changes to the ECN bits have
   occurred between originator and receiver.  The outlined procedure is
   executed under the control of the application prior to admission of a
   new real-time flow.  The testing for conformance is performed between
   the two Real-Time ECN-capable and conformant applications running in
   the end-systems.  These two end-systems will be referred to as sender
   and receiver.

   In the implementation of a Real-Time ECN mechanism in the network,
   the network administrator through the use of policies or through the
   use of signaling/control protocols such as SIP, can verify the
   capabilities and conformance of the end-systems.  As stated earlier,
   only applications running in end-systems that are capable and
   conformant to this Real-Time ECN mechanism may use it.  End-systems
   that are not Real-Time ECN-capable or conformant MUST set ECN field
   to '00' when sending packets.

5.1.  During Session Setup

   During the admission of a new real-time flow, application signaling
   is used to exchange end-system capabilities, including whether the
   end-systems are Real-Time ECN capable.  The Real-Time ECN mechanism
   defined in this memo can be used to provide admission control
   capabilities to end-systems.  In order to provide this capability,
   the signaling used by the end-systems requires a means to both
   trigger the Real-Time ECN probing process as described in "RTP
   Payload Format for ECN Probing" [15] and "Real-time ECN Use Cases"
   [11], as well as to delay session setup; - specifically user
   indication of a new session, i.e., ringing until an admission control
   decision has been made.  In the context of SIP, preconditions can be
   used to accomplish both of these requirements.  For more details, see
   A Congestion Status Precondition for the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [18].

   If signaling indicates that the destination end-system does not

   support the Real-Time ECN mechanism, the originating end-system MAY
   reattempt the session without stipulating the use of the Real-Time
   ECN mechanism.  While such a session would not undergo the Real-Time
   ECN admission control tests, this does allow session creation between
   end-systems that support the Real-Time ECN mechanism and those that
   do not.

   Prior to admission of a new real-time flow, the following procedure
   SHOULD be used to detect inappropriate changes to ECN field.  Note
   that this procedure can be independent of an actual admission control
   procedure.

   Under the control of the application, the sender generates and sends
   a stream of RTP-probe packets.  This stream of RTP-probe packets is
   specified as follows:

   1.  A random sequence of the four possible ECN bit combinations is
       selected, and this sequence of values is used as the ECN field
       values on the initial four RTP-probe packets.  The ECN field
       marking is also copied into the RTP-probe payload [15] and the
       payload should be secured.  SRTP RFC 3711 [9] is one mechanism
       that can provide the necessary security for the probe packets.

   2.  After the sequence of four RTP-probe packets is sent, the sender
       sends RTP-probe packets with randomly generated ECN bit of '10',
       '11' and '01' until probing is stopped.  As before, the ECN field
       marking is also copied into the RTP-probe payload and the payload
       should be secured.

   The probing sequence just described is one method that can be
   implemented for probing to detect inappropriate changes to the ECN
   field.  Because the ECN field marking on probe packets is always
   copied into the RTP-probe payload, the receiving end-system is always
   able to compare the received ECN value in the IP header with that in
   the secured RTP-probe payload.  Therefore the ability to detect
   inappropriate changes to the ECN Field via probing is independent of
   the ECN bit sequence used.

   Upon reception of the RTP-probe packet, the receiver compares the
   received ECN marking in the IP header to ECN marking in RTP-probe
   payload.

   A packet sent with ECN field '10' and received as indicated below
   have the meanings as indicated:

   o  Received as '10': path is valid, no congestion.

   o  Received as '11': path is valid, congestion experienced at 1st
      level.

   o  Received as '01': path is valid, congestion experienced at 2nd
      level.

   o  Received as '00': path is not valid, device in path zeroed ECN
      field.

   Packet sent with ECN field '01' and received as indicated below have
   the meanings as indicated:

   o  Received as '01': path is valid.

   o  Received as '11': path is not valid, device in path reduced
      congestion experienced to 1st level, this could also mean that the
      path is through a congested router that used RFC 3168 for ECN
      marking of this flow.

   o  Received as '10': path is not valid, device in path cleared
      indication of congestion experienced.

   o  Received as '00': path is not valid, device in path zeroed ECN
      field.

   Packet sent with ECN field '11' and received as indicated below have
   the meanings as indicated:

   o  Received as '11': path is valid.

   o  Received as '01': path is valid, congestion experienced at 2nd
      level.

   o  Received as '10': path is not valid, device in path cleared
      indication of congestion experienced.

   o  Received as '00': path is not valid, device in path zeroed ECN
      field.

   Packet sent with ECN field '00' and received as indicated below have
   the meanings as indicated:

   o  Received as '00': path is valid.

   o  Received other than '00':, path is not conformant.

   The above mechanism will detect when a device in the path tries to
   cheat by changing the ECN field to indicate no congestion, or reduce

   the level of congestion, or incorrectly indicate a path is or is not
   ECN capable.  Due to the nature of the Real-time ECN process
   described in this memo, it is not possible to detect the presence of
   devices which raise the level of congestion in the ECN marking.

   The detection of presence of devices that lower ECN marking is only
   possible if there are no other Real-Time ECN capable routers down
   stream from the cheating device along the network path legitimately
   marking the ECN bits, masking out the cheating condition.  However,
   this is not a problem if the down steam router marks ECN back to the
   appropriate congestion level, as the end-system will take the correct
   action for that flow.

   The outlined procedure for detection of inappropriate changes to the
   ECN field is also applied to RTP-probe flow in the direction from
   call originator to the far-end as outlined in Real-time ECN Use Cases
   [11].

   During session setup phase, if it is determined that the path is
   invalid, non-conformant or congested, the setup of the session SHOULD
   be terminated with cause information provided to the user.

5.2.  After Session is Established

   Once a new real-time flow has been admitted, the following procedure
   SHOULD be used to detect cheaters and routers that use ECN procedure
   defined in RFC 3168:

   o  For real-time flow, the media packets are sent with an ECN value
      of '10' set in the IP header.  At random intervals, a single media
      packet will be sent with '01' in order to detect the cheaters and
      congested RFC 3168-capable routers.  The receiver must be aware of
      which packets the sender marked with '01', so that it does not
      misinterpret such packets as indicating congestion.

   o  In order that both the sender and receiver are synchronized as to
      which packets are marked '01', they will use a common function to
      determine which packets are marked.  The Mersenne Twister MT 19937
      [16] random number generator, seeded with the initial RTP Sequence
      Number used by the sender, is utilized in this synchronization
      process.

   o  During the initial RTP-probe sequence [15] that was used to verify
      conformance of path during session setup, the initial Sequence
      Number used by the sender is sent to the receiver in the payload
      of the probe packets.  This value is used as a seed in a Mersenne
      Twister MT 19937 random number generator in both the sender and
      receiver.  The sender begins sending media packets marked with ECN



Babiarz, et al.          Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 23]


Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


      '10'.  The sender and receiver each use the MT 19937 function to
      select the next pseudorandom number in the sequence, modulus 4, to
      determine the next packet to mark with ECN '01'.  The use of
      modulus 4 is to keep the interval between packets used for
      detection of cheaters, etc., bounded.

   In the sender, the following steps describe this process:

   1.  During probing, send the Initial RTP Sequence Number (IRSN), in
       the payload of the probe packet.

   2.  Seed the MT 19937 function with the initial sequence number:
       MT19937.seed(IRSN).

   3.  Calculate N, the number of media packets to be marked with ECN
       '10', before marking a single media packet with ECN '01', as
       follows: N = (MT19937.next)(MOD 4) + 1.

   4.  Once the real-time flow begins, mark N packets with ECN '10'.

   5.  Send the next packet with ECN '01'.

   6.  Repeat starting with Step 3, until the real-time flow is
       terminated.

   In the receiver, the following steps describe this process:

   1.  During probing, pull the Initial RTP Sequence Number (IRSN) from
       the payload of a received probe packet[15].  Initialize NSN
       (described in Step 4 below): NSN = IRSN.

   2.  Seed the MT19937 function with the initial sequence number:
       MT19937.seed(IRSN).

   3.  Calculate N, the number of media packets to be marked with ECN
       '10', before marking a single media packet with ECN '01', as
       follows: N = (MT19937.next)(MOD 4) + 1.

   4.  Calculate NSN, the sequence number of the next packet expected to
       be marked with ECN '01': NSN = NSN + N.

   5.  Receive media packets, watching for a packet with a sequence
       number equal to or greater than NSN, until the real-time flow is
       terminated:

       A.  Packets with a sequence number less than NSN are used for
           congestion detection.  Repeat Step 5.




Babiarz, et al.          Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 24]


Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


       B.  Packets with a sequence number equal to NSN are used for
           detection of cheaters and congested RFC 3168-enabled routers.
           If the ECN value of this packet is not '01', a cheater or
           congested RFC 3168-enabled router is present along the
           network path.  Jump to Step 3 and repeat.

       C.  Packets with a sequence number greater than NSN should result
           in calculation of a new NSN value.  Jump to Step 3 and
           repeat.

   The previous algorithm is one that should be used.  Other methods can
   be used as long as both the sender and receiver agree to it.

   Upon receipt of an RTP packet the receiver expects to be marked '01',
   the end-system compares the received ECN field with the expected
   value of '01', or CE(2).  If a cheater is present, and is not being
   overridden by marking of one or more Real-Time ECN capable routers
   along the path through the network, the end-system detects the
   presence of a cheater if the received ECN value is '10' or '11' or
   '00', (ECT(0) or CE(1) or Not-ECT).  Also, this procedure can be used
   to detect the presence of congested routers that use RFC 3168 as its
   ECN marking.  A congested router that uses the ECN marking procedure
   as defined in RFC 3168 will interpret ECN value '01' as ECT(1) and
   change the marking to '11' (CE).

   If after a session has been admitted it is detected that there is a
   cheater or congested router that uses RFC 3168 for ECN marking of
   real-time flows, the established session SHOULD be terminated with
   cause information provided to the user.


6.  Network with DiffServ and Real-Time ECN Support

   The real-time ECN process requires that the real-time inelastic
   traffic is separated from the other traffic.  Within a DiffServ
   network, it is perfectly fine to deploy RFC 3168 ECN marking for
   service classes that are used for elastic TCP traffic and to deploy
   Real-Time ECN marking as defined herein for service classes that are
   used for inelastic real-time traffic.  DiffServ is used to separate
   the real-time traffic from the other traffic flows, and Real-Time ECN
   processing is applied to this separated traffic to provide control
   within the service class.  Under this condition, the most optimal
   deployment is to have all network segments support DiffServ, with
   Real-Time ECN marking capability on selected nodes where congestion
   within the real-time service class is likely.  Over time, as traffic
   levels within the real-time service class become complex and/or the
   network topology becomes more complex, it may be preferable that
   Real-Time ECN capability is extended to all or most network nodes.



Babiarz, et al.          Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 25]


Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   This approach allows for incremental deployment of DiffServ and Real-
   Time ECN.  Specific network nodes where congestion is not likely to
   occur may delay its use of DiffServ and ECN.

6.1.  Workable Approach for Co-existence of RT-ECN

   Routers need a method to understand which ECN mechanism should be
   applied based on the traffic being forwarded.  We believe DiffServ
   architecture can provide this capability.  The normal practice is to
   segregate elastic and real-time inelastic flows into different
   service classes that use different PHBs with the DS codepoint being
   used as the indicator for selection of the PHB.  Router can implement
   both ECN procedures and use DS codepoint for indicating which ECN
   mechanism applies to each packet.

   The approach that we selected allows for two different ECN
   mechanisms, one for elastic flows and the other for real-time
   inelastic flows with the following rules for deployment:

   1.  ECN as per RFC 3168 applies to the Default Forwarding [4] PHB
       '000000'.

   2.  In DiffServ enable networks, DS codepoints is used to indicate
       the ECN mechanisms that may be supported.

       A.  ECN as per RFC 3168 should be used with the AF [5] PHBs.

       B.  RT-ECN should be used with EF [8] PHB.

       C.  Class Selector PHBs may use RFC 3168 or RT-ECN and should be
           based on traffic characteristic assigned to the PHB.  See
           Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes [12]
           for guidance.

   3.  As RFC 3168 defines the default behavior, all other mechanisms
       that are defined should not cause harm to the default ECN
       behavior or network if the alternate ECN mechanism encounters RFC
       3168 marking.

   As stated in Specifying Alternate Semantics for the Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) Field [17] "that the default ECN
   semantics defined in RFC 3168 are the current default semantics for
   the ECN field, regardless of the contents of any other fields in the
   IP header.  In particular, the default ECN semantics apply for more
   than best-effort traffic with a codepoint of '000000' for the
   diffserv field - the default ECN semantics currently apply regardless
   of the contents of the diffserv field."  We propose that an amendment
   to RFC 3168 be considered that would allow non default DS codepoints

   to be used for indicating alternate ECN semantics with guidance as
   stated above.


7.  Discussion on Different Marking Approaches

   In our analysis of ECN marking to address the needs of real-time
   flows like voice and video conferencing, we look at different marking
   schemes so that the ECN bit definition and meanings be closely
   aligned with what is defined in RFC 3168.  Below is one example worth
   noting that was considered but rejected even if it uses the same ECN
   semantics as what is defined in RFC 3168.

7.1.  Alternate RT-ECN marking

   During session setup (flow admission), end-system marks its' packets
   with ECT(0) ECN='10' and once the flow is admitted the end-system
   marks its' packets with ECT(1) ECN='01'.

   With the following metering and marking policy in router, packets
   that are marked as ECN-capable (ECN= 10, 11 or 01) are meter by both
   meters:

   o  If traffic exceeds 1st threshold level, mark ECN-capable ECT(0)
      '10' packets to indicate that congestion was experienced CE '11'.

   o  If traffic exceeds 2nd threshold level, mark ECN-capable ECT(1)
      '01'packets to indicate that congestion was experienced CE '11'.

   ECN Marking (identical to RFC 3168):

   Bits 6 and 7 values
        0     0    Not-ECT - End-system is Not ECN-capable
        0     1    ECT(1)  - End-system is ECT, once flow is admitted
        1     0    ECT(0)  - End-system is ECT, during flow admission
        1     1    CE      - Congestion Experienced

   Figure 6: Alternate ECN Semantics for Real-Time Flows

7.2.  Implication of this Marking

   During session setup (admission control) end-systems send their
   packets marked with ECT(0) '10' and once the flow is admitted, end-
   systems mark their packets with ECT(1) '01'.  Routers have a policy
   that meters all ECN-capable traffic, packets marked with ECT(0) are
   measured to the 1st threshold level and packets marked with ECT(1)
   are measured against the 2nd threshold level.  The receiving end-
   system must be informed (some how) if the packet is ECT(0) or ECT(1),

   during RTP-probing as well after, and there are methods to achieve
   this.

7.3.  Reason for Not Using this RT-ECN Marking

   The concern that the authors of this draft had with the use of the
   same ECN semantics for two different congestion control mechanism is
   that there is no simple method for detection of the wrong ECN
   behavior being applied by router in the path.  As stated in
   Specifying Alternate Semantics for the Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) Field [17] a method is needed for end-systems to
   verify that routers are applying the compliant marking for safe co-
   existence of alternate ECN behavior.  For the proposed ECN semantics
   (see Section 4.4.2), and Section 5 of this document defines a method
   that can be used to detect the presence of congested routers that use
   RFC 3168 for its ECN marking.  As well, we would like to note that
   the procedure outlined in RFC 3540 can be used to detect presence of
   congested routers that use RT-ECN marking.


8.  Example of ECN usage for Admission Control

   Normally real-time VoIP bearer traffic is marked with EF DSCP and is
   mapped into a DiffServ service class that produces very low latency,
   jitter and packet loss when the traffic load is within the specified
   parameters.  Currently there is no method defined that can limit
   (without dropping packets) the amount of traffic that can be
   aggregated onto a link.  As a result, controlling loads to within
   engineered limits is difficult.  To address this issue, we propose
   that for real-time flows we use the metering and ECN marking method
   defined in this document.

   Here we describe how ECN can be used in real-time VoIP solution to
   provide end-to-end admission of new media flows.  This is only a
   simple example of how admission control may be implemented using rate
   metering and ECN bit marking in the network.  Different applications
   may use modified approaches to verify if there is sufficient
   bandwidth before admitting a new flow.

   Let us assume that the network is configured to mark real-time VoIP
   payload packets with EF DSCP, and only this traffic is mapped into a
   DiffServ service class referred to as Telephony service class.
   Mapping of real-time traffic marked with other DSCP values is
   possible but to keep this example simple we will only talk about EF
   marked packets.

   For example, before a session (i.e., a call) is established between
   two clients, the two endpoints involved in the call will execute a



Babiarz, et al.          Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 28]


Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2005


   request/response transaction where the called party (Client B) sends
   a Request probe packet to the calling party (Client A) and the
   calling party correspondingly sends back a Response probe packet to
   the called party.  Probe packets are marked with EF DSCP and are
   mapped into the Telephony service class.

   A DiffServ style traffic conditioner, meter and ECN marker are used
   on selected nodes in the network along the path to measure the
   aggregated (real-time media and probe packets) flow rate of EF marked
   packets.  If the flow rate of the EF marked packets as measured by
   the meter is greater than rate "A", bit 7 in the ECN field of IP
   header is set to 1 and the packet is forwarded as usual.  The
   metering and marking of ECN bit only needs to be performed on
   selected nodes where bandwidth constraints exist and where congestion
   is likely to occur.

   Upon receipt of the Request probe packet, the calling party generates
   and sends a Response probe packet to the called party, echoing the
   status of the received ECN bits in the Response probe packet.  Again,
   a DiffServ style traffic conditioner, meter and ECN marker are used
   on selected nodes in the network along the reverse path to measure
   the aggregated flow rate of EF marked packets.  If the flow rate of
   EF marked packets as measured by the meter is greater than rate "A",
   bit 7 in ECN field of IP header is set to 1 and the packet is
   forwarded as usual.  On receipt of the Response probe packet, the
   called party could send a notification with the ECN Status to relay
   the ECN bit status results for the media path to a server in the
   network where call admission control is performed.  Based on the
   received congestion status (bandwidth usage) for that path, the
   admission control function will make a decision as to whether or not
   to continue with call setup and admit this new real-time flow.
   Should bandwidth usage parameters as indicated by ECN bit marking be
   exceeded, then this new real-time flow will not be admitted.


9.  Non-compliance

   Because of the unstable history of the TOS octet, the use of the ECN
   field as specified in this document cannot be guaranteed to be
   backwards compatible with any past uses of these two bits that pre-
   date ECN.  The potential dangers of this lack of backwards
   compatibility are discussed in RFC 3168 [7] Section 22.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses detection of congestion for real-time traffic
   flows and also describes a common policy configuration, for the use
   and application of ECN bit marking.  If implemented as described, it
   should require the network to do nothing that the network has not
   already allowed.  If that is the case, no new security issues should
   arise from the use of such a policy.

   It is possible for the policy to be applied incorrectly, or for a
   wrong policy to be applied in the network for the defined congestion
   detection point.  In that case, a policy issue exists that the
   network must detect, assess, and deal with.  This is a known security
   issue in any network dependent on policy-directed behavior.

   A well known flaw appears when bandwidth is reserved or enabled for a
   service (for example, voice transport) and another service or an
   attacking traffic stream uses it.  This possibility is inherent in
   DiffServ technology, which depends on appropriate packet markings.
   When bandwidth reservation or a priority queuing system is used in a
   vulnerable network, the use of authentication and flow admission is
   recommended.  To the author's knowledge, there is no known technical
   way to respond to or act upon a data stream that has been admitted
   for service but that it is not intended for authenticated use.

   Below is a description of a Single Rate Meters and ECN Marker.  For
   scenarios that require two traffic levels within a service class to
   be measured for congestion indication, two instances of the single
   rate meter can be used, one for configured rate "A" and the other for
   configured rate "B", with a single ECN marker.  The meter parameters
   should be selected to meet the characteristics and performance
   requirements of traffic being measured.

14.1.  Introduction

   The Single Rate Meters and ECN Marker is configured by assigning
   values to four parameters: Committed Information Rate (CIR), Token
   Bucket Size (TBS), ECN set threshold 'm' as a percentage of TBS and
   ECN clear threshold 'n' as a percentage of TBS.  The meter has an
   internal state "result flag" which when set indicates a condition
   where the measured traffic has exceeded the CIR and token in the
   token bucket where exhausted below 'm' threshold.  When the rate
   decreases below CIR, token bucket is filled above 'n' threshold and
   the internal "result flag" is cleared.

   The Meter meters each packet within the real-time service class and
   passes the packet and the metering result to the Marker:

                         +------------+
                         |   Result   |

   Figure 7: Block Diagram of Meter and Marker Function

   The Marker sets the ECN bit values for each packet within the real-
   time service class based on the results of the Meter.

14.2.  Meter Configuration

   The Single Rate Meter and ECN Marker is configured by assigning
   values to four traffic parameters: Committed Information Rate (CIR),
   Token Bucket Size (TBS), and values 'm' and 'n' representing
   percentage fullness of Token Bucket.  CIR is measured in bytes of IP
   packets per second, i.e., it includes the IP header, but not link
   specific headers TBS is measured in bytes, and represents the
   variants of the rate being measured. 'm' and 'n' are percentages that
   change size of TBS depending on the state of the result flag.
   Normally, variable rate traffic will need larger token bucket than

   constant rate traffic, and the size will depend on the
   characteristics of traffic being measured.  TBS should be configured
   such that traffic variation within the specified rate as measured at
   the node should not use up all the available tokens during a single
   measurement duration.

14.3.  Meter Behavior

   The behavior of the Meter is specified in terms of its Committed
   Information Rate (CIR), Token Bucket Size (TBS) and its ECN set and
   clear thresholds 'm' and 'n'.

   Initially (at time 0), token bucket (TBS) is full, i.e., the token
   count is represented by Tp.

      Where Tp(0) = TBS

      As well, the internal meter result flag (1st_result_flag) is
      cleared.

   When a packet of size B arrives at time t, the following happens:

   Tp = Tp(t) + (CIR x delta_t)     //tokens added at CIR
   Tp = Min (Tp(t), TBS)            //keep Tp from growing pass full
   Tp = Tp(t) - B                   //decrement Tp by B bytes
   Tp = Max (0,Tp(t))               //keep Tp from going negative
   if (1st_result_flag = = 0)       //internal result_flag not set?
       if (Tp < TBS x m)            //has traffic exceeded CIR?
           1st_result_flag = 1      //set internal result_flag
           Tp = 0                   //set token bucket to zero
   else                             //if internal result_flag is set
       if (Tp > TBS x n)            //is traffic below CIR?
           1st_result_flag = 0      //clear internal result_flag
           Tp = TBS                 //set Tp to TBS
   return

   Where m and n is 1-99%

   Notes:
   - delta_t is the elapsed time from the previous received packets.
   - m controls token bucket threshold for setting the result flag.
   - n controls token bucket threshold for clearing the result flag.

   A second instance of this single rate meter can be configured for
   measurement of rate "B" (the second rate).

   The actual implementation of a Meter doesn't need to be modeled
   according to the above formal specification.

14.4.  Marking

   The ECN Marker reflects the result flag setting received from the
   Meters.  If 1st_result_flag is set, all packets indicating that the
   end-system is ECN-capable, have their ECN bit 7 set to '1'.  If the
   2nd_result-flag is set, all packets indicating that the end-system is
   ECN-capable have their ECN bits 6 and 7 set to '01'.  The ECN Marker
   sets the ECN bit of ECN-capable marked packets as long as the result
   flag(s) from the meters is set.

14.5.  Summary of the Behavior

   When the measured rate is exceeded (token bucket runs out of tokens)
   the meter sets the "result flag" and passes it to the ECN Marker.
   The ECN Marker, sets the ECN bit(s) of all ECN-capable marked packets
   marked with a specific DS codepoint flowing through the interface
   being measured until the traffic rate is reduced below the measuring
   threshold; thereby the token bucket becomes full.  When the token
   bucket becomes full, the meter clears the "result flag".  The
   clearing of the result flag output from the meter, stops marking of
   ECN bit by the Marker.
