                  Information Distribution over GRASP
                 draft-liu-anima-grasp-distribution-01

Abstract

   This document discusses the requirement of information distribution
   capability in autonomic networks.  Ideally, the autonomic network
   should support distributing some information which is generated/
   injected at an arbitrary autonomic node and be distributed among the
   whole autonomic domain.  This docuemnt specifically proposes to
   achive this goal based on the GRASP (A Generic Autonomic Signaling
   Protocol), and specifies additional node behavior.

1.  Introduction

   In an autonomic network, sometimes the nodes need to share a set of
   common information.  One typical case is the Intent Distribution
   which is briefly discussed in Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model].  However, the distribution
   should be a general function that one autonomic node should support,
   rather than a specific mechanism dedicated for Intent.  This document
   firstly analyzes several basic information distribution scenarios
   (Section 2), and then discusses the technical requirements
   (Section 3) that one autonomic node needs to fulfill.

   This document proposes to achieve distribution function based on the
   GRASP (A Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol) [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]

   . GRASP already provides some capability to support part of the
   distribution function.  Along with that, this document also proposes
   some additional functionality.  Detailed design is described in
   Section 4.

2.  Information Distribution Scenarios

2.1.  Whole Domain Distribution

   Once the information is input to the autonomic network, the node that
   firstly handle the information MUST be able to distribute it to all
   the other nodes in the autonomic domain.

   The distributed information might not relevant to every autonomic
   node, but it is flooded to all the devices.

2.2.  Selective Distribution

   When one node receive the information, it only replicates it to the
   neighbors that fit for a certain of conditions.  This could reduce
   some unnecessary signaling amplification.

   However, this scenario implies there needs to be corresponding
   mechanisms to represent the conditions and to judge which neighbors
   fit for the conditions.  Please refer to Section 4.3.2 (selective
   flooding behavior).

2.3.  Incremental Distribution

   The distribution only goes to the nodes that newly get online.  This
   might mostly happen between neighbors.

   The incremental distribution could also be a sub scenario of the
   whole domain distribution.  When one node is doing the whole domain
   distribution, it is possible that some of its neighbors are sleeping/
   off-line, so when the neighbors get online again, the node should do
   incremental distribution of the previous whole domain distributed
   information.

3.  Distribution Requirements

3.1.  Identifying Autonomic Domain Boundary

   The domain boundary devices are supposed to know themselves as
   boundary.  When the distribution messages come to the devices, they
   do not distribute them outside the domain.

3.2.  Arbitrary Injecting Point

   The distributed information SHOULD be injected at any autonomic node
   within the domain (or within a specific set of nodes [TBD]).

3.3.  Avoiding Loops

   There should be a mechanism to prevent the distributed information to
   travel around the domain again and again, so that there would not be
   a large amount of redundant packets troubling the network.

3.4.  Selective Flooding

   When one node receive the information, it only floods it to the
   neighbors that fit for a certain of rules.

3.5.  Point-to-Point Distribution

   One node only distributes the information to another node.  This is
   for the incremental distribution scenario.

3.6.  Verification of Distributed Information

   o  Information integrity verification

         The receiving node SHOULD be able to verify whether the
         distributed information is from the certain node.  In other
         words, it needs to make sure the information hasn't been
         modified.

   o  Source authorization verification

         Even the information integrity was verified, the distributed
         information might still be invalid, since the distribution
         source might not have the right to distribute such information
         that it just exceeds its authority.

3.7.  Conflict Handling

   As long as it supports arbitrary point of injecting distribution,
   there is possibility that two nodes advertise the same information
   but with conflict attribute(s).  Hence, there should be a mechanism
   to handle the conflict.

4.  Distribution Function and Behavior Specification

   This section specifies using certain GRASP messages for distribution,
   and also specifies the distribution behavior in an autonomic node.

4.1.  Using GRASP Flood Synchronization Message

   It is natural to use the GRASP Flood Synchronization message for
   distribution, since the Flood Synchronization behavior specified in
   GRASP is identical to the the whole domain distribution scenario
   described in Section 2.1.  And the Flood Synchronization naturally
   fits for "Arbitrary Injection Point" and "Avoiding Loops"
   requirements.

4.2.  Using GRASP Synchronization Message

   It is natural to use the GRASP Synchronization message for Point-to-
   Point distribution.  The two behavior is identical.

4.3.  Selective Flooding

4.3.1.  Selecting Cretiria

   When doing selective flooding, the distributed information needs to
   contain the cretiria for nodes to judge which interfaces should be
   sent the distributed information and which are not.  Specifically,
   the indication information needs to include following attributes/
   meta-data:

   o  Matching condition: which represents the cretiria of the
      selection.

   o  Matching objective: the matching objective is either the node
      itself or the neighbors.

   o  Action: the action is eithor continueing the distribution or
      terminating it.

   Example:

   o  Matching condition: "Device role=IPRAN_RSG"

   o  Matching objective: "Neighbors"

   o  Action: "Distribute"

   This example means: only distributing the information to the
   neighbors who are IPRAN_RSG.

4.3.2.  Node Behavior

   1) The distribution initial node Includes the Selecting Cretiria as
   attributes/meta-data in the distributed information.

   2) The recieving node does the matching indicated by the Selecting
   Cretiria.

   2-1  When the Matching Objective is "Neighbors", then the node only
      distributes the information to the neighbors who match the
      Matching Condition.

   2-2  When the Matching Objective is "Self", if matched, the node
      terminates the distribution (not flooding it to any of the
      neighbor).

4.4.  Conflict Handling

   The distribution information needs to include timestamps or version
   information.  When conflict happens, the node only accepts the latest
   information.

4.5.  Distribution Source Authentication

   The distribution source authentication could be done at multiple
   layers:

   o  Outer layer authentication: the GRASP communication is within ACP
      (Autonomic Control Plane,
      [I-D.behringer-anima-autonomic-control-plane] ).  This is the
      default GRASP behavior.

   o  Inner layer authentication: the GRASP communication might not be
      within a protected channel, then there should be embedded
      protection in distribution information itself.  Public key
      infrastructure might be involved in this case.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA assignment is needed.
