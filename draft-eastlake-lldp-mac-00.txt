      MAC Address for Layer 3 Link Local Discovery Protocol (LLDP)
                    <draft-eastlake-lldp-mac-00.txt>


Abstract

   IEEE 802 has defined a number of protocols which operate between
   adjacent Ethernet stations at Layer 2, including bridges, such as the
   Link Layer Discover Protocol (IEEE 802.1AB, LLDP). LLDP and other
   such protocols may be useful between Layer 3 aware stations such as
   IP routers and hosts. This document specifies a MAC address that can
   be used for this purpose despite intervening bridges.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                       L3 LLDP MAC Address


1. Introduction

   IEEE 802 [IEEE802] has defined a number of protocols which operate
   between adjacent Ethernet stations at Layer 2, including bridges,
   such as the Link Layer Discover Protocol ([802.1AB] LLDP) and the
   Link Aggregation Control Protocol ([802.1AX] LACP). LLDP and other
   such protocols may be useful between adjacent Layer 3 [ISO] aware
   stations such as IP routers and hosts. This document specifies a MAC
   address that can be used for that purpose despite intervening
   bridges.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                       L3 LLDP MAC Address


2. Network Layers and MAC Addresses

   LLDP [802.1AB] is a Layer 2 [ISO] protocol providing for the
   unacknowledged announcement of information by an Ethernet station to
   other stations on the same Ethernet link.  There are proposals for
   the use of LLDP between L3 aware stations such as between a host and
   its first hop IP router or between IP adjacent routers. Examples are
   [LLDP1] [LLDP2] [LLDP3]. In addition, project [802.1ABdh] is underway
   in [IEEE802] that may extend the LLDP standard so that stations can
   announce a larger amount of information.

   As illustrated in the figure below, uses of LLDP and similar
   protocols between Ethernet stations have a scope of adjacency
   controlled by the multicast destination MAC address [RFC7042bis] of
   the Ethernet frame used to transmit the LLDP PDU.

    - Customer bridges use 0x0180C2000000 for LLDP and the like. Frames
      sent to that address are transparently forwarded through any lower
      level bridges, such as the provider bridges shown below. On the
      other hand, IP routers do not forward frames sent to unknown
      multicast addresses unless configured to do so. Thus, frames sent
      to this address by the customer bridge shown near the bottom of
      the figure will not reach either of the customer bridges shown
      higher up in the figure due to the intervening IP router.

    - Provider bridges use 0x0180C2000008 for LLDP. Frames sent to that
      address are transparently forwarded by lower level bridges (not
      shown in the figure) and are blocked by higher level bridges, such
      as customer bridges. They are also blocked as described in the
      previous point by IP routers.


   LLDP or similar Ethernet frames intended to be between adjacent IP
   routers or between a host and its first hop IP router need to avoid
   use of a destination MAC address that might be intercepted by any
   intervening bridge. The multicast destination MAC addresses used by
   bridges are the block from 0x0180C2000000 to 0x0180C200003F but it
   would be best to be conservative and avoid all addresses from
   0x0180C2000000 to 0x0180C2FFFFFF.  An address meeting this criterion
   is specified in Section 3 below and its use is RECOMMENDED.

   Note: The above figure is simplified. For example, where one or two
   customer bridges or provider bridges are shown, there could be zero
   or some larger number. There could also be one or more bridges
   between the host shown at the top of the figure and its first hop IP
   router. Only two levels of bridge are shown (customer and provider)
   but [802.1Q] specifies additional levels of bridges.

3. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a 48-bit multicast MAC address
   [0x00000E900004 suggested] under the IANA OUI for use with Link Layer
   Discovery Protocol and similar protocols between Layer 3 routers as
   per the request in Appendix A. The entry in the "IANA Multicast
   48-bit MAC Addresses" registry is as follows:

      Addresses   Usage                      Reference
      ---------  -------------------------  ---------------
       [tbd]     Layer 3 LLDP and the like  [this document]

   (Alternatively, there could be more than on MAC address assigned for
   different L3 or higher layer [ISO] purposes.)
