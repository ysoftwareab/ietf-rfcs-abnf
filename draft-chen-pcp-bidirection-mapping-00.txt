                   Didirectional Port Control for PCP
                 draft-chen-pcp-bidirection-mapping-00

Abstract

   The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which PCP
   could not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage port
   mapping status for communicating remote peers.  The bi-directional
   port control mode will eliminate risks of connections interruption
   caused by remote peer pinhole timeout.

1.  Introduction

   Pinhole Control Protocol (PCP)[PCP] has proposed a mechanism which
   allows PCP client controls port mapping lifetime on NAT/FW for
   internal hosts.  The explicit dynamic mappings give chances to
   incoming traffic are translated and forwarded to interanl hosts and
   also reduce keepalive signaling initiated by internal hosts.
   Currently, the controlled pinhole PCP targeted is exclusively to
   internal hosts. Remote peer port mapping still follows implicit
   dynamic mapping behaviors, including mapped address and timeout
   configuration.  In this case, some failures might be happened in
   scenarios where there are long-lived TCP connections established.

   This memo has analyzed several failure scenarios and proposed a bi-
   directional option, along with which PCP could not only control NAT
   pinhole for internal hosts, but also could manage port mapping status
   for communicating remote peers.  The bi-directional port control mode
   will eliminate risks of connections interruption caused by remote
   peer NAT mapping timeout.

   The document is structured as follows.  Section 2 analyzes several
   failure cases.  Section 3 elaborates the MAP_BIDIRECTION option
   format and processing.


2.  Failure Scenarios Analysis

   Always-Online services are quickly developed these days, e.g.
   instance message services.  Usually, these services has NAT-friendly
   mechanisms to keep long-lived TCP connection alive between the
   originators and remote peers.  But frequent keepalive signaling might
   occupy significant network resources and make others service quality
   degradation, especially in mobile network scenarios.  PCP is one way
   to optimize these keepalive applications.  However, there are several
   failure cases might occur due to remote peers mapping expiration on
   the NAT/FW.

   There are three defined uses for the PCP OpCodes operation: a host
   operating a client, a host operating a server waiting an incoming
   connection and a host operating a client and server on the same port.

   When a host operating a client send PCP request to build a pinhole on
   NAT/FW, PCP server will hold mapping for required duration after
   successful processing.  Let't assume the lifetime is T1.  Afterwards,
   the host will initiate TCP communication with a remote peer.  The
   remote peer will reply TCP SYN/ACK message to the internal host for TCP
   handshake.  Meanwhile, NAT generates implicit dynamic mapping for the
   remote peer.  Let't assume the lifetime is T2.  Normally, T1 and T2

   is not identical. For reducing keepalive signaling, T1 is likely
   longer than T2.After TCP session is established, such remote peer NAT
   mapping will be expired when there is no traffic occurring in
   interval of T2.  In this case, TCP session will be broken even if the
   mapping for internal host is still alive.

   For the host acting as server, same problems will occur.  An internal
   host operating a server (e.g., a web server) listens for traffic on a
   specific port.  PCP will reserve mapping information on NAT for
   required duration.  Remote peers connect internal host through such
   pinhole and create mapping on the NAT for their-self.  These remote
   peers also SHOULD periodically produce keepalive for maintaining
   states with such middlebox.  Otherwise, expiration of remote peer will
   cause session interruption. For now, there is nothing to do with PCP
   to optimize such keepalive.  Worse than that, such keepalive message
   is normally designed for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGN).  In residential
   NATs case, it might be lack of such keepalive mechanism which leads
   to problematic in residential service scenarios.


3.  PCP Bidirectional Port Control

3.1.  Bidirectional Port Control Overview

   In order to fulfill long-lived TCP connection requirements,
   bidirectional port control option is proposed.  It means PCP will
   control mapping information for both internal hosts and remote peers.
   Depending on that, applications could safely remove sending keepalive
   signaling.

3.2.  MAP_BIDIRECTION Options

   The MAP_BIDIRECTION Option indicates both internal and remote hosts
   mapping control is desired.  The remote peer port and remote peer IP
   address indicate the desired destination IP address and port
   with which internal host has long-lived TCP connection.  The remote
   peer prefix length indicates the length of the remote peer's IP
   address.  This allows a single option to take effect on an entire
   subnet.  After processing this PCP request carrying such
   MAP_BIDIRECTION and generating a successful response, the PCP-
   controlled device will create or manage remote peer's mapping with a
   specific IP address, transport, and port that match these fields.

   The MAP_BIDIRECTION packet layout is described below:

   These fields are described below:

   Reserved: 8 reserved bits, MUST be sent as 0 and MUST be ignored when
   received.

   Prefix-length: indicates how many bits of the IPv4 or IPv6 address
   are relevant for bi-directional mapping.  The value 0 indicates "no
   bi-directional control", and will remove all previous activities.
   See below for detail.

   Remote Peer Port: the port number of the remote peer.  The value 0
   indicates "all ports" related to listed remote peer IP address.

   Remote Peer IP address: The IP address of the remote peer.  The value
   0 indicates "all remote peer address" related to internal host.

   This Option:

   name: MAP_BIDIRECTION

   number: 8

   is valid for OpCodes: MAP4, MAP6, PEER4, PEER6

   is included in responses: MUST, if it appeared in the request

   length: 0

   may appear in: requests

   maximum occurrences: as many as fit within maximum PCP message size

3.3.  MAP_BIDIRECTION Processing

   This Option could be used by a PCP client that is operating a
   application server or client.  The MAP_BIDIRECTION allows PCP client
   to create, manage and delete remote peer mapping information on NAT.

   When this option has been carried with MAP opcode, that means PCP
   client would like to ask PCP server to create the pinhole for remote
   peer hosts.  After PCP server finish successful processing, PCP-
   controlled NAT device will generate mapping information which matches
   remote peer address, port and protocol.  To be specific, the remote
   peer mapping information will be created according to MAP_BIDIRECTION
   fields indications.  When prefix-length is a specific value, which is
   32 or 128, an specific remote peer mapping could be created.  This is
   NOT RECOMMENDED to set prefix-length to a value, which is among 1 to
   32 or 128.  In another words, the PCP server can't to be asked to 
   create pinhole for an entire subnet.

   When this option has been carried with PEER opcode, that means PCP
   client would like to ask PCP server to prolong the pinhole lifetime
   for remote peer hosts.  After PCP server finish successful
   processing, PCP-controlled NAT device will set mapping information
   lifetime to desired values both for internal hosts and remote hosts.
   To be specific, the remote peer mapping information will be prolong
   according to MAP_BIDIRECTION fields indications.  When prefix-length
   is a specific value, which is 32 or 128, a specific remote peer
   mapping could be managed.  When prefix-length is a specific values,
   which is among 1 to 32 or 128, an entire subnet mapping can be
   impacted .  When remote peer IP address is set to 0, all remote peer
   address mapping related to internal host could be prolonged.

   When PCP server isn't capable of processing MAP_BIDIRECTION option,
   UNABLE_TO_CONTROL_BIDIRECTION failure code should be returned.
