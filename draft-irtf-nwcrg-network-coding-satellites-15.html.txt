1.  Introduction

   This document is one product of and represents the collaborative work
   and consensus of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
   Research Group (NWCRG); while it is not an IETF product and not a
   standard it intends to inform the SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM)
   and Internet research communities about recent developments in
   Network Coding.  A glossary is included in Section 6 to clarify the
   terminology use throughout the document.

   As will be shown in this document, the implementation of network
   coding techniques above the network layer, at application or
   transport layers (as described in [RFC1122]), offers an opportunity
   for improving the end-to-end performance of SATCOM systems.  While
   physical- and link-layer coding error protection is usually enough to

   provide Quasi-Error Free transmission thus minimizing packet loss,
   when residual errors at those layers cause packet losses,
   retransmissions add significant delays (in particular in
   geostationary systems with over 0.7 second round-trip delays).  Hence
   the use of network coding at the upper layers can improve the quality
   of service in SATCOM subnetworks and eventually favorably impact the
   experience of end users.

   While there is an active research community working on network coding
   techniques above the network layer in general and in SATCOM in
   particular, not much of this work has been deployed in commercial
   systems.  In this context, this document identifies opportunities for
   further usage of network coding in commercial SATCOM networks.

   The notation used in this document is based on the NWCRG taxonomy
   [RFC8406]:

   o  Channel and link error correcting codes are considered part of the
      PHYsical (PHY) layer error protection and are out of the scope of
      this document.

   o  Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) (also called Application-Level
      FEC) operates above the link layer and targets packet loss
      recovery.

   o  This document considers only coding (or coding techniques or
      coding schemes) that use a linear combination of packets and
      excludes for example content coding (e.g., to compress a video
      flow) or other non-linear operation.

2.  A Note on Satellite Networks Topology

   There are multiple SATCOM systems, for example broadcast TV, point to
   point communication or IoT monitoring.  Therefore, depending on the
   purpose of the system, the associated ground segment architecture
   will be different.  This section focuses on a satellite system that
   follows the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
   Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standards to provide broadband
   Internet access via ground-based gateways [ETSIEN2014].  One must
   note that the overall data capacity of one satellite may be higher
   than the capacity that one single gateway supports.  Hence, there are
   usually multiple gateways for one unique satellite platform.

   In this context, Figure 1 shows an example of a multi-gateway
   satellite system, where BBFRAME stands for Base-Band FRAME, PLFRAME
   for Physical Layer FRAME and PEP for Performance Enhancing Proxy.
   More information on a generic SATCOM ground segment architecture for
   bidirectional Internet access can be found in [SAT2017].

3.  Use-cases for Improving SATCOM System Performance Using Network
    Coding

   This section details use-cases where network coding techniques could
   improve SATCOM system performance.

3.1.  Two-way Relay Channel Mode

   This use-case considers two-way communication between end-users,
   through a satellite link as seen in Figure 2.

   Satellite terminal A sends a packet flow A and satellite terminal B
   sends a packet flow B to a coding server.  The coding server then
   sends a combination of both flows instead of each individual flows.
   This results in non-negligible capacity savings that has been
   demonstrated in the past [ASMS2010].  In the example, a dedicated
   coding server is introduced (note that its location could be
   different based on deployment use-case).  The network coding
   operations could also be done at the satellite level, although this
   would require a lot of computational resources on-board and may not
   be supported by today's satellites.

   ={X+Y= : traffic from X and Y combined sent from
               the server to terminals X and Y

3.2.  Reliable Multicast

   The use of multicast servers is one way to better utilize satellite
   broadcast capabilities.  As one example satellite-based multicast is
   proposed in the SHINE ESA project
   [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization] [SHINE].  This
   use-case considers adding redundancy to a multicast flow depending on
   what has been received by different end-users, resulting in non-

   negligible savings of the scarce SATCOM resources.  This scenario is
   shown in Figure 3.

   |Terminal B |-Lj}-+ |     |
   +-----------+       +-----+

     Figure 3: Network Architecture for a Reliable Multicast using NC

   A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and
   B.  However packet Ni (respectively Nj) gets lost at terminal A
   (respectively B), and terminal A (respectively B) returns a negative
   acknowledgment Li (respectively Lj), indicating that the packet is
   missing.  Using coding, either the access gateway or the multicast
   server can include a repair packet (rather than the individual Ni and
   Nj packets) in the multicast flow to let both terminals recover from
   losses.

   This could also be achieved by using other multicast or broadcast
   systems, such as NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) [RFC5740] or
   File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) [RFC6726].  Both
   NORM and FLUTE are limited to block coding; neither of them support
   more flexible sliding window encoding schemes that allow decoding
   before receiving the whole block an added delay benefit
   [RFC8406][RFC8681].

3.3.  Hybrid Access

   This use-case considers improving multiple path communications with
   network coding at the transport layer (see Figure 4, where DSL stands
   for Digital Subscriber Line, LTE for Long Term Evolution and SAT for
   SATellite).  This use-case is inspired by the Broadband Access via
   Integrated Terrestrial Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has been
   published as an ETSI Technical Report [ETSITR2017].

   To cope with packet loss (due to either end-user mobility or
   physical-layer residual errors), network coding can be introduced.

Internet-Draft    Network coding for satellite systems      October 2020


   Depending on the protocol, network coding could be applied at each of
   the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and at the concentrator or
   both.  Apart from packet losses, other gains from this approach
   include a better tolerance to out-of-order packet delivery which
   occur when exploited links exhibit high asymmetry in terms of Round-
   Trip Time (RTT).  Depending on the ground architecture
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang] [SAT2017], some ground
   equipment might be hosting both SATCOM and cellular network
   functionality.

3.4.  LAN Packet Losses

   This use-case considers using network coding in the scenario where a
   lossy WIFI link is used to connect to the SATCOM network.  When
   encrypted end-to-end applications based on UDP are used, a
   Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP) cannot operate hence other
   mechanism need to be used.  The WIFI packet losses will result in an
   end-to-end retransmission that will harm the end-user quality of
   experience and poorly utilize SATCOM bottleneck resource for non-
   revenue generating traffic.  In this use-case, adding network coding
   techniques will prevent the end-to-end retransmission from occurring
   since the packet losses would probably be recovered.

   The architecture is shown in Figure 5.

3.5.  Varying Channel Conditions

   This use-case considers the usage of network coding to cope with sub
   second physical channel condition changes where the physical-layer
   mechanisms (Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM)) may not adapt the
   modulation and error-correction coding in time: the residual errors
   lead to higher layer packet losses that can be recovered with network
   coding.  This use-case is mostly relevant when mobile users are
   considered or when the satellite frequency band introduces quick
   changes in channel condition (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.).  Depending
   on the use-case (e.g., very high frequency bands, mobile users), the
   relevance of adding network coding is different.

   The system architecture is shown in Figure 6.

3.6.  Improving Gateway Handover

   This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost
   during gateway handover.  Whether for off-loading a given equipment
   or because the transmission quality differs from gateway to gateway,
   switching the transmission gateway may be beneficial.  However,
   packet losses can occur if the gateways are not properly synchronized
   or if the algorithm used to trigger gateway handover is not properly
   tuned.  During these critical phases, network coding can be added to

4.  Research Challenges

   This section proposes a few potential approaches to introduce and use
   network coding in SATCOM systems.

4.1.  Joint-use of Network Coding and Congestion Control in SATCOM
      Systems

   Many SATCOM systems typically use Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP)
   RFC 3135 [RFC3135].  PEPs usually split end-to-end connections and
   forward transport or application layer packets to the satellite
   baseband gateway.  PEPs contribute to mitigate congestion in a SATCOM
   systems by limiting the impact of long delays on Internet protocols.
   A PEP mechanism could also include network coding operation and thus
   support the use-cases that have been discussed in the Section 3 of
   this document.

   Deploying network coding in the PEP could be relevant and be
   independent from the specifics of a SATCOM link.  This however leads
   to research questions dealing with the potential interaction between

Internet-Draft    Network coding for satellite systems      October 2020


   network coding and congestion control.  This is discussed in
   [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-coding-and-congestion].

4.2.  Efficient Use of Satellite Resources

   There is a recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems: how much overhead
   from redundant reliability packets can be introduced to guarantee a
   better end-user QoE while optimizing capacity usage?  At which layer
   this supplementary redundancy should be added?

   This problem has been tackled in the past by the deployment of
   physical-layer error-correction codes, but there remains questions on
   adapting the coding overhead and added delay for, e.g., the quickly
   varying channel conditions use-case where ACM may not be reacting
   quickly enough as was discussed in Section 3.5.  The higher layer
   with network coding does not react more quickly than the physical
   layer, but may operate over a packet-based time window that is larger
   than the physical one.

4.3.  Interaction with Virtualized Satellite Gateways and Terminals

   In the emerging virtualized network infrastructure, network coding
   could be easily deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNF).  The
   next generation of SATCOM ground segments will rely on a virtualized
   environment to integrate to terrestrial networks.  This trend towards
   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is also central to 5G and next
   generation cellular networks, making this research applicable to
   other deployment scenarios
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang].  As one example, the
   network coding VNF deployment in a virtualized environment has been
   presented in [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization].

   A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service
   function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other
   SATCOM specific functions, in order to guarantee efficient radio-link
   usage and provide easy-to-deploy SATCOM services.  Moreover, another
   challenge related to a virtualized SATCOM equipment is the management
   of limited buffered capacities in large gateways.

4.4.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN)

   Communications among deep-space platforms and terrestrial gateways
   can be a challenge.  Reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over
   such paths must cope with very long delays and frequent link
   disruptions; indeed, E2E connectivity may only be available
   intermittently, if at all.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking
   (DTN) [RFC4838] is a solution to enable reliable internetworking
   space communications where both standard ad-hoc routing and E2E

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Internet-Draft    Network coding for satellite systems      October 2020


   Internet protocols cannot be used.  Moreover, DTN can also be seen as
   an alternative solution to transfer data between a central PEP and a
   remote PEP.

   Network Coding enables E2E reliable communications over a DTN with
   potential adaptive re-encoding, as proposed in [THAI15].  Here, the
   use-cases proposed in Section 3.5 would encourage the usage of
   network coding within the DTN stack to improve the physical channel
   utilization and minimize the effects of the E2E transmission delays.
   In this context, the use of packet erasure coding techniques inside a
   Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) architecture
   has been specified in [CCSDS-131.5-O-1].  One research challenge
   remains on how such network coding can be integrated in the IETF DTN
   stack.

5.  Conclusion

   This document introduces some wide-scale network coding technique
   opportunities in satellite telecommunications systems.

   Even though this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
   pointing out that some scenarios proposed here may be relevant to
   other wireless telecommunication systems.  As one example, the
   generic architecture proposed in Figure 1 may be mapped onto cellular
   networks as follows: the 'network function' block gathers some of the
   functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access
   gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of
   functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network.
   This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this document
   since they may also be relevant for cellular networks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are inherent to any access network, and in
   particular SATCOM systems.  Such as it is done in cellular networks,
   over-the-air data can be encrypted using e.g.  [ETSITS2011].  Because
   the operator may not enable this [SSP-2020], the applications should
   apply cryptographic protection.  The use of FEC or Network Coding in
   SATCOM comes with risks (e.g., a single corrupted redundant packet
   may propagate to several flows when they are protected together in an
   Inter-Flow coding approach, see section Section 3).  While this
   document does not further elaborate on this, the security
   considerations discussed in [RFC6363] apply.
