    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance for MPLS-SR over IP
                  draft-mirsky-mpls-oam-mpls-sr-ip-01

Abstract

   Segment routing uses source routing paradigm to traffic engineering
   by specifying segments a packet traverses through the network.  MPLS
   Segment Routing applies that paradigm to an MPLS data plane-based
   networks.  SR-MPLS over IP uses MPLS label stack as a source routing
   instruction set and uses IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in-
   UDP as defined in RFC 7510 to realize a source routing mechanism
   across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes.  This document describes
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance operations in SR-MPLS
   over IP environment.

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing [RFC8402] uses source routing paradigm to traffic
   engineering by specifying segments a packet traverses through the
   network.  MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS)
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] applies that paradigm to an
   MPLS data plane-based networks.  SR-MPLS over IP uses MPLS label
   stack as a source routing instruction set and uses IP encapsulation/
   tunneling such as MPLS-in- UDP as defined in [RFC7510] to realize a
   source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes.
   This document describes Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) operations in SR-MPLS over IP environment.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  OAM in SR-MPLS over IP

   OAM operations support Fault Management and Performance Monitoring
   components of FCAPS framework for network management.  To achieve its
   objectives, Fault Management OAM includes proactive and on-demand
   protocols to provide constant monitoring of the network to detect the
   failure in combination with on-demand tools to efficiently localize
   and characterize the defect.  Performance Monitoring OAM protocols
   support measurement of packet loss and packet delay that enables
   calculation of performance metrics, e.g., packet loss ration, inter-
   packet delay variation, that are useful in monitoring the quality of
   service in the network, detect and quantify the service degradation.

3.1.  Fault Management OAM in SR-MPLS over IP

   Fault management OAM toolset includes protocols to perform on-demand
   failure detection and localization as well as proactively monitor
   path continuity.  An example of the former is echo request/reply,
   e.g., Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping [RFC8029].  An example of the
   latter - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) over MPLS LSP
   [RFC5884].  For SR-MPLS environment applicability and use of these
   OAM tools defined in [RFC8287] and [I-D.mirsky-spring-bfd]
   respectively.  Both LSP Ping and BFD can be used either with IP/UDP
   encapsulation or in Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) [RFC5586].
   The use of IP/UDP encapsulation is well-understood and has been
   defined in [RFC8029]:

      The IP header is set as follows: the source IP address is a
      routable address of the sender; the destination IP address is a
      (randomly chosen) IPv4 address from the range 127/8 or an IPv6

      address from the range 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00:0/104.  The IP TTL is
      set to 1.  The source UDP port is chosen by the sender.

   Using the sender's routable address enables the receiver to send an
   echo reply or BFD control packets over the IP network.  In some
   environments, the overhead of extra IP/UDP encapsulations may be
   considered as overburden and make to use more compact G-ACh
   encapsulation instead.  In such a case, the OAM control packet MUST
   be immediately followed by the IP Address TLV
   [I-D.mirsky-mpls-p2mp-bfd] with its Value field containing one of the
   routable IP addresses of the sender.

3.2.  Performance Monitoring OAM in SR-MPLS over IP

   Performance monitoring in SR-MPLS over IP may be performed using
   mechanisms defined in [RFC6374].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security aspects but inherits
   all security considerations from [RFC8287], [RFC8029], [RFC5884],
   [I-D.mirsky-spring-bfd].
