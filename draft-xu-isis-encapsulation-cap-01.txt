            Advertising Encapsulation Capability Using IS-IS
                   draft-xu-isis-encapsulation-cap-01

Abstract

   In a particular network environment where MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers
   are partially deployed, it needs to transport MPLS traffic through an
   IP-based tunnel between two MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers so as to
   traverse non-MPLS routers.  The ingress of the IP-based tunnel must
   know which encapsulation type is supported by the egress of that IP-
   based tunnel.This document describes how to advertise the
   encapsulation capability of MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers using IS-IS.
   Note that this encapsulation capablity advertisment could be
   applicalbe to other use cases besides that as mentioned above as
   well.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.xu-spring-islands-connection-over-ip] describes a particular
   network environment where MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers are partially
   deployed and therefore it needs to transport MPLS traffic through an
   IP-based tunnel between two MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers so as to
   traverse non-MPLS routers.  The ingress of the IP-based tunnel (i.e.,
   tunnel encapsulator) must know which encapsulation type is supported
   by the egress of the IP-based tunnel (i.e., tunnel decapsulator).This
   document describes how to advertise the encapsulation capability of
   MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers using IS-IS.  Note that this
   encapsulation capablity advertisment could be applicalbe to other use
   cases besides that as mentioned above as well.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971] and
   [I-D.xu-spring-islands-connection-over-ip].

3.  Advertising Encapsulation Capability

   MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers need to advertise the encapsulation
   type(s) they support by using a new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router
   CAPABILITY TLV [RFC4971], referred to as Encapsulation Capability
   sub-TLV.  The Encapsulation Capability sub-TLV could not appear more
   than once wihin a given IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV.  The scope of
   the advertisement depends on the application but it is recommended
   that it SHOULD be domain-wide.  The Type code of the Encapsualtion
   Cability sub-TLV is TBD, the Length value is vairalbe, and the Value
   field contains one or more Encapsulation Type sub-TLVs with each
   indicating a particular encapsulation format that the advertising
   router supports.

   This document defines the following types of Encapsulation Type sub-
   TLV:

   1.  MPLS-in-IP tunnel [RFC4023] : Type code=TBD1; Length=0

   2.  MPLS-in-GRE tunnel [RFC4023]: Type code=TBD2; Length=0

   3.  MPLS-in-L2TPv3 tunnel [RFC4817]: Type code=TBD3; Length=0

   4.  MPLS-in-UDP tunnel [I-D.ietf-mpls-in-udp]: Type code=TBD4;
       Length=0

   5.  MPLS-in-IP tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode [RFC5566]: Type
       code=TBD5; Length=0

4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Carlos Pignataro for his valuable
   comments on this draft.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA for allocating the type codes
   for Encapsulation Capability sub-TLV and Encapsulation Type sub-TLVs.
