1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS to handle multiple switching
   technologies.  For example: packet switching(PSC), Layer-2 switching
   (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplexing switching(TDM) , wavelength
   switching(LSC), and fiber switching(FSC) (see [RFC3945]).  GMPLS is
   not designed for a particular layer network design, so it can be
   unified management of the network with multiple switching capability.

   A MRN/MLN is defined as a TE domain supporting at least two different
   switching types (e.g.,TDM and LSC), and under the control of a single
   GMPLS control plane instance.In MRN TE links are consolidated into a
   single Traffic Engineering Database (TED).  Since this TED contains
   the information relative to all the different regions and layers
   existing in the network, a path across multiple regions or layers can
   be computed using this TED.  Thus, optimization of network resources
   can be achieved across the whole MLN/MRN.

   Path computation in large, multi-domain networks is complex and may
   require special computational components and cooperation between the
   elements in different domains.  IETF PCE group specifies the
   architecture for a Path Computation Element PCE)-based model to
   address this problem space.  A Path Computation Element (PCE) is an
   entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on
   a network graph, and of applying computational constraints during the
   computation.

   In [draft-ietf-pce-inter-layer-frwk-10] two models are defined to
   perform PCE-based inter-layer path computation, mainly including:

   o  Single PCE Inter-Layer Path Computation

   In this model inter-layer path computation is performed by a single
   PCE that has topology visibility to all layers.

   o  Multiple PCE Inter-Layer Path Computation

   In this model there is at least one PCE per layer, and each PCE has
   topology visibility restricted to its own layer

   A set of one or more lower-layer LSPs provides information for
   efficient path handling in higher layer(s) of the MLN, in other
   words, provides a virtual network topology (VNT) to the higher
   layers.A VNT Manager (VNTM) is defined as a functional element that
   manages and controls the VNT.  PCE and VNT Manager are distinct
   functional elements that may or may not be co-located.There are three
   Inter-Layer Path Control Models:

   o  PCE-VNTM Cooperation Model

   o  Higher-Layer Signaling Trigger Model

   o  NMS-VNTM Cooperation Model

   A MRN/MLN is a traffic engineering domain, so TE topology for all
   layer networks is visible within this routing
   domain.[draft-ietf-pce-inter-layer-frwk-10] suggest that the single
   PCE inter-layer path computation model may be adopted because a PCE
   is able to collect all layers' TE topologies by participating in only
   one routing domain.  However, in the above scenario, if Higher-Layer
   Signaling Trigger Model is used to establish FA-LSP there are some
   flaws.


2.  Description of Question

   In Single PCE Inter-Layer Path Computation model, the PCE know the TE
   information of all the layers, so PCE can calculate a complete
   path,which include the higher path and the lower path.

   In [RFC4606], the information carried in the Interface Switching
   Capabilities is used to construct LSP regions and to determine
   regions' boundaries as follows:

   o  Define an ordering among interface switching capabilities as
      follows: PSC-1 < PSC-2 < PSC-3 < PSC-4 < TDM < LSC < FSC.  Given
      two interfaces if-1 and if-2 with interface switching capabilities
      isc-1 and isc-2 respectively, say that if-1 < if-2 iff isc-1 <
      isc-2 or isc-1 == isc-2, and if-1's max LSP bandwidth is less than
      if-2's max LSP bandwidth.

   For a LSP, if two adjacent interfaces if-(i-1) < if-i, then we say
   the LSP has crossed a region boundary at the node where if-(i-1)
   locate.This node is the source node of lower FA-LSP.  If two adjacent
   interfaces if-(k-1)> if-k, then the node where if-k locate is the
   destination node of the lower FA-LSP.

   In Section 6.2 further shows that when RSVP-TE is as a signaling
   protocol, how to establish the FA-LSP automatically, briefly
   described as follows:

   o  when a region boundary node receives a Path message, the node
      determines whether or not it is at the edge of an LSP region with
      respect to the ERO carried in the message.  If the node is at the
      edge of a region, it must then determine the other edge of the
      region with respect to the ERO,using the IGP database.  The node



Lin, et al.              Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         PCE Ext for multilayer-lsp           October 2009


      then extracts from the ERO the sub-sequence of hops from itself to
      the other end of the region.

   o  Then the LSR establish a new FA-LSP, and this FA-LSP is as a
      higher FA.

   However, in Single PCE Inter-Layer Path Computation model, the above
   method has some defects:

   o  Because TED is centralized management, each node may not have the
      IGP database, it PCE needs to determine the region boundary.

   o  When there are multi-nested FA-LSP exists, PCE already know the
      region boundary nodes ,so it is not necessary to use IGP database
      to determine the region boundary.

   In a word, in Single PCE Inter-Layer Path Computation model, using
   signaling explicitly specify the FA-LSP can simplify the process of
   FA-LSP esstablishment.


3.  Solution

   When PCE computes the route,it can determine the regions' boundaries
   and the initiator and the terminator of the FA-LSP via the
   description in [RFC4206] section 5.1.

3.1.  Explicit Control of FA-LSP

   In[RFC4873],the Secondary Explicit Route objects( SEROs) is used to
   indicate the protected path of the LSP!_s segment recovery.  When
   service path includes one layer or multilayer FA-LSP, FA-LSP!_s
   Explicit routes are specified via the Secondary Explicit Route
   objects.

   When the Higher-Layer node creates a service,it sends a route request
   to PCE,in the response message of the route request from PCE, the
   whole LSP!_s routes are specified.The Higher-Layer path's Explicit
   routes are specified via the ERO.The FA-LSP!_s Explicit routes are
   specified via the SEROs.

   Consider the following topology:


                                PCE

                        H1---H2       H5---H6
                              \       /

Internet-Draft         PCE Ext for multilayer-lsp           October 2009


                               L3---L4


   In this topology, H1,H2,H5,H6 are the network nodes of Higher-Layer,
   while H2,L3,L4,H5 are the network nodes of low layer.  And, H2 and H5
   are the region boundaries.

   The process of creating a LSP from H1 to H6 is as the following:

   o  H1 sends a route request to PCE,which responses a message with the
      Higher-Layer path's explicit route specified via the ERO and the
      FA-LSP's explicit routes specified via the subsequent
      SEROs.Explicit routes are encoded as follows:ERO = {H1,H2, H5,
      H6}, SERO = {H2,L3,L4,H5}.

   o  H1 Sends Path message to the downstream node H2 with ERO =
      {H2,H5,H6} and SERO = {H2,L3,L4,H5}.

   o  After H2 receivs the Path message from H1,H2 confirm that it is
      the initiator of FA-LSP via the SERO,and extracts the complete
      route of the FA-LSP.

   o  Then H2 starts the creation of FA-LSP , the route is H2,L3,L4,H5.

   o  After the creation of the FA-LSPGBP[not]the Higher-Layer LSP!_s
      creation is to be continued.  And the SERO in the Path message is
      deleted..

3.2.  Process of multiple FA-LSPs in multiple layers

   Consider the following topology:


                                PCE

                    H1---H2             H7---H8
                           \            /
                            M3       M6
                              \       /
                               L4---L5


   In this topology, from top to down, the network is divided into three
   layers.

   Then H1,H2,H7,H8 belong to the first layer.  H2,M3,M6,H7 are the
   nodes of the second layer, while M3,L4,L5,M6 belong to the third
   layer.  And, H2 and H7 are regions boundaries between the first layer

   and the second layer.  M3 and M6 are region boundaries between the
   second layer and the third layer.

   The process of creating a LSP from H1 to H8 is as the following :

   o  H1 sends a route request to PCE, in the response message of route
      request from PCE, the first-layer path's Explicit routes are
      specified via the ERO.  The first FA-LSP!_s Explicit routes are
      specified via the first SERO.  The second FA-LSP!_s Explicit
      routes are specified via the SERO.  Encoded as follows:ERO =
      {H1,H2,H7,H8},SERO = {H2,M3,M6,H7},SERO={M3,L4,L5,M6}.

   o  H1 sends Path message to the downstream node H2,with ERO = {H2,H7,
      H8}, SERO = {H2,M3,M6,H7},SERO={M3,L4,L5,M6}.

   o  After H2 receives the Path message from H1,H2 confirms that it is
      the initiator of the second layer!_s FA-LSP via the first SERO,and
      extracts the route of the second layer!_s FA-LSP.  Then H2 starts
      the creation of the first FA-LSP, the route is H2,M3,M6,H7.  H2
      sends a new Path message to M3 with ERO =
      {M3,M6,H7},SERO={M3,L4,L5,M6}.

   o  After M3 receives the Path message from H2,M3 confirms that it is
      the initiator of the third layer!_s FA-LSP via the second SERO.and
      extracts the complete route of the third layer!_s FA-LSP.  Then M3
      starts the creation of the second FA-LSP, the route is
      M3,L4,L5,M6.M3 sends another new Path message to L4 with
      ERO={L4,L5,M6}.

   o  After the creation of the third layer!_s FA-LSP,the second layer
      FA-LSP!_s creation is to be continued.And the second SERO in the
      second Path message is deleted.

   o  After the creation of the second layer!_s FA-LSP,the first layer
      LSP!_s creation is to be continued.And the first SERO in the first
      Path message is deleted.

3.3.  Process of multiple FA-LSPs in the same layer

   Consider the following topology:


         Consider the following topology:
                                          PCE

                           H1---H2       H5---H6       H9---H10
                                 \       /      \       /
                                  L3---L4       L7---- L8

   In this topology, the network is divided into two
   layers.H1,H2,H5,H6,H9,H10 are the nodes of the first
   layer.H2,L3,L4,H5,H6,L7,L8,H9 belong to the second layer,and H2,H5,H6
   and H9 are regions' boundaries.

   Creat a LSP from H1 to H10,the process is as the following:

   o  H1 sends a route request to PCE,in the response message of route
      request from PCE, the first layer path Explicit routes are
      specified via the ERO.  The first FA-LSP!_s Explicit routes are
      specified via the first SERO.  The second FA-LSP!_s Explicit
      routes are specified via the SERO.  Encoded as follows: ERO =
      {H1,H2,H5,H6,H9,H10}, SERO ={H2,L3,L4,H5},SERO={H6,L7,L8,H9}.

   o  H1 Sends Path message to the downstream node H2,with ERO = {H2,
      H5, H6,H9,H10}, SERO = {H2,L3,L4,H5},SERO={H6,L7,L8,H9}

   o  After H2 receives the Path message from H1,H2 confirms that it is
      the initiator of the second layer!_s first FA-LSP via the first
      SERO,and extracts the route of the second layer!_s first FA-LSP.
      Then H2 starts the creation of the first FA-LSP, the route is
      H2,L3,L4,H5.  H2 sends a new Path message to L3 with ERO =
      {L3,L4,H5}.

   o  After the creation of the second layer!_s first FA-LSP,the first-
      layer LSP!_s creation is to be continued.And the first SERO in the
      Path message is deleted.

   o  After H6 receive the Path Message from H5,H6 confirm it is the
      initiator of the second layer!_s second FA-LSP via the second SERO
      and extracts the complete route of the second layer!_s second FA-
      LSP.  Then H6 starts the creation of the second FA-LSP, the route
      is H6,L7,L8,H9.

   o  After the creation of the second FA-LSP,the first-layer LSP!_s
      creation is to be continued.And the second SERO in the Path
      message is deleted.
