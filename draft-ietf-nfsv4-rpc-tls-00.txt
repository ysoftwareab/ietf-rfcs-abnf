Internet-Draft                RPC-Over-TLS                    March 2019


1.  Introduction

   In 2014 the IETF published [RFC7258] which recognized that
   unauthorized observation of network traffic had become widespread and
   was a subversive threat to all who make use of the Internet at large.
   It strongly recommended that newly defined Internet protocols make a
   real effort to mitigate monitoring attacks.  Typically this
   mitigation is done by encrypting data in transit.

   The Remote Procedure Call version 2 protocol has been a Proposed
   Standard for three decades (see [RFC5531] and its antecedants).
   Eisler et al. first introduced an in-transit encryption mechanism for
   RPC with RPCSEC GSS over twenty years ago [RFC2203].  However,
   experience has shown that RPCSEC GSS is difficult to deploy:

   o  Per-client deployment and administrative costs are not scalable.
      Keying material must be provided for each RPC client, including
      transient clients.

   o  Parts of the RPC header remain in clear-text, and can constitute a
      significant security exposure.

   o  On-host cryptographic manipulation of data payloads can exact a
      significant CPU cost on both clients and the server.

   o  Host identity management and user identity management must be
      carried out in the same security realm.  In certain environments,
      different authorities might be responsible for provisioning client
      systems versus provisioning new users.

   However strong a privacy service is, it can not provide any security
   if the difficulties of deploying and using it result in it not being
   used at all.

   An alternative approach is to employ a transport layer security
   mechanism that can protect the privacy of each RPC connection
   transparently to RPC and Upper Layer protocols.  The Transport Layer
   Security protocol [RFC8446] (TLS) is a well-established Internet
   building block that protects many common Internet protocols such as
   the Hypertext Transport Protocol (http) [RFC2818].

   Encrypting at the RPC transport layer enables several significant
   benefits.

   Encryption By Default
      In-transit encryption can be enabled without additional
      administrative actions such as identifying the host system to a

      trust authority, generating additional key material, or
      provisioning a secure network tunnel.

   Protection of Existing Protocols
      The imposition of encryption at the transport layer protects any
      Upper Layer protocol that employs RPC, without alteration of that
      protocol.  RPC transport layer encryption can protect recent
      versions of NFS such as NFS version 4.2 [RFC7862] and indeed
      legacy NFS versions such as NFS version 3 [RFC1813] and NFS side-
      band protocols such as the MNT protocol [RFC1813].

   Decoupled User and Host Identities
      TLS can be used to authenticate hosts using certificates while
      other security mechanisms can handle user authentictation.

   Encryption Offload
      The use of a well-established transport encryption mechanism that
      is also employed by other very common network protocols makes it
      likely that a hardware encryption implementation will be available
      to offload encryption and decryption.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This document adopts the terminology introduced in Section 3 of
   [RFC6973] and assumes a working knowledge of the Remote Procedure
   Call (RPC) version 2 protocol [RFC5531] and the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) version 1.3 protocol [RFC8446].

   Note also that the NFS community uses the term "privacy" where other
   Internet communities use "confidentiality".  In this document the two
   terms are synonymous.

4.  RPC-Over-TLS in Operation

   In this section we cleave to the convention that a "client" is the
   peer host that actively initiates a connection, and a "server" is the
   peer host that passively accepts a connection request.

4.1.  Discovering Server-side TLS Support

   The mechanism described in this document interoperates fully with RPC
   implementations that do not support TLS.  The use of TLS is
   automatically disabled in these cases.

   To achieve this, we introduce a new RPC authentication flavor called
   AUTH_TLS.  This new flavor is used to signal that the client wants to
   initiate TLS negotiation if the server supports it.  Except for the
   modifications described in this section, the RPC protocol is largely
   unaware of security encapsulation.

   <CODE BEGINS>

   enum auth_flavor {
           AUTH_NONE       = 0,
           AUTH_SYS        = 1,
           AUTH_SHORT      = 2,
           AUTH_DH         = 3,
           AUTH_KERB       = 4,
           AUTH_RSA        = 5,
           RPCSEC_GSS      = 6,
           AUTH_TLS        = 7,

           /* and more to be defined */
   };

   <CODE ENDS>

   The length of the opaque data constituting the credential sent in the
   call message MUST be zero.  The verifier accompanying the credential
   MUST be an AUTH_NONE verifier of length zero.

   The flavor value of the verifier received in the reply message from
   the server MUST be AUTH_NONE.  The bytes of the verifier's string
   encode the fixed ASCII characters "STARTTLS".

   When an RPC client is ready to begin sending traffic to a server, it
   starts with a NULL RPC request with an auth_flavor of AUTH_TLS.  The
   NULL request is made to the same port as if TLS were not in use.

   The RPC server can respond in one of three ways:

   o  If the RPC server does not recognise the AUTH_TLS authentication
      flavor, it responds with a reject_stat of AUTH_ERROR.  The RPC
      client then knows that this server does not support TLS.

Internet-Draft                RPC-Over-TLS                    March 2019


   o  If the RPC server accepts the NULL RPC procedure, but fails to
      return an AUTH_NONE verifier containing the string "STARTTLS", the
      RPC client knows that this server does not support TLS.

   o  If the RPC server accepts the NULL RPC procedure, and returns an
      AUTH_NONE verifier containing the string "STARTTLS", the RPC
      client SHOULD proceed with TLS negotiation.

   If an RPC client attempts to use AUTH_TLS for anything other than the
   NULL RPC procedure, the RPC server responds with a reject_stat of
   AUTH_ERROR.  In addition, a client MUST NOT attempt a TLS handshake
   after the initial exchange.

   Once the TLS handshake is complete, the RPC client and server will
   have established a secure channel for communicating and can proceed
   to use standard security flavors within that channel, presumably
   after negotiating down the irrelevant RPCSEC_GSS privacy and
   integrity services and applying channel binding [RFC7861].

   If TLS negotiation fails for any reason -- say, the RPC server
   rejects the certificate presented by the RPC client, or the RPC
   client fails to authenticate the RPC server -- the RPC client reports
   this failure to the calling application the same way it would report
   an AUTH_ERROR rejection from the RPC server.

4.2.  RPC Authentication

   Both RPC and TLS have their own variants of authentication, and there
   is some overlap in capability.  The goal of interoperability with
   implementations that do not support TLS requires that we limit the
   combinations that are allowed and precisely specify the role that
   each layer plays.  We also want to handle TLS such that an RPC
   implementation can make the use of TLS invisible to existing RPC
   consumer applications.

   Toward these ends, there are two deployment modes.

4.2.1.  Server-only Host Authentication

   In a basic deployment, a server possesses a unique global identity
   (e.g., a certificate that is self-signed or signed by a well-known
   trust anchor) while its clients are anonymous (i.e., present no
   identifier).  In this situation, the client SHOULD authenticate the
   server host using the presented TLS identity, but the server cannot
   authenticate connecting clients.  Here, a TLS session is established
   and the RPC requests in transit carry user and group identities
   according to the conventions of the RPC protocol.

Internet-Draft                RPC-Over-TLS                    March 2019


4.2.2.  Mutual Host Authentication

   In this type of deployment, both the server and its clients possess
   unique identities (e.g., certificates).  As part of the TLS
   handshake, both peer hosts SHOULD authenticate using the presented
   TLS identities.  Should authentication of either peer fail, or should
   authorization based on those identities block access to the server,
   the connection MAY be rejected.  However, once a TLS session is
   established, the server MUST NOT utilize TLS identity for the purpose
   of authorizing RPC requests.

   In some cases, a client might choose to present a certificate that
   represents a user rather than one that is bound to the client host.
   As above, the server MUST NOT utilize this identity for the purpose
   of authorizing RPC requests.  The TLS identities of the peer hosts
   are fully independent of RPC user identities.

4.2.3.  Advanced Forms of RPC Authentication

   RPCSEC GSS can provide integrity or privacy (also known as
   confidentiality) services.  When operating over a TLS session, these
   services become redundant.  Each RPC implementation is responsible
   for using channel binding for detecting when GSS integrity or privacy
   is unnecessary and can therefore be disabled.  See Section 2.5 of
   [RFC7861] for details.

   Note that a GSS service principal is still required on the server,
   and mutual GSS authentication of server and client still occurs after
   the TLS session is established.

5.  TLS Requirements

   When a TLS session is negotiated for the purpose of transporting RPC,
   the following restrictions apply:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS versions prior to v1.3
      [RFC8446].  Support for mandatory-to-implement ciphersuites for
      the negotiated TLS version is REQUIRED.

   o  Implementations MUST support certificate-based mutual
      authentication.  Support for TLS-PSK mutual authentication
      [RFC4279] is OPTIONAL.  See Section 4.2 for further details.

   o  Negotiation of a ciphersuite providing for confidentiality as well
      as integrity protection is REQUIRED.  Support for and negotiation
      of compression is OPTIONAL.

5.1.  Connection Types

5.1.1.  Operation on TCP

   RPC over TCP is protected by using TLS [RFC8446].  As soon as a
   client completes the TCP handshake, it uses the mechanism described
   in Section 4.1 to discover TLS support and then negotiate a TLS
   session.

5.1.2.  Operation on UDP

   RPC over UDP is protected using DTLS [RFC6347].  As soon as a client
   initializes a socket for use with an unfamiliar server, it uses the
   mechanism described in Section 4.1 to discover DTLS support and then
   negotiate a DTLS session.  Connected operation is RECOMMENDED.

   Using a DTLS transport does not introduce reliable or in-order
   semantics to RPC on UDP.  Also, DTLS does not support fragmentation
   of RPC messages.  One RPC message fits in a single DTLS datagram.
   DTLS encapsulation has overhead which reduces the effective Path MTU
   (PMTU) and thus the maximum RPC payload size.

5.1.3.  Operation on an RDMA Transport

   RPC-over-RDMA can make use of Transport Layer Security below the RDMA
   transport layer [RFC8166].  The exact mechanism is not within the
   scope of this document.

5.2.  TLS Peer Authentication

   Peer authentication can be performed by TLS using any of the
   following mechanisms:

5.2.1.  X.509 Certificates Using PKIX trust

   Implementations are REQUIRED to support this mechanism.  In this
   mode, an RPC client is uniquely identified by the tuple (serial
   number of presented client certificate;Issuer).

   o  Implementations MUST allow the configuration of a list of trusted
      Certification Authorities for incoming connections.

   o  Certificate validation MUST include the verification rules as per
      [RFC5280].

   o  Implementations SHOULD indicate their trusted Certification
      Authorities (CAs).

Internet-Draft                RPC-Over-TLS                    March 2019


   o  Peer validation always includes a check on whether the locally
      configured expected DNS name or IP address of the server that is
      contacted matches its presented certificate.  DNS names and IP
      addresses can be contained in the Common Name (CN) or
      subjectAltName entries.  For verification, only one of these
      entries is to be considered.  The following precedence applies:
      for DNS name validation, subjectAltName:DNS has precedence over
      CN; for IP address validation, subjectAltName:iPAddr has
      precedence over CN.  Implementors of this specification are
      advised to read Section 6 of [RFC6125] for more details on DNS
      name validation.

   o  Implementations MAY allow the configuration of a set of additional
      properties of the certificate to check for a peer's authorization
      to communicate (e.g., a set of allowed values in
      subjectAltName:URI or a set of allowed X509v3 Certificate
      Policies).

   o  When the configured trust base changes (e.g., removal of a CA from
      the list of trusted CAs; issuance of a new CRL for a given CA),
      implementations MAY renegotiate the TLS session to reassess the
      connecting peer's continued authorization.

   Having identified a connecting entity does not mean the RPC server
   necessarily wants to communicate with that client.  For example, if
   the Issuer is not in a trusted set of Issuers, the RPC server may
   decline to perform RPC transactions with this client.
   Implementations that want to support a wide variety of trust models
   should expose as many details of the presented certificate to the
   administrator as possible so that the trust model can be implemented
   by the administrator.  As a suggestion, at least the following
   parameters of the X.509 client certificate should be exposed:

   o  Originating IP address

   o  Certificate Fingerprint

   o  Issuer

   o  Subject

   o  all X509v3 Extended Key Usage

   o  all X509v3 Subject Alternative Name

   o  all X509v3 Certificate Policies

5.2.2.  X.509 Certificates Using Fingerprints

   This mechanism is OPTIONAL to implement.  In this mode, an RPC client
   is uniquely identified by the fingerprint of the presented client
   certificate.

   Implementations SHOULD allow the configuration of a list of trusted
   certificates, identified via fingerprint of the DER encoded
   certificate octets.  Implementations MUST support SHA-1 as the hash
   algorithm for the fingerprint.  To prevent attacks based on hash
   collisions, support for a more contemporary hash function, such as
   SHA-256, is RECOMMENDED.

5.2.3.  Pre-Shared Keys

   This mechanism is OPTIONAL to implement.  In this mode, an RPC client
   is uniquely identified by its TLS identifier.  At least the following
   parameters of the TLS connection should be exposed:

   o  Originating IP address

   o  TLS Identifier

5.2.4.  Token Binding

   This mechanism is OPTIONAL to implement.  In this mode, an RPC client
   is uniquely identified by a token.

   Versions of TLS subsequent to TLS 1.2 feature a token binding
   mechanism which is nominally more secure than using certificates.
   This is discussed in further detail in [RFC8471].

6.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.

   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

7.  Security Considerations

   One purpose of the mechanism described in this document is to protect
   RPC-based applications against threats to the privacy of RPC
   transactions and RPC user identities.  A taxonomy of these threats
   appears in Section 5 of [RFC6973].  In addition, Section 6 of
   [RFC7525] contains a detailed discussion of technologies used in
   conjunction with TLS.  Implementers should familiarize themselves
   with these materials.

   The NFS version 4 protocol permits more than one user to use an NFS
   client at the same time [RFC7862].  Typically that NFS client will
   conserve connection resources by routing RPC transactions from all of
   its users over a few or a single connection.  In circumstances where

   domains, the client MUST establish independent TLS sessions for each
   distinct security domain.

7.1.  Implications for AUTH_SYS

   Ever since the IETF NFSV4 Working Group took over the maintenance of
   the NFSv4 family of protocols (currently specified in [RFC7530],
   [RFC5661], and [RFC7863], among others), it has encouraged the use of
   RPCSEC GSS over AUTH_SYS.  For various reasons, unfortunately
   AUTH_SYS continues to be the primary authentication mechanism
   deployed by NFS administrators.  As a result, NFS security remains in
   an unsatisfactory state.

   A deeper purpose of this document is to attempt to address some of
   the shortcomings of AUTH_SYS so that, where it has been impractical
   to deploy RPCSEC GSS, better NFSv4 security can nevertheless be
   achieved.

   When AUTH_SYS is used with TLS and no client certificate is
   available, the RPC server is still acting on RPC requests for which
   there is no trustworthy authentication.  In-transit traffic is
   protected, but the client itself can still misrepresent user identity
   without detection.  This is an improvement from AUTH_SYS without
   encryption, but it leaves a critical security exposure.

   Therefore, the RECOMMENDED deployment mode is that clients have
   certificate material configured and used so that servers can have a
   degree of trust that clients are acting responsibly.

8.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with Section 6 of [RFC7301], the authors request that
   IANA allocate the following value in the "Application-Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry.  The "sunrpc" string
   identifies SunRPC when used over TLS.

   Protocol:
      SunRPC

   Identification Sequence:
      0x73 0x75 0x6e 0x72 0x70 0x63 ("sunrpc")

   Reference:
      RFC-TBD
