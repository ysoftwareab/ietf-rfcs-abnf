1.  Introduction

   The Internet Registry Information Service[RFC3981] described a
   client-server protocol for querying Internet registries.  One
   intended usage of the protocol was address registries, described in
   [RFC4698].  That document requested the Internet Architecture Board
   (IAB) to instruct IANA to insert a new label under .arpa.  The IAB
   requested that delegation as set out in [RFC3172], and IANA set up
   both iris.arpa and a sub-delegation, areg.iris.arpa, as requested.

2.  Recommendation

   While IRIS was specified for this usage, it was not deployed for this
   purpose.  At the request of the IAB, IANA reviewed usage statistics
   for the iris.arpa zone and found zero queries for areg.iris.arpa or
   NAPTR records during the survey period.

   This document recommends that these delgations be removed from .arpa.
   If approved, the IAB is requested to instruct IANA to remove them.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA remove .iris.arpa and its sub-
   delegations from the arpa zone upon receiving the relevant approval
   of the IAB.

4.  Security Considerations

   If there are users which are testing for the presence of this domain,
   those tests will fail.  Without evidence of the existence of those
   tests or knowledge of their purpose, the impact is unknown.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Michelle Cotton and ICANN staff gathered the DNS request data on
   iris.arpa utilization.  Michelle Cotton and Andy Newton reviewed this
   document.
