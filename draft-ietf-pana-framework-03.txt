1.  Introduction

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a
   link-layer agnostic network access authentication protocol that runs
   between a node that wants to gain access to the network and a server
   on the network side.  PANA defines a new EAP [RFC3748] lower layer
   that uses IP between the protocol end points.

   The motivation to define such a protocol and the requirements are
   described in [I-D.ietf-pana-requirements].  Protocol details are
   documented in [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].  [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] describes
   use of IPsec for access control following PANA-based authentication.
   IPsec can be used for per-packet access control, but nevertheless it
   is not the only way to achieve this functionality.  Alternatives
   include reliance on physical security and link-layer ciphering.
   Separation of PANA server from the entity enforcing the access
   control is envisaged as an optional deployment choice.  SNMP
   [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp] is chosen as the protocol to carry associated
   information between the separate nodes.

   PANA design provides support for various types of deployments.
   Access networks can differ based on the availability of lower-layer
   security, placement of PANA entities, choice of client IP
   configuration and authentication methods, etc.

   PANA can be used in any access network regardless of the underlying
   security.  For example, the network might be physically secured, or
   secured by means of cryptographic mechanisms after the successful
   client-network authentication.

   The PANA client, PANA authentication agent, authentication server,
   and enforcement point are the relevant functional entities in this
   design.  PANA authentication agent and enforcement point(s) can be
   placed on various elements in the access network (e.g., access point,
   access router, dedicated host).

   IP address configuration mechanisms vary as well.  Static
   configuration, DHCP, stateless address autoconfiguration are possible
   mechanisms to choose from.  If the client configures an IPsec tunnel
   for enabling per-packet security, configuring IP addresses inside the
   tunnel becomes relevant, for which there are additional choices such
   as IKE.

   This document defines a general framework for describing how these
   various deployment choices are handled by PANA and the access network
   architectures.  Additionally, two possible deployments are described
   in detail: PANA over DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) networks and WLANs
   (Wireless LANs).

2.  Terminology

   Pre-PANA address (PRPA)

      This is an IP address configured on a PANA client before starting
      the PANA protocol exchange.

   Post-PANA address (POPA)

      This is an IP address (optionally) configured on a PANA client
      after a successful authentication.

   IPsec Tunnel Inner Address (IPsec-TIA)

      This is an IP address configured on a PANA client as the inner
      address of an IPsec tunnel mode SA.

   IPsec Tunnel Outer Address (IPsec-TOA)

      This is the address configured on a PANA client as the outer
      address of an IPsec tunnel mode SA.

   Secure Association Protocol

      A protocol that provides a cryptographic binding between the
      initial entity authentication (and authorization) exchange to the
      subsequent exchange of data packets.  Examples of secure
      association protocols include the 4-way handshake in IEEE 802.11i
      [802.11i], and IKE [RFC2409] in IP-based access control.

3.  General PANA Framework

   PANA protocol is designed to facilitate authentication and
   authorization of clients in access networks.  PANA is an EAP
   [RFC3748] lower-layer that carries EAP authentication methods
   encapsulated inside EAP between a client node and an agent in the
   access network.  While PANA enables the authentication process
   between the two entities, it is only a part of an overall AAA
   (Authentication Authorization and Accounting) and access control
   framework.  A AAA and access control framework using PANA is
   comprised of four functional entities.

   PANA Client (PaC):

      The PaC is the client implementation of the PANA protocol.  This
      entity resides on the node that is requesting network access.
      PaCs can be end hosts, such as laptops, PDAs, cell phones, desktop
      PCs, or routers that are connected to a network via a wired or
      wireless interface.  A PaC is responsible for requesting network
      access and engaging in the authentication process using the PANA
      protocol.

   PANA Authentication Agent (PAA):

      The PAA is the server implementation of the PANA protocol.  A PAA
      is in charge of interfacing with the PaCs for authenticating and
      authorizing them for the network access service.

      The PAA consults an authentication server in order to verify the
      credentials and rights of a PaC.  If the authentication server
      resides on the same node as the PAA, an API is sufficient for this
      interaction.  When they are separated (a much more common case in
      public access networks), a protocol needs to run between the two.
      LDAP [RFC3377] and AAA protocols like RADIUS [RFC2865] and
      Diameter [RFC3588] are commonly used for this purpose.

      The PAA is also responsible for updating the access control state
      (i.e., filters) depending on the creation and deletion of the
      authorization state.  The PAA communicates the updated state to
      the enforcement points in the network.  If the PAA and EP are
      residing on the same node, an API is sufficient for this
      communication.  Otherwise, a protocol is required to carry the
      authorized client attributes from the PAA to the EP.  While not
      prohibiting other protocols, currently SNMP [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp]
      is suggested for this task.

Internet-Draft               PANA Framework                December 2004


      The PAA resides on a node that is typically called a NAS (network
      access server) in the local area network.  The PAA can be hosted
      on any IP-enabled node on the same IP subnet as the PaC.  For
      example on a BAS (Broadband Access Server) in DSL networks, or
      PDSN (Packet Data Serving Node) in 3GPP2 networks.

   Authentication Server (AS):

      The server implementation that is in charge of verifying the
      credentials of a PaC that is requesting the network access
      service.  The AS receives requests from the PAA on behalf of the
      PaCs, and responds with the result of verification together with
      the authorization parameters (e.g., allowed bandwidth, IP
      configuration, etc).  The AS might be hosted on the same node as
      the PAA, on a dedicated node on the access network, or on a
      central server somewhere in the Internet.

   Enforcement Point (EP):

      The access control implementation that is in charge of allowing
      access to authorized clients while preventing access by others.
      An EP learns the attributes of the authorized clients from the
      PAA.

      The EP uses non-cryptographic or cryptographic filters to
      selectively allow and discard data packets.  These filters may be
      applied at the link-layer or the IP-layer.  When cryptographic
      access control is used, a secure association protocol needs to run
      between the PaC and EP.  Link or network layer protection (for
      example TKIP, IPsec ESP) is used after the secure association
      protocol established the necessary security association to enable
      integrity protection, data origin authentication, replay
      protection and optionally confidentiality protection.

      An EP must be located strategically in a local area network to
      minimize the access of unauthorized clients to the network.  For
      example, the EP can be hosted on the switch that is directly
      connected to the clients in a wired network.  That way the EP can
      drop unauthorized packets before they reach any other client node
      or beyond the local area network.

   Figure 1 illustrates these functional entities and the interfaces
   (protocols, APIs) among them.

                    Figure 1: PANA Functional Model

   Some of the entities may be co-located depending on the deployment
   scenario.  For example, the PAA and EP would be on the same node
   (BAS) in DSL networks.  In that case a simple API is sufficient
   between the PAA and EP.  In small enterprise deployments the PAA and
   AS may be hosted on the same node (access router) that eliminates the
   need for a protocol run between the two.  The decision to co-locate
   these entities or otherwise, and their precise location in the
   network topology are deployment decisions.

   Use of IKE or IEEE 802.11i 4-way handshake protocols for secure
   association is only required in the absence of any lower-layer
   security prior to running PANA.  Physically secured networks (e.g.,
   DSL) or the networks that are already cryptographically secured on
   the link-layer prior to PANA run (e.g., cdma2000) do not require
   additional secure association and per-packet ciphering.  These
   networks can bind the PANA authentication and authorization to the
   lower-layer secure channel that is already available.

   Figure 2 illustrates the signaling flow for authorizing a client for
   network access.

                     Figure 2: PANA Signaling Flow

   The EP on the access network allows general data traffic from any
   authorized PaC, whereas it allows only limited type of traffic (e.g.,
   PANA, DHCP, router discovery, etc.) for the unauthorized PaCs.  This
   ensures that the newly attached clients have the minimum access
   service to engage in PANA and get authorized for the unlimited
   service.

   The PaC MUST configure an IP address prior to running PANA.  After
   the successful PANA authentication, depending on the deployment
   scenario the PaC MAY need to re-configure its IP address or configure
   additional IP address(es).  The additional address configuration MAY
   be executed as part of the secure association protocol run (e.g., via
   IKE).

   An initially unauthorized PaC starts the PANA authentication by
   discovering the PAA on the access network, followed by the EAP
   exchange over PANA.  The PAA interacts with the AS during this
   process.  Upon receiving the authentication and authorization result
   from the AS, the PAA informs the PaC about the result of its network
   access request.

   If the PaC is authorized to gain the access to the network, the PAA
   also sends the PaC-specific attributes (e.g., IP address,
   cryptographic keys, etc.) to the EP by using SNMP.  The EP uses this
   information to alter its filters for allowing data traffic from and
   to the PaC to pass through.

   In case cryptographic access control needs to be enabled after the
   PANA authentication, a secure association protocol runs between the
   PaC and the EP.  The PaC should already have the input parameters to
   this process as a result of the successful PANA exchange.  Similarly,

Internet-Draft               PANA Framework                December 2004


   the EP should have obtained them from the PAA via SNMP.  The secure
   association protocol exchange produces the required security
   associations between the PaC and the EP to enable cryptographic data
   traffic protection.  Per-packet cryptographic data traffic protection
   introduces additional per-packet overhead but the overhead exists
   only between the PaC and EP and will not affect communications beyond
   the EP.  In this sense it is important to place the EP as close to
   the edge of the network as possible.

   Finally data traffic can start flowing from and to the newly
   authorized PaC.

4.  Environments

   The PANA protocol can be used on any network environment whether
   there is a lower-layer secure channel prior to PANA, or one has to be
   enabled upon successful PANA authentication.

   With regard to network access authentication two types of networks
   need to be considered:

   a. Networks where a secure channel is already available prior to
   running PANA

      This type of network is characterized by the existence of
      protection against spoofing and eavesdropping.  Nevertheless, user
      authentication and authorization is required for network
      connectivity.

      One example is a DSL network where the lower-layer security is
      provided by physical means (a.1).  Physical protection of the
      network wiring ensures that practically there is only one client
      that can send and receive IP packets on the link.  Another example
      is a cdma2000 network where the lower-layer security is provided
      by means of cryptographic protection (a.2).  By the time the
      client requests access to the network-layer services, it is
      already authenticated and authorized for accessing the radio
      channel, and link-layer ciphering is enabled.

      The presence of a secure channel before PANA exchange eliminates
      the need for executing a secure association protocol after PANA.
      The PANA session can be bound to the communication channel it was
      carried over.  Also, the choice of EAP authentication method
      depends on the presence of this security during PANA run.  Use of
      some authentication methods outside a secure channel is not
      recommended (e.g., EAP-MD5).

   b. Networks where a secure channel is created after running PANA

      These are the networks where there is no lower-layer protection
      prior to running PANA.  A successful PANA authentication enables
      generation of cryptographic keys that are used with a secure
      association protocol to enable per-packet cryptographic
      protection.

      PANA authentication is run on an insecure channel that is
      vulnerable to eavesdropping and spoofing.  The choice of EAP
      method must be resilient to the possible attacks associated with
      such an environment.  Furthermore, the EAP method must be able to
      create cryptographic keys that will later be used by the secure

      association protocol.

      Whether to use a link-layer per-packet security (b.1) or a network
      layer security (b.2) is a deployment decision.  This decision also
      dictates the choice of the secure association protocol.  If
      link-layer protection is used, the protocol would be link-layer
      specific.  If IP-layer protection is used, the secure association
      protocol would be IKE and the per-packet security would be
      provided by IPsec AH/ESP regardless of the underlying link-layer
      technology.

5.  IP Address Configuration

   The PaC configures an IP address before the PANA protocol exchange
   begins.  This address is called a pre-PANA address (PRPA).  After a
   successful authentication, the client may have to configure a
   post-PANA address (POPA) for communication with other nodes, if the
   PRPA is a local-use (e.g., a link-local or private address) or a
   temporarily allocated IP address.  An operator might choose
   allocating a POPA only after successful PANA authorization either to
   prevent waste of premium (e.g., globally routable) IP resources until
   the client is authorized, or to enable client identity based address
   assignment.

   In case the PaC is a IPv4/IPv6 dual-stacked node, it may configure
   more than one PRPA.  After a successful PANA authentication the PaC
   may configure multiple POPAs.

   There are different methods by which a PRPA can be configured.

   1.  In some deployments (e.g., DSL networks) the PaC may be
      statically configured with an IP address.  This address SHOULD be
      used as a PRPA.

   2.  In IPv4, most clients attempt to configure an address dynamically
      using DHCP [RFC2131].  If they are unable to configure an address
      using DHCP, they can configure a link-local address using
      [I-D.ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal].

      When the network access provider is able to run a DHCP server on
      the access link, the client would configure the PRPA using DHCP.
      This address may be from a private address pool [RFC1918].  Also,
      the lease time on the address may vary.  For example, a PRPA
      configured solely for running PANA can have a short lease time.
      The PRPA may be used for local-use only (i.e., only for on-link
      communication, such as for PANA and IPsec tunneling with EP), or
      also for ultimate end-to-end data communication.

      In case there is no running DHCP server on the link, the client
      would fall back to configuring a PRPA via zeroconfiguration
      technique [I-D.ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal].  This yields a
      long-term address that can only be used for on-link communication.

   3.  In IPv6, clients configure a link-local address [RFC2462] when
      they initialize an interface.  This address SHOULD be used as a
      PRPA.

   When a PRPA is configured, the client starts the PANA protocol
   exchange.  By that time, a dual-stacked client might have configured



Jayaraman, et al.        Expires June 28, 2005                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               PANA Framework                December 2004


   both an IPv4 address, and one or more IPv6 addresses as PRPAs.

   When the client successfully authenticates to the network, it may be
   required to configure POPAs for its subsequent data communication
   with the other nodes.

   If the client is already configured with a non-temporary address that
   can be used with data communication, it is not required to configure
   a POPA.  Otherwise, the PANA-Bind-Request message allows the PAA to
   indicate the available configuration methods to the PaC.  The PaC can
   choose one of the methods and act accordingly.

   1.  If the network relies on physical or link layer security, the PaC
      can configure a POPA using DHCP [RFC2131][RFC3315] or using IPv6
      stateless auto-configuration [RFC2461].  If IPv4 is being used, a
      PRPA is likely to be a link-local or private address, or an
      address with a short DHCP lease.  An IPv4 PRPA SHOULD be
      unconfigured when the POPA is configured to prevent IPv4 address
      selection problem [I-D.ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal].  If IPv6 is
      used, the link-local PRPA SHOULD NOT be unconfigured [RFC3484].

      If the PaC is a dual-stacked node, it can configure both IPv4 and
      IPv6 type POPAs.

      The PaC with a PRPA and the PAA with IP address X can perform
      on-link communication as required by PANA.  In IPv4, the PRPA and
      IP address X have the same on-link prefix.  In IPv6, the two
      addresses are link-local addresses.  When the PaC replaces its
      IPv4 PRPA with an IPv4 POPA, the PaC and PAA SHOULD create host
      routes to each other, when they do not share the same on-link
      prefix any more.  This is needed for the PaC with the IPv4 POPA
      and the PAA with IP address X to continue on-link communication.
      In this case, the PaC SHOULD create a host route to IP address X,
      and the PAA SHOULD create a host route to the IPv4 POPA.  PANA
      defines a mechanism for the PaC to report the POPA to the PAA.

   2.  If the network uses IPsec for protecting the traffic on the link
      subsequent to PANA authentication [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec], the PaC
      would use the PRPA as the outer address of IPsec tunnel mode SA
      (IPsec-TOA).  The PaC also needs to configure an inner address
      (IPsec-TIA).  There are different ways to configure an IPsec-TIA
      which are indicated in a PANA-Bind-Request message.

      When an IPv4 PRPA is configured, the same address may be used as
      both IPsec-TOA and IPsec-TIA.  In this case, a POPA is not
      configured.  Alternatively, an IPsec-TIA can be obtained via the
      configuration method available within [RFC3456] for IPv4, and
      [I-D.ietf-ipsec-ikev2] for both IPv4 and IPv6.  This newly

      configured address constitutes a POPA.  Please refer to
      [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] for more details.

      IKEv2 can enable configuration of one IPv4 IPsec-TIA and one IPv6
      IPsec-TIA for the same IPsec tunnel mode SA.  Therefore, IKEv2 is
      recommended for handling dual-stacked PaCs where single execution
      of PANA and IKE is desired.

   Although there are potentially a number of different ways to
   configure a PRPA, and POPA when necessary, it should be noted that
   the ultimate decision to use one or more of these in a deployment
   depends on the operator.  The decision is dictated by the operator's
   choice of per-packet protection capability (physical and link-layer
   vs network-layer), PRPA type (local and temporary vs global and
   long-term), and POPA configuration mechanisms available in the
   network.

6.  Data Traffic Protection

   Protecting data traffic of authenticated and authorized client from
   others is another component of providing a complete secure network
   access solution.  Authentication, integrity and replay protection of
   data packets is needed to prevent spoofing when the underlying
   network is not physically secured.  Encryption is needed when
   eavesdropping is a concern in the network.

   When the network is physically secured, or the link-layer ciphering
   is already enabled prior to PANA, data traffic protection is already
   in place.  In other cases, enabling link-layer ciphering or
   network-layer ciphering might rely on PANA authentication.  The user
   and network have to make sure that an appropriate EAP method which
   generates keying materials is used.  Once the keying material is
   available, it needs to be provided to the EP(s) for use with data
   traffic protection.

   Network-layer protection, i.e., IPsec, can be used when data traffic
   protection is required but link-layer protection is not available.
   Note that the keying material generated by an EAP method is not
   readily usable by IPsec AH/ESP or most link layer mechanisms.  A
   fresh and unique session key derived from the EAP method is still
   insufficient to produce an IPsec SA since both traffic selectors and
   other IPsec SA parameters are missing.  The shared secret can be used
   in conjunction with a key management protocol like IKE [RFC2409] to
   turn a session key into the required IPsec SA.  The details of such a
   mechanism is outside the scope of PANA protocol and is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].  PANA provides bootstrapping functionality for
   such a mechanism by carrying EAP methods that can generate initial
   keying material.

   Using network-layer ciphers should be regarded as a substitute for
   link-layer ciphers when the latter is not available.  Network-layer
   ciphering can also be used in addition to link-layer ciphering if the
   added benefits outweigh its cost to the user and the network.  In
   this case, PANA bootstraps only the network-layer ciphering;
   link-layer ciphering is enabled using any of the existing link-layer
   specific methods.

7.  PAA-EP Protocol

   The PANA protocol provides client authentication and authorization
   functionality for securing network access.  The other component of a
   complete solution is the access control which ensures that only
   authenticated and authorized clients can gain access to the network.
   PANA enables access control by distinguishing authenticated and
   authorized clients from others and generating filtering information
   for access control mechanisms.

   Access control can be achieved by placing EPs (Enforcement Points) in
   the network for policing the traffic flow.  EPs should prevent data
   traffic from and to any unauthorized client unless it's either PANA
   or one of the other allowed traffic types (e.g., ARP, IPv6 neighbor
   discovery, DHCP, etc.).

   When a PaC is authenticated and authorized, the PAA should notify
   EP(s) and ask for installing filtering rules to allow the PaC to send
   and receive data traffic.  SNMP is used between PAA and EP(s) for
   this purpose when these entities are not co-located
   [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp].

   This section describes the possible models on the location of PAA and
   EP, as well as the basic authorization information that needs to be
   exchanged between PAA and EP.  When PAA and EP are not co-located in
   a single device, there are other issues such as dead or rebooted peer
   detection and consideration for specific authorization and accounting
   models.  However, these issues are closely related to the PAA-EP
   protocol solution and thus not discussed in this document.  See
   [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp] for further discussion.

7.1  PAA and EP Locations

   EPs' location in the network topology should be appropriate for
   performing access control functionality.  The closest IP-capable
   access device to the client devices is the logical choice.  PAA and
   EPs on an access network should be aware of each other as this is
   necessary for access control.  Generally this can be achieved by
   manual configuration.  Dynamic discovery is another possibility, but
   this is left to implementations and outside the scope of this
   document.

   Since PANA allows the separation of EP and PAA, there are several
   models depending on the number of EPs and PAAs and their locations.
   This section describes all possible models on the placement of PAA(s)
   and EP(s).

Internet-Draft               PANA Framework                December 2004


7.1.1  Single PAA, Single EP, Co-located

   This model corresponds to the legacy NAS model.  Since the PAA and
   the EP are co-located, the PAA-EP communication can be implemented
   locally by using, e.g., IPC (Inter-Process Communication).  The only
   difference from the legacy NAS model is the case where there are
   multiple co-located PAA/EP devices on the same IP link and the PAA/EP
   devices are link-layer switches or access points.  In this case, for
   a PaC that attaches to a given PAA/EP device, other PAA/EP devices
   should not be discovered by the PaC even if those devices are on the
   same IP link.  Otherwise, the PaC may result in finding a PAA that is
   not the closest one to it during the PANA discovery and initial
   handshake phase and performing PANA with the PAA, which does not
   correspond to the legacy NAS model.  To prevent this, each PAA/EP
   device on an link-layer switch or access point should not forward
   multicast PANA discovery message sent by PaCs attached to it to other
   devices.

7.1.2  Separate PAA and EP

   When PAA is separated from EP, two cases are possible with regard to
   whether PAA and EP are located in parallel or serial when viewed from
   PaC, for each of models described in this section.

   In the first case, PAA is located behind EP.  The EP should be
   configured to always pass through PANA messages and address
   configuration protocol messages used for configuring an IP address
   used for initial PANA messaging.  This case can typically happen when
   the EP is an link-layer switch or an access point (the EP also has an
   IP stack to communicate with PAA via a PAA-EP protocol).

                     Figure 3: PAA and EP in Serial

   In the other case, PAA is located in parallel to EP.  Since the EP is
   not on the communication path between PaC and PAA, the EP does not
   have to configure to pass through PANA messages or address
   configuration protocol messages in this case.  This case can
   typically happen when the EP is a router and the PAA is an
   authentication gateway without IP routing functionality.

7.1.2.1  Single PAA, Single EP, Separated

   The model benefits from separation of data traffic handling and AAA.
   The EP does not need to have a AAA protocol implementation which
   might be updated relatively more frequently than the per-packet
   access enforcement implementation.

7.1.2.2  Single PAA, Multiple EPs

   In this model, a single PAA controls multiple EPs.  The PAA may be
   separated from any EP or co-located with a particular EP.  This model
   might be useful where it is preferable to run a AAA protocol at a
   single, manageable point.  This model is particularly useful in an
   access network that consists of a large number of access points on
   which per-packet access enforcement is made.  When a PaC is
   authenticated to the PAA, the PAA should install access control
   filters on each of the EPs under control of the PAA if the PAA cannot
   tell which EP the PaC is attached to.  Even if the PAA can tell which
   EP the PaC is attached to, the PAA may install access control filters
   to those EPs if the PaC is a mobile device that can roam among the
   EPs.  Such pre-installation of filters can reduce handoff latency.
   If different access authorization policies are applied to different
   EPs, different filter rules for a PaC may be installed on different
   EPs.

7.1.2.3  Multiple PAAs

   The PANA protocol allows multiple PAAs to exist on the same IP link
   and to be visible to PaCs on the link.  PAAs may or may not be
   co-located with EPs [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

7.2  Notification of PaC Presence

   When PAA and EP are separated and PAA is configured to be the
   initiator of the discovery and initial handshake phase of PANA, EP
   has the responsibility to detect presence of a new PaC and notifies
   the PAA(s) of the presence [I-D.ietf-pana-requirements].  Such a
   presence notification is carried in a PAA-EP protocol message
   [I-D.ietf-pana-snmp].

7.3  Filter Rule Installation

   Filtering rules to be installed on EP generally include a device
   identifier of PaC, and also cryptographic keying material (e.g., IKE
   pre-shared key [RFC2409]) when cryptographic data traffic protection
   is needed (See Section 6).  Each keying material is uniquely
   identified with a keying material name (e.g., ID_KEY_ID in IKE
   [RFC2409]) and has a lifetime for key management, accounting, access
   control and security reasons in general.  In addition to the device
   identifier and keying material, other filter rules, such as the IP
   filter rules specified in NAS-Filter-Rule AVPs carried in Diameter
   EAP application [I-D.ietf-aaa-eap] may be installed on EP.

8.  Network Selection

   The network selection problem statement is made in
   [I-D.ietf-eap-netsel-problem].  The PANA protocol
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] provides a way for networks to advertise which
   ISPs are available and for a PaC to choose one ISP from the
   advertised information.  When the PaC chooses an ISP in the PANA
   protocol exchange, the ultimate destination of the AAA exchange is
   determined based on the identity of the chosen service provider.  It
   is also possible that the PaC does not choose a specific ISP in the
   PANA protocol exchange.  In this case, both the ISP choice and the
   AAA destination are determined based on the PaC's identity, where the
   identifier may be an NAI [RFC2486] or the physical port number or
   link-layer address of the subscriber.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-eap-netsel-problem], network selection is
   not only related to AAA routing but also related to payload routing.
   Once an ISP is chosen and the PaC is successfully authenticated and
   authorized, the PaC is assigned an address by the ISP.

   Consider a typical DSL network where the AR (access router), EP, and
   PAA are co-located on a BAS (Broadband Access Server) in the access
   network operated by a NAP (Network Access Provider).  Figure 6 shows
   a typical model for ISP selection.

          <---- NAP ----><--------- ISP --------->

                               +---ISP1
                              /
         +---+    +---------+/
         |PaC|----|AR/EP/PAA|
         +---+    +---------+\
                      BAS     \
                               +---ISP2

                  Figure 6: A Network Selection Model

   When network selection is made at network-layer with the use of the
   PANA protocol instead of link-layer specific authentication
   mechanisms, the IP link between the PaC and PAA needs to exist prior
   to doing PANA (and prior to network selection).  In this model, the
   PRPA is either given by the NAP or a link-local address is
   auto-configured.  After the successful authentication with the ISP,
   the PaC may acquire an address (POPA) from the ISP.  It also learns
   the address of the access router (AR), e.g., through DHCP, to be used
   as its default router.  The address of the AR may or may not be in
   the same IP subnet as that of the PaC's POPA.  If they don't share
   the same prefix, they SHOULD use host routes to reach each other.

   Note that the physically secured DSL networks do not require
   IPsec-based access control.  Therefore the PaC uses one IP address at
   a time where the POPA replaces the PRPA upon configuration.

9.  Authentication Method Choice

   Authentication methods' capabilities and therefore applicability to
   various environments differ among them.  Not all methods provide
   support for mutual authentication, key derivation or distribution,
   and DoS attack resiliency that are necessary for operating in
   insecure networks.  Such networks might be susceptible to
   eavesdropping and spoofing, therefore a stronger authentication
   method needs to be used to prevent attacks on the client and the
   network.

   The authentication method choice is a function of the underlying
   security of the network (e.g., physically secured, shared link,
   etc.).  It is the responsibility of the user and the network operator
   to pick the right method for authentication.  PANA carries EAP
   regardless of the EAP method used.  It is outside the scope of PANA
   to mandate, recommend, or limit use of any authentication methods.
   PANA cannot increase the strength of a weak authentication method to
   make it suitable for an insecure environment.  There are some
   EAP-based approaches to achieve this goal (see
   [I-D.josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap],[I-D.ietf-pppext-eap-ttls]
   ,[I-D.tschofenig-eap-ikev2]).  PANA can carry these EAP encapsulating
   methods but it does not concern itself with how they achieve
   protection for the weak methods (i.e., their EAP method payloads).

10.  Example Cases

10.1  DSL Access Network

   In a DSL access network, PANA is seen applicable in the following
   scenarios.

   A typical DSL access consists of a NAS device at the DSL-access
   provider and a DSL-modem (CPE) at the customer premises.  The CPE
   devices support multiple modes of operation and PANA is applicable in
   each of these modes.

   In the current DSL deployment, a DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexor) which
   is placed between the CPE and NAS is a transparent device from PANA
   perspective.  In a future DSL model, the PAA may reside in the DSLAM
   which may directly connect ISP routers through VLANs.

         <------- customer --> <------- NAP -----> <---- ISP --->
                  premise

                          Figure 7: DSL Model

   The devices at the customer premises have been shown as "hosts" in
   the above network.

   DSL networks are protected by physical means.  Eavesdropping and
   spoofing attacks are prevented by keeping the unintended users
   physically away from the network media.  Therefore, generally
   cryptographic protection of data traffic is not necessary.
   Nevertheless, if enhanced security is deemed necessary for any
   reason, IPsec-based access control can be enabled on DSL networks as
   well by using the method described in [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].

10.1.1  Bridging Mode

   In the bridging mode, the CPE acts as a simple link-layer bridge.
   The hosts at the customer premises will function as clients to obtain
   addresses from the NAS device by using DHCP or PPPoE.

   If PPPoE is used, authentication is typically performed using CHAP or
   MS-CHAP.

   PANA will be applicable when the hosts use DHCP to obtain IP address.
   DHCP does not support authentication of the devices on either side of
   the DSL access line.  In the simplest method of address assignment,
   the NAS will allocate the IP address to a host with a lease time
   reasonably sufficient to complete a full PANA based authentication
   which will be triggered immediately after the address assignment.
   The hosts will perform the PaC function and the NAS will perform the
   PAA, EP and AR functions.

           (PaC)

                         Figure 8: Bridge Mode

   The DSL service provider's trunk network should not be accessible to
   any host that has not successfully completed the PANA authentication
   phase.

10.1.2  Router Mode

   In this mode, the CPE acts as a router for the customer premises
   network.  The CPE itself may obtain the IP address using DHCP or be
   configured with a static IP address.  Once the CPE is authenticated
   using PANA and is provided access to the service provider's network,
   the NAS should begin exchanging routing updates with the CPE.  All
   devices at the customer premises will then have access to the service
   provider's network.

           Host--+
                 |
                 +----- CPE ----- DSLAM ----- NAS ------------- ISP
                 |   (Router, PaC)        (PAA,EP,AR)
           Host--+

                         Figure 9: Router Mode

   It is possible that both ends of the DSL link are configured with
   static IP addresses.  PANA-based mutual authentication of CPE and NAS
   is desirable before data traffic is exchanged between the customer
   premises network and the service provider network.  The CPE router
   may also use NAPT (Network Address Port Tranlation).

10.1.3  PANA and Dynamic ISP Selection

   In some installations, a NAS device is shared by multiple service
   providers.  Each service provider configures the NAS with a certain
   IP address space.

   The devices at the customer premises network indicate their choice of
   service provider and the NAS chooses the IP address from the
   appropriate service provider's pool.  In many cases, the address is
   assigned not by the NAS but by the AAA server that is managed fully
   by the service provider.

   This simplifies the management of the DSL access network as it is not
   always necessary to configure each DSL access line with the service
   provider's identity.  The service provider is chosen dynamically by
   the CPE device.  This is typically known as "dynamic Internet Service
   Provider selection".  The AAA function is usually overloaded to
   perform dynamic ISP selection.

   If the CPE device uses a PPP based protocol (PPP or PPPoE), the ISP
   is chosen by mapping the username field of a CHAP response to a
   provider.

   If the CPE uses DHCP, the 'client-id' field of the DHCP-discover or
   DHCP-request packet is mapped to the provider.

10.1.3.1  Selection as Part of the DHCP protocol or an Attribute of DSL
         Access Line

   The ISP selection, therefore the IP address pool, can be conveyed
   based on the DHCP protocol exchange (as explained earlier), or by
   associating the DSL access line to the service provider before the
   PANA authentication begins.  When any of these schemes is used, the
   IP address used during PANA authentication (PRPA) is the ultimate IP
   address and it does not have to be changed upon successful
   authorization.

10.1.3.2  Selection as Part of the PANA Authentication

   The ISP selection of the client can be explicitly conveyed during the
   PANA authentication.  In that case, the client can be assigned a
   temporary IP address (PRPA) prior to PANA authentication.  This IP
   address might be obtained via DHCP with a lease reasonably long to
   complete PANA authentication, or via the zeroconf technique
   [I-D.ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal].  In either case, successful PANA
   authentication signalling prompts the client to obtain a new (long
   term) IP address via DHCP.  This new IP address (POPA) replaces the
   previously allocated temporary IP address.

10.2  Wireless LAN Example

   This section describes how PANA can be used on WLANs.  In most common
   WLAN deployments the IP addresses are dynamically configured.
   Therefore this section does not cover the scenarios where the IP
   address is statically configured.  There are two models depending on
   which layer security is bootstrapped from PANA authentication,
   link-layer or IP-layer.  When PANA authentication is used for
   bootstrapping IP-layer security, link-layer security is not
   necessarily to exist even after PANA authentication.  Instead,
   IPsec-based data traffic protection is bootstrapped from PANA.  The
   PAA can indicate the PaC as to whether link-layer or IP-layer
   protection is needed, by including a Protection-Capability AVP in
   PANA-Bind-Request message.  In both cases, the most common deployment
   would be illustrated in Figure 10, where EP is typically co-located
   with AP (access point) when PANA is used for bootstrapping link-layer
   security or with AR when PANA is used for bootstrapping IP-layer
   security.

10.2.1  PANA with Bootstrapping IPsec

   In this model, data traffic is protected by using IPsec tunnel mode
   SA and an IP address is used as the device identifier of the PaC (see
   Section 5 for details).  Some or all of AP, DHCPv4 Server (including
   PRPA DHCPv4 Server and IPsec-TIA DHCPv4 Server), DHCPv6 Server, PAA
   and EP may be co-located in a single device.  EP is always co-located
   with AR and may be co-located with PAA.  When EP and PAA are not
   co-located, PAA-EP protocol is used for communication between PAA and
   EP.

   Note that for all of the cases described in this section, a PBR
   (PANA-Bind-Request) and PBA (PANA-Bind-Answer) exchange in PANA
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] should occur after installing the authorization
   parameter to the AR, so that IKE can be performed immediately after
   the PANA authentication is successfully completed.  The PAA can
   obtain the required device identifer (i.e., the IPsec-TOA in this
   case) to be installed on the AR from the IP header of a PANA message
   sent by the PaC before sending the PBR.  However, when the PBR/PBA
   exchange fails, the authorization parameters already installed on the
   AR must be immediately revoked to avoid unauthorized access.

10.2.1.1  IPv4

   Case A: IPsec-TIA obtained by using DHCPv4

      In this case, the IPsec-TIA and IPsec-TOA are the same as the
      PRPA, and all configuration information including the IP address
      is obtained by using DHCPv4 [RFC2131].  No POPA is configured.
      Case A is the simplest compared to other ones and might be used in
      a network where IP address depletion attack on DHCP is not a
      significant concern.  The PRPA needs to be a routable address
      unless NAT is performed on AR.

   Case B: IPsec-TIA obtained by using IKE

      In this case, the PRPA is obtained by using DHCPv4 and used as the
      IPsec-TOA.  The POPA is obtained by using IKE (via a Configuration
      Payload exchange or equivalent) and used as the IPsec-TIA.  An
      example sequence for Case B is shown in Figure 12.

   Case C: IPsec-TIA obtained by using RFC3456

      Like Case B, the PRPA is obtained by using DHCPv4.  The difference
      is that the POPA (eventually used as IPsec-TIA) and other
      configuration parameter are configured by running DHCPv4 over a
      special IPsec tunnel mode SA [RFC3456].  Note that the PRPA DHCPv4
      Server and IPsec-TIA DHCPv4 Server may be co-located on the same
      node.

10.2.1.2  IPv6

   In the case of IPv6, the IPsec-TOA (PRPA) is the IPv6 link-local
   address.  IPsec-TIA (POPA) is obtained by using IKE (via a
   Configuration Payload exchange or equivalent).  Other configuration
   information may be obtained in the same Configuration Payload
   exchange or may be obtained by running an additional DHCPv6.

10.2.2  PANA with Bootstrapping WPA/IEEE 802.11i

   In this model, PANA is used for authentication and authorization, and
   link-layer ciphering is used for access control.  Successful PANA
   authentication enables link-layer ciphering which is based on PSK
   (Pre-Shared Key) mode of WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) [WPA] or IEEE
   802.11i [802.11i].  In this document, the key shared between a
   station and an AP is referred to as the PMK (Pair-wise Master Key).
   The PMK is derived from the EAP AAA-Key as a result of successful
   PANA authentication.  In this model, MAC addresses are used as the
   device identifiers in PANA.

   This model allows the separation of PAA from EPs(APs).  A typical
   purpose of using this model is to reduce AP management cost by
   allowing physical separation of RADIUS/Diameter client from access
   points, where AP management can be a significant issue when deploying
   a large number of access points.  Additionally, this centralized AAA
   framework enhances mobility-related performance (inter-AP but

   intra-PAA mobility does not require additional PANA executions).

   By bootstrapping PSK mode of WPA and IEEE 802.11i from PANA it is
   also possible to improve wireless LAN security by providing protected
   disconnection procedure at L3.

   This model does not require any change in the current WPA and IEEE
   802.11i specifications.  This also means that PANA doesn't provide
   any link-layer security features beyond those already provided for in
   WPA and IEEE 802.11i.

   The IEEE 802.11 specification [802.11] allows Class 1 data frames to
   be received in any state.  Also, IEEE 802.11i [802.11i] optionally
   allows higher-layer data traffic to be received and processed on the
   IEEE 802.1X Uncontrolled Ports.  This feature allows processing
   IP-based traffic (such as ARP, IPv6 neighbor discovery, DHCP, and
   PANA) on IEEE 802.1X Uncontrolled Port prior to client
   authentication.

   Until the PaC is successfully authenticated, only a selected type of
   IP traffic is allowed over the IEEE 802.1X Uncontrolled Port.  Any
   other IP traffic is dropped at the AP without being forwarded to the
   DS (Distribution System).  Upon successful PANA authentication, the
   traffic switches to the controlled port.  Host configuration,
   including obtaining an (potentially new) IP address, takes place on
   this port.  Usual DHCP-based, and also in the case of IPv6 stateless
   autoconfiguration, mechanism is available to the PaC.  After this
   point, the rest of the IP traffic, including PANA exchanges, are
   processed on the controlled port.

   When a PaC does not have a PMK for the AP, the following procedure is
   taken:

   1.  The PaC associates with the AP.

   2.  The PaC configures a PRPA by using DHCP (in the case of IPv4) or
       configures a link-local address (in the case of IPv6), and then
       runs PANA.

   3.  Upon successful authentication, the PaC obtains a separate PMK
       for each AP controlled by the PAA.

   4.  The AP initiates IEEE 802.11i 4-way handshake to establish a PTK
       (Pair-wise Transient Key) with the PaC, by using the PMK.

   5.  The PaC obtains a POPA by using any method that the client
       normally uses.

10.2.3  Capability Discovery

   When a PaC is a mobile, there may be multiple APs available in its
   vicinity.  Each AP are connected to one of the following types of
   access networks.

   a) Free access network

      There is no IEEE 802.1X or PANA authentication in this access
      network.

   b) PANA-secured network

      There is PANA authentication in this access network.

   c) IEEE 802.1X-secured network

      There is IEEE 802.1X authentication in this access network.

   Type (c) is distinguished from others by checking the capability
   information advertised in IEEE 802.11 Beacon frames (IEEE 802.11i
   defines RSN Information Element for this purpose).  Types (a) and (b)
   are not distinguishable until the PaC associates with the AP, get an
   IP address, and engage in PANA discovery.  The default PaC behavior
   would be to act as if this is a free network and attempt DHCP.  This
   would be detected by the access network and trigger unsolicited PANA
   discovery.  A type (b) network would send a PANA-Start-Request to the
   client and block general purpose data traffic.  This helps the client
   discover whether the network is type (a) or type (b).  Or if the PaC
   is pre-provisioned with the information that this is a PANA enabled
   network, it can attempt PAA discovery immediately.  The PaC behavior
   after connecting to an AP of type (b) network is described in Section
   10.2, Section 10.2.1 and Section 10.2.2.

Appendix A.  Other Possible Cases for PANA with Bootstrapping IPsec in
            Wireless LAN

   This section describes other possible cases for PANA with
   Bootstrapping IPsec in wireless LAN environments.

Appendix A.1  IPv4

   Case D: IPsec-TIA obtained by using RFC3118

      In this case, the POPA is configured and used as both IPsec-TIA
      and IPsec-TOA.  The IPsec-TIA is assigned by using RFC3118
      (authenticated DHCP) [RFC3118] before running IKE.  The PaC
      unconfigures the PRPA immediately after the IPsec-TIA is obtained.
      The DHCP-PSK needed for authenticated DHCP is distributed from the
      PAA to the POPA DHCPv4 server by using the method specified in
      [I-D.yegin-eap-boot-rfc3118].  The PRPA is assigned by using
      DHCPv4 and may be assigned with a short lease period in order to
      provide some level of robustness against IP address depletion
      attack.  The IPsec-TIA is bound to an IPsec SA by using specifying
      the IPsec-TIA as the SA Identification in IKEv1 phase II or IKEv2
      CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange as specified in [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].
      Once the IPsec-TIA is obtained, the PUR (PANA-Update-Request) and
      PUA (PANA-Update-Answer) exchange is performed with using the
      obtained IPsec-TIA in order to inform the PAA of the update of the
      IP address of the PaC.  The IKE procedure should occur after the
      PANA-Update exchange.

      Note that different DHCP servers may be used for obtaining the
      PRPA and the POPA, when the PRPA address space and POPA address
      space are under different administrative domains.

   Case A: IPsec-TIA obtained by using DHCPv6

      This case is similar to Case A in IPv4, except that a link-local
      address is used as the PRPA and IPsec-TOA, and that the DHCPv6
      procedure can occur at any time after link-layer association and
      before IKE.

      This case is not recommended since there is an ambiguity on
      whether IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for the POPA should run on the
      physical interface or inside the IPsec tunnel or both.

   Case B: IPsec-TIA obtained by using IPv6 stateless address
   autoconfiguration

      In this case, the IPsec-TOA (link-local address) and IPsec-TIA
      (global address) are configured through IPv6 stateless address
      autoconfiguration before running IKE.  Other configuration
      information can be obtained by using several methods including
      authenticated DHCPv6, Configuration Payload exchange and DHCPv6
      over IPsec SA.

      This case is not recommended for the same reason as Case A of
      IPv6.
