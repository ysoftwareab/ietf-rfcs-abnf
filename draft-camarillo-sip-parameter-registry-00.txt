Abstract

   This document creates an IANA registry for SIP header field, SIP URI
   and SIPS URI parameters. It also lists the already existing
   parameters to be used as initial values for that registry.

Internet Draft                    SIP                  December 19, 2002


1 Introduction

   RFC3261 [1] allows new header field, SIP URI and SIPS URI parameters
   to be defined. However, RFC3261 omitted an IANA registry for them.
   This document creates such a registry.

2 Use of the Registry

   Any RFC that defines a new header field, SIP URI or SIPS URI
   parameter, MUST include an IANA registration for it, as described
   below. Note that this includes RFCs that define parameters for P-
   headers.

3 IANA Considerations

   Section 27 of RFC 3261 [1] creates an IANA registry for method names,
   header field names, warning codes, status codes, and option tags.
   This specification instructs the IANA to create two new sub-
   registries under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters:

        o Header Field Parameters

        o SIP/SIPS URI Parameters

3.1 Header Field Parameters Sub-Registry

   The majority of the SIP header fields can be extended by defining new
   parameters. New SIP header field parameters are registered by the
   IANA when they are published in an RFC. The IANA considerations
   section of the RFC MUST include the following information, which
   appears in the IANA registry along with the RFC number of the
   publication.

        o Name of the parameter.

        o Header fields in which the parameter can appear.

   Parameters that can appear in different header fields MAY have the
   same name. However, parameters that can appear in the same header
   field MUST have different names.

   Table 1 contains the initial values for this sub-registry.


3.2 SIP and SIPS URI Parameters Sub-Registry

   New SIP and SIPS URI parameters are registered by the IANA when they
   are published in standards track RFCs. The IANA considerations

4 TODO list

   Add media feature tags from draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-07.txt. That
   draft will be revised next week, and based on that revision we will
   add the parameters to the registry. We may have to define a prefix
   for some of them.

Internet Draft                    SIP                  December 19, 2002


   Check timeframe of draft-garcia-sipping-3gpp-p-headers-02.txt. It
   will probably have to define its own entries in this registry.

   Check whether there are more specs that define parameters in addition
   to RFC 3261, draft-ietf-sip-compression-02.txt, draft-ietf-sip-
   symmetric-response-00.txt, draft-ietf-sip-callerprefs-07.txt and
   draft-garcia-sipping-3gpp-p-headers-02.txt.
