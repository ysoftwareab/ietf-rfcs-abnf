Abstract

   Presence Information Data Format(PIDF) [1] and Rich Presence
   Extensions to the Presence Information Data Format(RPID) [2] have
   definition for a lot of presence information.  Notifier can filter
   the presence information to subscriber according to local policy .
   But the notifier may not support all the presence information.  It is
   a matter how to inform the subscriber the allowed, forbidden and
   unsupported presence information.  This document provides a method to
   solve this problem by introducing the concept of Resource Information

Internet-Draft               A Method of RIL               February 2006


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3265 [3] described a general framework by which notification of
   event, and the rules of creating SUBSCRIBE request and NOTIFY
   request.  SUBSCRIBE applies to subscription and NOTIFY applies to
   notification when the resource state has changed.

   Presence is an important part of SIMPLE.  PIDF [1] and RPID [2]
   defined a lot of presence information.  One user can achieve the
   presence information of other users by sending SUBSCRIBE request.

   Whereas, the presence information has privacy, notifier can have a
   local policy to control who can have what part of presence
   information.  This policy can be configured through Web, Terminal
   User Interface etc.

   Another issue to be considered is that the Notifier MAY NOT support
   all the presence information defined by PIDF [1] and RPID [2] for the
   reason of physical device, environment, or the notifier itself etc.

   Currently, if the notifier provide partial presence information in
   PIDF, the subscriber can not know the exact reason for the missing
   part, whether it is not supported, temporarily not available or
   forbidden to expose.

   This document introduces a method to solve the above issues by
   allowing NOTIFY to deliver RIL(Resource Information List) to
   subscriber.

3.  Definitions

   USRIL: Unsupported Resource Information List, base on a set which
   describe all presence element that the RFC and Draft supported, but
   in this set notifier can not support some presence element, the
   unsupported part of this set is called USRIL.  USRIL can be some
   single presence element or some presence element set or the both.

   ASPE: Allowed Subscribe Presence Element, notifier perform local
   policy to decide which presence element can be subscribed, and with
   the subscriber wish to obtain presence element together making "and"
   operation, that is called ASPE.  ASPE can be some single presence
   element or some presence element set or the both.  But purpose to
   make ASPE simple, ASPE may include a subset of FSPE.

   FSPE: Forbidden Subscribe Presence Element, notifier perform local
   policy to decide which presence element can not be subscribed, and
   with the subscriber wish to obtain presence element together making
   "and" operation, that is called FSPE.  FSPE can be some single
   presence element or some presence element set or the both.

   FASPE: Final Allowed Subscribe Presence Element, subscriber make
   "and" operation by ASPE and FSPE.  In the FASPE exclude any subset of
   FSPE and USRIL.

   RIL: Resource Information List, include ASPE, FSPE and USRIL.

4.  Negotiation of RIL

   This specification uses the SIP option tag mechanism for negotiating
   support for the extension defined herein.  Refer to RFC3261 [5] for
   the normative description of processing of the "Supported" and
   "Require" header fields and the 421 (Extension Required) response
   code.  If subscriber want to get RIL in the subsequent NOTIFY
   request, MUST include the "Supported" or "Require" header field with
   "RIL" in a SUBSCRIBE request.

   When SUBSCRIBE request includes "RIL" in the "Supported" header
   field, if notifier supports RIL then it MUST include "Supported"
   header field with "RIL" in the 2xx response, otherwise it MUST NOT
   include "RIL" in the "Supported" header field.  When SUBSCRIBE
   request includes "RIL" in the "Require" header field, if notifier
   doesn't support then according to RFC3261 it returns the 421 response
   code.  If SUBSCRIBE request or refreshing SUBSCRIBE request doesn't
   include "RIL" in "Supported" or "Require" header field, it means that
   subscriber doesn't want to obtain RIL, the notifier MUST NOT insert
   RIL in the subsequence NOTIFY message.

5.  Definition of RIL

   RIL is an XML document [7] that MUST be well-formed and MUST be valid
   according to schemas, including extension schemas, available to the
   validater and applicable to the XML document.  The RIL documents MUST
   be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  The namespace
   identifier for elements defined by this specification is a URN [8],
   using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [9] and extended by
   [10].  This urn is: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ril.

   The MIME type for the RIL document is "application/ril+xml".

   The root element of the RIL is <ril>.  The <ril> element contains the
   namespace definition mentioned above.  The <ril> element contains at
   most one <aspe> element and one <fspe> element and one <usril>
   element.

   The <aspe>, <fspe> and <usril> elements have meaning as ASPE, FSPE
   and USRIL.  Every element of the three have zero or more <set>
   elements.  The value of <set> is the elements defined in the PIDF
   [1], RPID [2], and other specification defines presence elements.

   The following example selects the <basic> element defined in the PIDF
   [1].  This results in the selection of the <basic> element as well as
   all the ancestors.  I.e. <status> and <tuple>.

   <set>/presence/tuple/status/basic</set>.

6.  Node Behavior

6.1.  Description of Notifier Behavior

   RIL is conveyed as an independent message body in NOTIFY message.
   Certainly, the NOTIFY message body may only contain RIL.

   The RIL may be conveyed in the following scenarios:

      1) Initial Subscription: The Notifier may contain RIL in the first
      NOTIFY, just after the subscription is accepted.

      2) Presence notification: The Notifier may convey RIL in the
      NOTIFY delivered during subscription to provide the latest RIL
      especially when the local policy for presence information
      publication is changed.

      3) Subscription refresh: The Notifier may also convey the latest
      RIL in NOTIFY when the Subscriber refreshs the subscription if the
      RIL is changed.

6.2.  Description of Subscriber Behavior

   RFC 3265 [3] describes the manner of obtaining presence information,
   one is immediate fetch manner, another is persistent subscription
   manner.  Subscriber can obtain the currently RIL through any of them
   if required.

   Subscriber can directly get USRIL and FSPE from RIL in NOTIFY
   message, and also can make use of intersection operation to obtain
   FASPE by ASPE , FSPE and USRIL.

   The rule to calculate FASPE is as follow:

      1) If ASPE is NULL then FASPE is NULL.

      2) If ASPE and FSPE is not NULL then FASPE equal ASPE not belong
      FSPE part.

      3) If ASPE and USRIL is not NULL then FASPE equal ASPE not belong
      USRIL part.

      4) If ASPE, FSPE and USRIL is not NULL then FASPE equal ASPE not
      belong FSPE and USRIL part

7.  Examples

   If a notifier supports all the presence element, in the other words
   RIL excludes USRIL, then RIL can be described by [4].  This example
   assumes subscriber called Bob, notifier called Alice.  Alice
   supported all the presence information as follow:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf,
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid

   Bob is interested only in part of Alice's presence element such as:
   status, contact, activities, mood, place-type

   1)  Bob send SUBSCRIBE message to Alice with "RIL" in Supported
       header field.

   4)  During the subscription, Alice wants to change the local policy,
       the new local policy allows more presence information as follows

8.  Security Considerations

   It is important to user that include RIL in NOTIFY message body.  As
   a result, it is especially important that messages containing this
   extension be authenticated and authorized.  Authentication can be
   achieved using the Digest Authentication mechanism described in RFC
   3261 [5].  The authorization decision is made based on the
   permissions that the resource (notifier) has given to the watcher.
   An example of such authorization policy can be found in [6].

   The RIL may concerns by revealing sensitive policy information, that
   the notifier may not want to provide to subscriber.  This
   specification only provide a way to transfer RIL, whether providing
   this information may according to the notifyer's policy.  The
   notifier can follow the negotiation mechanism in this specification
   to decide to privide RIL or not.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  New SIP Option Tag: RIL

   This section defines a new option tag for the registry established by
   section 27.1 of RFC3261 [5].

   Option Tag Name: RIL

   Description: Resource Information List.

   Published specification: RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor: replace xxxx
   with the RFC number of this document when published]]

10.2.  New MIME type for RIL

   MIME Media Type Name: application

   MIME subtype name: ril+xml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: charset

   See RFC3023 [11] for a discussion of the charset parameter on XML-
   derived MIME types.  Since this MIME type is used exclusively in SIP,
   the use of UTF-8 encoding is strongly encouraged.

   Encoding considerations: 8-bit text

   Security considerations: Security considerations specific to uses of
   this this MIME type are discussed in RFC xxxx [[Note to RFC editor:
   replace xxxx with the RFC number of this document when published]].
   RFC1874 [12] and RFC3023 [11] discuss security issues common to all
   uses of XML.

10.3.  URN Sub-Namespace

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ril

   Description: This is the XML namespace URI for XML elements defined
   by [RFCXXXX] to describe information about refreshing many
   subscriptions by a message.  It is used in the application/ril+xml
   body type.
