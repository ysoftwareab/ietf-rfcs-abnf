       Generic YANG Data Model for the Management of Operations,
Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Protocols that use Connectionless
                             Communications
               draft-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-14

Abstract

   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless
   Operations Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols.  The data
   model is defined using the YANG in RFC7950 data modeling language.
   It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM
   constructs for connectionless protocols.  The base model presented
   here can be extended to include technology specific details.  This is
   leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and support both nested
   OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same
   levels through a unified interface) and interacting OAM workflows
   (i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified
   interface).

1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1.  Monitor networks communication (Reachability Verification,
       Continuity Check).

   2.  Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and localization).

   3.  Monitor Performance

   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [RFC7276].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks.
   Over the years, different technologies have developed similar tools
   for similar purposes.

   The different OAM tools may support connection-oriented technologies
   or connectionless technologies.  In connection-oriented technologies,
   a connection is established prior to the transmission of data.  After
   connection is established, no additional control information such as
   signaling or operations and maintenance information is required to
   transmit the data.  In connectionless technologies, data is typically
   sent between end points without prior arrangement, but control
   information is required to identify destination.[G.800][RFC7276].
   Note that the YANG Data model for OAM protcols using connection-
   oriented communications is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connection-oriented-oam-model].

   This document defines a base YANG Data model for connectionless OAM
   protocols.  The data model is defined using the YANG [RFC7950] data
   modeling language.  This generic YANG model for connectionless OAM
   only includes configuration data and state data.  It can be used in
   conjunction with data retrieval method model described in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods], which focuses on
   data retrieval procedures such as RPC.  However it also can be used
   independently of this data retrieval method model.

3.  Overview of the Connectionless OAM Model

   The model augments "/networks/network/node" path defined in the ietf-
   network module [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] with 'test-point-
   locations' grouping defined in Section 3.5.  The network node in
   "/networks/network/node" path are used to describe the network
   hierarchies and the inventory of nodes contained in a network.

   Under the 'test-point-locations' grouping, each test point location
   is chosen based on 'tp-location-type' leaf which when chosen, leads
   to a container that includes a list of 'test-point-locations'.

   Each 'test-point-locations' list includes a 'test-point-location-
   info' grouping.  The 'test-point-location-info' grouping includes:

   o  'tp-technology' grouping,

   o  'tp-tools' grouping,

   o  and 'connectionless-oam-tps' grouping.

   The groupings of 'tp-address' and 'tp-address-ni' are kept out of
   'test- point-location-info' grouping to make it addressing agnostic
   and allow varied composition.  Depending upon the choice of the 'tp-
   location-type' (determined by the 'tp-address-ni'), the containers
   differ in its composition of 'test-point-locations' while the 'test-
   point-location-info', is a common aspect of every 'test-point-
   locations'.

   The 'tp-address-ni' grouping is used to describe the corresponding
   network instance.  The 'tp-technology' grouping indicate OAM
   technology details.  The 'connectionless-oam-tps' grouping is used to
   describe the relationship of one test point with other test points.
   The 'tp-tools' grouping describe the OAM tools supported.

   In addition, at the top of the model, there is an 'cc-oper-data'
   container for session statistics.  Grouping is also defined for

   common session statistics and these are only applicable for proactive
   OAM sessions.

3.1.  TP Address

   With connectionless OAM protocols, the TP address can be one of the
   following types:

   o  MAC address [RFC6136] at link layer for TPs

   o  IPv4 or IPv6 address at IP layer for TPs

   o  TP-attribute identifying a TP associated with an application layer
      function

   o  System-id to represent the device or node.
      [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang]

   To define a forwarding treatment of a test packet, the 'tp-address'
   grouping needs to be associated with additional parameters, e.g.,
   DSCP for IP or EXP (renamed to Traffic Classic in [RFC5462]) for
   MPLS.  In generic connectionless OAM YANG model, these parameters are
   not explicit configured.  The model user can add corresponding
   parameters according to their requirements.

3.2.  Tools

   The different OAM tools may be used in one of two basic types of
   activation: proactive and on-demand.  The proactive OAM refers to OAM
   actions which are carried out continuously to permit proactive
   reporting of fault.  The proactive OAM method requires persistent
   configuration.  The on-demand OAM refers to OAM actions which are
   initiated via manual intervention for a limited time to carry out
   diagnostics.  The on-demand OAM method requires only transient
   configuration.[RFC7276] [G.8013].  In connectionless OAM, 'session-
   type' grouping is defined to indicate which kind of activation will
   be used by the current session.

   In connectionless OAM, the tools attribute is used to describe a
   toolset for fault detection and isolation.  And it can serve as a
   constraint condition when the base model be extended to specific OAM
   technology.  For example, to fulfill the ICMP PING configuration, the
   "../coam:continuity-check" leaf should be set to "true", and then the
   lime base model should be augmented with ICMP PING specific details.

3.3.  OAM neighboring test points

   As typical network communication stacks have a multi-layer
   architecture, the set of associated OAM protocols may similarly have
   a multi-layer structure; each communication layer in the stack may
   have its own OAM protocol [RFC7276] that may also be linked to a
   specific administrative domain.  Management of these OAM protocols
   will necessitate associated test points in the nodes accessible by
   appropriate management domains.  Accordingly, a given network
   interface may present several test points.

   OAM neighboring test points are referred to a list of neighboring
   test points in adjacent layers up and down the stack for the same
   interface that are related to the current test point.  This allows
   users to easily navigate between related neighboring layers to
   efficiently troubleshoot a defect.  In this model, the 'position'
   leaf defines the relative position of the neighboring test point
   corresponding to the current test point, and is provided to allow
   correlation of faults at different locations.  If there is one
   neighboring test point placed before the current test point, the
   'position' leaf is set to -1.  If there is one neighboring test point
   placed after the current test point, the 'position' leaf is set to 1.
   If there is no neighboring test point placed before or after the
   current test point, the 'position' leaf is set to 0.

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations Information
   (i.e., test-point-location-info grouping).  It Provide details of
   Test Point Location using 'tp-technology','tp-tools' grouping, 'oam-
   neighboring-tps' grouping defined above.

3.5.  Test Point Locations

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations.  'tp-location-
   type 'leaf is used to define locations types, for example 'ipv4-
   location-type', 'ipv6-location-type', etc.  Container is defined
   under each location type containing list keyed to test point address,
   Test Point Location Information defined in section above, and network
   instance name(e.g., VRF instance name) if required.

3.6.  Path Discovery Data

   This is a generic grouping for path discovery data model that can be
   retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPC operations.
   Path discovery data output from methods, includes 'src-test-point'
   container, 'dst-test-point' container, 'sequence-number'leaf, 'hop-
   cnt'leaf, session statistics of various kinds, path verification and
   path trace related information.  Path discovery includes data to be

   list'list which includes information like 'timestamp'grouping, '
   ingress-intf-name ', ' egress-intf-name ' and 'app-meta-data'.  The
   path discovery data model is made generic enough to allow different
   methods of data retrieval.  None of the fields are made mandatory for

5.  Connectionless model applicability

   The "ietf-connectionless-oam" model defined in this document provides
   a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for
   connectionless protocols.  This model can be further extended to
   include technology specific details, e.g., adding new data nodes with
   technology specific functions and parameters into proper anchor
   points of the base model, so as to develop a technology-specific
   connectionless OAM model.

   This section demonstrates the usability of the connectionless YANG
   OAM data model to various connectionless OAM technologies, e.g., BFD,
   LSP ping.  Note that, in this section, several snippets of
   technology-specific model extensions are presented for illustrative
   purposes.  The complete model extensions should be worked on in
   respective protocol working groups.

5.1.  BFD Extension

   RFC 7276 defines BFD as a connection-oriented protocol.  It is used
   to monitor a connectionless protocol in the case of basic BFD for IP.

Internet-Draft        Connectionless OAM YANG model         October 2017


5.1.1.  Augment Method

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to cover BFD technology.  For this purpose, a set of
   extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and test-
   point attributes extension.

   Note that a dedicated BFD YANG data model [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] is also
   standardized.  Augmentation of the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   with BFD specific details provides an alternative approach that
   provides a unified view of management information across various OAM
   protocols.  The BFD specific details can be the grouping defined in
   the BFD model avoiding duplication of effort.

5.1.1.1.  Technology type extension

   No BFD technology type has been defined in the "ietf-connectionless-
   oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is required in the
   model Extension.

   The snippet below depicts an example of adding the "bfd" type as an
   augment to the ietf-connectionless-oam" model:

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
   +"coam:test-point-locations/coam:technology"
   {
       leaf bfd{
      type string;
     }
   }

5.1.1.2.  Test point attributes extension

   To support BFD technology, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can be
   extended by adding specific parameters into the "test-point-
   locations" list and/or adding a new location type such as "BFD over
   MPLS TE" under "location-type".

5.1.1.2.1.  Define and insert new nodes into corresponding test-point-
            location

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, multiple "test-point-
   location" lists are defined under the "location-type" choice node.
   Therefore, to derive a model for some BFD technologies ( such as ip
   single-hop, ip multi-hops, etc), data nodes for BFD specific details
   need to be added into corresponding "test-point-locations" list.  In

Internet-Draft        Connectionless OAM YANG model         October 2017


   this section, some groupings which are defined in [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]
   are reused as follow:

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to support "BFD IP single-hop":

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
   {
           container session-cfg {
             description "BFD IP single-hop session configuration";
             list sessions {
               key "interface dest-addr";
               description "List of IP single-hop sessions";
               leaf interface {
                 type if:interface-ref;
                 description
                   "Interface on which the BFD session is running.";
               }
               leaf dest-addr {
                 type inet:ip-address;
                 description "IP address of the peer";
               }
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-echo-cfg-parms;
             }
           }
   }

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD IP multi-hop, BFD over MPLS, etc.

5.1.1.2.2.  Add new location-type cases

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, If there is no appropriate
   "location type" case that can be extended, a new "location-type" case
   can be defined and inserted into the "location-type" choice node.

   Therefore, the model user can flexibly add "location-type" to support
   other type of test point which are not defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  In this section, a new "location-type"
   case is added and some groupings that are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] are reused as follows:

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to support "BFD over MPLS-TE":

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/coam:location-type"{
    case te-location{
     list test-point-location-list{
      key "tunnel-name";
      leaf tunnel-name{
       type leafref{
    path "/te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te:name";
   }
   description
   "point to a te instance.";
      }
       uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
           uses bfd-mpls:bfd-encap-cfg;
     }
    }
   }

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD over LAG, etc.

5.1.2.  Schema Mount

   Another alternative method is using the schema mount mechanism [I-
   D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount] in the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model.
   Within the "test-point-locations" list, a "root" attribute is defined
   to provide a mount point for models mounted per "test-point-
   locations".  Therefore, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   provide a place in the node hierarchy where other OAM YANG data
   models can be attached, without any special extension in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" YANG data models [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount].
   Note that the limitation of the Schema Mount method is it is not
   allowed to specify certain modules that are required to be mounted
   under a mount point.

   The snippet below depicts the definition of the "root" attribute.

         anydata root {
          yangmnt:mount-point root;
          description
         "Root for models supported per
           test point";
         }

   The following section shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can use schema mount to support BFD technology.

5.1.2.1.  BFD Modules be populated in schema-mount

   To support BFD technology, "ietf-bfd-ip-sh" and "ietf-bfd-ip-mh" YANG
   modules might be populated in the "schema-mounts" container:

5.2.  LSP ping extension

5.2.1.  Augment Method

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to support LSP ping technology.  For this purpose, a
   set of extensions are introduced such as the "technology-type"
   extension and the test-point "attributes" extension.

   Note that a LSP Ping YANG data model
   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] has been standardized.  As with
   BFD, users can choose to use the "ietf-connectioless-oam" as basis
   and augment the "ietf- connectionless-oam" model with LSP Ping
   specific details in the model extension to provide a unified view
   across different technologies.  The LSP Ping specific details can be
   the grouping defined in the LSP ping model to avoid duplication of
   effort.

5.2.1.1.  Technology type extension

   No lsp-ping technology type has been defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is
   required in the model extension.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" with "lsp-ping" type:

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"

   {
      leaf lsp-ping{
      type string;
     }
   }

5.2.1.2.  Test point attributes extension

   To support lsp-ping, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can be
   extended and add lsp-ping specific parameters can be defined and
   under "test-point-locations" list.

   User can reuse the attributes or groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] as follows:

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting the "test-point-
   locations" list with lsp ping attributes:

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"

   provide a place in the node hierarchy where other OAM YANG data
   models can be attached, without any special extension in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" YANG data models [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount].
   Note that the limitation of the Schema Mount method is it is not
   allowed to specify certain modules that are required to be mounted
   under a mount point.

   The snippet below depicts the definition of "root" attribute.

         anydata root {

         }

   The following section shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can use schema mount to support LSP-PING technology.

5.2.2.1.  LSP-PING Modules be populated in schema-mount

   To support LSP-PING technology, "ietf-lspping" YANG module

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:ipv4-
      location-type/cl-oam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/cl-oam:test-
      point-locations/

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:ipv6-
      location-type/cl-oam:test-point-ipv6-location-list/cl-oam:test-
      point-locations/

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:mac-
      location-type/cl-oam:test-point-mac-address-location-list/cl-
      oam:test-point-locations/

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:group-
      as-number-location-type/cl-oam:test-point-as-number-location-list/

      system-id-location-type/cl-oam:test-point-system-info-location-
      list/cl-oam:test-point-locations/

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect OAM
   management system handling of end-to-end OAM and coordination of OAM
   within underlying network layers.  This may lead to inconsistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
