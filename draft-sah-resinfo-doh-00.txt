                    DNS Resolver Information: "doh"
                       draft-sah-resinfo-doh-00

Abstract

   This document defines a name-value pair, "doh", for the "DNS Resolver
   Information Self-publication" protocol described in draft-sah-
   resolver-information.  This name-value pair describes whether the
   resolver acts as a DoH server and, if so, the URI template for it.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.sah-resolver-information] defines a format for information about
   a DNS resolver and protocols to get that information.  Stub resolvers
   and applications that can act as DoH clients [RFC8484] may want to
   know the URI templates used by a resolver that is acting as a DoH
   server.

1.1.  Definitions

   In this document, the term "resolver" without qualification means
   "recursive resolver" as defined in [RFC8499].  Also, the term "stub"
   is used to mean "stub resolver".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Definition of the "doh" Name-value Pair

   The "doh" name has a value of a JSON object.  That object has the
   following name-value pairs.  The "templates" name MUST be present;
   the "domain-to-match" name is OPTIONAL.

   templates:  array of strings.  Each string is a URI template for the
      DoH server.  The array MAY have zero values; if so, this indicates
      that the resolver does not support DoH.  The values MUST NOT be
      empty.

Internet-Draft         Resolver Information "doh"               May 2019


   domain-to-match:  array of strings.  Each string is a fully-qualified
      domain name that is expected to appear in the certificate used for
      TLS.  These names can be used for matching in the TLS handshake if
      the DoH client accesses the DoH server with a template that has an
      IP address.  The array MAY have zero values; if so, this indicates
      that the certificate should only be matched using IP addresses as
      subject names.  The values MUST NOT be empty.

   For example, a pair might look like:

   { "doh":
     { "domain-to-match": [ "resolver.example.net" ],
       "templates: [ "https://resolver.example.net/dns-query{?dns}",
       "https://192.0.1.2/dns-query{?dns}" ]
     }
   }

   As another example, where the TLS certificate is expected to have
   identifiers of IP addresses, not domain names:

   { "doh":
     { "templates: [ "https://192.0.1.2/dns-query{?dns}" ],
       "domain-to-match": [ ]
     }
   }

3.  Use of Data from the "doh" Name-value Pair

   If the "template" array has more than one string, a client can
   consider them all to be of equal value when finding a DoH server
   associated with the resolver.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Entry for the "Registry for DNS Resolver Information"

   This document adds one new entry to the "Registry for DNS Resolver
   Information".

   Name: doh

   Value type: object

   Specification: This document

5.  Security Considerations

   The data in the "doh" object MUST be received from an authoritative
   source, and MUST be authenticated.  Currently, that means either
   using DNSSEC validation if using DNS to get the data, or TLS
   certificate validation if using DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858] or DNS-over-
   HTTPS from the resolver itself.
