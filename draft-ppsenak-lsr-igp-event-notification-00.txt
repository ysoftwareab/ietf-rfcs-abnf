            IS-IS and OSPF Extension for Event Notification
              draft-ppsenak-lsr-igp-event-notification-00

Abstract

   Link-state protocols like IS-IS and OSPF have been designed to
   distribute state information - state of the local adjacencies, state
   of the local prefix reachability, etc.  Each state can have
   additional attributes associated with it, but all the attributes are
   only meaningful while the state exists.

   This document extends link-state IGPs to distribute event
   notifications.  An event notification has a very limited lifetime.
   It is rapidly propagated across the network and leaves no state after
   its lifetime.

1.  Introduction

   Link-state IGP protocols like IS-IS and OSPF are primarily used to
   distribute routing information between routers belonging to a single
   Autonomous System (AS) and to calculate the reachability for IPv4 or
   IPv6 prefixes advertised by the individual nodes inside the AS.  Each

   node advertises the state of its local adjacencies, connected
   prefixes, capabilities, etc.  The collection of these states from all
   the routers inside the area form a link-state database (LSDB) that
   describes the topology of the area and holds additional state
   information about the prefixes, router capabilities, etc.

   Link-state protocols have been designed to distribute state
   information.  More precisely, it's only the existent or steady state
   that is being advertised - local adjacencies in UP sate, local
   prefixes that are reachable, etc.  When the state does not exist
   anymore (e.g., adjacency transition to DOWN state), it is simply
   removed by the advertising node.  Each state can have additional
   attributes associated with it, but all the attributes are only
   meaningful while the state exists.

   There are certain types of events, that do not represent a steady
   state and therefore cannot be advertised, that may be useful for the
   network operation.

   This document introduces the capability in link-state protocols to
   propagate event notifications that have a short and limited lifetime
   and do not introduce a state into IS-IS, OSPFv2, and OSPFv3.  These
   event notifications are referred to as pulses to reflect their short-
   lived nature.  Pulses may be used to advertise many types of events
   including those that are positive or negative in nature and for which
   there is no associated state that is to be maintained by link-state
   protocols.

2.  Use Case

   In this section we present one practical use case of event based
   notification in link-state routing protocols.

   The growth of networks running link-state routing protocol results in
   the addition of more state that presents itself in the form of
   scalability and convergence challenges.  The organization of networks
   into levels/areas and IGP domains helps limit the scope of link-state
   information within certain boundaries.  However, the state related to
   prefix reachability often requires propagation across a multi-area/
   level and/or multi-domain IGP network.

   Techniques such as summarization have been used traditionally to
   address the scale challenges associated with advertising prefix state
   outside of local area/domain.

   However, this results in suppression of the individual prefix state
   that is useful for triggering fast-convergence mechanisms outside of
   the IGPs - e.g., BGP PIC Edge [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].

Internet-Draft           IGP Event Notification                July 2021


   In such a scenario, it is desirable to enable the notification of
   events, such as an individual prefix becoming unreachable, outside of
   the local area/domain and across the network in a manner that does
   not leave behind any persistent state in the link-state database.

3.  Requirements for Pulse Notification

   This section describes the basic requirements of the pulse based
   notification for link-state protocols.

      Pulse Processing - processing of the pulse on the router is
      OPTIONAL.  It's the decision of the receiver of the pulse whether
      the pulse is processed and any action is taken.

      Reliability - the distribution of the pulses MUST be reliable.

      Separation from Link-State - receiving pulses MUST NOT result in
      any update of the link-state topology or in any route calculation.
      Pulse advertisements MUST NOT be sent using existing protocol
      link-state messages.

      Limited Lifetime - pulses are short-lived.  There is no flushing
      or purging mechanism for pulses.  They MUST be destroyed after
      their flooding procedure is complete.

      Limited Retransmissions - pulses MUST be retransmitted, as
      required by the flooding procedure, only for a limited period.

      Not Part of Database Sync - pulses MUST NOT be exchanged as part
      of the initial or post Graceful Restart database synchronization
      between adjacent peers.

4.  IS-IS Pulse PDUs

   Two new IS-IS PDUs are introduced for pulse propagation:

      Flooding Scoped Pulse LSP (FSP-LSP)

      Flooding Scoped Pulse PSNP (FSP-PSNP)

4.1.  IS-IS Flooding Scoped Pulse LSP

   The format of an IS-IS Flooding Scoped Pulse LSP (FSP-LSP) is similar
   to the format of the Flooding Scoped LSP defined in [RFC7356], with
   the following fields being removed:

      FSP-LSP ID: The ID of the FSP-LSP being acknowledged

      Sequence Number: Sequence number of the FSP-LSP being acknowledged

      Checksum: Checksum reported in the FSP-LSP

4.3.  Flooding Scope Update Process Operation

   The Update Process in [ISO10589] is responsible for reliable flooding
   of LSPs.  In the case of FSP-LSPs, the lack of persistence introduces
   some changes in how the Update Process operates.

   Analagous to what is defined in [RFC7356], there is a separate
   instance of the Update Process for each scope supported for FSP-LSPs.
   The circuit(s) on which FSP-LSPs are flooded is limited to those
   circuits that are participating in the given scope.  Consistent
   support of a given flooding scope on a circuit by all routers
   operating on that circuit is required.

   FSP-LSPs are not meant to be retained beyond the minimum time needed
   to process the information and to provide a reasonable opportunity
   for flooding the information to neighbors.  FSP-LSPs are also not



Psenak, et al.           Expires January 6, 2022                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IGP Event Notification                July 2021


   synchronized on adjacency establishment and/or Graceful Restart
   [RFC8706].  For this reason, an FSP Complete Sequence Number PDU is
   NOT REQUIRED.  Flooding of an FSP-LSP on a circuit ceases after a
   configurable number of retries.  Default number of retries is
   RECOMMENDED to be 3.

   Receipt of an FSP-PSNP with a matching Flooding Scope Pulse LSP Entry
   serves as an acknowledgment of receipt of an FSP-LSP on that circuit.

   FSP-LSPs SHOULD be retained in the FSP Scope Specific LSDB for
   ZeroAgeLifetime (60 seconds).  This is done to support reliable
   flooding of the FSP-LSP and to minimize the possibility of
   reprocessing a previously received FSP-LSP.

4.3.1.  FSP-LSP Generation Procedures

   Although sequence numbers in FSP-LSPs are less important than in
   traditional LSPs since FSP-LSPs are not retained for a significant
   period and are not purged, they are still useful to identity a newer
   version of a given FSP-LSP.  Nodes which originate FSP-LSPs MUST
   remember the last sequence number used for a given FSP-LSP and
   increment the sequence number when generating a new version.

   FSP-LSP generation SHOULD utilize the "next" FSP-LSP ID each time new
   pulse information needs to be advertised i.e., if the most recent
   FSP-LSP ID used was A-00.n, the next set of pulse information SHOULD
   be advertised using FSP-LSP.ID A-00.n+1.  This minimizes the
   possibility of confusion if other routers in the network have not yet
   removed A-00.n from their LSPDB.

4.3.2.  FSP-LSP Acknowledgement Behavior

   Determining whether a received FSP-LSP is newer than a previously
   received copy follows the rules defined for LSPs defined in
   [ISO10589].

   Received FSP-LSPs which are either newer or the same as an existing
   entry in the LSPDB are acknowledged using FSP-PSNPs.

   Received FSP-LSPs which are older than existing entries in the LSPDB
   are ignored.  The sender of the FSP-LSP will in any case cease
   flooding such an FSP-LSP after a modest number of retries.

5.  IS-IS Summary Component Reachability Loss Pulse TLV

   IS-IS Summary Component Reachability Loss Pulse (SCRLP) TLV MAY be
   sent in an FSP-LSP.  It is used by the IS-IS L1/L2 routers or by an
   IS-IS Autonomous Boundary Router (ASBR) that is performing prefix

         D-flag: Same as described in section 4.1. of [RFC5305].

         F-flag: If unset, then the Summary Prefix and Component
         Prefix(es) are IPv4 prefixes.  If set, then the Summary Prefix
         and Component Prefix(es) are IPv6 prefixes.

         The remaining bits are reserved for future use.  They MUST be
         set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

      R bits: reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero on
      transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

      MT ID: Multitopology Identifier as defined in [RFC5120].  Note
      that the value 0 is legal.

      Summ-Pfx Length + Flag: 1 octet

         Summ-Pfx Length: Length of the Summary Prefix in bits.  Valid
         values are (0-31) when F-flag is unset, (0-127) when F-flag is
         set.

         S-bit: MUST be set when Sub-TLVs are present for Summary
         Prefix, otherwise MUST NOT be set.

      Summary Prefix: variable.  IPv4 or IPv6 Summary Prefix.

      Sub-TLV-length: 1 octet.  Number of octets used by Summary Prefix
      Sub-TLVs.  Only present when S-bit is set.

      Optional Sub-TLVs: No Sub-TLVs are defined by this document.

      Comp-Pfx Length + Flag: 1 octet

         Comp-Pfx Len.: 1 octet.  Length of the Component Prefix in
         bits.  Valid values are (1-32) when F-flag is unset, (1-128)
         when F-flag is set.  Comp-Pfx Len MUST be > Summ-Pfx Length.

         S-bit: MUST be set when Sub-TLVs are present for Component
         Prefix, otherwise MUST NOT be set.

      Component Prefix: variable.  IPv4 or IPv6 Component Prefix.

      Sub-TLV-length: 1 octet.  Number of octets used by Component
      Prefix sub-TLVs.  Only present when S-bit is set.

Internet-Draft           IGP Event Notification                July 2021


   When an IS-IS L1/L2 router or an IS-IS Autonomous Boundary Router
   (ASBR) is performing prefix summarization and it loses the
   reachability to one or more previously reachable component(s) of the
   summary-prefix inside the area or domain for which the summarization
   is done, it MAY originate the SCRLP TLV to inform routers in other
   areas or domains about such summary component-prefix reachability
   loss.

   An originator of the SCRLP TLV chooses to advertise it in FSP-LSP
   with L1 flooding scope and/or FSP-LSP with L2 flooding scope.

   The IS-IS SCRLP TLV MAY be leaked between levels on L1/L2 router,
   subject to local policy of such L1/L2 router.

   IS-IS SCRLP TLV MUST NOT be leaked inside the area if the summary
   prefix carried in IS-IS SCRLP TLV (Summary Prefix, Summ-Pfx Length)
   is advertised from such area by L1/L2 router.

   When the router receives the SCRLP TLV it MAY choose to inform the
   BGP component on the router.  BGP component on the router MAY trigger
   BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC) as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic] as a result of such notification.

   The mechanism on how the IS-IS passes the information from IS-IS
   SCRLP TLV to the BGP component or how the BGP component uses this
   information to trigger the PIC is implementation-specific and outside
   of the scope of this specification.

   The IS-IS SCRLP TLV may be used by other applications on the
   receiving node that wish to be notified about the loss of summary
   component-prefix reachability.  The details of such usage are outside
   of the scope of this specification.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  New IS-IS PDU Types

   This document includes the definition of two new PDU types that are
   reflected in the "IS-IS PDU Registry":

       Value  Description
       ----  ---------------------
        7    FSP-LSP
        8    FSP-PSNP

8.2.  Revised sub-TLV table

   IANA is requested to modify the table in "TLV Codepoints Registry" by
   adding columns for FSP-LSP and FSP-PSNP and set FSP-LSP:n and FSP-
   PSNP:n for all existing TLVs with the exception of 10
   (Authentication) and 11 (ESN).

8.3.  IS-IS Flooding Scope Pulse LSP Entries TLV

   This document makes the following registrations in the IS-IS TLV
   Codepoints registry:

        Type  Description             IIH LSP SNP Purge FSP-LSP FSP-PSNP
        ----  ---------------------   --- --- --- ----- ------- -------
        29   FS-LSP Entries TLV         n   n   n     n       n       y

8.4.  IS-IS Summary Component Reachability Loss Pulse TLV

   This document makes the following registrations in the IS-IS TLV
   Codepoints registry:

        Type  Description             IIH LSP SNP Purge FSP-LSP FSP-PSNP
        ----  ---------------------   --- --- --- ----- ------- --------
        30    Summary Component
              Reachability Loss
              Pulse                     n   n   n     n       y       n

9.  Security Considerations for ISIS

   The introduction of new PDU types introduces the possibility that an
   attacker could inject a false but apparently valid PDU.  The use of
   cryptographic authentication as defined in [RFC5304] or [RFC5310]
   minimizes the possibility of such occurrences.

   Replay attacks could still be possible.  Prevention of replay attacks
   can be done by including the Extended Sequence Numbers(ESN) TLV
   [RFC7602] in FSP-LSPs and FSP-PSNPs.  Note, however, that the use of
   ESN MUST be done independently for each FSP-LSP ID.  It is not safe
   to use a single ESN for the FSP-LSP PDU Type (as is done with hellos
   and SNPs) since we cannot guarantee the order in which multiple FSP-
   LSPs from the same source may arrive at a given node.

   If a false PDU were to be injected, invalid SCRLP information could
   falsely trigger BGP-PIC behavior.
