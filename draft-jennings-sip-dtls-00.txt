Abstract

   This draft specifies how to use Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) as a transport for SIP.  DTLS is a new protocol for providing
   TLS security over a datagram protocol.

   This draft is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.

Internet-Draft           DTLS Transport for SIP            February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [7] provides communication
   privacy similar to TLS for datagram packets.  SIP can run over both
   stream and datagram transports.  SIP already defines how to use TLS
   with stream oriented transports.  This specification extends SIP to
   use DTLS with datagram oriented transports.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3.  Transport Parameters

   SIP URIs can carry a transport parameter indicating the transport
   protocol to be used.  This specification defines two new values for
   the transport parameter: "dtls-udp" for the SIP URI transport
   parameter to be used for messages sent using DTLS over UDP, and
   "dtls-dccp" for messages sent using DTLS over DCCP.  The update to
   the ABNF in RFC 3261 for this parameter is the following:

   transport-param   =  "transport="
                      ( "udp" / "tcp" / "sctp" / "tls" / "tls-sctp"
                        "dtls-dccp" / "dtls-udp"
                         / other-transport)

   The following is an example of SIP URIs using "dtls-udp":

   sip:alice@example.com;transport=dtls-udp

   Via header fields also carry a transport protocol identifier.  This
   specification extends RFC 3261 to define the value "DTLS-UDP" for
   DTLS over UDP and "DTLS-DCCP" for DTLS over DCCP.  The update to the
   ABNF in RFC 3261 for this parameter is the following:

   transport         =  "UDP" / "TCP" / "TLS" / "SCTP" / "TLS-SCTP"
                        "DTLS-DCCP" / "DTLS-UDP"
                        / other-transport

   The following is an example Via header field:

   Via: SIP/2.0/DTLS-UDP atlanta.example.com:5060

4.  DTLS Usage

   The normal rules for sending a request over UDP in RFC 3261 apply to
   sending over DTLS.  Note that the congestion safety rules for UDP do
   not apply to DCCP.  In addition, the normal rules for validating a
   TLS connection in RFC 3261 apply to DTLS connections.  Requests with
   a sips URI can be sent over DTLS as well as TLS.

5.  Locating DTLS SIP Servers

   The normal rules from RFC 3263 [4] apply when locating a SIP server
   that supports DTLS.  The following new NAPTER[5] service values are
   defined: "SIPS+D2U" for UDP, and "SIPS+D2D" for DCCP.  In addition,
   "SIP+D2D" should be used for SIP without DTLS over DCCP.

   The default port for DTLS over UDP is 5061.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security issues with SIP using DTLS are closely equivalent to the
   issues of using SIP with TLS.  All the security considerations in RFC
   3261 relevant to TLS apply to DTLS.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to update the following entry to the "SIP/SIPS
   URI Parameters" registry.  The reference to this RFC should appear in
   double-brackets and be appended to the list of references already
   listed on for the transport parameter, as indicated in RFC 3969 [6].
   The resulting entry should be similar to:

   Parameter Name     Predefined Values     Reference
   --------------     -----------------     ---------
   transport          Yes                   [RFC3261] [[RFCXXXX]]

   This document also defines new NAPTR service field values.  The IANA
   is requested to register these values under the "Registry for the SIP
   SRV Resource Record Services Field".  The resulting entries should
   be:

    Services Field        Protocol  Reference
    --------------------  --------  ---------
    SIPS+D2U              UDP       [RFCXXXX]
    SIPS+D2D              DCCP      [RFCXXXX]
    SIP+D2D               DCCP      [RFCXXXX]
