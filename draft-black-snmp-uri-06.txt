    Abstract 
       
      SNMP and the Internet Standard Management Framework are widely 
      used for management of communication devices, creating needs to 
      specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object 
      instances) from non-SNMP management environments.  For example, 
      when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management 
      interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP 
      access) there is a need for a uniform way to indicate how to 
      contact the device for management.  URIs fit this need well, as 
      they allow a single text string to indicate a management access 
      communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols.

   1. Introduction 
       
      SNMP and the Internet-Standard Management Framework were 
      originally devised to manage IP devices via in-band means where 
      management access is primarily via the same interface(s) used to 
      send and receive IP traffic.  SNMP's wide adoption has resulted in 
      its use to manage communication devices that do not support in-
      band IP access (e.g., Fibre Channel devices); a separate out-of-
      band IP interface is often used for management.  URIs provide a 
      convenient way to locate that interface and specify the protocol 
      to be used for management; one possible scenario is for an in-band 
      query to return a URI that indicates how the device is managed.  
      This document specifies a URI scheme to permit SNMP (including a 
      specific SNMP context) to be designated as the management protocol 
      by such a URI.  This scheme also allows a URI to refer to specific 
      object instances within an SNMP MIB.

                            URI Scheme for SNMP                July 2004 
    
    
      For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
      Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
      of [RFC 3410]. 
        
   2. Syntax of an SNMP URI 
       
      An SNMP URI has the following ABNF [RFC 2234] syntax, based on the 
      ABNF syntax rules for userinfo, host, port, and (path) segment in 
      [rfc2396bis] and the ABNF syntax rule for HEXDIG in [RFC 2234]: 
       
         snmp_URI        = "snmp://" snmp-authority [ context [ oids ]] 
       
         snmp-authority  = [ securityName "@" ] host [ ":" port ] 
         securityName    = userinfo    ; SNMP securityName 
       
         context         = "/" contextName [ ";" contextEngineID ] 
         contextName     = segment     ; SNMP contextName 
         contextEngineID = 1*HEXDIG    ; SNMP contextEngineID 
       
         oids            = "/" ( oid / oid-group ) [ suffix ] 
         oid-group       = "(" oid *( "," oid ) ")" 
         oid             = < as specified by [RFC 3061] > 
         suffix          = "+" / ".*" 
       
      The userinfo and (path) segment ABNF rules are reused for syntax 
      only.  In contrast, host and port have both the syntax and 
      semantics specified in [rfc2396bis].  securityName, 
      contextEngineID, and contextName are defined in [RFC 3411]. 
       
      The snmp-authority syntax matches the URI authority syntax in 
      section 3.2 of [rfc2396bis] with the additional restriction that 
      (when present) the userinfo component of an authority MUST be an 
      SNMP securityName.  If the securityName is empty or not given, the 
      entity making use of an SNMP URI is expected to know what SNMP 
      securityName to use if one is required.  Inclusion of 
      authentication information (e.g., passwords) in URIs has been 
      deprecated (see Section 3.2.1 of [rfc2396bis]), so any secret or 
      password required for SNMP access must be obtained via other 
      means.  If the port is empty or not given, port 161 is assumed. 
       
      If the contextName is empty or not given, the zero-length string 
      ("") is assumed, as it is the default SNMP context.  An SNMP 
      contextEngineID is a variable-format binary element that is 
      usually discovered by an SNMP Manager.  If the contextEngineID is 
      empty or not given, the context engine is to be discovered by 
      querying the SNMP Agent at the specified host and port; see 
      Section 3.1 below.  The contextEngineID component of the URI 
      SHOULD be present if more than one context engine at the 
      designated host and port supports the designated context.

                            URI Scheme for SNMP                July 2004 
    
    
      An SNMP URI that designates the default SNMP context ("") MAY end 
      with the "/" character that introduces the contextName component.  
      An SNMP URI MUST NOT end with the "/" character that introduces an 
      oid or oid-group component, as the empty string is not a valid oid 
      for SNMP. 
       
      The encoding rules specified in [rfc2396bis] MUST be used for SNMP 
      URIs, including the use of percent encoding ("%" followed by two 
      hex digits) to represent characters other than unreserved 
      characters.  SNMP allows any UTF-8 character to be used in a 
      securityName or contextName; all multi-byte UTF-8 characters in an 
      SNMP URI MUST be percent encoded as specified in Section 2 of 
      [rfc2396bis].  These requirements are a consequence of reuse of 
      the ABNF syntax rules for userinfo and segment from [rfc2396bis]. 
       
      SNMP URIs will generally be short enough to avoid implementation 
      string length limits (e.g., that may occur at 255 characters).  
      Such limits may be a concern for large oid groups; relative URIs 
      provide an alternative in some circumstances. 
       
      Use of IP addresses in SNMP URIs is acceptable in situations where 
      dependence on availability of DNS service is undesirable or must 
      be avoided; otherwise IP addresses should not be used (see [RFC 
      1900] for further explanation). 
       
   2.1 Relative URI Considerations 
       
      Use of the SNMP default context (zero-length string) within an 
      SNMP URI can result in a second instance of "//" in the URI, e.g.: 
       
          snmp://<host>//<oid> 
       
      This is allowed by [rfc2396bis] syntax; if a URI parser does not 
      handle the second "//" correctly, the parser is broken and needs 
      to be fixed.  This example is important because use of the SNMP 
      default context in SNMP URIs is expected to be common. 
       
      On the other hand, the second occurrence of "//" in an absolute 
      SNMP URI affects usage of relative URIs because a "//" at the 
      start of a relative URI always introduces a URI authority 
      component.  Specifically, a relative SNMP URI of the form //<oid2> 
      is not usable because the "//" causes <oid2> to be parsed as a URI 
      authority, resulting in a syntax error.  To avoid this problem, 
      relative SNMP URIs that start with "//" but do not contain a URI 
      authority component MUST NOT be used.  The intended functionality 
      of any such relative URI can be obtained by prefixing "." or "..", 
      depending on the base URI (e.g., ..//<oid2>).

   3. Semantics and Operations 
       
      An SNMP URI that does not include any oids is called an SNMP 
      service URI because it designates a communication endpoint for 
      access to SNMP management service.  An SNMP URI that includes one 
      or more oids is called an SNMP object URI because it designates 
      one or more object instances in an SNMP MIB. 
       
   3.1 SNMP Service URIs 
       
      An SNMP service URI does not designate a data object, but rather 
      an SNMP context to be accessed by a service; the telnet URI scheme 
      [RFC 1738] is another example of URIs that designate service 
      access.  The expected means of using an SNMP service URI is to 
      employ an SNMP Manager to access the SNMP context designated by 
      the URI via the SNMP Agent at the host and port designated by the 
      URI; if the contextName is empty or not given in the URI, "" (the 
      zero-length string) is assumed as it is the default SNMP context. 
       
      The semantics of an SNMP securityName depend on the security model 
      and SNMP protocol version in use.  For the SNMPv3 User-based 
      Security Model (USM), an SNMP securityName is an SNMP userName 
      [RFC 3414].  For SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, the securityName is obtained 
      via mapping from the community name, see [RFC 3584].  Additional 
      SNMP security models may be defined. 
       
      If a contextEngineID is given in an SNMP service URI, the context 
      engine that it designates is to be used.  If the contextEngineID 
      is empty or not given in the URI, the context engine is to be 
      discovered; the context engine to be used is the one that supports 
      the context designated by the URI.  The contextEngineID component 
      of the URI SHOULD be present if more than one context engine at 
      the designated host and port supports the designated context. 
       
      Many common uses of SNMP URIs are expected to omit (i.e., default) 
      the contextEngineID because they do not involve accessing SNMP 
      proxy agents, the most common reason for multiple SNMP context 
      engines to exist at a single host and port.  Specifically, when an 
      SNMP Agent is local to the network interface that it manages, the 
      agent will usually have only one context engine, in which case it 
      is safe to omit the contextEngineID component of an SNMP URI.  In 
      addition, many SNMP Agents that are local to a network interface 
      support only the default SNMP context (zero-length string). 
       
   3.2 SNMP Object URIs 
       
      An SNMP object URI contains one or more oids.  The URI is used by 
      first separating the oid or oid group (including its preceding 
      slash plus any parentheses and/or suffix), and then processing the

      resulting SNMP service URI as specified in Section 3.1 (above) to 
      determine the SNMP context to be accessed.  The oid or oid group 
      is then used to generate SNMP operations directed to that SNMP 
      context. 
       
      The semantics of an SNMP object URI depend on whether the oid or 
      oid group has a suffix and what that suffix is.  There are three 
      possible formats; in each case, the MIB object instances are 
      designated within the SNMP context specified by the service URI 
      portion of the SNMP object URI.  The semantics of an SNMP object 
      URI that contains a single oid are: 
       
      (1) An oid without a suffix designates the MIB object 
         instance named by the oid. 
      (2) An oid with a "+" suffix designates the lexically next 
         MIB object instance following the oid. 
      (3) An oid with a ".*" suffix designates the set of MIB 
         object instances for which the oid is a strict lexical prefix; 
         this does not include the MIB object instance named by the oid. 
       
      An oid group in an SNMP URI consists of a set of oids in 
      parentheses.  In each case, the oid group semantics are the 
      extension of the single oid semantics to each oid in the group 
      (e.g., a URI with a "+" suffix designates the set of MIB object 
      instances consisting of the lexically next instance for each oid 
      in the oid group). 
       
      When there is a choice among URI formats to designate the same MIB 
      object instance or instances, the above list is in order of 
      preference (no suffix is most preferable) as it runs from most 
      precise to least precise.  This is because an oid without a suffix 
      precisely designates an object instance, whereas a "+" suffix 
      designates the next object instance, which may change, and the 
      ".*" suffix could designate multiple object instances.  Multiple 
      syntactically distinct SNMP URIs SHOULD NOT be used to designate 
      the same MIB object instance or set of instances as this may cause 
      unexpected results in URI-based systems that use string comparison 
      to test URIs for equality.   
       
      Data access based on an SNMP URI returns an SNMP variable binding 
      for each MIB object instance designated by the URI or an SNMP 
      error if the operation fails.  An SNMP variable binding binds a 
      variable name (oid) to a value or an SNMP exception (see [RFC 
      3416]).  The SNMP operation or operations generated to access data 
      designated by an SNMP object URI depend on the oid or oid group 
      suffix or absence thereof:

      (1) For an oid or oid group without a suffix, an SNMP Get 
         operation is generated using each oid as a variable binding 
         name.  If an SNMP error occurs, that error is the result 
         of URI data access, otherwise the returned variable binding or 
         bindings are the result of URI data access.  Note that any 
         returned variable binding may contain an SNMP "noSuchObject" 
         or "noSuchInstance" exception. 
       
      (2) For an oid or oid group with a "+" suffix, an SNMP GetNext 
         operation is generated using each oid as a variable binding 
         name.  If an SNMP error occurs, that error is the result 
         of URI data access, otherwise the returned variable binding 
         or bindings are the result of URI data access.  Note that any 
         returned variable binding may contain an SNMP "endOfMibView" 
         exception. 
       
      (3) For an oid or oid group with a ".*" suffix, an SNMP GetNext  
         operation is initially generated using each oid as a variable 
         binding name.  If the result is an SNMP error, that error is 
         the result of URI data access.  If all returned variable 
         bindings contain either an oid for which the corresponding URI 
         oid is not a lexical prefix or an SNMP "endOfMibView" 
         exception, the returned variable binding or bindings are the 
         result of URI data access. 
       
         Otherwise the results of the GetNext operation are saved, and 
         another SNMP GetNext operation is generated using the newly 
         returned oids as variable binding names; this is iterated until 
         an SNMP error is returned or until all returned variable 
         bindings contain either an oid for which the corresponding URI 
         oid is not a lexical prefix or an SNMP "endOfMibView" 
         exception.  The result of URI data access consists of the 
         groups of variable bindings from the successful SNMP GetNext 
         operations.  SNMP GetBulk operations MAY be used to optimize 
         this iterated access. 
       
         Whenever a returned variable binding contains an oid for which 
         the corresponding URI oid is not a lexical prefix or an SNMP 
         "endOfMibView" exception, iteration of that element of the 
         oid group MAY cease, reducing the number of variable bindings 
         used in subsequent GetNext operations.  In this case the 
         results of URI data access for the SNMP URI will not consist 
         entirely of oid-group-sized sets of variable bindings.  Even if 
         this does not occur, the last variable binding returned for 
         each member of the oid group will generally be an SNMP 
         exception or an for which the corresponding URI oid is not a 
         lexical prefix.

                            URI Scheme for SNMP                July 2004 
    
    
      SNMP URIs designate the data to be accessed, as opposed to the 
      specific SNMP operations to be used for access.  Therefore, any 
      applicable SNMP operation, including GetBulk, MAY be used to 
      access data for all or part of one or more SNMP URIs (e.g., via 
      use of multiple variable bindings in a single operation); it is 
      not necessary to use the specific operations in the above 
      descriptions as long as the returned variable bindings or error 
      could have been obtained by following the descriptions.  The use 
      of relative SNMP object URIs that do not change the contextName 
      (i.e., ./<oid>) should be viewed as a hint that optimization of 
      SNMP access across multiple URIs may be possible. 
        
      An SNMP URI MAY also be used to specify a MIB object instance or 
      instances to be written; this causes generation of an SNMP Set 
      operation instead of a Get.  The "+" and ".*" suffixes MUST NOT be 
      used in this case; any attempt to do so is an error that MUST NOT 
      generate any SNMP Set operations.  Values to be written to the MIB 
      object instance or instances are not specified within an SNMP URI. 
        
      SNMP URIs designate data in SNMP MIBs, and hence do not provide 
      the means to generate all possible SNMP protocol operations.  For 
      example, data access for an SNMP URI cannot directly generate 
      either Snmpv2-Trap or InformRequest notifications, although side 
      effects of data access could cause such notifications (depending 
      on the MIB).  In addition, determining whether and how GetBulk is 
      used for a SNMP URI with a ".*" suffix is implementation-specific. 
       
   3.3 OID Groups in SNMP URIs 
       
      Parenthesized oid groups in SNMP URIs are intended to support MIB 
      object instances for which access via a single SNMP operation is 
      required to ensure consistent results or otherwise desirable.  
      Therefore, the oids within an oid group in an SNMP URI SHOULD be 
      accessed by a single SNMP operation containing a variable binding 
      corresponding to each oid in the group.  A specific example 
      involves the InetAddress and InetAddressType textual conventions 
      defined in [RFC 3291] where the format of an InetAddress instance 
      is specified by an associated InetAddressType instance.  If two 
      such associated instances are read via separate SNMP operations, 
      the resulting values could be inconsistent (e.g., due to an 
      intervening Set) causing the InetAddress value to be incorrectly 
      interpreted. 
       
      This single operation requirement ("SHOULD") also applies to each 
      oid group resulting from iterated access for an SNMP URI with a 
      ".*" suffix.  When members of an SNMP URI oid group differ in the 
      number of oids for which each is a lexical prefix, this iteration 
      may overrun by returning numerous variable bindings for which the 
      corresponding oid in the oid group is not a lexical prefix.  Such

      overrun can be avoided by using relative URIs within the same 
      context (i.e., ./<oid>) when it is not important to access 
      multiple MIB object instances in a single SNMP operation. 
       
   3.4 Interoperability Considerations 
       
      This document defines a transport-independent "snmp" scheme that 
      is intended to accommodate SNMP transports other than UDP.  UDP is 
      the default transport for access to information specified by an 
      SNMP URI for backwards compatibility with existing usage, but 
      other transports MAY be used.  If more than one transport can be 
      used (e.g., SNMP over TCP [RFC 3430] in addition to SNMP over UDP) 
      the information or SNMP service access designated by an SNMP URI 
      SHOULD NOT depend on which transport is used (for SNMP over TCP, 
      this is implied by Section 2 of [RFC 3430]). 
       
      An SNMP URI designates use of SNMPv3 as specified by [RFC 3416], 
      [RFC 3417], and related documents, but older versions of SNMP MAY 
      be used in accordance with [RFC 3584] where usage of such older 
      versions is unavoidable.  For SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, the contextName 
      and contextEngineID elements of an SNMP URI are mapped to and from 
      the community name as described in [RFC 3584].  Note that some 
      SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c community names contain reserved characters 
      (e.g., "@") that require percent encoding when used in an SNMP 
      URI.  SNMP versions (e.g., v3) have been omitted from the SNMP URI 
      scheme for forwards compatibility with any possible future 
      successor to SNMPv3. 
       
   4. Examples 
       
         snmp://snmp.example.com 
       
      This example designates the default SNMP context at the SNMP Agent 
      at port 161 of host snmp.example.com .   
       
         snmp://tester5@snmp.example.com:8161 
       
      This example designates the default SNMP context at the SNMP Agent 
      at port 8161 of host snmp.example.com and indicates that the SNMP 
      user name "tester5" is to be used to access that Agent.  A 
      possible reason for use of a non-standard port is testing of a new 
      version of SNMP Agent code. 
       
         snmp://snmp.example.com/bridge1 
       
      This example designates the "bridge1" SNMP context at 
      snmp.example.com.  Because the contextEngineID component of the 
      URI is omitted, there SHOULD be at most one SNMP context engine at 
      snmp.example.com that supports the "bridge1" context.

         snmp://snmp.example.com/bridge1;800002b804616263 
       
      This example designates the "bridge1" context at snmp.example.com 
      via the SNMP context engine 800002b804616263 (string 
      representation of a hexadecimal value).  This avoids ambiguity if 
      any other context engine supports a "bridge1" context.  The above 
      two examples are based on the figure in Section 3.3 of [RFC 3411].  
       
         snmp://snmp.example.com//1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 
         snmp://snmp.example.com//1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3+ 
         snmp://snmp.example.com//1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.* 
       
      These three examples all designate the sysUpTime.0 object instance 
      in the SNMPv2-MIB or RFC1213-MIB for the default SNMP context ("") 
      at snmp.example.com as sysUpTime.0 is: 
         a) designated directly by oid 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0, 
         b) the lexically next MIB object instance after the oid 
            1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3, and 
         c) the only MIB object instance whose oid has 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3 
            as a lexical prefix. 
      These three examples are provided for illustrative purposes only, 
      as multiple syntactically distinct URIs SHOULD NOT be used to 
      designate the same MIB object instance in order to avoid 
      unexpected results in URI-based systems that use string comparison 
      to test URIs for equality. 
       
         snmp://example.com/bridge1/1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.* 
       
      This example designates the ifOperStatus column of the IF-MIB in 
      the bridge1 SNMP context at example.com. 
       
         snmp://example.com//(1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8).* 
       
      This example designates all (ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus) pairs in 
      the IF-MIB in the default SNMP context at example.com. 
       
   5. Security Considerations 
       
      An intended use of this URI scheme is designation of the location 
      of management access to communication devices.  Such location 
      information may be considered sensitive in some environments, 
      making it important to control access to this information and 
      possibly even to encrypt when sending it over the network.  All 
      uses of this URI scheme should provide security mechanisms 
      appropriate to the environments in which such uses are likely to 
      be deployed.

      There are management objects defined in SNMP MIBs whose MAX-ACCESS 
      is read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be considered 
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support 
      for SNMP SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
      protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  The 
      individual MIB module specifications, and especially their 
      security considerations, should be consulted for further 
      information. 
       
      Some readable objects in some MIB modules (i.e., objects with a 
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
      or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
      to control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even 
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the 
      network via SNMP.  The individual MIB module specifications, and 
      especially their security considerations, should be consulted for 
      further information.  This consideration also applies to objects 
      for which read operations have side effects. 
       
      SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
      Even if the network itself is secure (for example via use of 
      IPsec), there is no control over who on the secure network is 
      allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
      objects in MIB modules. It is RECOMMENDED that implementers 
      consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework 
      (see [RFC 3410], section 8 for an overview), including full 
      support for SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication 
      and privacy).  This is of additional importance for MIB elements 
      considered sensitive or vulnerable because GETs have side effects. 
       
      Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
      RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
      enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
      responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to a 
      MIB module instance is properly configured to give access to the 
      objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
      rights to indeed GET or SET (read/change/create/delete) them. 
       
   6. IANA Considerations 
       
      The IANA is asked to register the URL registration template found 
      in Appendix A in accordance with [RFC 2717].
