1.  Introduction

   This document explores, and makes recommendations for, timing of
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) publication of ROV data,
   their propagation, and their use in Relying Parties (RP), caches and
   routers.

   The RPKI supply chain from CAs to reach routers has the following
   structure:

   Cerification Authorities:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are
      meant to be published by a distributed set of Certification
      Authorities (CAs) at the IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs (see
      [RFC6481]).

   Publication Points:  The CAs publish their authoritative data in



Bush, et al.            Expires 17 February 2022                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft               RPKI ROV Timing                 August 2021


      publicly accessible repositories which have a Publication Point
      (PP) for each CA.  A CA may publish directly at a PP or may use
      the RPKI Publication Protocol [RFC8181].

   Relying Parties:  Relying Parties are a local (to the routers) set of
      one or more collected and verified caches of RPKI data which the
      RPs collect from the PPs.

      Currently RPs can pull from other RPs, thereby allowing a somewhat
      complex topology.

   Routers:  Validating routers fetch data from local RP caches using
      the RPKI to Router Protocol, [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].  Routers
      are clients of the caches.  Validating routers MUST have a trust
      relationship with, and a trusted transport channel to, any RP(s)
      they use.  [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] specifies mechanisms for a
      router to assure itself of the authenticity of the cache(s) and to
      authenticate itself to cache(s).

   As Resource Public Key Infrastructure based Route Origin Validation
   (ROV) becomes deployed in the Internet, the quality of the routing
   control plane, and hence timely and accurate delivery of packets in
   the data plane, increasingly depend on prompt and accurate
   propagation of the RPKI data from the originating Certification
   Authorities (CAs), to Relying Parties (RPs), to Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) speaking routers.

   Origin Validation based on stale ROAs allows accidental or
   intentional mis-origination; announcement of a prefix by an AS which
   does not have the authority to do so.  Delays in ROA propagation to
   ROV in routers might cause loss of good traffic.  Therefore
   minimizing propagation time of data from CAs to routers is important.

   Before the data can start on the CA to router supply chain, the
   resource holder (operator) MUST create or delete the relevant ROA(s)
   through the CA's operational interface(s).  The operator is
   responsible for anticipating their future needs for ROAs, be aware of
   the propagation time from creating ROAs to effect on routing, and
   SHOULD create, delete, or modify ROAs sufficiently in advance of any
   needs in the routing system.

   There are questions of how frequently a CA publishes, how often an RP
   pulls, and how often routers pull from their RP(s).  Overall, the
   router(s) SHOULD react within an hour of ROA publication.

   For CAs publishing to PPs, a few seconds to a minute seems easily
   achieved with reasonable software.  See Section 3.

Internet-Draft               RPKI ROV Timing                 August 2021


   Relying Party validating caches periodically retrieve data from CA
   publication points.  RPs using rsync to poll publication points every
   ten minutes would be a burden today, given the load it would put on
   publication services, cf. one notorious repository which was
   structured against specification.  RPs using RRDP impose less load.
   As the infrastructure moves from rsync to RRDP
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-prefer-rrdp], RRDP is designed for quite frequent
   polling as long as Relying Parties use the "If-Modified-Since" header
   and there is a caching infrastructure.  For rsync, an hour would be
   the longest acceptable window and half an hour the shortest.  See
   Section 4.

   For BGP speaking router(s) pulling from the RP(s), five minutes to an
   hour is a wide window.  But, the RPKI-Rtr protocol does have the
   Serial Notify PDU, the equivalent of DNS Notify, where the cache
   tells the router that it has new data.  See Section 5.

   We discuss each of these in detail below.

2.  Related Work

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI
   [RFC6480], RPKI Manifests [RFC6486], Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs), [RFC6482], the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)
   [RFC8182], The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis], RPKI-based Prefix Validation,
   [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications, [RFC8481].

3.  Certification Authority Publishing

   A principal constraint on publication timing is ensuring the CRL and
   Manifest ([RFC6486]) are atomically correct with respect to the other
   repository data.  With rsync, the publication point must be
   atomically correct before it becomes current.  RRDP ([RFC8182]) is
   similar, the publication point must be atomically correct before it
   is published.

4.  Relying Party Fetching

   rsync puts a load on RPKI publication point servers.  Therefore
   relying party caches have been discouraged from fetching more
   frequently than on the order of a half hour.  Times as long as a day
   were even suggested.  We conclude that RPs using rsync SHOULD pull
   from CA publication points every 30 to 60 minutes.

   With RRDP ([RFC8182]), such constraints are less relevant.  [RFC8182]
   makes clear that polling as no more frequently than once a minute is
   acceptable iff Relying Parties use the If-Modified-Since header and



Bush, et al.            Expires 17 February 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               RPKI ROV Timing                 August 2021


   there is caching.  Absent use of the If-Modified-Since header, the
   RRDP polling interval MUST NOT be more frequent than ten minutes.
   Use of the If-Modified-Since header is strongly recommended.

   Migration from rsync to RRDP in [I-D.ietf-sidrops-prefer-rrdp] is
   recommended.  During dual RRDP/rsync operation, should an RP need to
   fall over from RRDP to rsync, a uniformly distribued jittered delay
   with a mean of half the rsync interval SHOULD be used; so clients
   falling over to rsync are as spread out as they would be if they used
   rsync initallly.

   A number of timers are embedded in the X.509 RPKI data which should
   also be considered.  E.g., CRL publication commitments, expiration of
   EE certificates pointing to Manifests, and the Manifests themselves.
   Some CA operators commonly indicate new CRL information should be
   available in the next 24 hours.  These 24 hour sliding timers, when
   combined with fetching RPKI data once a day, would expose failure
   windows, especially in the face of transient network issues between
   the CA and RP.  To ameliorate this, RPs SHOULD update from CAs every
   hour or two at most.

5.  Router Updating

   The rate of change of ROA data is estimated to remain small, on the
   order of a few ROAs a minute, but with bursts.  Therefore, the
   routers may update from the (presumed local) relying party cache(s)
   quite frequently.  Note that [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] recommends a
   polling interval of one hour.  This polling timing is conservative
   because caches can send a Serial Notify PDU to tell routers when
   there are new data to be fetched.  As the RP cache and the router
   belong to the same operator, routers are free to hammer the RPs as
   frequently as they wish.

   A router SHOULD respond with a Serial Query when it receives a Serial
   Notify from a cache.  If a router can not respond appropriately to a
   Serial Notify, then it MUST send a periodic Serial Query no less
   frequently than once an hour.

6.  Effect on Routing

   Once a router has received an End of Data PDU from a cache, the
   effect on Route Origin Validation MUST be a matter of seconds to a
   minute.  The router MAY allow incoming VRPs to affect Origin
   Validation as they arrive instead of waiting for the End of Data PDU.
   See [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis] for some cautions regarding the
   arrival sequence of VRPs.

7.  Alternative Technologies

   Should the supply chain include components or technologies other than
   those in IETF documents, the end effect SHOULD be the same; the
   router(s) SHOULD react to invalid AS origins within the same overall
   time constraint, an hour at most from ROA creation at the CA
   publication point to effect in the router.

8.  Operational Expectations

   Assuming the above recommendations, in worst conditions such as an
   RPKI-rtr Notify PDU being ignored, it may take up to two hours for a
   new ROA to propagate from creation at the CA to BGP speaking routers.
   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that planned changes in ROAs take this
   propagation time into consideration.  E.g. if a new route is to be
   announced in BGP, the operators SHOULD create the ROA around three
   hours before BGP announcement, or it may not propagate globally.

9.  Security Considerations

   Despite common misconceptions and marketing, Route Origin Validation
   is not a magic security protocol.  It is intended to catch
   operational errors, and is easily gamed and attacked through, for
   example, AS Path manipulation.  It is one tool in the prudent
   operator's kit, and a good one.

   If an attacker can add, delete, or modify RPKI data, either in
   repositories or in flight, they can affect routing and thereby steer
   or damage traffic.  The RPKI system design does much to deter these
   attacks.  But the 'last mile' from the cache to the router uses
   transport, as opposed to object, security and is vulnerable.  This is
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].

   Similarly, if an attacker can delay prompt propagation of RPKI data
   on the supply chain described in this document, they can affect
   routing, and therefore traffic flow, to their advantage.
