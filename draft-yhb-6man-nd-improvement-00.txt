Abstract

   This document describes the improvement to neighbor discovery. When
   an IPv6 address is deleted on a node, the node will send a neighbor 
   advertisement with a "Deleted" flag set to all link-local nodes.
   If the IPv6 address has been configured on another node, and it is
   in duplicate state, it will perform DAD(Duplicate Address Detection)
   again. If DAD succeeds, the IPv6 address will be assigned to the  
   node.
   If the IPv6 address exists in the neighbor cache on the other nodes,
   when the neighbor advertisement with deleted flag set arrived, they 
   know the neighbor is unreachable and delete the neighbor cache entry.

1.  Introduction                                                         	
                                                                         	
   The defect of neighbor discovery is described in section 1.1, and 
   then the solution is described in section 1.2.
   
1.1.  Problems

   Scenario 1                                                                               	
   Host A and host B are on the same link.IPv6 address A is configured 
   on each host almost at the same time, and each host performs DAD for 
   IPv6 address A. Both hosts discover that IPv6 address A is duplicate.
   After IPv6 address A on host A is deleted, IPv6 address A on host B 
   is unique on the link, but the reality is that it will remain in 
   duplicate state without manual intervention (such as unplugging and 
   then plugging the network cables, or deleting the IPv6 address A on 
   host B and re-configuring it).
   
   Scenario 2                                                                         	
   Host A and host B are on the same link, host A is up, and host B is
   down. Host A occupied IPv6 address A that is assigned to host B. Then 
   host B is up, and host B will find that IPv6 address A is duplicate. 
   After IPv6 address A on host A is deleted, IPv6 address A on host B
   is unique on the link, but the reality is that it will remain in 
   duplicate state without manual intervention.
   
   Scenario 3
   IPv6 address A is assigned to node A, and the other nodes on the same 
   link learned IPv6 address A via neighbor discovery. 
   Then IPv6 address A is deleted on node A (deleted manually by the
   administrator, or valid lifetime expires), but the other nodes don't 
   know, the neighbor cache entry for IPv6 address A still exists, and 
   maybe continue to route the IPv6 packets to node A until it finds out
   via NUD(Neighbor Unreachability Detection) that IPv6 address A is 
   unreachable.
   

1.2.  Solution Overview
                                                                         	
   When IPv6 address A is deleted on host A, host A sends a neighbor 
   advertisement to tell all other nodes on the link that IPv6 address A
   is deleted.
    
   In scenario 1 or 2, when host B receives the neighbor advertisement,
   IPv6 address A in duplicate state will enter tentative state, and
   DAD will be performed. If DAD succeeds, IPv6 address A will be 
   assigned to host B.
    
   In scenario 3, when host B receives the neighbor advertisement, 
   delete the neighbor cache entry for IPv6 address A.
                                                                         	
2.  Modified Neighbor Advertisement Message Format
                                                                        	
   In order to implement the solution, a "Deleted" indication bit is 
   added to the reserved section of the NA message.  Figure 1 shows the
   format of the modified NA, and "D" stands for "Deleted".

3.  Host Specification

3.1.  Sending NA with "D" flag set

   When IPv6 address A is deleted on a node, the node SHOULD send an 
   unsolicited neighbor advertisement to tell all other nodes on the 
   link that IPv6 address A is deleted. The neighbor advertisement is as
   follows:
   
   * Source address: If A is a tentative address or duplicate address, 
   the source address MUST be the unspecified address. Otherwise, the 
   source address SHOULD be IPv6 address A.
   
   * Destination address: MUST be link-local all-nodes multicast address
   FF02::1.
   
   * Flag S and Flag O are both zero.
   
   * Flag D MUST be set.
   
   * Target address: MUST be IPv6 address A.
   
   * No option is needed.   
                                                                         	
3.2.  Processing Received NA with "D" flag set
   
    If IPv6 operation is disabled on the receiving interface because the
    link-local address formed from an interface identifier based on the
    hardware address is duplicate, neighbor advertisements with "D" flag
    set SHOULD be accepted.
      
    A valid neighbor advertisement with "D" flag set that does not meet
    any of the following requirements MUST be silently discarded:
      
    (1)Host does not recognize "D" flag.      

    (2)Flag S MUST be zero.
    
    (3)The Destination Address MUST be link-local all-nodes multicast 
    address FF02::1.
    
    Flag R, flag O and all options are ignored.
        
    If the target address is a unicast address in duplicate state on the
    receiving interface, the node SHOULD set the state of the unicast 
    address to tentative and perform DAD. If DAD succeeds, do:
    
    (1) The unicast address will be assigned to the node.
    
    (2) If the target address is the link-local address formed from an 
    interface identifier based on the hardware address, IPv6 operation 
    SHOULD be enabled.
    
    Why not immediately assign the unicast address to the node when 
    neighbor advertisement is received? It is possible that another 
    node has the unicast address, so DAD is needed.
    
    If the source address is not the unspecified address, the neighbor 
    cache will be searched for the target's entry. If appropriate 
    neighbor cache entry has been located, because the neighbor is 
    unreachable, the node SHOULD delete the neighbor cache immediately.
         
4.  Security Considerations                                              	
                                                                         	
    Neighbor discovery protocol is vulnerable, and any node can send a 
    neighbor advertisement with flag D set to cheat all other nodes that
    an IPv6 address assigned to a node is deleted. One available 
    solution is the Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol.
