<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be
	carried out by various persons or entities. The RFC Editor
	model presented in this document divides the responsibilities
	for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series Editor,
	the Independent Submission Editor, RFC Production Center, and
	the RFC Publisher. It also introduces the RFC Series Advisory
	group and an (optional) Independent Stream Editorial Board. The model
	outlined here is intended to increase flexibility and
	operational support options, provide for the orderly
	succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the
	RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely
	processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs,
	and increasing cost transparency.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is
	concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series,
	orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and
	RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the
	concerns of the IAOC about providing the necessary services in
	a cost effective and efficient manner.
      
</p>
<p>
	The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844
	<a class='info' href='#RFC4844'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Daigle, L. and Internet Architecture Board, &ldquo;The RFC Series and RFC Editor,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor":
      
</p>
<p>
	</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
| 3.1. RFC Editor
|
|  Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
|  Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now
|  requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC
|  Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be
|  multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
|  required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without
|  attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
|  this document refers to this collection of experts and organizations
|  as the "RFC Editor".
|
|  The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
|  acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC
|  Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
|  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In addition,
|  the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
|  discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
|  RFCs.
</pre></div><p>

      
</p>
<p>
	RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization
	of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the
	RFC Editor organizational structure.  In discussion with the
	Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase
	flexibility and operational support options, provides for the
	orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the
	continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality,
	maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
	accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
	transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those
	discussions, and examines the internal organization of
	the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.
      
</p>
<p>
	Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
	Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which
	this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
	memo introduces the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series
	Editor" for one of the organizational components.
      
</p>
<p>
        The IAB approved the the initial version of this RFC Editor
        model on October 1, 2008, the model has received
        clarifications since. It should be noted that the publication
        of the document as an RFC does not cast the model in stone, as
        the primary purpose of this document, throughout the
        publication procession, is to encourage normal community
        review in order to ascertain consensus to work to this model
        as a first step. The document, and the resulting structures,
        will be modified as needed through normal procedures. The IAB
        will continue to monitor discussions within the community
        about potential adjustments to the RFC Editor model and
        recognizes that the process described in this document, may
        need to be adjusted to align with any changes that result from
        such discussions, hence the version number in the title.
      
</p>
<p>
	In particular, the document will be reviewed after the
	various transition periods and mechanisms specified in
	this version are completed.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
IAOC Implementation</h3>

<p>
	The model is constructed in such a way that it allows for all
	these functions to be implemented jointly or under separate
	contractual arrangements. In fact, a bidder could put together
	a proposal that includes one or more subcontractors. The
	reporting structure will depend on the manner that the
	contracts are awarded, and they are subject to change over
	time. As a result, the model describes only responsibilities,
	procedures, and process. The exact implementation is a
	responsibility of the IAOC.

	  They are part of the IASA budget. Today, these expenses are
	  part of the RFC Editor contract with ISI.

RFC Editor Model</h3>

<p>
	The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for
	the RFC Series into the following components:
      
</p>
<p>
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>RFC Series Editor ("RSE")
</li>
<li>Independent Submission Editor ("ISE")
</li>
<li>RFC Production Center
</li>
<li>RFC Publisher
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p>
	The RFC Series Production and Process under this structure is
	schematically represented by the figure below (the picture does not
	depict oversight and escalation relations).

	      Exercising executive-level management over the
	      implementation of policies, processes and procedures

</p>
<p>
	  There are many potential issues with respect to RFC Series
	  continuity. To name a few: Look and feel of the series,
	  indexing methodologies, accessibility of the publications,
	  IPR and copyright issues, and formatting issues.  After
	  identifying the appropriate steps to address such issues,
	  the implementation of those steps resides mostly with the
	  RFC production and publishing functions. Since the IAOC
	  maintains oversight of the implementation, the RFC Series Editor
	  is expected to be invited and participate in reviews of that
	  implementation.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RFC Series Editor is a senior technology professional
	  with the following qualifications:
	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Strong understanding of the IETF process
</li>
<li> Executive management experience suitable to managing
	    the requirements outlined elsewhere in this document and
	    the many aspects of this role and to coordinating the
	    overall RFC Editor process.
</li>
<li>Good understanding of the English language and technical
	    terminology related to the Internet
</li>
<li>Good communication skills
</li>
<li>Experience with editorial processes
</li>
<li>Independent worker
</li>
<li>Experience as an RFC author desired
</li>
</ol><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	  There are alternative selection methods for selecting the
	  individual to serve as the RFC Series Editor:
	
</p>
<p>
	  The first alternative involves a Request for Proposal (RFP)
	  process run by the IAOC. The IAOC would seek a person with
	  the listed qualifications in a broadly distributed RFP. The
	  winner would be selected by the IAOC in consultation with
	  the IAB, and then, the IAOC would contract for the
	  services. Contract terms, including length of contract,
	  extensions and renewals, shall be as provided in the
	  RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly available. Fees
	  and expenses to support the administrative operation of the
	  RFC Series Editor would be part of the awarded contract and
	  be part of the IASA budget.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The second alternative involves a nomination and
	  confirmation process. Candidates are nominated, and then an
	  individual with the listed qualifications is selected by the
	  Internet community and confirmed by the IAB. An approach
	  similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member
	  every other year as described in <a class='info' href='#selection'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>2009 Selection Process</span><span>)</span></a>
	  will be used.  Once the selection is made, a contract will
	  be negotiated between the person selected and the IAOC,
	  following the general model above. Financial compensation
	  and expenses to support the administrative operation of the
	  RFC Series Editor selected in this manner would be part of
	  the IASA budget.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Based on an Request for Information (RFI) issued by the IAOC
	  in December 2008 the IAOC recommended that the second alternative
	  is chosen for the 2009 selection cycle to be completed in 2009.

</li>
<li>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series
</li>
<li>An ability to define and constitute advisory and

</p>
<p>
	  The individual with the listed qualifications will be

</p>
<p>
      The RFC Production Center contractor is to be selected by the
      IAOC through an RFP process. The IAOC would seek a bidder
      who, among other things, is able to provide a professional,
      quality, timely, and cost effective service against the
      established style and production guidelines. Contract terms,
      including length of contract, extensions and renewals, shall be
      as defined in an RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly

</p>
<p> As described in <a class='info' href='#RSE'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>RFC Series Editor</span><span>)</span></a> this model allows the
      IAOC to recommend the RSE position to be selected through an RFP
      process, in that case the model also allows combining the RFC
      Production Center bid with the RSE bid. For 2009 the
      recommendation was made that the RSE is selected throug a IAB
      led selection process.

    submission streams and the RSE. 
</p>
<p>
      Implementation of the RFC Publisher function can be pursued in
      two different ways. The choice between these alternatives will
      be based on an RFI issued by the IAOC in December 2009.
    
</p>
<p>
      The first alternative is to modify the IETF Secretariat contract
      to include these services. Expenses to support these services
      would be part of the revised contract.
    
</p>
<p>
      The second alternative is a separate vendor selected by the IAOC
      through an RFP process, possibly as part of the same contract as
      the RFC Series Editor. Expenses to support service would be part of the

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.1"></a><h3>4.1.1.&nbsp;
Charter</h3>

<p>
	The purpose of the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG) is to
	provide expert, informed guidance (chiefly, to the RSE) in
	matters affecting the RFC Series operation and development.
	Such matters include, but are not limited to, issues in
	operation of the RFC model components, and consideration of
	additional RFC streams, to give a sense of the range of topics
	covered.
      
</p>
<p>
	The RSAG is chartered by the IAB.  As such, it operates
	independently of the IAB to fulfill that charter, and provides
	periodic reports to the IAB via the RSE.
      
</p>
<p>
	The group provides guidance to the RSE, who in turn addresses
	immediate operational issues or opportunities with the ISE,
	Production Center, or Publisher. In cases where these issues
	have contractual side-effects the RSE provides guidance to the
	IAD.  The RSAG also serves to provide advice to the RSE on
	longer-term, larger-scale developments for the RFC Series.
	This informs the proposals the RSE takes to the community for
	discussion, and the IAD/IAOC as proposals for implementation.
      
</p>
<p>
	The RSAG will assist the RSE in identifying and leading
	community discussion of important issues and opportunities
	facing the RFC Series.  The IAB retains its oversight role and
	is responsible for ensuring that adequate community discussion
	has been held on any such significant topics.
      
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2"></a><h3>4.1.2.&nbsp;
membership</h3>

<p>
	  The RSAG full members are all at large members, selected for
	  their experience and interest in the RFC Series, to provide
	  consistency and constancy of the RFC Series interpretation
	  over time; the members do not represent a particular RFC
	  stream or any organizations.  The RSAG members are proposed by the Series Editor in
	  consultation with the sitting RSAG members, and then
	  confirmed and formally appointed by the IAB.  In addition to these full members,
	  each RFC stream will appoint a liaison to the RSAG to
	  provide context specific to their stream. Initially there
	  will be no IAOC or IAB liaison for their oversight role, however as experience is
	  gained the IAOC, IAB, or RSAG may request for such. There is
	  no requirement or expectation that RSAG members will be IAB
	  members.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The RSAG does not select or appoint the RSE, or any other
	  component of the RFC Editor model, although it acts as an
	important resource for informing any selection process.
	
</p>
<p>
	  It is envisioned that the RSAG will be composed of appointed
	  full members serving staggered 3 year terms, plus the RSE.
	  The full members will serve at the pleasure of the IAB --
	  appointed by the IAB, and if necessary, removed by the IAB.
	
</p>
<p>
	  In order to provide continuity and to assist with a smooth
	  transition of the RFC Editor function, the members of the
	  existing RFC Editor Editorial Board who are willing to do so
	  are asked to serve as an interim RSAG, effective as of the
	  time of approval of this document.  Within one year from the
	  time the RFC Editor function transitions to the new model
	  and after consideration of the operation of the new model in
	  practice, the interim RSAG and RSE will formulate 
	  recommendations to the IAB about this model, in particular
	  the regular composition, size, and selection process for the
	  permanent RSAG in particular.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.3"></a><h3>4.1.3.&nbsp;
Disagreements Among RFC Editor Entities</h3>

<p>
	  If during the execution of their activities, a disagreement
	  arises over an implementation decision made by one of the
	  entities in the model, any relevant party should first
	  request a review and reconsideration of the decision.  If
	  that party still disagrees after the reconsideration, the
	  RSE may be asked to decide or, especially if the RSE is
	  involved, the IAB Chair (for a technical or procedural
	  matter) or IAD (for an administrative or contractual one)
	  may be asked to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in the
	  discussions, although neither is obligated to do so.  All
	  parties should work informally and in good faith to reach a
	  mutually agreeable conclusion.
	
</p>
<p>
	  If such a conclusion is not possible through those informal
	  processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC
	  Series Advisory Group.  The RSAG may choose to offer advice
	  to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved
	  and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates
	  its advice.  However, if a timely decision cannot be reached
	  through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the
	  Series Editor is expected to make whatever decisions are
	  needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC Editor
	  function; those decisions are final.
	
</p>
<p>
	  RSE decisions of this type are limited to the functioning of
	  the process and evaluation of whether current policies are
	  appropriately implemented in the decision or need
	  adjustment.  In particular, it should be noted that final
	  decisions about the technical content of individual
	  documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream
	  approvers for those documents, as shown in the illustration
	  in <a class='info' href='#model-figure'>Figure&nbsp;1</a>.
	
</p>
<p>
	  If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future
	  contractual consequences, the Series Editor must identify
	  the issue to the IAOC and, if the RSAG has provided advice,
	  forward that advice as well. After the IAOC has notified the
	  IAB, the IAD as guided by the IAOC, with advice provided by
	  the Series Editor, has the responsibility to resolve these
	  contractual issues.
	
</p>
<p>
	  If informal agreements cannot be reached and formal RSAG
	  review and/or RSE or stream approver decisions are required,
	  the RSE must identify the issues involved to the community
	  and report them to the IAB in its oversight capacity.  The
	  RSE and IAB shall mutually develop a satisfactory mechanism
	  for this type of reporting when and if it is necessary.
	
</p>
<p>
	  IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are
	  expected to inform future changes to Series policies
	  including possible updates to this document.

Security considerations</h3>

<p>
      The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply: The
      processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need
      to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other
      similar disasters.
    
</p>
<p>
     The IAOC should take these security considerations into
     account during the implementation of this RFC Editor model.

<p>
      The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and
      on mail lists. The first iteration of the text on which this
      document is based was first drafted by Leslie Daigle, Russ
      Housley, and Ray Pelletier.  In addition to the members of the
      IAOC and IAB in conjuction with those roles, major and minor
      contributions were made by (in alphabetical order): Bob Braden,
      Brian Carpenter, Sandy Ginoza, Alice Hagens, Joel M. Halpern,
      Paul Hoffman, John Klensin, Subramanian Moonesamy, and Jim
      Schaad.

2009 Selection Process</h3>

<p>
      In 2009 the IAB is repsonsible for the selection of the RFC
      Series Editor and for the selection of the Independent
      Submission Editor. The IAOC selects the RFC Production Center
      and RFC Publisher from vendors that choose to submit a proposal.
      The IAOC procurement process is not described in this document.
    
</p>
<p>The selection process for the ISE and RSE is taken from <a class='info' href='#RFC4333'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huston, G. and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) Member Selection Guidelines and Process,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> but modified to allow for subject matter
    experts to advise the IAB, to take into account that the
    community with interest in the RFC series extends beyond the IETF
    community.

Ad-hoc advisory committee(s)</h3>

<p>
	It is expected that the IAB and IAOC will, during the various
	stages of the bidding process, establish one or more ad-hoc
	advisory committees to assist them in the selection of the
	various functions.  The names of the members of the
	committees, who do not need to be IAB members or IETF
	participants, will be made public through the IAB and IAOC
	minutes or otherwise.
      
</p>
<p>
	Members of these committees are expected to have an
	understanding of the RFC series and related processes, and of
	procedures and interests of the various streams.
      
</p>
<p>
	Members of the subcommittees will be privy to confidential
	material and are expected to honour confidentiality. Because
	they are subject to confidential material they are recused
	from bidding on any of the functions for which financial
	compensation is offered.
      
</p>
<p>
	The IAB and IAOC bear the responsibility for the selections of
	the candidates for defined functions, the committees provide
	advice and recommendations  but are not expected to act as
	nomination or selection committees.

Nominations and Eligibility</h3>

<p>
	  The IAB will be making a broad public call for nominations.
	  The public call will specify the manner by which nominations
	  will be accepted and the means by which the list of nominees
	  will be published. Self-nominations are permitted. Along
	  with the name and contact information for each candidate,
	  details about the candidate's background and qualifications
	  for the position should be attached to the nomination.
	
</p>
<p>
	  People that served on the ad-hoc advisory committee(s)
	  mentioned above are not eligible.  There are no further
	  limmitations. Specifically, nominees do not have to be
	  actively contributing to the IETF and active participation
	  as being a working group chair, an IETF Nominating Committee
	  member, or an IAB or IESG member is not a limitation.
	
</p>
<p>
	  IAB members who accept a nomination for an IAB-selected
	  position will recuse themselves from IAB selection
	  discussions.

Committees in 2009</h3>

<p>
	  During the 2009 selection process a committee assisted
	  the IAOC/IAB in creating the job descriptions and
	  statements of work. This committee may also assist in
	  assessing the bids made to the IAOC for the Production
	  Center and the RFC Publisher. Another committee, the Ad-hoc
	  Committee for selection of Editorial Functions, assists the
	  IAB in the assesment of the RFC Series Editor and the Independent
	  Submission Editor candidates.

<a name="rfc.section.A.2.3"></a><h3>A.2.3.&nbsp;
Selection</h3>

<p>
	  The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons prior to
	  making a decision, allowing time for the community to pass
	  any relevant comments to the IAB. When established, the
	  advisory committee will be asked to provide a motivated
	  shortlist. The IAB will review the nomination material, any
	  submitted comments, the shortlist from the advisory
	  committee, and make its selection.
	
</p>
<p>
	  It is noted that the community mentioned above is the
	  community with an interest in RFCs and the RFC Editor's
	  functioning, the IETF community is only a part of that
	  community.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The main intent is to select the superior candidate taking
	  considerations of continuity of the series into account.

Term of Office and Selection Time Frame</h3>

<p>
	  Subject to further negotiations and in the interest of
	  providing stability, terms of office are expected to be five
	  years with no restrictions on renewals and with provision
	  for shorter actual contracts and intermediate reviews. In
	  addition an effort should be made so that terms of office
	  for the RSE, ISE, and RFC Production Center do not terminate
	  concurrently.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The selection timeframe for 2009 is roughly:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
