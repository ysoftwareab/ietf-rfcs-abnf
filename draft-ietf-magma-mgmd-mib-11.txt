1. Introduction
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet
   Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [RFC1112], version 2 
   [RFC2236] or version 3 [RFC3376] and the Multicast Listener 
   Discovery (MLD) protocol version 1 [RFC2710] or version 2 [RFC3810]. 
   Both protocols provide multicast membership discovery capability. 
   IGMP pertains to IP version 4 clients, and MLD for IP version 6 
   clients. This version of the MIB module obsoletes both RFC 2933 
   [RFC2933] and RFC 3019 [RFC3019], incorporating a generic interface 
   for both IGMP and MLD implementations, and changes to enable 
   "source filtering" in multicast clients. The MIB module encompasses 
   both router and host nodes with relevant management objects defined 
   for each.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].
   

3. Overview

   This Multicast Group Membership Discovery (MGMD) MIB module contains 
   eight tables:

     1. the MGMD Host Interface Table which contains one row for each
        interface on which IGMP or MLD is enabled on a host.

     2. the MGMD Router Interface Table which contains one row for each


   Chesterfield           I-D - Expires May 2008            [Page 2]
               Multicast Group Membership Discovery MIB

        interface on which MGMD is enabled on a router,

     3. the MGMD Host Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular
        interface on a host. The table is optimised for lookup by
        IP multicast group, e.g., for enumerating the interfaces 
        per multicast group.

     4. the MGMD Router Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular
        interface on a router. The table is optimised for lookup by
        IP multicast group, e.g., for enumerating the interfaces 
        per multicast group.

     5. the reverse MGMD Host Table which contains one row for each IP 
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular 
        interface on a host. The table differs from the Host cache 
        table in that it is optimised for lookup by interface, e.g., 
        enumerating the multicast groups per interface.

     6. the reverse MGMD Router Table which contains one row for each 
        IP multicast group for which there are members on a particular 
        interface on a router. The table differs from the Router cache 
        table in that it is optimised for lookup by interface, e.g., 
        enumerating the multicast groups per interface.

     7. the MGMD HostSrcList Table which contains one row for each 
        entry in the source filter record for an interface and 
        multicast group pair on a host.
				
     8. the MGMD RouterSrcList Table which contains one row for each 
        entry in the source filter record for an interface and 
        multicast group pair on a router.

   All tables are intended for EITHER router OR host functionality as 
   indicated by the name and corresponding description, although it is 
   anticipated that there would be scenarios where both terms might 
   apply to a device, e.g. a router which joins a multicast group also 
   as a host for measurement purposes. The source list tables provide
   an extension to the cache tables to indicate the source specific 
   includes or excludes associated with each IP Multicast group on 
   each specific interface. This functionality is only supported in 
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 capable nodes.

   Incorporated within the MGMD MIB tables are objects for the
   management of IGMP and MLD proxy devices as described in [RFC4605].
   Proxy devices can be used in simple topologies where it is not
   necessary to run a full multicast routing protocol. A proxy device
   can make forwarding decisions based on IGMP or MLD group membership
   activity.

   The MIB module references InterfaceIndex and InterfaceIndexOrZero 
   objects as defined in [RFC2863], the MIB module that decribes generic

   objects for network interface sub-layers.

   Extensive references to the InetAddress and InetAddressType objects
   are made as defined in [RFC4001].

5. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  Access to read-only variables furthermore can
   present a security vulnerability. Retrieving information on group
   membership, interface reporting interval times etc.., can provide
   useful data to a targetted attack, or data mining operation without
   the administrator or user's knowledge. These are the tables and 
   objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
   
   a) The mgmdHostInterfaceTable provides a RowStatus variable
   (mgmdHostInterfaceStatus) with read-create access. Unauthorised
   access to the RowStatus variable can enable or disable multicast
   access on that interface thereby causing a denial of service 
   vulnerability. Additional read-create variables are the
   mgmdHostInterfaceVersion and the mgmdHostInterfaceVersion3Robustness,
   both of which might be used to cause denial of service to certain 
   or all hosts on attached interface.
   Access to read-only objects can also provide a
   large amount of feedback to an attacker on group membership and
   multicast network activity of the host.
   b) The mgmdRouterInterfaceTable provides a RowStatus variable
   (mgmdRouterInterfaceStatus) with read-create access. Unauthorised
   access to the RowStatus variable can enable or disable multicast
   access on that interface thereby causing a denial of service 
   vulnerability both to directly connected hosts and traffic being 
   routed through the device. Additional read-create variables are the
   mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryInterval, mgmdHostInterfaceVersionRobustness,
   mgmdRouterInterfaceLastMemberQueryInterval, 
   mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryMaxResponseTime,
   the mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion and mgmdRouterInterfaceProxyIfIndex,
   all of which might be used to cause disruption to hosts and/or
   multicast traffic, at the worst causing a denial of service.


   Chesterfield           I-D - Expires May 2008            [Page 30]
               Multicast Group Membership Discovery MIB

   Access to read-only objects, as with the host interface table,
   can provide feedback to an attacker on group membership and
   multicast network activity on the router and its interfaces. Such
   data might well serve as input to the formulation of alternative
   attacks.
   c) All other tables provide only read access to objects, however
   the use of such data can still provide a security vulnerability.
   Information on group membership, IP addresses, protocol versioning
   etc.. can be used to provide input into formulating alternative 
   attacks on hosts, routers and the applications that generate or
   receive multicast traffic.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include strong security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module (see View-Based Access Control for SNMP 
   [RFC3415]).

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy [RFC3414]).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


6. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------

   mgmdStdtMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree
   and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When
   the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
