Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                   December 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 2 ('v2') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   It obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629], which contained
   the original language definition, and which was subsequently extended
   ("v2").  Furthermore, it discusses potential extensions in a future
   revision ("v3").

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

1.1.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix C (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   [[anchor2: In the section below, some elements/attributes do not have
   a prose description yet.  This is because this is work-in-progress;
   feedback with accurate descriptions is appreciated.]]

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  The abstract ought to be
   self-contained and thus should not contain references or unexpanded
   abbreviations.  See Section 4.3 of [RFCSTYLE] for more information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.38)

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                   December 2013


2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <postal> element (Section 2.27)

   2.  One optional <phone> element (Section 2.26)

   3.  One optional <facsimile> element (Section 2.16)

   4.  One optional <email> element (Section 2.14)

   5.  One optional <uri> element (Section 2.42)

2.3.  <annotation>

   Provides additional prose augmenting a bibliographical reference.

   For instance:

   <annotation>
     Latest version available at <eref
     target='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml'/>.
   </annotation>

   ...will generate the text used in the reference for [XML].

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.30).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.45)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.15)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.20)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.12)

   o  <spanx> elements (Section 2.36)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area this document applies to
   (currently not used when generating documents).

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> is the only element in the vocabulary that provides full
   control of horizontal whitespace and line breaks, and thus is used
   for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  source code,

   o  formal languages (such as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this
      document),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing.  In this case,
   the textual content acts as fallback for output formats that do not
   support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a "line art"
   variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes the
   included image in sufficient detail.  Note that RFCs occasionally are
   published with enhanced diagrams; a recent example is [RFC5598].

   This element appears as child element of: <figure> (Section 2.17).

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   The suggested height of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case
   the graphics file essentially is in-lined.

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.

   The value either is a well-known keyword (such as "abnf"), or an

   Internet Media Type (see [RFC2046]).

   How it is used depends on context and application.  For instance, a
   formatter can attempt to syntax-highlight code in certain known
   languages.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   The suggested width of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.8.  'xml:space' attribute

   Determines whitespace handling.

   "preserve" is both the default value and the only meaningful setting
   anyway (because that's what the <artwork> element is for).

   See also Section 2.10 of [XML].

   Allowed values:

   o  "default"

   o  "preserve" (default)

2.6.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see Section 4.9 of [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.19).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <organization> element (Section 2.25)

   2.  One optional <address> element (Section 2.2)

2.6.1.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.6.2.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

2.6.3.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.6.4.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.7.  <back>

   Contains the "back" part of the document: the references and
   appendices.

   This element appears as child element of: <rfc> (Section 2.33).

   Content model:

   Content model: only text content.

2.12.  <cref>

   Represents a comment.

   Comments can be used in a document while it is work-in-progress.
   They usually appear either visually highlighted, at the end of the
   document (depending on file format and settings of the formatter), or
   not at all (when generating an RFC).

   This element appears as child element of: <annotation> (Section 2.3),
   <c> (Section 2.8), <postamble> (Section 2.28), <preamble>
   (Section 2.29), and <t> (Section 2.38).

   Content model: only text content.

2.12.1.  'anchor' attribute

   [[element.cref.attribute.anchor.missing: attribute description
   missing]]

2.12.2.  'source' attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.13.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references.

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see Section 8 of [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are
   left out, the processor will attempt to use the current system date
   if the attributes that are specified do match the system date.  Note
   that month names need to match the full (English) month name
   ("January", "February", "March", "April", "May, "June", "July",
   "August", "September", "October", "November", or "December") in order
   for expiration calculations to work.

   In the second case, the date information will be embedded as-is into
   the reference text.  Therefore, also vague dates ("ca. 2000"), date
   ranges, and so on, are allowed.

2.44.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group the document
   originates from, if any.  The recommended format is the official name
   of the Working Group (with some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>

5.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor7: This section is likely incomplete.]]

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document serves as the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml".  The following is to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                   December 2013


   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

      File extension(s):  .xml

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See
      Authors Section.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  N/A

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the "category" determines the "maturity level" (see Section
   4 of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for - surprise - "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the "<date>" element when
      archiving the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of
      submission.

   _Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER._ For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the "submissionType"
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | TLP      | starting with publication date |
   +----------+--------------------------------+

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published on
      the Standards Track.

A.2.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.2.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
      Contributions published or made publicly available before November

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3978 (March 2005).

A.2.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3667 (February 2004).

A.2.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.

B.2.  Changed Defaults

   Many attributes have lost their "default" value; this is to avoid
   having document semantics differ based on whether a DTD was specified

   <author>: The <organization> element is now optional.  The "role"
   attribute was added.  (Section 2.6)

   "align", "alt", "width", and "height".  (Section 2.17)

   <iref>: Has a new "primary" attribute.  (Section 2.20)

   <list>: The "style" attribute isn't restricted to a set of enumerated
   values anymore.  The "hangIndent" and "counter" attributes have been
   added.  (Section 2.22)

   <rfc>: The "ipr" attribute has gained additional values.  The
   attributes "consensus", "iprExtract", "submissionType", and "xml:
   lang" have been added.  (Section 2.33)

   <reference>: <annotation> allows adding prose to a reference.
   (Section 2.30)

   <references>: Can now appear multiple times, and carry a "title"
   attribute (so that normative and informative references can be
   split).  (Section 2.31)

   <section>: The new "toc" attribute controls whether it will appear in
   the Table Of Contents. <iref> can now appear as direct child element.
   (Section 2.34)

   <t>: The "anchor" attribute can now be used as well, however there
   are restrictions on how they can be referred to.  (Section 2.38)

   (This schema was derived from version 1.3.6 of the xml2rfc DTD
   ('Document Type Definition', [XML], Section 2.8), available from <htt
   p://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/xml2rfc/spec-v2/02/xml2rfcv2.dtd>).

Appendix D.  Proposed Future Changes for 'v3'

   Discussion of "v3" changes takes place on the rfc-interest mailing
   list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at
   <http://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest>.  See also
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rse/wiki/doku.php?id=design:xml-tags> for
   a related Wiki page.

D.1.  Contact Information

   If contact information is changed to allow non-ASCII characters: add
   a place for a ASCII fallback (probably just for the author names).

   The content model for <postal> ought to be more strict to allow at
   most one of <city>, <region>, <code>, and <country>.

   It should be possible to have multiple <email> and <uri> elements
   (see also <http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/36>).

   <facsimile> looks outdated, while a container for IM (messaging) URIs

   is missing.  Maybe this area needs to be aligned with vCard.

   Section 4.8 of [RFCSTYLE] hints at a "Contributors" Section that
   could supply contact information similar to the one in the auto-
   generated "Authors' Address" Section.  Consider how to capture
   contributor contact information (probably not using <author> to avoid
   confusion).  Furthermore, consider ways to augment the contact
   information section with prose.

D.2.  Figures

   Cleanup the set of overlapping attributes between <figure> and
   <artwork>.

   For artwork that consists of a sequence of items (such as messages in
   a protocol example), it would be good if a <figure> element could
   contain multiple <artwork> elements (to assist code to find good
   places for page breaks).

   Extend <figure> to support different types of artwork (such as by
   specifying certain type attribute values, see <http://greenbytes.de/
   tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html#artwork.types>), and also
   avoid having to markup code (such as ABNF) as "artwork".

   It would be good if "code components" could be marked as such.

   Finally, even in preformatted text use of markup could be useful to
   support (a) references, or (b) highlighting the important bits (<http
   ://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext-rfc2629.artwork>).

D.3.  Linking

   Extend <xref> so that subsection/anchors can be specified (see <http:
   //greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext-rfc2629.xref>).  Remove the "pageno" attribute
   which seems to be both undocumented and non-functional.

D.4.  Lists

   Allow multiple paragraphs in list items; eliminating the need to use
   <vspace> (see <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext.element.lt>).

D.5.  References

   Allow overriding the "anchor" attribute of an included <reference>
   element.

Internet-Draft                   XML2RFC                   December 2013


   Add a way to add prose to a reference that avoids abuse of
   <seriesInfo>.

   Allow <reference>s that identify a document set such as a BCP.

   Deprecate or remove the <format> element; right now it's not used for
   the generation of the plain text document anyway.

   It is unclear why the "anchor" attribute is optional.

D.6.  Archival Considerations

   When this vocabulary becomes the canonical RFC format, it will need
   to be able to capture all generated information, such as section/
   figure/table numbers, plus any auto-generated boilerplate (copyright
   statements etc.).

D.7.  Document Metadata

   Extend the concept of language tagging to at least examples and
   contact information to address potential japanese/chinese font
   confusion.

   Provide a way to indicate the intended level on the standards track.

   Include feedback information in a way so that generated documents can
   provide usable feedback links (see <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/
   rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html#ext.element.feedback>).

D.8.  Misc.

   Make the <date> element optional; all of its content is optional
   already.

   <spanx> has both a weird whitespace model ("preserve") and
   problematic styling.  Consider to deprecate it in favor of elements
   such as <em> and <code> (where the name "code" is already in use for
   region codes).

   Indented paragraphs currently can be created by abusing the <list>.
   It would be good to have a special element for this purpose.

   Provide a special element for generating citations (<http://
   greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/
   rfc2629xslt.html#ext.element.blockquote>).

   The content model for <cref> should be extended to allow more flow
   elements, such as <xref> and <eref>.

   Section titles should really be elements, not attributes (this would
   allow them to contain markup).

   Text tables are currently very constrained.  For instance, it would
   be good if alignment of headers and table cells could be de-coupled
   <http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/69>).

   Counters are currently restricted to lists, figures, and tables.
   Maybe there should be a generic mechanism that is not directly tied
   to other elements
   <http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/ticket/68>).
