1.  Introduction

   With the development of new network technologies such as cloud
   computing, 5G, IoT, etc., very many applications are carried over the
   network.  Each has different needs for network bandwidth, latency,
   jitter, and packet loss, etc.

   Work in the IETF is divided into Areas.  The demands of the new
   technologies motivates innovation and new architectures in multiple
   network layers, and resulting cross-area work is increasing in the
   IETF.  Existing protocol practice shows that people who focus on one
   specific area are sometimes not aware of related work in different
   areas.  Some cross-area work is not recognized until late in the
   lifecycle so that useful experiences cannot be shared early in the
   development.  Fixing problems that are identified late can become
   time consuming.

   This document investigates the benefits of cross-area work in the
   IETF.  It is examines existing cross-area work and identifies other
   possibilities for work that spans more than one area.  The intention

   is to help community members who focus their work within a specific
   area to understand related work in other areas and to motivate
   efficient cooperation across different areas in the IETF.

   SRv6: Segment Routing over IPv6

   MPLS: Multi-Protocol Label Switch

3.  SRv6

   Segment Routing is an important networking technology developed in
   the IETF.  SRv6 is the Segment Routing deployed on the IPv6 data
   plane[RFC8200] and SRv6 network programming
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] is introduced to support
   multiple services which have requirements on the SRv6 network.  The
   related areas and Working Groups for SRv6 are shown in Figure 1: the
   work can be categorized into Basics, Encapsulations, Protocols, YANG,
   Use cases, and Others.

4.  YANG Models

   Data models written in the YANG modelling language [RFC6020] can be
   used for service and network management to provide a programmatic
   approach for representing (virtual) services or networks and for
   deriving configuration information that will be forwarded to network
   and service components that are used to build and deliver the
   service.

   YANG module developers have taken both top-down and bottom-up
   approaches to develop modules [RFC8199] and to establish a mapping
   between network technology and customer requirements on the top or
   abstracting common construct from various network technologies on the
   bottom.  There are many data models including configuration and
   service models that have been specified or are being specified by the
   IETF.  They cover many of the networking protocols and techniques.

   Figure 2 is from [I-D.wu-model-driven-management-virtualization]
   provides and provides an overview of various macro-functional blocks
   at different levels that articulate the various YANG data modules.
   In this figure, example models developed in the IETF are layered as
   Network Service Models, Network Resource Models, and Network Element
   Models.  The Network Element Models are further layered into
   Composition Models and Function Models.

               Figure 2: An overview of Layered YANG Modules

   A Network Service Model [RFC8309] is a kind of high level data model.
   It describes a service and the parameters of the service in a
   portable way that can be used uniformly and independent of the
   equipment and operating environment.  In the OPS area, the Layer
   Three Virtual Private Network Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299] and the
   Layer Two Virtual Private Network Service Model (L2SM) [RFC8466]
   define L3VPN and L2VPN services that can be ordered by a customer
   from a network operator.  In the RTG area, the Virtual Network (VN)
   model[I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] provides a YANG data model
   generally applicable to any mode of VN operation.

Internet-Draft            Cross-Area IETF Work                 July 2019


   The category of Network Resource Models includes topology modules and
   tunnel modules worked on in the RTG area, as well as the resource
   management tool models worked in both the RTG and OPS areas.

   A Network Element model is used to describe how a service can be
   implemented by activating and tweaking a set of functions (enabled in
   one or multiple devices, or hosted in cloud infrastructures) that are
   involved in the delivery of the service.  This includes various
   models for individual protocols specified in the RTG, OPS, TSV, and
   INT areas.

5.  Network Intelligence/Telemetry

   It is conceivable that an intent-driven autonomic network [RFC7575]
   is the logical next step for network evolution following Software
   Defined Network (SDN).  This approach aims to reduce (or even
   eliminate) human labor, make the most efficient usage of network
   resources, and provide better services more aligned with customer
   requirements.  Although it takes time to reach the ultimate goal, the
   journey has started nevertheless.

   Network Intelligence and Telemetry are the cornerstone for the
   intent-driven autonomic network.

5.1.  Network Telemetry

   Network telemetry has emerged as a mainstream technical term to refer
   to the newer data collection and consumption techniques,
   distinguishing itself from the conventional techniques for network
   OAM.  Network Telemetry acquires network data remotely for network
   monitoring and operation.  It addresses the current network operation
   issues and enables smooth evolution toward intent-driven autonomous
   networks.

   The Network Telemetry Framework [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntf] provides a
   layered categorization for the telemetry technologies developed in
   the IETF across areas including OPS, TSV (IPPM working group), RTG
   (MPLS and NVO3 working groups), and INT (6MAN working group).  The
   categorization is shown in Figure 3.

          Figure 3: Layer Category of Network Telemetry Framework

   The categories shown in Figure 3 are as follows:

   - Management Plane Telemetry: This refers to work on the push
   extensions for NETCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].  This work is
   on-going in the NETCONF working group in the OPS area.

   - Control Plane Telemetry: BGP is a very important protocol in the
   control plane.  The GROW working group in the OPS area is developing
   the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to monitor BGP sessions
   and to provide a convenient interface for obtaining route views.

   - Data Plane Telemetry: In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT)
   [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework] is a new proposal that enumerates
   several key components and describes how they could be assembled to
   achieve a complete solution for on-path user traffic telemetry in
   carrier networks.  It includes two major modes that are described in
   further documents: Postcard mode in
   [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry] and Passport mode in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].
   [I-D.zhou-ippm-enhanced-alternate-marking] proposes a lightweight way
   to achieve most measurement requirements.  In general, the basic
   mechanism is discussed in the IPPM working group in the TSV area, and
   specific encapsulations are discussed in the working groups dedicated
   to the associated protocols including the 6MAN working group in the
   INT area for IPv6 and SRv6, and the MPLS and NVO3 working groups in
   the RTG area for MPLS and VXLAN.

5.2.  Network Intelligence

   Thanks to advances in computing and storage technologies, today's big
   data analytics gives network operators an unprecedented opportunity
   to gain network insights and move toward network autonomy.  Some
   operators have started to explore the application of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) to make sense of network data.  Software tools can
   use the network data to detect and react to network faults,
   anomalies, and policy violations, as well as to predict future
   events.  In turn, the network policy can be updated for planning,
   intrusion prevention, optimization, and self-healing.

   This topic is relatively new and requires a central place for
   discussion.  The IRTF's Network Management Research Group (NMRG)
   recently discussed Network Intent [I-D.li-nmrg-intent-classification]
   while [I-D.kim-nmrg-rl] presents intelligent network management
   scenarios based on reinforcement-learning approaches.

6.  5G Transport

   As work on the requirements, architecture, and protocols to support
   5G progress, cross-area work is gaining momentum to address major
   requirements for transport systems to underlie 5G.  This includes
   work on network slicing, deterministic latency/low latency, etc.

   1.  Network Slicing

   Transport network slicing involves work in the IETF RTG area and the
   INT area.  In the TEAS working group in the RTG area,
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] specifies a framework for using
   existing, modified, and potentially new networking technologies as
   components to provide Enhanced Virtual Private Network (VPN+)
   services to satisfy the network slicing requirement.  SR is an
   important transport technologies for network slicing and the SPRING
   working group is also involved.

   The DMM WG in the INT area focuses on the mobility work involved in
   supporting end-to-end network slicing.  When considering RAN slicing
   and Mobile Core slicing, other SDOs (such as 3GPP and the BBF) are
   also ntvolved, interacting with each other and with the IETF via
   liasions.

   2.  Deterministic latency/Low latency

   The main relevant WG is Detnet which belongs to the RTG area.  The
   technologies developed in the TSV area and the ART area can also
   provide the latency service.

7.  Cross-layer Work

   Layering is an important network design principle.  Cross-layer work
   often gives rise to cross-area work.

   As ideas around network services are progressing cross-layer work is
   as an important research are such as path-aware networking in the
   IRTF's Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), and application-
   aware IPv6 networking proposed by
   [I-D.li-6man-app-aware-ipv6-network].

7.1.  Path-Aware Networking

   Work on the path-aware network is being done in the PANRG.  The
   Internet architecture assumes a division between the end-to-end
   functionality of the transport layer and the properties of the path
   between endpoints.  Increased diversity in access networks, and
   ubiquitous mobile connectivity, have made this architecture's
   assumptions about paths less tenable.  Multipath protocols taking
   advantage of this mobile connectivity begin to show us a way forward:
   if endpoints cannot control the path, at least they can determine the
   properties of the path by choosing among paths available to them.
   The PANRG aims to support research in bringing path awareness to
   transport and application layer protocols, and to bring research in
   this space to the attention of the Internet engineering and protocol
   design community.

   The group's scope overlaps with existing IETF and IRTF efforts (and
   also with some past efforts).  Of the existing overlaps, the group
   collaborates with working groups and research groups chartered to
   work on multipath transport protocols (MPTCP, QUIC, TSVWG),
   congestion control in multiply-connected environments (ICCRG), and
   alternate routing architectures (e.g., PCE and LISP).  The charter is
   also related to the questions discussed in a number of past BoF
   sessions, e.g.  SPUD, PLUS, and BANANA.

7.2.  Application-aware IPv6 Networking

   [I-D.li-6man-app-aware-ipv6-network] proposes possible work on
   application-aware IPv6 networking (APN6).  As the Internet continues
   to develop, the decoupling of applications from network transport
   causes the operation actions on service provider networks to be
   pipelined which becomes the bottleneck of network service deployment.
   Moreover, a multitude of applications with varying needs for network
   bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss are being carried over
   the IP network.  However it is hard for the network to learn the
   applications' service requirements which make it difficult for an
   operator to provide truly fine-grain traffic operations for the

Internet-Draft            Cross-Area IETF Work                 July 2019


   applications and to guarantee their SLA requirements.  APN6 aims to
   make use of an IPv6 extensions header to convey the application
   related information including its requirements along with the packet
   to tell the network how to adjust the network resources to facilitate
   the deployment of services.

   The scope of the work overlaps with existing IETF and IRTF efforts
   including, but not limited to, multiple working groups in RTG area,
   the 6MAN working group in the INT area, and the IRTF's ICNRG and
   PANRG.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security is a fundamental part of all work done at the IETF.  At the
   least this requires security considerations to be part of every RFC
   published, and attention should also be given to privacy
   requirements.  This work is usually supported by reviews from
   security experts on the Security Directorate and is a good example of
   cross-area work.  Furthermore, when major new technologies are being
   developed within the IETF it is possible to ask for security advisors
   to be appointed for working groups.  And from time to time, new work
