Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it introduces extensions to
   several objects and textual conventions defined in the HDSL2-SHDSL
   Line MIB (RFC 3276) [RFC3276] to manage a G.SHDSL.bis interface.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

   This document describes extensions to several objects and textual
   conventions defined in the HDSL2-SHDSL Line MIB (RFC 3276) [RFC3276]
   to support equivalent management of a G.SHDSL.bis interface.  These
   extensions are based upon the specifications for G.SHDSL.bis
   as defined in the ITU documentation [ITUXXXX].

2.1.   Relationship of G.SHDSL.bis to G.SHDSL

   As discussed in RFC3276, G.SHDSL supports up to two wire pairs in
   a G.SHDSL line.  With G.SHDSL.bis, the ITU has extended the 
   specification of G.SHDSL to support an additional two pairs of wires.

INTERNET-DRAFT            G-SHDSL-BIS-LINE-MIB                March 2004

   Thus, to support G.SHDSL.bis, several textual conventions and objects 
   must have their ranges and enumerations changed.  

   A modified version of Figure 2 from RFC3276, section 4.3.1, is below:

2.2.  Changes to RFC 3276 Textual Conventions

    The textual convention, Hdsl2ShdslWirePair, is found in RFC3276:

    Hdsl2ShdslWirePair ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS    current
       DESCRIPTION
         "This is the referenced pair of wires in a HDSL2/SHDSL Segment.
          HDSL2 only supports a single pair (wirePair1), while SHDSL
          supports an optional second pair (wirePair2)."
       SYNTAX    INTEGER
               {
               wirePair1(1),
               wirePair2(2)
               }

    The introduction of two additional wire pairs on the line leads to 
    the following:

         "This is the referenced pair of wires in a HDSL2/SHDSL Segment.
          HDSL2 only supports a single pair (wirePair1), while SHDSL
          supports an optional second pair (wirePair2).  G.SHDSL.bis
          supports optional third and fourth wire pairs (wirePair3 
          and wirePair4)."
       SYNTAX    INTEGER
               {
               wirePair1(1),
               wirePair2(2),
               wirePair2(3),
               wirePair2(4)
               }
  
2.3.  Changes to RFC 3276 Objects

   The addition of two (optional) wire pairs leads to one direct
   and several indirect changes.  

2.3.1.   Changes to hdsl2ShdslConfWireInterface

   From RFC3276:

   hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      INTEGER
                   {
                   twoWire(1),
                   fourWire(2)
                   }
       MAX-ACCESS  read-create

       DESCRIPTION
         "This object configures the two-wire or optional four-wire
          operation for SHDSL Lines."
       DEFVAL      { twoWire }
       ::= { hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileEntry 2 }

   Two additional enumerations are required to support G.SHDSL.bis.

   hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      INTEGER
                   {

       DESCRIPTION
         "This object configures the number of wire pairs to be used
          in the line.  HDSL2 supports one pair (twoWire), SHDSL lines 
          support an optional, addition pair (fourWire), and 
          G.SHDSL.bis lines support up to four pairs (sixWire or 
          eightWire)."
       DEFVAL      { twoWire }
       ::= { hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileEntry 2 }

2.3.2.   Changes to Line Rate Objects

   Four objects in the HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB have rate limitations.  
   In each case, these objects have the syntax

        SYNTAX      Unsigned32(0..4112000)

   Changes introduced in G.SHDSL.bis support an increased upper rate
   of 5696 kbits/s, leading to the updated syntax

        SYNTAX      Unsigned32(0..5696000).

   These objects with updated syntax are listed below:

       hdsl2ShdslStatusMaxAttainableLineRate OBJECT-TYPE

          the line is capable of achieving.  This is based upon 
          measurements made during line probing."
       ::= { hdsl2ShdslSpanStatusEntry 2 }

       hdsl2ShdslStatusActualLineRate OBJECT-TYPE
           SYNTAX      Unsigned32(0..5696000)
           UNITS       "bps"

           "Contains the actual line rate in this HDSL2/SHDSL span.  
           This should equal ifSpeed."
       ::= { hdsl2ShdslSpanStatusEntry 3 }

      ::= { hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileEntry 4 }

2.4.  Changes to RFC 3276 Compliance Section

    To maintain dual compliance with the existing HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB,
    the compliance section must be extended.  To accomplish this, 
    the objects identified above are restated with their original
    ranges from RFC 3276.

        OBJECT hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface 
           SYNTAX      INTEGER
                       {

              as applicable for the original g.shdsl specification."

2.5.  Updated MIB Location 

    A version of the MIB object definitions found in RFC3276 modified
    to contain the above changes is available at:

           www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/SHDSL-BIS-LINE-MIB.mib

3.  Implementation Analysis

   A management application which supports RFC3276 could mistakenly 
   flag a unit which responds with a rate or wire pair which exceeds
   the ranges and/or enumerations specified in RFC3276.  For example,
   a G.SHDSL.bis line with four wire pairs would report statistics
   for wire pairs that do not exist in RFC3276.  That is, a GET-NEXT
   request issued with the object identifier:

        hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrAtn.1.1.1.2

   might return

        hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrAtn.1.1.1.3 = 0

   with a G.SHDSL.bis unit and

        hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrSnrMgn.1.1.1.1 = 0

   with an HDSL2 unit as these objects are indexed by

       INDEX  { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslEndpointSide,
                hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair }

   A management application which intends to manage G.SHDSL.bis
   agents, should be modified to accept this sequence.

   One should note that this same unmodified management application
   is still capable of managing G.SHDLS.bis agents albiet to the
   degree of G.SHDSL (non-bis) limitations.  That is, it can create
   and monitor configurations limited to two wire pairs with an 
   upper rate limit of 4112000 bits/second.

4.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations presented in RFC3276,
   it is conceivable that a management application could be broken
   by a G.SHDSL.bis agent which reports objects for additional
   wire pairs (as noted in section 3).  

   For example, if a management application blindly loaded object 
   instances into an array until the an object changes (during 
   repeated GET-NEXT requests).   It is anticipated that the 
   modifications to the management application code would be
   straightforward.  Perhaps, of the form:

                if (name[12] > 2)   reject();

   or
         
                if (*val > 4112000) reject();
