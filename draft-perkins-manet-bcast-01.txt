Abstract

   An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of which
   communicates over wireless channels and is capable of movement.
   Nodes participating in such an ad hoc network communicate on
   a peer-to-peer basis.  Broadcast is often a desired form of
   communication in these networks, as it can enable both the
   dissemination of control information and the delivery of data
   packets.  This document describes a method for providing broadcast
   communication in ad hoc networks.

Internet Draft     IP Broadcast in Ad hoc Networks      14 November 2000


1. Introduction

   This document makes a particular specification for a classical
   broadcast algorithm, as it can be used to disseminate IP packets
   across ad hoc networks.  Broadcast is needed in many circumstances;
   in particular, it is useful for the kind of route discovery
   operations that are required for on-demand route acquisition in
   several candidate manet protocols.

   This protocol specification works when the nodes sending broadcast
   packets ensure that each distinct broadcast packet that they send is
   tagged with a distinct value in the ident field of the IP header.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


2. Broadcast

   For the purposes of this document, the IPv4 broadcast address
   is 255.255.255.255.  The analogous address for IPv6 system-wide
   broadcast is the site-local All Routers multicast address
   (FF05::0002).  This document does not specify transmissions to any
   directed broadcast address.

   Every node maintains a list to keep track of which broadcast packets
   have already been received and retransmitted.  The list contains, for
   each distinct broadcast packet received, a value called the Broadcast
   Packet Identifier (BPI). For IPv4, this BPI is composed of the source
   IP address, the IP ident value, and the fragment offset values
   obtained from the IP header of the broadcast packet.  For IPv6, the
   BPI is calculated as specified in section 3.

   When a node receives a broadcast packet, it checks its list for the
   BPI of the broadcast packet's IP header [2].  If there is such a list
   entry with matching BPI, the node silently discards the broadcast
   packet since it has already been received.  The node then checks to
   see whether it is enabled for retransmitting broadcast packets.  By
   default, all nodes in the ad hoc network are so enabled; however,
   this is not required (see section 5).  If the node is not enabled for
   retransmitting broadcasts, it takes no further action.  If there is
   no existing list entry containing the same BPI, and if the node has
   been enabled to forward broadcast packets, the node retransmits the
   broadcast packet.

   List entries SHOULD be kept for at least BROADCAST_RECORD_TIME
   before the node expunges the record.  BROADCAST_RECORD_TIME

   is a configurable parameter, but it MUST be at least equal to
   NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME.


3. BPI computation for IPv6

   To obtain the BPI for IPv6 packets, a node uses MD5 [3] to perform
   the following calculation for the incoming broadcast packet:

      BPI = MD5 (IPv6 packet data).

   The IP packet data includes all non-mutable IPv6 headers and
   extensions, as well as any higher-level protocol data.  The source
   node for each broadcast MUST ensure that this BPI is distinct
   from the BPI from every other broadcast packet which the node
   has transmitted during the last BROADCAST_RECORD_TIME. In the
   unlikely event that the BPI value is identical to some such recently
   transmitted packet, the source node MUST add a Unique Identifier
   Destination Option to the broadcast packet (see section 4).


4. Unique Identifier Destination Option

   The Unique Identifier option is encoded in type-length-value (TLV)
   format as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Option Type  | Option Length |       Uniquifying Value       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Option Type

         TBD

      Option Length

         2

      Uniquifying Value

         The 16-bit Uniquifying Value is chosen to make the broadcast
         packet BPI computation different than that for any other
         broadcast packet from the same source node.

5. Selective Broadcast Retransmission

   By default, each node in the ad hoc network is enabled to retransmit
   each distinct broadcast packet that it receives.  However, in some
   cases, there may be additional control signaling in place that is
   used to reduce the number of nodes that perform this retransmission,
   in order to reduce the overall bandwidth consumption and congestion
   which can be caused by excessive broadcast.  This document does not
   specify any such control protocol to disable or enable such node
   selection.  However, an ad hoc network which employs such a node
   selection protocol can still be considered to be compliant with the
   broadcast protocol specified in this document.


6. Configuration Parameters

   This section gives default values for some important values
   associated with broadcast operations.  Mobile nodes in particular
   ad hoc networks may wish to change certain of the parameters, in
   particular the NET_DIAMETER and NODE_TRAVERSAL values.  Choice
   of these parameters may affect the robustness of the broadcast
   operation.

      Parameter Name          Value
      ----------------------  -----
      BROADCAST_RECORD_TIME   2 * NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME
      NET_DIAMETER            35
      NODE_TRAVERSAL_TIME     40
      NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME      3 * NODE_TRAVERSAL_TIME * NET_DIAMETER / 2



   NET_DIAMETER measures the maximum possible number of hops between
   two nodes in the network.  NODE_TRAVERSAL_TIME is a conservative
   estimate of the average one hop traversal time for packets and should
   include queuing delays, interrupt processing times and transfer
   times.  NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME is a conservative estimate of how long it
   should take for a message to traverse the entire ad hoc network.


7. Security Considerations

   This draft specifies a general mechanism for handling broadcast.
   It does not make any provision for securing the contents of the
   broadcast data, either to protect against tampering or to protect
   against unauthorized inspection of the data.

8. Acknowledgments

   This broadcast method is a codification of a well known algorithm
   which has been assumed for general use in various ad hoc protocols.
   Thus, the protocol specification in this draft should be considered
   the joint work of many engineers who have worked on producing ad hoc
   network protocols.  The authors of this draft hope that we have been
   able to faithfully and usefully represent the work of these many
   engineers.
