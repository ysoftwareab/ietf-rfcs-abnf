 A Use Case of Packets' Significance Difference with Media Scalability
             draft-dong-usecase-packet-significance-diff-01

Abstract

   This document introduces a use case of packets' significance
   difference embedded with media scalability.  With the dominance of
   video traffic on the Internet, selectively dropping packets or parts
   of packets from competing media streams becomes a complementary
   mechanism when dealing with network congestion.

   The document describes the characteristics of media scalability, some
   limitations of existing end-to-end congestion control mechanisms
   through rate control and adaptation, explains why current ways of
   entire packet dropping at the traffic class level using in-network
   active queue management are not most appropriate to meet end users'
   Quality of Service expectations.  The document identifies that there
   exists "significance difference" among packets or even among parts of
   the packets within a flow, and brings out a new set of requirements
   for application and network to support packet significance difference
   to improve the Quality of Experience of end users.

1.  Introduction

   Recent studies [CiscoNetworkingIndex] show that IP video traffic will
   be 82 percent of all consumer Internet traffic by 2021 in a global
   scale, up from 73 percent in 2016.  Live video has grown 15-fold from
   2016 to 2021, accounts for 13 percent of Internet video traffic by
   2021.  VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) traffic has
   increased 20-fold between 2016 and 2021, at a CAGR (Compound Annual
   Growth Rate) of 82 percent.  With the rapid growth of multimedia
   streaming traffic, it is increasingly likely that multiple streaming
   flows share a bottleneck link, which would inevitably cause network
   congestion.  Today's transport protocols and Internet protocols are
   oblivious to multimedia streaming applications or end users' QoE
   (Quality of Experience) expectations.  From the perspective of user
   experience and user expectation, the following two observations could
   be made.

   *  It is very likely that a user may prefer to acquire the media
      content in a somewhat degraded quality that is above the tolerance
      threshold rather than getting nothing at all for a few seconds.

   *  A user may be particularly interested in certain group of blocks
      belonging to the interested objects in the media content (i.e.,
      Region of Interest, RoI).  It is necessary to prevent the RoI
      blocks from being lost during transmission.

   At the beginning of this document, the different types of scalability
   are discussed in current video codecs, facilitating the rate control
   and adaptation mechanisms carried out in video segments when dealing
   with network congestion during the media streaming.  It is
   acknowledged that such mechanisms have efficiently improved users'
   QoE.  However, the packets on the wire cannot avoid the possibility
   of being entirely dropped when the bottleneck network nodes cannot
   retain them due to buffer overflowing during congestion.  Thanks to
   the scalability characteristics designed to the video codecs, it is
   not hard to find out that the importance or significance of different
   packets within a media streaming flow or even different parts of the
   single packet could vary for their usefulness in decoding and
   recovering the media content to meet receiver's expectation.  The
   document highlights the requirements of making the user' preference
   and application context aware to the network to help further improve
   the QoE of media streaming.  Accordingly, the network could treat the
   packets or different parts of the packets according to the
   characteristics of the packets and end users' preferences.

3.  Media Scalability and Congestion Control

   A visual scene is represented in digital form by sampling the real
   scene spatially on a rectangular grid in the video image plane and
   sampling temporally at regular time intervals as a sequence of still
   frames.  Correspondingly, modern media codec [Conklin2001] [Kim2001]
   incorporates three types of "Scalability": i.e., temporal
   scalability, spatial scalability, and quality scalability, which
   adapt the media bitstream by adding or removing some portions to/from
   it in order to match the different needs or preferences of end users
   as well as to the network conditions.

   Temporal scalability refers to scalability designed to allow the
   frame rate of the video bitstream to be varied using interlayer
   prediction.  Spatial scalability represents the spatial resolution
   variations with respect to the original image frame.  The lower layer
   provides the basic spatial resolution.  The enhancement layer employs
   the spatially interpolated lower layers and constructs the source
   video in its full spatial resolution.  Quality scalability is also
   commonly referred to as fidelity or SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
   scalability.  Each spatial layer could have many quality layers.  For
   example, SVC (Scalable Video Coding)[SVC] is an H.264 [H.264]
   extension that divides a single video bitstream into multiple
   representations or layers.  This hierarchical layered structure
   comprises a base layer and two enhancement layers.  The media may be
   scaled up by adding the enhancement layer(s) or scaled down by
   dropping the enhancement layer(s).  The levels of scalability
   included in the media stream affect the quality of media presented to
   the end users' devices.

   Bursty loss and longer-than-expected delay have catastrophic effect
   on QoE to end-users in media streaming.  They are usually caused by
   network congestion.  Despite all kinds of congestion control
   mechanisms developed in the community over the decades [Saadi2019]
   [Adams2013], they often target different goals, e.g., link
   utilization improvement, loss reduction, fairness enhancement.  By
   leveraging the flexibility and variety of media qualities provided by
   different types of media scalability, for media streaming, minimizing
   the possibility of network congestion can often be achieved by rate
   control and media adaptation methods.

   Existing rate control and adaptation methods [Bentaleb2019] [Wu2001]
   can be at source-side and receiver-side, which are carried at end
   devices and servers, respectively.

   *  In source-based schemes [Wu2000] , source regulates the sending
      rate to maintain the packet loss ratio below a threshold by
      employing the feedback from probing experiments, or source
      determines the sending rate through a TCP-friendly model.
      However, some constraints exist, media codecs can usually only
      adjust their output rates in a much more coarse-grained fashion
      than, for example, TCP.  Users' QoE would also suffer if encoding
      rates are switched too frequently.

   *  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)-based dynamic video adaptation
      methods [Kua2017] could be driven by source.  The server collects
      the feedback from the network and client (e.g., dynamic variation
      of network bandwidth and receiving buffer capacity of the client),
      and accordingly, the video quality will be adapted and streamed.
      On the other hand, adaptation techniques are also proposed at
      receiver-side, which mainly use DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
      over HTTP) [MPEG-DASH-SAND] [MPEG-DASH] and HAS (HTTP Adaptive
      Stream) for streaming adapted video data.

   *  The receiver-based rate control [McCanne1996] is typically used in
      multicasting scalable media content, which is split into multiple
      layers, with each layer corresponding to one channel in the
      multicast tree.  Receivers could regulate their own receiving
      rates by adding/dropping channels.  Thus receiver-based rate has
      its limited usage in unicasting.  All these techniques consider
      full quality while streaming from sender to receivers; hence, they
      consume more resources in the network.

4.  Packet Dropping

   Acknowledging the benefits offered by various congestion control and
   congestion avoidance mechanisms, we would like to point out that the
   feedback and rate adaption might not be prompt enough to cope with
   the dropping of packets on the wire.

   In the current Internet, a packet is treated as the minimal,
   independent, and self-sufficient unit that gets classified,
   forwarded, or dropped completely by a network node, according to the
   local configuration and congestion condition.  Although congestion
   discard can be mitigated by a mixture of ingress traffic shaping and
   active queue management mechanisms [Thiruchelvi2008] [Adams2013] to
   avoid any network resource overdrawn, it is not feasible to be
   deployed on a large scale, meanwhile wastes network resources
   preparing for the worst possible scenario.

   DiffServ [RFC2475] is is used to manage resources such as bandwidth
   and queuing buffers on a per-hop basis between different classes of
   traffic.  The Internet traffic may be separated into different
   classes with differentiated priorities.  This allows preferential
   treatment for latency or loss sensitive traffic over more tolerant
   applications, for example those that can afford retransmission.
   However, with video traffic dominating Internet traffic, flows of
   media streaming applications with the same class still compete for
   network resources when encountering bottleneck links and fighting
   network congestion, preference decided on traffic class would not be
   effective to eliminate the possibility of degraded service levels or
   packet drops due to collisions with each other.

   The routers treat every bit/byte in the packet payload equally, which
   means every bit/byte has the same significance to the routers.  Each
   to-be-dropped packet is discarded completely.  If the transport layer
   protocol is TCP, after timeout or duplicate acknowledgements received
   at the sender, the sender may re-try to send the dropped packet
   before the maximum number of re-transmissions reaches.
   Retransmission of packets wastes network resources, reduces the
   overall throughput of the connection and causes longer latency for
   the packet delivery.  The study [RFC8836] has shown that a loss rate
   of 1% is tolerable to users while a loss rate of 3% is intolerable to
   most users who found the quality to be annoying (or worse), according
   to the subjective opinions of the effects of packet loss on media
   quality.  Therefore, the current way of handling network congestion
   by discarding the packet entirely and retransmitting the packets in a
   blind-of-application-context manner is not very suitable for media
   streaming.

5.  Significance Difference Among Packets and Within Packets

   With the various scalability implemented in the media codec, some
   bits of an encoded media stream are more important than others.  Bits
   belonging to base layer usually are more significant to the decoder
   than bits belonging to enhancement layers.  For example, I-frames
   hold complete picture data [Orosz2015] and is frequently referenced
   by the subsequent frames.  It is inserted by the encoder when the
   scene changes.  Losing the first I-frame in the GOP (Group of
   Pictures) would cause video picture even missing for few seconds,
   because P- and B-frames referencing to the I-frame would not be
   decoded nor displayed either.  Thus, I-frames are most essential in
   the media stream, which have the most effect on perceived video
   quality, and such effect can last through the whole GOP.  P- and
   B-frames are inserted at appropriate places to reduce the video size
   or bitrate and are tuned to maintain a certain video quality level.
   P-frame stands for Predicted Frame and allows macroblocks to be
   compressed using temporal prediction in addition to spatial

Internet-Draft     draft-dong-packet-significance-diff      October 2021


   prediction.  A P-frame might be referenced by a P frame after it, or
   a B frame before or after it.  B-frame stands for bi-directional
   frame, which can be predicted using backward prediction and forward
   prediction.  A B-frame can act as a reference, and if so, it is
   termed as a reference B-frame.  If a B-frame is not to be used as a
   reference, it is called a non-reference B-frame.  Video scenes with a
   low level of movement are less sensitive to both B-frame and P-frame
   packet loss, alternatively video scenes with a high level of movement
   are more sensitive to both B-frame and P-frame packet loss.  A lost
   P-frame can impact the remaining part of the GOP.  A lost B-frame has
   only local effects in a slowly moving content or with large static
   background.  In a scene of a dynamically moving content, losing
   B-frame has more dramatic impact and its scale can be as far-reaching
   as a P-frame loss.

   As another example, macroblocks that are identified to represent the
   objects in RoI are likely more important than other macroblocks of
   non-RoI regions.  For packets carrying RoI macroblocks in the media
   stream need to have higher priority to be retained compared to other
   packets carrying non-RoI macroblocks.

   According to the characteristics of frames contained in the video
   packet payload, namely: frame type, whether the frames are referenced
   by other frames, movement level of the pictures, whether the picture
   contained in the packet belongs to RoI or not, etc., significance
   difference could present among packets for the video decoding at the
   receiver side and the QoE improvement of end users.  The dropping
   priority is possibly implemented at packet level in the network.

   On the other hand, let's say that the end-users can reveal their
   preferences to the network, e.g., degree of tolerance to the decoded
   media content' quality degradation, which might reflect visually such
   as resolution reduction, missing objects in non-RoI regions, the
   network could selectively drop packets in a differentiated manner
   according to such information.  This avoids retransmission or delay
   of those packets with higher significance, reduce the experienced
   end-to-end latency of end users, and maintain the continuous
   streaming of the media.  This is achieved at the cost of dropping
   lower-significance packets.

6.  New Requirements

   We have discussed in the previous sections that due to the various
   types of scalability implemented in the media codecs, "significance
   difference" exists among packets or even among parts of the packets.
   In other words, some packets containing the more important
   macroblocks (e.g., RoI macroblocks, base layer macroblocks) show
   higher significance than other packets for the media decoding at the

   receiver side and the improvement of QoE of end users.  In order for
   the network be able to treat the packets of media streams in a
   differentiated manner and at finer granularity than DiffServ, the
   application shall reveal some information to the network to enable
   selective packet dropping or partial packet dropping.  For example,
   an API could be implemented to input such information or metadata
   from the application. which might be mapped to IPv6 extension header,
   IPv4 options or a dedicated metadata field in the IP header.  Some
   examples of such information or metadata are listed below:

   *  Receiving end user's preference on media quality, e.g. tolerable
      quality degradation regarding for example resolution.

   *  Characteristics of media content contained in the packets, e.g.,
      frame type, whether the packet contains frames that are referenced
      by other frames, movement level of the video sample contained in
      the packet.

   *  Labeling of the packets or some parts of the packets that
      correspond to receiver's interested objects as RoI.

   Correspondingly, the network shall be able to leverage the above
   information revealed by the application, and selectively drop packets
   or parts of the packets from competing media streaming flows with
   precedence order when network congestion happens.  The retransmission
   could be maximumly eliminated.  The receiving end user is able to
   consume the delivered packets as many as possible in-time with
   acceptable quality.
