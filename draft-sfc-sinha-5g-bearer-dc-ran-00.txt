       5G-System Bearer Offloading for Dual Connectivity for RAN
                draft-sfc-sinha-5g-bearer-dc-ran-00

Abstract

   This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be 
   developed for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of the
   user's data in a scenario of dual-connectivity 3GPP access outlining
   the poor radio coverage issues. This document also outlines the
   faster user data mechanism accompanying 3GPP access of 5G user
   device via bearer offloading in case of a poor coverage.

1. Introduction

   5G system has been evolved to serve the user in more efficient way
   of meeting higher download and upload of user data for 5G Users
   accessing the network via wireline and wireless, in addition to
   Residential Gateway RG and IoT support. In 5G system Access and
   user experience is challenging for poor radio coverage (for both
   wi-fi and RAN) and the proposal in this document addresses to the
   problem of dual-connectivity of 3GPP access with Master-gNB having
   poor coverage.

        Figure 1 : Simplified 5G-system Architecture for RAN access

   For clarity in the current document proposal, multiple node/
   function like UDSF, NRF, and interfaces N9, N14 are not shown.

3.2 QoS 

   QFI is defined as Qos Flow ID is an identity to QoS flow in the 5G 
   system. All data traffic within a PDU session are labelled or 
   identified by QFI, it implies same QFI labelled data flow will 
   receive same traffic forwarding treatment like scheduling, priority
   etc.

   Data flow is via N3 (N3 and N9) interface, being encapsulated
   end-to-end. This flow is controlled by SMF, who provides QoS profile 
   during session establishment to R(AN) and provide the PDR to the UPF.
   Please Note that like 4G system, default QoS flow is applied to each
   PDU session and retain till lifetime span of connectivity. In case
   of non-3GPP access QFI is delivered to N3IWF entity (or NG-RAN) for 
   every time User Plane of the PDU session is established, modified or
   activated.

3.3 Dual Connectivity

Internet-Draft        5G Bearer Offloading DC for RAN         June 2018


   Dual connectivity (DC) concept developed for 3GPP access, functional
   support the network to make use of additional radio resource to 
   achieve required throughput in downlink and uplink of user data. This
   was introduced in 4G system support 5G data speed by addition of dual
   connectivity of UE with eNBs , master eNB and Secondary eNB and /or 
   eNodeB in congestion with gNB. This is achieved by addition of 
   Secondary eNodeB to the Master eNodeB. Master-eNB has full control
   to add, delete and HO (handover) of eNodeBs as and when needed.

3.4 Problem Statement

   Problem statement 1: Inspite in a Dual connectivity of 5G system user
   experience is impacted because of Master-gNB may have degrade radio
   condition and another Master-gNB is not available for handover where
   as Secondary-gNB is available with sufficient radio resource.

4. Proposal of Bearer Offloading Dual-Connectivity with 3GPP access

   The solution proposed in this document to solve the degrade Rf 
   condition at Master-gNB while handover to another Master-gNB is
   not possible and UE have better or improved Rf condition with 
   Secondary-gNB(as compared to Master-gNB).

   Figure 2, show below shows how radio resource control can be handed
   over from Master-gNB to Secondary-gNB.

   - 5G user (UE) is being served by Master-gNB
   - Master-gNB adds Secondary-gNB for delivering user data to UE
   - UE is register to 5G-core via Master-gNB , whereas there is no
     user context available between Secondary-gNB and AMF
   - There is X2 interface between master-gNB and Secondary-gNB defined
     in 3GPP specification.
   - User data is deliver over N3 interface between UPF and Master-gNB
   - Master-gNB splits the partial User data over x2 interface to 
     Secondary-gNB.

    Figure 2: Bearer Offloading Dual-Connectivity with 3GPP access only

   - Based on Measurement report, Master-gNB take decision to execute a
     procedure of handover to Secondary-gNB with SCG configuration. 
   - Secondary-gNB establish connection with AMF to cater user's all 
     signalling and data traffic. 
   - Master-gNB also provides a radio (Rf) bearer splitting template
     termed as 'FILTER'. This bearer template FILTER is delivered to
     UPF via SMF. 
   - UPF now shift the user data on N3 interface from Master-gNB to 
     Secondary-gNB. This Secondary-gNB will act as new Master-gNB.

Internet-Draft        5G Bearer Offloading DC for RAN         June 2018

   Please note that this FILTER value in this scenario of handover from
   Master-gNB to Secondary-gNB MUST empty or NULL, implies that user
   traffic segregation is completely governed by AMF and SMF based on
   PCC rules and policies.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations related to the 5G systems are discussed in
   [NGMN].  Due to the request for intrinsic realization of security
   such aspects have to be considered by design for architecture and
   protocols.

   Especially as a joint usage of resources and network functions by
   different separate logical network slices (e.g. in terms of virtual
   network functions) seems to be inevitable in the framework of 5G the
   need for strong security measures in such an environment is a major
   challenge.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Support of full privacy of the users (customers and tenants / end
   service providers) is a basic feature of the next generation trusted
   and reliable communications offering system.  Such a high degree of
   ensured privacy shall be reflected in the proposed architecture and
   protocol solutions.

   Especially as Identifiers and mapping of locators to them are
   addressed some privacy concerns arise.  Mobility solutions tend to
   expose unique identifiers.  A solution inside the mobile network
   exposes these identifiers to the network operator, which is not a big
   deal since the network operator already has information about the
   device's location.  In contrast, an IP level solution exposes both
   the identifiers and the locations at the IP layer.  That means that
   web sites, for example, can now track the device's successive
   locations by watching the IP address.  Solutions such as transporting
   the identifiers not as part of the IP header should be considered.
