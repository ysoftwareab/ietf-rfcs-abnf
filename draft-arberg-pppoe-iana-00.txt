1. Introduction

   This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding the registration of values related to 
   the PPP over Ethernet Protocol (PPPoE), defined in [RFC2516], in
   accordance with BCP 26, [RFC2434].  It also reserves PPPoE TAG
   values that are or have been in use on the Internet.


1.1 Terminology

   The following terms are used here with the meanings defined in
   BCP 26:  "name space", "assigned value", "registration".

   The following policies are used here with the meanings defined in
   BCP 26: "Private Use", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review",
   "Specification Required", "IETF Consensus", "Standards Action".


1.2 Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. IANA Considerations

   The PPPoE protocol as defined in [RFC2516] defines one name space 
   that requires registration, the PPPoE TAG.


2.1 Recommended Registration Policies

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "PPPoE TAG Values". These are
   16-bit values. PPPoE TAG values already in use are specified as 
   reserved in this document, all other TAG values between 0 and 65535 
   are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" 
   policy defined in [RFC2434]. 

   A TAG-Name and a point of contact MUST be provided for any assignment 
   from this registry.

   If a specification description exists, a reference to this SHOULD
   also be provided.


2.2 Reserved PPPoE TAG Values

   TAG Value            TAG Name                         Reference
