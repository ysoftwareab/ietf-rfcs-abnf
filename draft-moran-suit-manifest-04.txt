                SUIT CBOR manifest serialisation format
                      draft-moran-suit-manifest-04

Abstract

   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest is
   a bundle of metadata about the firmware for an IoT device, where to
   find the firmware, the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic
   information protecting the manifest.

1.  Introduction

   A firmware update mechanism is an essential security feature for IoT
   devices to deal with vulnerabilities.  While the transport of
   firmware images to the devices themselves is important there are
   already various techniques available, such as the Lightweight
   Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol offering device management of IoT
   devices.  Equally important is the inclusion of meta-data about the

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   conveyed firmware image (in the form of a manifest) and the use of
   end-to-end security protection to detect modifications and
   (optionally) to make reverse engineering more difficult.  End-to-end
   security allows the author, who builds the firmware image, to be sure
   that no other party (including potential adversaries) can install
   firmware updates on IoT devices without adequate privileges.  This
   authorization process is ensured by the use of dedicated symmetric or
   asymmetric keys installed on the IoT device: for use cases where only
   integrity protection is required it is sufficient to install a trust
   anchor on the IoT device.  For confidentiality protected firmware
   images it is additionally required to install either one or multiple
   symmetric or asymmetric keys on the IoT device.  Starting security
   protection at the author is a risk mitigation technique so firmware
   images and manifests can be stored on untrusted respositories; it
   also reduces the scope of a compromise of any repository or
   intermediate system to be no worse than a denial of service.

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the high-level
   firmware update architecture [Architecture].  This document is
   structured as follows: In Section 8 we describe the main building
   blocks of the manifest and Section 12 contains the description of the
   CBOR of the manifest.

   The SUIT manifest is heavily optimised for consumption by constrained
   devices.  This means that it is not constructed as a conventional
   descriptive document, as described in [Behaviour].  This means that a
   user viewing the contents of the document will require tooling to
   view the contents in a more descriptive way.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   -  SUIT: Sofware Update for the Internet of Things, the IETF working
      group for this standard.

   -  Payload: A piece of information to be delivered.  Typically
      Firmware for the purposes of SUIT.

   -  Resource: A piece of information that is used to construct a
      payload.

   -  Manifest: A piece of information that describes one or more
      payloads, one or more resources, and the processors needed to
      transform resources into payloads.

   -  Update: One or more manifests that describe one or more payloads.

   -  Update Authority: The owner of a cryptographic key used to sign
      updates, trusted by recipient devices.

   -  Recipient: The system, typically an IoT device, that receives a
      manifest.

   -  Condition: A test for a property of the Recipient or its
      components.

   -  Directive: An action for the Recipient to perform.

   -  Command: A Condition or a Directive.

3.  SUIT digest container

   RFC 8152 [RFC8152] provides containers for signature, MAC, and
   encryption, but no basic digest container.  The container needed for
   a digest requires a type identifier and a container for the raw
   digest data.  Some forms of digest may require additional parameters.
   These can be added following the digest.  Algorithm identifiers
   defined in RFC 6920 [RFC6920] are reused for this digest container.
   This structure is described by the following CDDL:

   SUIT_Digest = [
    suit-digest-algorithm-id : $suit-digest-algorithm-ids,
    suit-digest-bytes : bytes,
    ? suit-digest-parameters : any
   ]

   ; Named Information Hash Algorithm Identifiers
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha256
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha256-128
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha256-120
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha256-96
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha256-64
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha256-32
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha384
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha512
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha3-224
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha3-256
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha3-384
   digest-algorithm-ids /= algorithm-id-sha3-512

4.  Distributing firmware

   Distributing firmware in a multi-party environment is a difficult
   operation.  Each party requires a different subset of data.  Some
   data may not be accessible to all parties.  Multiple signatures may
   be required from parties with different authorities.  This topic is
   covered in more depth in [Architecture]

5.  Workflow of a device applying a firmware update

   The manifest is designed to work with a pull parser, where each
   section of the manifest is used in sequence.  The expected workflow
   for a device installing an update can be broken down into 5 steps:

   1.  Verify the signature of the manifest

   2.  Verify the applicability of the manifest

   3.  Resolve dependencies

   4.  Fetch payload(s)

   5.  Install payload(s)

   When installation is complete, similar information can be used for
   validating and running images in a further three steps:

   1.  Verify image(s)

   2.  Load image(s)

   3.  Run image(s)

   When multiple manifests are used for an update, each manifest's steps
   occur in a lockstep fashion; all manifests have dependency resolution
   performed before any manifest performs a payload fetch, etc.

6.  SUIT manifest goals

   The manifest described in this document is intended to simplify the
   construction of constrained device firmware update solutions.  It is
   also intended to allow update authors to describe complex update
   processes for complex devices.

   Manifests implemented as descriptive documents require changes to the
   parser and the information model whenever a new feature is added.
   This is particularly accentuated when the parser is a fixed-function
   minimal parser (or a pull parser) such as the type that is typically



Moran, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   used in a bootloader or in a constrained client.  The issue is not as
   significant in devices that can use general purpose parsers.

   The manifest detailed in this document aims to address these and more
   problems by changing the processing model from a piece of software
   that loads a manifest, interprets the data, then performs some
   actions, into a model in which the software performs exactly the
   operations stated in the manifest, in order.  This allows the
   manifest to encode data in a way that matches precisely with what the
   parser expects.  It also makes inflexible code, like a bootloader,
   more flexible in what it can do; because the manifest defines part of
   the "program," the manifest's execution defines part of the behaviour
   of the system.  Further detail on this approach is covered in
   [Behaviour]

   The SUIT manifest can be used for a variety of purposes throughout
   its lifecycle.  The manifest allows:

   1.  the Firmware Author to reason about releasing a firmware.

   2.  the Network Operator to reason about compatibility of a firmware.

   3.  the Device Operator to reason about the impact of a firmware.

   4.  the Device Operator to manage distribution of firmware to
       devices.

   5.  the Plant Manager to reason about timing and acceptance of
       firmware updates.

   6.  the device to reason about the authority & authenticity of a
       firmware prior to installation.

   7.  the device to reason about the applicability of a firmware.

   8.  the device to reason about the installation of a firmware.

   9.  the device to reason about the authenticity of a firmware at
       boot.

   Each of these uses happens at a different stage of the manifest
   lifecycle, so each has different requirements.

   To verify authenticity at boot time, only the smallest portion of the
   manifest is required.  This core part of the manifest describes only
   the fully installed firmware and any of its dependencies.

7.  SUIT manifest design overview

   In order to provide flexible behaviour to constrained devices, while
   still allowing more powerful devices to use their full capabilities,
   the SUIT manifest takes a new approach, encoding the required
   behaviour of a Recipient device, instead of just presenting the
   information used to determine that behaviour.  This gives benefits
   equivalent to those provided by a scripting language or byte code,
   with two substantial differences.  First, the language is extremely
   high level, consisting of only the operations that a device may
   perform during update and secure boot of a firmware image.  The
   language specifies behaviours in a linearised form, without branches
   or loops.  Conditional processing is supported, and parallel and out-
   of-order processing may be performed by sufficiently capable devices.

   By structuring the data in this way, the manifest processor becomes a
   very simple engine that uses a pull parser to interpret the manifest.
   This pull parser invokes a series of command handlers that evaluate a
   Condition or execute a Directive.  Most data is structured in a
   highly regular pattern, which simplifies the parser.

   The results of this allow a Recipient with minimal functionality to
   perform complex updates with reduced overhead.  Conditional execution
   of commands allows a simple device to perform important decisions at
   validation-time, such as which differential update to download for a
   given current version, or which hash to check, based on the
   installation address.

   Dependency handling is vastly simplified as well.  Dependencies
   function like subroutines of the language.  When a manifest has a
   dependency, it can invoke that dependency's commands and modify their
   behaviour by setting parameters.  Because some parameters come with
   security implications, the dependencies also have a mechanism to
   reject modifications to parameters on a fine-grained level.

   Developing a robust permissions system works in this model too.  The
   Recipient can use a simple ACL that is a table of Identities and
   Component Identifier permissions to ensure that only manifests
   authenticated by the appropriate identity have access to define a
   component.

   Capability reporting is similarly simplified.  A Recipient can report
   the Commands and Parameters that it supports.  This is sufficiently
   precise for a manifest author to create a manifest that the Recipient
   can accept.

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   The simplicity of design in the Recipient due to all of these
   benefits allows even a highly constrained platform to use advanced
   update capabilities.

7.1.  Severable Elements

   Because the manifest can be used by different actors at different
   times, some parts of the manifest can be removed without affecting
   later stages of the lifecycle.  This is called "Severing."  Severing
   of information is achieved by separating that information from the
   signed container so that removing it does not affect the signature.
   This means that ensuring authenticity of severable parts of the
   manifest is a requirement for the signed portion of the manifest.
   Severing some parts makes it possible to discard parts of the
   manifest that are no longer necessary.  This is important because it
   allows the storage used by the manifest to be greatly reduced.  For
   example, no text size limits are needed if text is removed from the
   manifest prior to delivery to a constrained device.

   Elements are made severable by removing them from the manifest,
   encoding them in a bstr, and placing a SUIT_Digest of the bstr in the
   manifest so that they can still be authenticated.  The SUIT_Digest
   typically consumes 4 bytes more than the size of the raw digest,
   therefore elements smaller than (Digest Bits)/8 + 4 SHOULD never be
   severable.  Elements larger than (Digest Bits)/8 + 4 MAY be
   severable, while elements that are much larger than (Digest Bits)/8 +
   4 SHOULD be severable.

7.2.  Conventions

   The map indices in this encoding are reset to 1 for each map within
   the structure.  This is to keep the indices as small as possible.
   The goal is to keep the index objects to single bytes (CBOR positive
   integers 1-23).

   Wherever enumerations are used, they are started at 1.  This allows
   detection of several common software errors that are caused by
   uninitialised variables.  Positive numbers in enumerations are
   reserved for IANA registration.  Negative numbers are used to
   identify application-specific implementations.

   CDDL names are hyphenated and CDDL structures follow the convention
   adopted in COSE [RFC8152]: SUIT_Structure_Name.

7.3.  Payloads

   Payloads can take many forms, for example, binary, hex, s-record,
   elf, binary diff, PEM certificate, CBOR Web Token, serialised
   configuration.  These payloads fall into two broad categories: those
   that require installation-time unpacking and those that do not.
   Binary, PEM certificate, and CBOR Web Token do not require
   installation-time unpacking.  Hex, s-record, elf, and serialised
   configuration require installation-time unpacking.

   Some payloads cannot be directly converted to a writable binary
   stream.  Hex, s-record, and elf may contain gaps and they have no
   guarantee of monotonic increase of address, which makes pre-
   processing them into a binary stream difficult on constrained
   platforms.  Serialised configuration may be unpacked into a
   configuration database, which makes it impossible to preprocess into
   a binary stream, suitable for direct writing.

   Where a specialised unpacking algorithm is needed, a digest is not
   always calculable over an installed payload.  For example, an elf,
   s-record or hex file may contain gaps that can contain any data,
   while not changing whether or not an installed payload is valid.
   Serialised configuration may update only some device data rather than
   all of it.  This means that the digest cannot always be calculated
   over an installed payload when a specialised installer is used.

   This presents two problems for the manifest: first, it must indicate
   that a specialised installer is needed and, second, it cannot provide
   a hash of the payload that is checkable after installation.  These
   two problems are resolved in two ways:

   1.  Payloads that need a specialised installer must indicate this in
       suit-payload-info-unpack.

   2.  Payloads that need specialised verification must indicate this in
       the SUIT_Payload section or SUIT_Parameter_Image_Digest by
       indicating a SUIT_Digest algorithm that correctly validates their
       information.

8.  Manifest Structure

   The manifest is divided into several sections in a hierarchy as
   follows:

   1.  The outer wrapper

       1.  The authentication wrapper

8.1.  Outer wrapper

   This object is a container for the other pieces of the manifest to
   provide a common mechanism to find each of the parts.  All elements
   of the outer wrapper are contained in bstr objects.  Wherever the
   manifest references an object in the outer wrapper, the bstr is
   included in the digest calculation.

   The CDDL that describes the wrapper is below

SUIT_Outer_Wrapper = {
    suit-authentication-wrapper => bstr .cbor
                                   SUIT_Authentication_Wrapper / nil,
    suit-manifest               => bstr .cbor Manifest,
    suit-dependency-resolution  => bstr .cbor SUIT_Command_Sequence,
    suit-payload-fetch          => bstr .cbor SUIT_Command_Sequence,
    suit-install                => bstr .cbor SUIT_Command_Sequence,
    suit-text-external          => bstr .cbor SUIT_Text_Info,
    suit-coswid-external        => bstr .cbor COSWID
}
suit-authentication-wrapper = 1
suit-manifest = 2
suit-dependency-resolution = 7
suit-payload-fetch = 8
suit-install = 9
suit-text = 13
suit-coswid = 14

SUIT_Authentication_Wrapper = [ * (COSE_Mac_Tagged / COSE_Sign_Tagged /
                                   COSE_Mac0_Tagged / COSE_Sign1_Tagged)]

   All elements of the outer wrapper must be wrapped in a bstr to
   minimize the complexity of the code that evaluates the cryptographic
   integrity of the element and to ensure correct serialisation for
   integrity and authenticity checks.

   The suit-authentication-wrapper contains a list of 1 or more
   cryptographic authentication wrappers for the core part of the
   manifest.  These are implemented as COSE_Mac_Tagged or
   COSE_Sign_Tagged blocks.  The Manifest is authenticated by these
   blocks in "detached payload" mode.  The COSE_Mac_Tagged and
   COSE_Sign_Tagged blocks are described in RFC 8152 [RFC8152] and are
   beyond the scope of this document.  The suit-authentication-wrapper
   MUST come first in the SUIT_Outer_Wrapper, regardless of canonical
   encoding of CBOR.  All validators MUST reject any SUIT_Outer_Wrapper
   that begins with any element other than a suit-authentication-
   wrapper.

   A manifest that has not had authentication information added MUST
   still contain the suit-authentication-wrapper element, but the
   content MUST be null.

   suit-manifest contains a Manifest structure, which describes the
   payload(s) to be installed and any dependencies on other manifests.

   Each of suit-dependency-resolution, suit-payload-fetch, and suit-
   payload-installation contain the severable contents of the
   identically named portions of the manifest, described in Section 8.2.

   suit-text contains all the human-readable information that describes
   any and all parts of the manifest, its payload(s) and its
   resource(s).

   suit-coswid contains a Concise Software Identifier.  This may be
   discarded by the recipient if not needed.

8.2.  Manifest

   The manifest describes the critical metadata for the referenced
   payload(s).  In addition, it contains:

   1.  a version number for the manifest structure itself

   2.  a sequence number

   3.  a list of dependencies

   4.  a list of components affected

   5.  a list of components affected by dependencies

   6.  a reference for each of the severable blocks.

   7.  a list of actions that the recipient should perform.

   The following CDDL fragment defines the manifest.

   Several fields in the Manifest can be either a CBOR structure or a
   SUIT_Digest.  In each of these cases, the SUIT_Digest provides for a
   severable field.  Severable fields are RECOMMENDED to implement.  In
   particular, text SHOULD be severable, since most useful text elements
   occupy more space than a SUIT_Digest, but are not needed by recipient
   devices.  Because SUIT_Digest is a CBOR Array and each severable
   element is a CBOR bstr, it is straight-forward for a recipient to
   determine whether an element has been severed.

   The suit-manifest-version indicates the version of serialisation used
   to encode the manifest.  Version 1 is the version described in this
   document. suit-manifest-version is MANDATORY.

   The suit-manifest-sequence-number is a monotonically increasing anti-
   rollback counter.  It also helps devices to determine which in a set
   of manifests is the "root" manifest in a given update.  Each manifest

   MUST have a sequence number higher than each of its dependencies.
   Each recipient MUST reject any manifest that has a sequence number
   lower than its current sequence number.  It MAY be convenient to use
   a UTC timestamp in seconds as the sequence number. suit-manifest-
   sequence-number is MANDATORY.

   suit-dependencies is a list of SUIT_Dependency blocks that specify
   manifests that must be present before the current manifest can be
   processed. suit-dependencies is OPTIONAL.

   In order to distinguish between components that are affected by the
   current manifest and components that are affected by a dependency,
   they are kept in separate lists.  Components affected by the current
   manifest include the digest and size of the result.  Components
   affected by a manifest only include the component identifier and the
   index of the manifest that fully defines the component.

   suit-components is a list of SUIT_Component blocks that specify the
   vital information about the content a component identifier should
   contain following the update.  These are the component identifiers
   that will be affected by the content of the current manifest. suit-
   components is OPTIONAL, but at least one manifest MUST contain a
   suit-components block.

   suit-dependency-components is a list of SUIT_Component_Reference
   blocks that specify component identifiers that will be affected by
   the content of a dependency of the current manifest. suit-dependency-
   components is OPTIONAL.

   suit-common is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute prior to executing
   any other command sequence.  Typical actions in suit-common include
   setting expected device identity and image digests when they are
   conditional (see Section 11 for more information on conditional
   sequences). suit-common is OPTIONAL.

   suit-dependency-resolution is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute in
   order to perform dependency resolution.  Typical actions include
   configuring URIs of dependency manifests, fetching dependency
   manifests, and validating dependency manifests' contents. suit-
   dependency-resolution is MANDATORY when suit-dependencies is present.

   suit-payload-fetch is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute in order to
   obtain a payload.  Some manifests may include these actions in the
   suit-install section instead if they operate in a streaming
   installation mode.  This is particularly relevant for constrained
   devices without any temporary storage for staging the update. suit-
   payload-fetch is OPTIONAL.

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   suit-install is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute in order to
   install a payload.  Typical actions include verifying a payload
   stored in temporary storage, copying a staged payload from temporary
   storage, and unpacking a payload. suit-install is OPTIONAL.

   suit-validate is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute in order to
   validate that the result of applying the update is correct.  Typical
   actions involve image validation and manifest validation. suit-
   validate is MANDATORY.  If the manifest contains dependencies, one
   process-dependency invocation per dependency or one process-
   dependency invocation targeting all dependencies SHOULD be present in
   validate.

   suit-load is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute in order to prepare a
   payload for execution.  Typical actions include copying an image from
   permanent storage into RAM, optionally including actions such as
   decryption or decompression. suit-load is OPTIONAL.

   suit-run is a SUIT_Command_Sequence to execute in order to run an
   image. suit-run typically contains a single instruction: either the
   "run" directive for the bootable manifest or the "process
   dependencies" directive for any dependents of the bootable manifest.
   suit-run is OPTIONAL.  Only one manifest in an update may contain the
   "run" directive.

   suit-text-info is a digest that uniquely identifies the content of
   the Text that is packaged in the OuterWrapper. text is OPTIONAL.

   suit-coswid is a digest that uniquely identifies the content of the
   concise-software-identifier that is packaged in the OuterWrapper.
   coswid is OPTIONAL.

8.3.  SUIT_Dependency

   SUIT_Dependency specifies a manifest that describes a dependency of
   the current manifest.

   The following CDDL describes the SUIT_Dependency structure.

   SUIT_Dependency = {
       suit-dependency-digest => SUIT_Digest,
       suit-dependency-prefix => SUIT_Component_Identifier,
   }

   The suit-dependency-digest specifies the dependency manifest uniquely
   by identifying a particular Manifest structure.  The digest is
   calculated over the Manifest structure instead of the COSE
   Sig_structure or Mac_structure.  This means that a digest may need to



Moran, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   be calculated more than once, however this is necessary to ensure
   that removing a signature from a manifest does not break dependencies
   due to missing 'body_protected' and 'body_signed' elements.  This is
   also necessary to support the trusted intermediary use case, where an
   intermediary re-signs the Manifest, removing the original signature,
   potentially with a different algorithm, or trading COSE_Sign for
   COSE_Mac.

   The suit-dependency-prefix element contains a
   SUIT_Component_Identifier.  This specifies the scope at which the
   dependency operates.  This allows the dependency to be forwarded on
   to a component that is capable of parsing its own manifests.  It also
   allows one manifest to be deployed to multiple dependent devices
   without those devices needing consistent component hierarchy.  This
   element is OPTIONAL.

8.4.  SUIT_Component

   The SUIT_Component describes an image that is uniquely defined by the
   current manifest.  It consists of three elemnts: the component
   identifier that represents a component that will be affected by this
   manifest.  This excludes components that are affected by
   dependencies.  The following CDDL describes the SUIT_Component.

   SUIT_Component = {
       suit-component-identifier => SUIT_Component_Identifier,
       ? suit-component-size => uint,
       ? suit-component-digest => Digest,
   }

   Because suit-component-size and suit-component-digest can be
   dependent on installation offset, they cannot be exclusively
   contained in SUIT_Component.  However, since these are security
   critical parameters, these parameters are updated to match the
   contents of suit-components prior to processing suit-common.  If
   absent, these are set to Zero and NULL, respectively.  This enforces
   that the manifest defining a component is the only manifest that can
   describe its contents.

8.5.  SUIT_Component_Reference

   The SUIT_Component_Reference describes an image that is defined by
   another manifest.  This is useful for overriding the behaviour of
   another manifest, for example by directing the recipient to look at a
   different URI for the image or by changing the expected format, such
   as when a gateway performs decryption on behalf of a constrained
   device.  The following CDDL describes the SUIT_Component_Reference.

   SUIT_Component_Reference = {
       suit-component-identifier => SUIT_Component_Identifier,
       suit-component-dependency-index => uint
   }

8.6.  Manifest Parameters

   Many conditions and directives require additional information.  That
   information is contained within parameters that can be set in a
   consistent way.  Parameters MUST only be:

   1. Integers
   2. Byte strings
   3. Booleans

   This allows reduction of manifest size and replacement of parameters
   from one manifest to the next.  Byte strings MAY contain CBOR-encoded
   objects.

   The defined manifest parameters are described below.

   Each parameter contains a Skip/Append flag.  Append is an advanced
   feature that is not available on highly constrained platforms.  The
   mechanism for setting the Append flag is TBD.

   CBOR-encoded object parameters are still wrapped in a bstr.  This is
   because it allows a parser that is aggregating parameters to
   reference the object with a single pointer and traverse it without
   understanding the contents.  This is important for modularisation and
   division of responsibility within a pull parser.  The same
   consideration does not apply to Conditions and Directives because
   those elements are invoked with their arguments immediately

8.6.1.  SUIT_Parameter_Strict_Order

   The Strict Order Parameter allows a manifest to govern when
   directives can be executed out-of-order.  This allows for systems
   that have a sensitivity to order of updates to choose the order in
   which they are executed.  It also allows for more advanced systems to
   parallelise their handling of updates.  Strict Order defaults to
   True.  It MAY be set to False when the order of operations does not
   matter.  When arriving at the end of a command sequence, ALL commands
   MUST have completed, regardless of the state of
   SUIT_Parameter_Strict_Order.  If SUIT_Parameter_Strict_Order is
   returned to True, ALL preceding commands MUST complete before the
   next command is executed.

8.6.2.  SUIT_Parameter_Coerce_Condition_Failure

   When executing a command sequence inside SUIT_Run_Sequence and a
   condition failure occurs, the manifest processor aborts the sequence.
   If Coerce Condition Failure is True, it returns Success.  Otherwise,
   it returns the original condition failure.
   SUIT_Parameter_Coerce_Condition_Failure is scoped to the enclosing
   SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence.  Its value is discarded when
   SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence terminates.

8.7.  SUIT_Parameter_Encryption_Info

   Encryption Info defines the mechanism that Fetch or Copy should use
   to decrypt the data they transfer.  SUIT_Parameter_Encryption_Info is
   encoded as a COSE_Encrypt_Tagged or a COSE_Encrypt0_Tagged, wrapped
   in a bstr

8.8.  SUIT_Parameter_Compression_Info

   Compression Info defines any information that is required for a
   device to perform decompression operations.  Typically, this includes
   the algorithm identifier.

8.11.  SUIT_Command_Sequence

   A SUIT_Command_Sequence defines a series of actions that the
   recipient MUST take to accomplish a particular goal.  These goals are
   defined in the manifest and include:

   1.  Dependency Resolution

   2.  Payload Fetch

   3.  Payload Installation

   4.  Image Validation

   5.  Image Loading

   6.  Run or Boot

   Each of these follows exactly the same structure to ensure that the
   parser is as simple as possible.

   Lists of commands are constructed from two kinds of element:

   1.  Conditions that MUST be true-any failure is treated as a failure
       of the update/load/boot

   2.  Directives that MUST be executed.

   The lists of commands are logically structured into sequences of zero
   or more conditions followed by zero or more directives.  The
   *logical* structure is described by the following CDDL:

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   Command_Sequence = {
       conditions => [ * Condition],
       directives => [ * Directive]
   }

   This introduces significant complexity in the parser, however, so the
   structure is flattened to make parsing simpler:

   SUIT_Command_Sequence = [ + (SUIT_Condition/SUIT_Directive) ]

   Each condition and directive is composed of:

   1.  A command code identifier

   2.  An argument block

   Argument blocks are defined for each type of command.

   Many conditions and directives apply to a given component, and these
   generally grouped together.  Therefore, a special command to set the
   current component index is provided with a matching command to set
   the current manifest index.  This index is a numeric index into the
   component ID tables defined at the beginning of the document.  For
   the purpose of setting the index, the two component ID tables are
   considered to be concatenated together.

   To facilitate optional conditions, a special directive is provided.
   It runs a new list of conditions/directives that are contained as an
   argument to the directive.  It also contains a flag that indicates
   whether or not a failure of a condition should indicate a failure of
   the update/boot.

8.12.  SUIT_Condition

   Conditions are used to define mandatory properties of a system in
   order for an update to be applied.  They can be pre-conditions or
   post-conditons of any directive or series of directives, depending on
   where they are placed in the list.  Conditions include:

   Each condition MUST report a success code on completion.  If a
   condition reports failure, then the current sequence of commands MUST
   terminate.  If a recipient encounters an unknown Condition Code, it
   MUST report a failure.

   Positive Condition numbers are reserved for IANA registration.
   Negative numbers are reserved for proprietary, application-specific
   directives.

8.12.1.  ID Conditions

   There are three identifier-based conditions:
   SUIT_Condition_Vendor_Identifier, SUIT_Condition_Class_Identifier,
   and SUIT_Condition_Device_Identifier.  Each of these conditions
   present a RFC 4122 [RFC4122] UUID that MUST be matched by the
   installing device in order to consider the manifest valid.

   These conditions MAY be used with or without an argument.  If an
   argument is supplied, then it must be the RFC 4122 [RFC4122] UUID

   that must be matched for the condition to succeed.  If no argument is
   supplied, then the recipient uses the ID parameter that has already
   been set using the Set Parameters directive.  If no ID has been set,
   this condition fails.  SUIT_Condition_Class_Identifier and
   SUIT_Condition_Vendor_Identifier are MANDATORY to implement.
   SUIT_Condition_Device_Identifier is OPTIONAL to implement.

8.12.2.  SUIT_Condition_Image_Match

   Verify that the current component matches the supplied digest.  If no
   digest is specified, then the digest is verified against the digest
   specified in the Components list.  If no digest is specified and the
   component is not present in the Components list, the condition fails.
   SUIT_Condition_Image_Match is MANDATORY to implement.

8.12.3.  SUIT_Condition_Image_Not_Match

   Verify that the current component does not match the supplied digest.
   If no digest is specified, then the digest is compared against the
   digest specified in the Components list.  If no digest is specified
   and the component is not present in the Components list, the
   condition fails.  SUIT_Condition_Image_Not_Match is OPTIONAL to
   implement.

8.12.4.  SUIT_Condition_Use_Before

   Verify that the current time is BEFORE the specified time.
   SUIT_Condition_Use_Before is used to specify the last time at which
   an update should be installed.  One argument is required, encoded as
   a POSIX timestamp, that is seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00.
   Timestamp conditions MUST be evaluated in 64 bits, regardless of
   encoded CBOR size.  SUIT_Condition_Use_Before is OPTIONAL to
   implement.

8.12.5.  SUIT_Condition_Minimum_Battery

   SUIT_Condition_Minimum_Battery provides a mechanism to test a
   device's battery level before installing an update.  This condition
   is for use in primary-cell applications, where the battery is only
   ever discharged.  For batteries that are charged,
   SUIT_Directive_Wait_Event is more appropriate, since it defines a
   "wait" until the battery level is sufficient to install the update.
   SUIT_Condition_Minimum_Battery is specified in mWh.
   SUIT_Condition_Minimum_Battery is OPTIONAL to implement.

8.12.6.  SUIT_Condition_Update_Authorised

   Request Authorisation from the application and fail if not
   authorised.  This can allow a user to decline an update.  Argument is
   an integer priority level.  Priorities are application defined.
   SUIT_Condition_Update_Authorised is OPTIONAL to implement.

8.12.7.  SUIT_Condition_Version

   SUIT_Condition_Version allows comparing versions of firmware.
   Verifying image digests is preferred to version checks because
   digests are more precise.  The image can be compared as:

   -  Greater

   -  Greater or Equal

   -  Equal

   -  Lesser or Equal

   -  Lesser

   Versions are encoded as a CBOR list of integers.  Comparisons are
   done on each integer in sequence.

   The following CDDL describes SUIT_Condition_Version_Argument

SUIT_Condition_Version_Argument = [
    suit-condition-version-comparison: SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Types,
    suit-condition-version-comparison: SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Value
]
SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Types /= SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Greater
SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Types /= SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Greater_Equal
SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Types /= SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Equal

SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Equal = 3
SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Lesser_Equal = 4
SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Lesser = 5

SUIT_Condition_Version_Comparison_Value = [+int]

   While the exact encoding of versions is application-defined, semantic
   versions map directly:

   -  1.2-beta = [1,2,-2]

   -  1.2-alpha = [1,2,-3]

   -  1.2-alpha4 = [1,2,-3,4]

   SUIT_Condition_Version is OPTIONAL to implement.

8.12.8.  SUIT_Condition_Custom

   SUIT_Condition_Custom describes any proprietary, application specific
   condition.  This is encoded as a negative integer, chosen by the
   firmware developer, and a bstr that encodes the parameters passed to
   the system that evaluates the condition matching that integer.
   SUIT_Condition_Custom is OPTIONAL to implement.

8.12.9.  Identifiers

   Many conditions use identifiers to determine whether a manifest
   matches a given recipient or not.  These identifiers are defined to
   be RFC 4122 [RFC4122] UUIDs.  These UUIDs are explicitly NOT human-
   readable.  They are for machine-based matching only.

   A device may match any number of UUIDs for vendor or class
   identifier.  This may be relevant to physical or software modules.
   For example, a device that has an OS and one or more applications
   might list one Vendor ID for the OS and one or more additional Vendor
   IDs for the applications.  This device might also have a Class ID
   that must be matched for the OS and one or more Class IDs for the
   applications.

   A more complete example: A device has the following physical
   components: 1.  A host MCU 2.  A WiFi module

   This same device has three software modules: 1.  An operating system
   2.  A WiFi module interface driver 3.  An application

   Suppose that the WiFi module's firmware has a proprietary update
   mechanism and doesn't support manifest processing.  This device can
   report four class IDs:

   1.  hardware model/revision

   2.  OS

Internet-Draft          Firmware Manifest Format              March 2019


   3.  WiFi module model/revision

   4.  Application

   This allows the OS, WiFi module, and application to be updated
   independently.  To combat possible incompatibilities, the OS class ID
   can be changed each time the OS has a change to its API.

   This approach allows a vendor to target, for example, all devices
   with a particular WiFi module with an update, which is a very
   powerful mechanism, particularly when used for security updates.

8.12.9.1.  Creating UUIDs:

   UUIDs MUST be created according to RFC 4122 [RFC4122].  UUIDs SHOULD
   use versions 3, 4, or 5, as described in RFC4122.  Versions 1 and 2
   do not provide a tangible benefit over version 4 for this
   application.

   The RECOMMENDED method to create a vendor ID is: Vendor ID =
   UUID5(DNS_PREFIX, vendor domain name)

   The RECOMMENDED method to create a class ID is: Class ID =
   UUID5(Vendor ID, Class-Specific-Information)

   Class-specific information is composed of a variety of data, for
   example:

   -  Model number

   -  Hardware revision

   -  Bootloader version (for immutable bootloaders)

   When a Recipient executes a Directive, it MUST report a success code.
   If the Directive reports failure, then the current Command Sequence
   MUST terminate.

8.13.1.  SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index

   Set Component Index defines the component to which successive
   directives and conditions will apply.  The supplied argument MUST be
   either a boolean or an unsigned integer index into the concatenation
   of suit-components and suit-dependency-components.  If the following
   directives apply to ALL components, then the boolean value "True" is
   used instead of an index.  True does not apply to dependency
   components.  If the following directives apply to NO components, then
   the boolean value "False" is used.  When
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index is used,
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index = False is implied.  When
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index is used,
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index = False is implied.

   The following CDDL describes the argument to
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index.

   SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index_Argument = uint/bool

8.13.2.  SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index

   Set Manifest Index defines the manifest to which successive
   directives and conditions will apply.  The supplied argument MUST be
   either a boolean or an unsigned integer index into the dependencies.
   If the following directives apply to ALL dependencies, then the
   boolean value "True" is used instead of an index.  If the following
   directives apply to NO dependencies, then the boolean value "False"
   is used.  When SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index is used,
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index = False is implied.  When
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index is used,
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Component_Index = False is implied.

   Typical operations that require SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index
   include setting a source URI, invoking "Fetch," or invoking "Process
   Dependency" for an individual dependency.

   The following CDDL describes the argument to
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index.

   SUIT_Directive_Set_Manifest_Index_Argument = uint/bool

8.13.3.  SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence

   To enable conditional commands, and to allow several strictly ordered
   sequences to be executed out-of-order, SUIT_Run_Sequence allows the
   manifest processor to execute its argument as a
   SUIT_Command_Sequence.  The argument must be wrapped in a bstr.

   When a sequence is executed, any failure of a condition causes
   immediate termination of the sequence.

   The following CDDL describes the SUIT_Run_Sequence argument.

 SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence_Argument = bstr .cbor SUIT_Command_Sequence

   When SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence completes, it forwards the last
   status code that occurred in the sequence.  If the Coerce on
   Condition Failure parameter is true, then SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence
   only fails when a directive in the argument sequence fails.

   SUIT_Parameter_Coerce_Condition_Failure defaults to False when
   SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence begins.  Its value is discarded when
   SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence terminates.

8.13.4.  SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence_Conditional

   This command is exactly the same as SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence,
   except that it initialises Coerce on Condition Failure to True.

   SUIT_Parameter_Coerce_Condition_Failure defaults to True when
   SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence_Conditional begins.  Its value is
   discarded when SUIT_Directive_Run_Sequence_Conditional terminates.

8.13.5.  SUIT_Directive_Process_Dependency

   Execute the commands in the common section of the current dependency,
   followed by the commands in the equivalent section of the current
   dependency.  For example, if the current section is "fetch payload,"
   this will execute "common" in the current dependency, then "fetch
   payload" in the current dependency.  Once this is complete, the
   command following SUIT_Directive_Process_Dependency will be
   processed.

   If the current dependency is False, this directive has no effect.  If
   the current dependency is True, then this directive applies to all
   dependencies.  If the current section is "common," this directive
   MUST have no effect.

   When SUIT_Process_Dependency completes, it forwards the last status
   code that occurred in the dependency.

   The argument to SUIT_Directive_Process_Dependency is defined in the
   following CDDL.

   SUIT_Directive_Process_Dependency_Argument = nil

8.13.6.  SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters

   SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters allows the manifest to configure
   behaviour of future directives by changing parameters that are read
   by those directives.  When dependencies are used,
   SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters also allows a manifest to modify the
   behaviour of its dependencies.

   Available parameters are defined in Section 8.6.

   If a parameter is already set, SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters will
   skip setting the parameter to its argument.  This provides the core

   of the override mechanism, allowing dependent manifests to change the
   behaviour of a manifest.

   The argument to SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters is defined in the
   following CDDL.

   SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters_Argument = {+ SUIT_Parameters}

   N.B.: A directive code is reserved for an optimisation: a way to set
   a parameter to the contents of another parameter, optionally with
   another component ID.

8.13.7.  SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameter_State_Append

   This command is reserved for future use.  It will provide a mechanism
   to override the "set if unset" logic of SUIT_Directive_Set_Parameters
   on a per-parameter basis.  This will allow certain parameters to be
   treated as lists, rather than fixed values.  This enables a feature
   for an advanced device to fail over from URIs defined in one manifest
   to those defined in another.

8.13.8.  SUIT_Directive_Override_Parameters

   SUIT_Directive_Override_Parameters replaces any listed parameters
   that are already set with the values that are provided in its
   argument.  This allows a manifest to prevent replacement of critical
   parameters.

   Available parameters are defined in Section 8.6.

   The argument to SUIT_Directive_Override_Parameters is defined in the
   following CDDL.

   SUIT_Directive_Override_Parameters_Argument = {+ SUIT_Parameters}

8.13.9.  SUIT_Directive_Fetch

   SUIT_Directive_Fetch instructs the manifest processor to obtain one
   or more manifests or payloads, as specified by the manifest index and
   component index, respectively.

   SUIT_Directive_Fetch can target one or more manifests and one or more
   payloads.  SUIT_Directive_Fetch retrieves each component and each
   manifest listed in component-index and manifest-index, respectively.
   If component-index or manifest-index is True, instead of an integer,
   then all current manifest components/manifests are fetched.  The
   current manifest's dependent-components are not automatically

   fetched.  In order to pre-fetch these, they MUST be specified in a
   component-index integer.

   SUIT_Directive_Fetch typically takes no arguments unless one is
   needed to modify fetch behaviour.  If an argument is needed, it must
   be wrapped in a bstr.

   SUIT_Directive_Fetch reads the URI List parameter to find the source
   of the fetch it performs.

   The behaviour of SUIT_Directive_Fetch can be modified by setting one
   or more of SUIT_Parameter_Encryption_Info,
   SUIT_Parameter_Compression_Info, SUIT_Parameter_Unpack_Info.  These
   three parameters each activate and configure a processing step that
   can be applied to the data that is transferred during
   SUIT_Directive_Fetch.

   The argument to SUIT_Directive_Fetch is defined in the following
   CDDL.

   SUIT_Directive_Fetch_Argument = nil/bstr

8.13.10.  SUIT_Directive_Copy

   SUIT_Directive_Copy instructs the manifest processor to obtain one or
   more payloads, as specified by the component index.
   SUIT_Directive_Copy retrieves each component listed in component-
   index, respectively.  If component-index is True, instead of an
   integer, then all current manifest components are copied.  The
   current manifest's dependent-components are not automatically copied.
   In order to copy these, they MUST be specified in a component-index
   integer.

   The behaviour of SUIT_Directive_Copy can be modified by setting one
   or more of SUIT_Parameter_Encryption_Info,
   SUIT_Parameter_Compression_Info, SUIT_Parameter_Unpack_Info.  These
   three parameters each activate and configure a processing step that
   can be applied to the data that is transferred during
   SUIT_Directive_Copy.

   *N.B.* Fetch and Copy are very similar.  Merging them into one
   command may be appropriate.

   SUIT_Directive_Copy reads its source from
   SUIT_Parameter_Source_Component.

   The argument to SUIT_Directive_Copy is defined in the following CDDL.

   SUIT_Directive_Copy_Argument = nil

8.13.11.  SUIT_Directive_Run

   SUIT_Directive_Run directs the manifest processor to transfer
   execution to the current Component Index.  When this is invoked, the
   manifest processor MAY be unloaded and execution continues in the
   Component Index.  Arguments provided to Run are forwarded to the
   executable code located in Component Index, in an application-
   specific way.  For example, this could form the Linux Kernel Command
   Line if booting a linux device.

   If the executable code at Component Index is constructed in such a
   way that it does not unload the manifest processor, then the manifest
   processor may resume execution after the executable completes.  This
   allows the manifest processor to invoke suitable helpers and to
   verify them with image conditions.

   The argument to SUIT_Directive_Run is defined in the following CDDL.

   SUIT_Directive_Run_Argument = nil/bstr

8.13.12.  SUIT_Directive_Wait

   SUIT_Directive_Wait directs the manifest processor to pause until a
   specified event occurs.  Some possible events include:

   1.  Authorisation

   2.  External Power

   3.  Network availability

   4.  Other Device Firmware Version

   5.  Time

   6.  Time of Day

   7.  Day of Week

9.  Dependency processing

   Dependencies need careful handling on constrained systems.  A
   dependency tree that is too deep can cause recursive handling to
   overflow stack space.  Systems that parse all dependencies into an
   object tree can easily fill up available memory.  Too many
   dependencies can overrun available storage space.

   The dependency handling system in this document is designed to
   address as many of these problems as possible.

   Dependencies MAY be addressed in one of three ways:

   1.  Iterate by component

   2.  Iterate by manifest

   3.  Out-of-order

   Because each manifest has a list of components and a list of
   components defined by its dependencies, it is possible for the
   manifest processor to handle one component at a time, traversing the
   manifest tree once for each listed component.  This, however consumes
   significant processing power.

   Alternatively, it is possible for a device with sufficient memory to
   accumulate all parameters for all listed component IDs.  This will
   naturally consume more memory, but it allows the device to process
   the manifests in a single pass.

   It is expected that the simplest and most power sensitive devices
   will use option 2, with a fixed maximum number of components.

   Advanced devices may make use of the Strict Order parameter and
   enable parallel processing of some segments, or it may reorder some
   segments.  To perform parallel processing, once the Strict Order
   parameter is set to False, the device may fork a process for each
   command until the Strict Order parameter is returned to True or the
   command sequence ends.  Then, it joins all forked processes before
   continuing processing of commands.  To perform out-of-order
   processing, a similar approach is used, except the device consumes
   all commands after the Strict Order parameter is set to False, then
   it sorts these commands into its prefered order, invokes them all,
   then continues processing.

10.  Access Control Lists

   To manage permissions in the manifest, there are three models that
   can be used.

   First, the simplest model requires that all manifests are
   authenticated by a single trusted key.  This mode has the advantage
   that only a root manifest needs to be authenticated, since all of its
   dependencies have digests included in the root manifest.

   This simplest model can be extended by adding key delegation without
   much increase in complexity.

   A second model requires an ACL to be presented to the device,
   authenticated by a trusted party or stored on the device.  This ACL
   grants access rights for specific component IDs or component ID
   prefixes to the listed identities or identity groups.  Any identity
   may verify an image digest, but fetching into or fetching from a
   component ID requires approval from the ACL.

   A third model allows a device to provide even more fine-grained
   controls: The ACL lists the component ID or component ID prefix that
   an identity may use, and also lists the commands that the identity
   may use in combination with that component ID.

11.  Creating conditional sequences

   For some use cases, it is important to provide a sequence that can
   fail without terminating an update.  For example, a dual-image XIP
   MCU may require an update that can be placed at one of two offsets.
   This has two implications, first, the digest of each offset will be
   different.  Second, the image fetched for each offset will have a
   different URI.  Conditional sequences allow this to be resolved in a
   simple way.

   The following JSON representation of a manifest demonstrates how this
   would be represented.  It assumes that the bootloader and manifest
   processor take care of A/B switching and that the manifest is not
   aware of this distinction.

14.  IANA Considerations

   Several registries will be required for:

   -  standard Commands

   -  standard Parameters

   -  standard Algorithm identifiers

   -  standard text values

15.  Security Considerations

   This document is about a manifest format describing and protecting
   firmware images and as such it is part of a larger solution for
   offering a standardized way of delivering firmware updates to IoT
   devices.  A more detailed discussion about security can be found in
   the architecture document [Architecture] and in [Information].
