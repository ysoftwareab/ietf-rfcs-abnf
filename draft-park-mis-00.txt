Abstract

   In this draft, we discuss how to make use of multiple interfaces in a
   single mobile router.  We will focus on the scenario in which each
   interface is attached to different access network.  Especially, we
   propose how a mobile router selects proper interfaces to provide

   services to different traffic flows.  We suggest two methods to do
   that.  First we suggest a new option carried in IPv6 hop-by-hop
   options header, and we will use the flow label field in the IPv6 main
   header.  The flow label field is used to distinguish different
   packets belonging to different traffic flows.  New option contains a
   service type value and a preference value.  A servie type value is
   used for traffic classification, and a preference value enables
   mobile router to control the traffic in detail.  The propsed multiple
   interface selection mechanism in a multihomed mobile router (MMR)
   chooses an appropriate interface for each flow, depending on traffic
   requirements and access network characteristics.

1.  Introduction

   Every access network has its own characteristics, like QoS support,
   bandwidth, charging policy, etc.  Such various network
   characteristics can provide a wide sprectrum of network services to
   users.  A multihomed mobile router(MMR) has multiple kinds of
   wireless interfaces, each of which is attached to different access
   networks.

   We focus on the way how to select an interface to forward the traffic
   to exploit the various characteristics of wireless network.  So each
   traffic flow would specify its requirements such as QoS level,
   latency, etc.  In this way, users can be provided differentiated and
   customized services.  And network operators can control MMR in detail
   with policies.

   The requirement of each flow can be included in the IPv6 hop-by-hop
   options header.  We suggest a new option that contains two values, a
   service type value and a preference value.  The classified flow will
   be forwarded to an appropriate access network, which is determined by
   the multiple interface selection mechanism that orders several access
   networks depending on the flow requirements and predefined policies.
   The flow information and forwarding interface information will be
   inserted in a flowbase, so that the subsequent packets in the same
   flow will be forwarded directly without any repeating steps.


2.  Terminology

   Flow

      A flow is a sequence of packets sent from a particular source to a
      particular unicast/anycast/multicast destination that the source
      desires to label.

   Multihomed mobile router

      A multihomed mobile router (MMR) is a mobile router that has two
      or more interfaces, each of which provides connectivity to
      different access network.

   Flowbase

      A flowbase consists of a source address, a destination address, a
      flow label and a forwarding interface for each flow to be
      forwarded by the multihomed mobile router.

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   Flow label

      A flow label is a pseudo-randomly generated number which can be
      used to identify between two flows which have the same source and
      destination points.

   Metric vector

      A metric vector is a vector which contains normalized values of
      traffic characteristics.

   Metric function

      A metric function computes a single metric value by inner-
      producting two metric vectors.

   Policy

      A policy is a set of rules that determines what a metric vector
      looks like.


3.  Traffic classification

   ITU presented a guidance of traffic classification in [1].  And we
   modified the traffic classification into has 4 classes of traffic.
   Here is the description about each traffic class.

   VoIP traffic

      VoIP traffic is for transmission of voice call over IP.  VoIP
      traffic consists of same small size packets, and it is delay-
      sensitive.  So VoIP traffic should be able to be serviced with
      small latency, small jitter, or large bandwidth.

   Video traffic

      Like VoIP traffic, video traffic is also delay-sensitive.  And
      video traffic packets are VBR in nature.  Large bandwidth would be
      helpful for transmitting video traffic.

   Data

      The other packets for user applications are classified into this
      class.  Data traffic is typically insensitive of QoS parameters
      such as latency, jitter.  Data traffic even does not need to be
      guaranteed to get a certain level of bandwidth.

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   Control

      Small packet size, delay-sensitive control traffic is used for IP-
      level control message, such as ICMPv6 message.  Control traffic
      does not need large bandwidth, nor high-level QoS suppport.


4.  Multiple interface selection framework overview

   Our general framework looks like this:

                              |

                              v

              Figure 1. Multiple interface selection framework

4.1.  Flow label

   In IPv6 specification [2], we have a 20-bit flow label field in the
   IPv6 header.  The flow label field is used to distinguish a flow from
   the others.  A source node should assign a pseudo-randomly generated
   flow label value to a particular flow, in such a way that there
   should be no identical flow label for two traffic flows toward the
   same destination node.

   When a packet from a mobile node attached to a MMR arrives at the
   MMR, source address, destination address and flow label value in IPv6
   header are compared to flowbase tuples.  If the tuple matches the
   above information in the packet, then the framework will deem the
   tuple to forward the packet directly without multiple interface
   selection.

   If any matching tuple are not found, the packet will move on to
   interface selection step.

4.2.  Traffic control option

   We suggest an option for the IPv6 hop-by-hop options header.


    0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                      Figure 3. Traffic control option


   The traffic control option will be carried as an option in the IPv6
   hop-by-hop options header.  Each field will have following value:

   Option type

      Option type value will have value 001xxxxx, of which the 5 lowest
      bits will be assigned by IANA.

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   Option length = 3

      The traffic control option requires 3 octets, except option type
      field and option length field.

   Sevice type

   Preference

      The use of two fields is described below.  Two values are assumed
      to be determined in application layer of source node.

4.2.1.  Service type

   The 8-bit service type field in the traffic control option will carry
   the value represents to which traffic class the packet belongs to.  A
   service type value and and its matching traffic class are described
   below:

   0 :  The packet belongs to data traffic

   1 :  The packet belongs to control messages

   2 :  The packet belongs to VoIP traffic

   3 :  The packet belongs to Video traffic

   4 ~ 255 :  Reserved

4.2.2.  Preference

   The preference value is determined by the application, just like the
   service type value.  An user can set the preference value to
   represent the service preference he/she wants, or a network provider
   can advertise recommended preference value.

   A network operator should predefine the use of the value for
   preference value and the policy that matches the preference value.
   The policy contains rules to make a metric vector which will be used
   in interface selection.  Surely, a MMR should keep a set of
   predefined policies in its non-volatile storage, that matches
   preference values.

   Hereby we illustrate some example values for how the preference
   values can be used:

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   0 :  No policy

   1 :  Maximize throughput

   2 :  Support QoS

   3 :  Perform load balancing

   4 - 65535 :  Reserved

4.3.  Multiple interface selection

   In interface selection step, multiple interface selection (MIS)
   mechanism for outgoing traffic will be executed.  The selection
   mechanism needs some characteristics of access network, like traffic
   amount, bandwidth, and/or QoS support, etc.  The parameters are to be
   assumed that they are already known to the MIS framework in the
   heuristic way.  Based on the information, MIS mechanism can select an
   appropriate outgoing interface (and access network which connected
   to) that satisfies the flow's requirement.

   As a packet arrives at interface selection step, MIS mechanism looks
   at the traffic class information and the preference value of the flow
   from the traffic control option in IPv6 hop-by-hop options header.
   Based on the information, a metric function will be generated.  And
   then MIS will compute a single metric value from the function to
   choose the best interface to service the packet.  Then MIS can select
   a proper access network and interface to transmit the packet through,
   and the packet will be forwarded to the selected access network.
   Note that if the traffic class field in the IPv6 main header has some
   meaningful value, then the MIS will take it into account when it
   selects an appropriate metric function.

   The metric function should make a metric value from two vectors: an
   access network characteristic vetcor and a traffic flow requirement
   vector.  MIS should compute metric value for every access networks as
   the first packet of a flow enters MIS.  For example, the metric
   function will look like this:

      F = V_n X V_t

   The metric function computes an inner product of two vectors.  V_n is
   a subset of access network characteristics, and V_t is a subset of
   traffic flow requirements.  Some elements of a vector should be
   normalized between 0 and 1, because what the metric function has to
   do is to make a relative ordering among the access networks, not to
   make absolute preference values for the access networks.  And the
   other elements would have a binary value indicating whether the

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   network satisfies a condition or not.  The details of a metric
   function can be various due to policies, so we do not describe the
   details of a metric function.  Instead, we'll show a situation with
   some particular policies in Sec. 5.

   We list some example characteristics of the access networks and their
   interface.  Some of them are quoted from [3].

   Queueing delay

      A mean queueing delay in the interface.

   Loss rate

      A mean packet loss rate in the access network.

   Jitter

      The variation in latency.

   Bandwidth

      Maximum bandwidth provided by the access network.

   QoS support

      Whether the QoS is supported by the access network or not.

   Security support

      Whether the security protection is supported by the access network
      or not.

   Power consumption

      Some particular MMR may not be mains-powered.  Power consumption
      of interface would be a metric for choosing access network.

   Charging policy

      A network provider has many charging policies for customers, like
      a flat rate or a meter rate.

4.4.  Flowbase

   As the selected interface forwarding packet, the MIS framework should
   create a 4-tuple (source address, destination address, flow label,
   interface number) and store it in a non-volatile memory in the MMR.



Park, et al.            Expires January 20, 2007                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   As described above, the stored information can be used to select
   interface quickly without MIS step.


5.  Case study

   Hereby we describe some examples of policies and metric vectors for a
   metric function that corresponds a preference value.  Metric vectors,
   preference values and all the other required parameters are assumed
   to be set in MIS framework a priori.  The parameter values can be
   predetermined in a heuristic way, by network service providers or
   operators.

5.1.  Maximize Throughput

   V_n = ( Bandwidth, Loss rate )

   V_t = ( PacketSize, v )

   In this case, let us assume that the throughput means the "goodput".
   So if we want to maximize the gootput, a packet loss should be
   considered.  And the bandwidth is properly provided according to the
   mean packet size of the traffic.

   The variable v is a coordination value about the effect of packet
   loss factor in maximizing goodput.  And the parameter "PacketSize"
   will have a value by a rule, for example:

      0.1 for Control message

      0.5 for VoIP traffic

      1.0 for Video/Data traffic

5.2.  Load balancing

   V_n = ( Queueing delay )

   V_t = ( 1 )

   In this case, only the load of each interface is considered.  So only
   the queueing delay of each interface is considered, and the traffic
   flow parameter is ignored.

5.3.  QoS support with load balancing

   V_n = ( QoS support, Queueing delay )




Park, et al.            Expires January 20, 2007               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        Multiple interface selection             July 2006


   V_t = ( Service type, 1 )

   The QoS support parameter represents whether an access network
   support QoS by nature or not.  So basically it can have only the
   binary value 1 or 0, and if there are many networks support QoS in
   various level, the parameter can have a value between 1 and 0.

   The service type parameter represents whether the traffic should be
   served QoS support.  So, it will have a value of 1 for the QoS-needed
   traffic, and 0 for the other traffic.  For example, the rules for the
   metric value will look like this:

      0 for control message and data packets

      1 for video and VoIP traffic

   Like case 5.2, the queueing delay parameter will be used alone for
   load balancing without the traffic flow requirement parameter.

   We do not consider any security issues in this draft.
