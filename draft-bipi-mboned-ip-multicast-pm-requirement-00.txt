Abstract 

   With increasing deployment of IP multicast in service provider (SP) 
   network, SPs need a carrier-grade IP multicast performance monitoring 
   solution. This document describes the requirements for such a system 
   for a SP network. This system enables efficient performance 
   monitoring in SPs' production network and provides diagnostic 
   information in case of performance degradation or failure.

   network. This system enables efficient monitoring of performance 
   metrics of any given multicast channel (*,G) or (S,G) and provides 
   diagnostic information in case of performance degradation or failure. 

   Increasing deployment of IP multicast in SP network calls for a 
   carrier-grade IP multicast performance monitoring solution. SPs have 
   been leveraging IP multicast to provide revenue-generating services, 
   such as IP television (IPTV), video conferencing, as well as the 
   distribution of stock quotes or news. These services are usually 
   loss-sensitive or delay-sensitive, and their data packets need to be 
   delivered over a large IP network in real-time.  Accordingly, these 
   services demands very strict service-level agreements (SLAs). For 
   example, loss rate over 5% is generally considered unacceptable for 
   IPTV delivery. Video conferencing normally demands delays no more 
   than 150 milliseconds. However, the real-time nature of the traffic 
   and the deployment scale of service make it very challenging for IP 
   multicast performance monitoring in a SP's production network. With 
   increasing deployment of multicast service in SP networks, it becomes 
   mandatory to develop an efficient solution that is designed for SPs 
   to solve the following problems. 

   o SLA monitoring and verification: verify whether the performance of 
      production multicast network meets SLA requirements. 

   o Network optimization: identify bottlenecks when the performance 
      metrics do not meet the SLA requirements. 

   o Fault localization: pin-point impaired components in case of 
      performance degradation and service disruption. 

   These capabilities ease the management and maintenance costs of IP 
   multicast network for SPs, and ensure quality of services. 

   However, the existing IP multicast monitoring tools and systems, 
   which were mostly designed either for primitive connectivity 
   diagnosis or for experimental evaluations, does not suit for a SP 
   production network, given the following facts: 

   o Most of them provide end-to-end reachability check only [4][6][8]. 
      They cannot provide sophisticated measurement metrics such as 
      packet loss, one-way delay, and jitter, for the purpose of SLAs 
      verification.

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM requirements             July 2009 
    

   o Most of them can perform end-to-end measurements only. For example, 
      RTCP-based monitoring system [7] can report end-to-end packet loss 
      rate and jitter. End-to-end measurements are usually inadequate 
      for fault localization, which needs fine-grain measurement data to 
      pin-point exact root causes. 

   o Most of them use probing packets to probe network performance [4] 
      [6]. The approach might yield biased or even irrelevant results 
      because the probing results are sampled and the out-of-band 
      probing packets might be forwarded differently from the monitored 
      user traffic. 

   o Most of them are not scalable in a large deployment like SPs' 
      production network. For example, in IPTV deployment, the number of 
      group member might be in the order of thousands.  In this scale, a 
      RTCP-based multicast monitoring system [7] becomes almost unusable 
      because RTCP report intervals of each receiver might be delayed up 
      to minutes or even hours because of over-crowded reporting 
      multicast channel [14]. 

   o Some of them rely on the information from external protocols, 
      which make their capabilities and deployment scenarios limited by 
      the external protocols. The examples are passive measurement tools 
      that collect and analyze messages from protocols such as multicast 
      routing protocols [9], IGMP [11], or RTCP [7], etc.  Another 
      example is a SNMP-based system [10] that collects and analyzes 
      relevant multicast MIB information. 

   This document specifies the requirements for an IP multicast traffic 
   monitor for a carrier-grade IP multicast network, which help SPs to 
   do SLA verification, network optimization, and fault localizations in 
   a large production network.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

3. Terminologies 

   o SSM (source specific multicast): When a multicast group is 
      operating in SSM mode, only one designated node is eligible to 
      send traffic through the multicast channel. A SSM multicast group 
      with the designated source address s and group address G is 
      denoted by (s, G).

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM requirements             July 2009 
    

   o ASM (any source multicast): When a multicast group is operating in 
      ASM mode, any node can multicast packets through the multicast 
      channel to other group members. An ASM multicast group with group 
      address G is denoted by (*, G). 

   o Root (of a multicast group): In a SSM multicast group (s, G), the 
      root of this group is the first-hop router next to the source node 
      s. In an ASM multicast group (*, G), the root of this group is the 
      selected rendezvous point router. 

   o Receiver: The term receiver refers to any node in the multicast 
      group that receives multicast traffic. 

   o Internal forwarding path: Given a multicast group and a forwarding 
      node in the group, the internal forwarding path inside the node 
      refers to the data path between the upstream interface towards the 
      root and one of the downstream interface towards the receivers. 

   o Multicast forwarding path: Given a multicast group, a multicast 
      forwarding path refers to the sequence of the interfaces, links 
      and internal forwarding paths from the downstream interface at 
      root until the upstream interface at a receiver. 

   o Multicast forwarding tree: Given a multicast group G, the union of 
      all multicast forwarding paths composes the multicast forwarding 
      tree. 

   o Segment (of multicast forwarding path): The segment of a multicast 
      forwarding path refers to part of the path between any two given 
      interfaces. 

   o Measurement session: A measurement session refers to the period of 
      time in which certain performance metrics over a segment of 
      multicast forwarding path is monitored and measured. 

   o Monitoring node: A monitoring node is a node on a multicast 
      forwarding path that is capable of performing traffic performance 
      measurements on its interfaces. 

   o Active interface: An interface of a monitoring node that is turned 
      on to start a measurement session is said active. 

   o Measurement session control packets: The packets are used for 
      dynamic configuration for active interface to coordinate 
      measurement sessions.

   Figure 1 shows a multicast forwarding tree rooted at a root's 
   interface A. Within router 1, B-C and B-D are two internal forwarding 
   paths. Path A-B-C-E-G-I is a multicast forwarding path, which starts 
   at root's downstream interface A and ends at receiver 2's upstream 
   interface I. A-B, B-C-E are two segments of this forwarding path. 
   When a measurement session for a metric such as loss rate is turned 
   on over segment A-B, interfaces A and B are active interfaces.

4. Functional Requirements 

4.1. Topology discovery and monitoring 

   The monitor system SHOULD have mechanisms to collect topology 
   information of the multicast forwarding trees for any given multicast 
   group. The function can be an integrated part of this monitoring 
   system. Alternatively, the function might relies on other tools and 
   protocols, such as mtrace [5], MANTRA[9], etc. The topology 
   information will be referred by network operators to decide where to 
   enable measurement sessions. 

4.2. Performance measurement 

   The performance metrics that a monitoring node needs to collect 
   include but not limit to the following. 

4.2.1. Loss rate 

   Loss rate over a segment is the ratio of user packets not delivered 
   to the total number of user packets delivered over this segment 
   during a given interval. The number of user packets not delivered 
 
 
Bianchetti, et al.     Expires January 6, 2010                [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM requirements             July 2009 
    

   over a segment is the difference between the number of packets 
   transmitted at the starting interface of the segment and received at 
   the ending interface of this segment. Loss rate is crucial for 
   multimedia streaming, such as IP, video/audio conferencing. 

   Loss rate over any segment of a multicast forwarding path MUST be 
   provided. The measurement interval MUST be configurable.  

4.2.2. One-way delay 

   One-way delay over a segment is the average time that user packets 
   take to traverse this segment of forwarding path during a given 
   interval. The time that a user packet traversing a segment is the 
   difference between the time when the user packet leaves the starting 
   interface of this segment and the time when the same user packet 
   arrives at the ending interface of this segment. The one-way delay 
   metric is essential for real-time interactive applications, such as 
   video/audio conferencing, multiplayer gaming. 

   One-way delay over any segment of a multicast forwarding path SHOULD 
   be able to be measured. The measurement interval MUST be configurable. 

   To get correct one-way delay measurements, the two end monitoring 
   nodes of the investigated segments might need to have clock 
   synchronized. 

4.2.3. Jitter 

   Jitter over a segment is the variance of one-way delay over this 
   segment during a given interval. The metric is of great importance 
   for real-time streaming and interactive applications, such as IPTV, 
   audio/video conferencing. 

   One-way delay jitter over any segment of a multicast forwarding path 
   SHOULD be able to be measured. The measurement interval MUST be 
   configurable. 

   To get correct jitter statistics, the clock frequencies at the two 
   end monitoring nodes might need to be synchronized so that the clocks 
   at two systems will proceed at the same pace. 

4.2.4. Throughput 

   Throughput of multicast traffic for a group over a segment is the 
   average number of bytes of user packets of this multicast group 
   transmitted over this segment in unit time during a given interval. 
   The information might be useful for resource management. 
 
 
Bianchetti, et al.     Expires January 6, 2010                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM requirements             July 2009 
    

   Throughput of multicast traffic over any segment of a multicast 
   forwarding path MAY be measured. The measurement interval MUST be 
   configurable. 

4.3. Measurement session management 

   A measurement session refers to the period of time in which 
   measurement for certain performance metrics is enabled over a segment 
   of multicast forwarding path or over a complete multicast forwarding 
   path. During a measurement session, the two end interfaces are said 
   active. When an interface is activated, the interfaces start 
   collecting statistics, such as number or timestamps of user packets 
   which belongs to the given multicast group and pass through the 
   interface. When both interfaces are activated, the measurement 
   session starts. During a measurement session, statistics from two 
   active interfaces are periodically correlated and the performance 
   metrics, such as loss rate or delay, are derived. The correlation can 
   be done either on the downstream interface if the upstream interface 
   passes its statistics to it or on a third-party if the raw statistics 
   on two active interfaces are reported to it. When one of the two 
   interfaces is deactivated, the measurement session stops. 

4.3.1. Segment v.s. Path 

   Network operators SHOULD be able to turn on or off measurements 
   sessions for specific performance metrics over either a segment of 
   multicast forwarding path or over a complete multicast forwarding 
   path at any time. For example in Figure 1, network operator can turn 
   on the measurement session of loss rate over path A-B-D-F and segment 
   A-B-C as well as jitter over segment C-E-G-I simultaneously. This 
   feature allows network operators to zoom into the suspicious 
   components when degradation or failure occurs. 

4.3.2. Static v.s. Dynamic configuration 

   A measurement session can be configured statically. In this case, 
   network operators activate the two interfaces or configure their 
   parameter settings on the relevant nodes either manually or 
   automatically through agents of network management system (NMS). 

   Optionally, a measurement session can be configured dynamically. In 
   this case, an interface may coordinate another interface on its 
   forwarding path to start or stop a session. Accordingly, the format 
   and process routines of the measurement session control packets need 
   to be specified. The delivery of such packets SHOULD be reliable and 
   MUST be secured.

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM requirements             July 2009 
    

4.3.3. Proactive v.s. on-demand 

   A measurement session can be started either proactively or on demand. 
   To save resources, operators may turn on measurement sessions 
   proactively for critical performance metrics over the backbone 
   segments of multicast forwarding tree only. This keeps the overall 
   monitoring overhead minimal during normal network operations. However, 
   when network performance degradation or service disruption occurs, 
   operators might turn on measurement sessions on demand over the 
   interested segments to facilitate fault localization. 

4.4. Measurement result report 

   The measurement results might be present in two forms: reports or 
   alarms. 

4.4.1. Performance reports 

   Performance reports contain streams of continuous measurement data 
   over a period of time. A data collection agent MAY actively poll the 
   monitoring nodes and collect the measurement reports from all active 
   interfaces. Alternatively, the monitoring nodes might be configured 
   to upload the reports to the specific data collection agents once the 
   data become available. To save bandwidth, the content of the reports 
   might be aggregated and compressed. The period of reporting SHOULD be 
   able to be configured or controlled by rate limitation mechanisms 
   (e.g., exponentially increasing). 

4.4.2. Exceptional alarms 

   On the other hand, the active interfaces of a monitoring node MAY be 
   configured to raise alarms if exceptional events such as performance 
   degradation or service disruption occur. During the meantime, the 
   monitoring node remains quiescent. In this configuration, alarm 
   thresholds and the nodes to which alarms are reported should be 
   specified for each of the performance metric when the measurement 
   session is configured on this interface. During measurement session, 
   once the performance metric exceeds the threshold, alarm will be 
   raised and reported to the configured nodes. To prevent huge volume 
   of alarms from overloading the management nodes and congest the 
   network, suppression and aggregation mechanisms SHOULD be employed on 
   the interfaces to limit the rate of alarm report and the volume of 
   data.

5. Design considerations 

   To make the monitoring system feasible for a SP production network, 
   the designers should take into account the following requirements. 

5.1. Inline data-plane measurement 

   The system is monitoring the performance of multicast traffic, and 
   thus is operating on data plane. The performance measurement should 
   be ``inline'' in the sense that the measurement statistics are 
   derived directly from user packets, instead of probing packets. At 
   the same time, unlike offline packet analysis, the measurement is 
   counting user packets at line-speed in real-time without any packet 
   duplication or buffering. 

   Probing packet SHOULD be avoided in performance measurement. 
   Measurement results collected by probing packets might be biased or 
   even totally irrelevant given the facts that (1) probing packets 
   collect sampled results only and might not capture the real statistic 
   characteristics of the monitored user traffic. Experiments have 
   demonstrated that the measurement sampled by the probing packets, 
   such as ping probes, might be incorrect if sampling interval is too 
   long [1]; (2) probing packets introduce extra load onto the network. 
   In order to improve accuracy, sampling frequency has to be high 
   enough, which in turn increase network overhead and further bias the 
   measurement results; (3) probing packets are usually not in the same 
   multicast group as user packets and might take different forwarding 
   path given that equal cost multi-path routing (ECMP) and link 
   aggregation (LAG) have been widely adopted in SP network. An out-of-
   band probing packet might take a path totally different from the user 
   packets of the multicast group that it is monitoring. Even if the 
   forwarding path is the same, the intermediate node might apply 
   different queuing and scheduling strategy for the probing packets. As 
   a result, the measured results might be irrelevant. 

   To accomplish the inline measurement, some extra packets might need 
   to be injected into user traffic to coordinate measurement across 
   nodes. The volume of these packets SHOULD be keep minimal such that 
   the injection of such packets will not impact measurement accuracy.  

5.2. Scalability 

   The measurement methodology and system architecture MUST be scalable. 
   A multicast network for SP is usually composed of thousands of nodes. 
   Given the scale, the collecting, processing and reporting overhead of 
   performance statistic data SHOULD not overwhelm either monitoring 

 
 
Bianchetti, et al.     Expires January 6, 2010               [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM requirements             July 2009 
    

   nodes or management nodes. The volume of reporting traffic should be 
   reasonable and not cause any network congestion.  

5.3. Robustness 

   The measurements MUST be fault-free, namely, independent of the 
   failure of the underlying multicast network. For example, the monitor 
   SHOULD generate correct measurement result even if some measurement 
   coordinating packets are lost; invalid performance reports should be 
   able to be identified in case that the underlying multicast network 
   is undergoing drastic changes. 

   If dynamic configuration is supported, the delivery of measurement 
   session control packets SHOULD be reliable so that the measurement 
   sessions can be started, ended and performed in a predictable manner. 
   Meanwhile, the packets SHOULD be multicast independent as the packets 
   should not use multicast to delivery. This guarantees that the active 
   interfaces are still under control even if the multicast service is 
   malfunctioning. 

   Similarly, if NMS are used to control the monitoring nodes remotely, 
   the communication between them SHOULD be reliable and multicast 
   independent. 

5.4. Security 

   The monitoring system MUST not impose security risks on the network. 
   For example, the monitoring nodes should not be exploited by third 
   parties to control measurement sessions arbitrarily. This might leave 
   holes for DDoS attacks. 

   If dynamic configuration is supported, the measurement session 
   control packets need to be encrypted and authenticated. 

5.5. Device flexibility 

   The deployment requirement in terms of both software and hardware 
   SHOULD be reasonable. For example, one-way delay measurement needs 
   clock synchronization across nodes. To require all nodes to install 
   expensive hardware clock synchronization devices might be too costly 
   to make the monitoring system infeasible for large deployment. 

   The monitor system SHOULD be incrementally deployable, which means 
   that the system can enable monitoring functionality even if some of 
   the nodes in the network are not equipped with the required software 
   and hardware or does not meet the software and hardware deployment 
   requirements.

   The non-monitoring nodes without the monitoring capabilities SHOULD 
   be able to coexist with monitoring nodes and function. The packets 
   exchanged between monitoring nodes SHOULD be transparent to other 
   nodes and MUST not cause any malfunction of the non-monitoring nodes. 

5.6. Extensibility 

   The system should be easy to extend for new functionalities. For 
   example, the system should be easily extended to collect newly 
   defined performance metrics. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security issues have been taken into account in design 
   considerations. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA action required by this draft.
