1.  Introduction

   Today RPKI-based Origin Validation, [RFC6811], relies on widespread
   deployment of the Global Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI),
   [RFC6480].  In the future, RPKI-based Path Validation,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview], will be even more reliant on the
   Global RPKI.

   But there are critical circumstances in which a local, clearly-
   scoped, administrative and/or routing domain will want to augment
   and/or modify their internal view of the Global RPKI.

   This document attempts to lay out a few of those use cases.  It is
   not intended to be authoritative, complete, or to become a standard.
   It merely tries to lay out a few critical examples to help frame the
   issues.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the RPKI, see [RFC6480],
   the RPKI Repository Structure, see [RFC6481], Route Origin
   Authorizations (ROAs), see [RFC6482], and GhostBusters Records, see
   [RFC6493].

3.  What is 'Local'

   The RPKI is a distributed database containing certificates, CRLs,
   manifests, ROAs, and GhostBusters Records as described in [RFC6481].
   Policies and considerations for RPKI object generation and
   maintenance are discussed elsewhere.

   Like the DNS, the Global RPKI tries to present a single global view,
   although only a loosely consistent view, depending on timing,

   updating, fetching, etc.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is not
   broken, it is the nature of distributed data with distributed caches.

   There are critical uses of the RPKI where a local administrative and/
   or routing domain, e.g. an end-user site, a particular ISP or content
   provider, an organization, a geo-political region, ... may wish to
   have a specialized view of the RPKI.

   For the purposes of this exploration, we refer to this localized view
   as a 'Local Trust Anchor', mostly for historical reasons, but also
   because implementation would likely require the local distribution of
   one or more specialized trust anchors, [RFC6481].

4.  Example Uses

   We explore this space using three examples.

   Carol, a RIPE resource holder (LIR, PI holder, ...), operates outside
   of the Netherlands.  Someone convinces a Dutch court to force the
   RIPE/NCC to remove or modify some or all of Carol's certificates,
   ROAs, etc. or the resources they represent, and the operational
   community wants to retain the ability to route to Carol's network(s).
   There is need for some channel through which operators can exchange
   local trust, command, and data collections necessary to propagate
   patches local to all their RPKI views.

   Bob has a multi-AS network under his administration and some of those
   ASs use private ([RFC1918]) or 'borrowed' address space which is not
   announced on the global Internet, and he wishes to certify them for
   use in his internal routing.

   Alice is responsible for the trusted routing for a large
   organization, commercial or geo-political, in which management
   requests routing engineering to redirect their competitors' prefixes
   to socially acceptable data, and Alice is responsible for making the
   CA hierarchy have validated certificates for those redirected
   resources as well as the rest of the Internet.

5.  Notes

   In these examples, it is ultimately the ROAs, not the certificates,
   which one wants to modify or replace.  But one probably can not
   simply create new ROAs as one does not have the private keys needed
   to sign them.  Hence it is likely that one has to also do something
   about the [RFC6480] certificates.

Internet-Draft      RPKI Local Trust Anchor Use Cases      December 2015


   The goal is to modify, create, and/or replace ROAs and GhostBuster
   Records which are needed to present the localized view of the RPKI
   data.

   One wants to reproduce only as much of the Global RPKI as needed.
   Replicating more than is needed would amplify tracking and
   maintenance.

   One can not reissue down from the root trust anchor at the IANA or
   from the RIRs' certificates because one does not have the private
   keys required.  So one has to create a new trust anchor which, for
   ease of use, will contain the new/modified certificates and ROAs as
   well as the unmodified remainder of the Global RPKI.

   Because Alice, Bob, and Carol want to be able to archive, reproduce,
   and send to other operators the data necessary to reproduce their
   modified view of the global RPKI, there will need to be a formally
   formally defined set of data which is input to a well-defined process
   to take an existing Global RPKI tree and produce the desired modified
   re-anchored tree.

   It is possible that an operator may need to accept and process
   modification data from more than one source.  Hence modification
   'recipes' should be mergable.

6.  Security Considerations

   These use cases are all about violating global security, albeit
   within a constrained local context.

   Authentication of modification 'recipes' will be needed.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
