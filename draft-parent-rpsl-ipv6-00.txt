Internet-Draft                  RPSL-IPv6                   October 2001


1. Introduction

   This draft documents the required information and extensions in RPSL
   to be able to specify an IPv6 routing policy.

   This document assumes that it is not required to build a seperate
   Internet Routing Registry (IRR) infrastructure from the existing IPv4
   IRR.  Extensions to existing RPSL object are introduced to allow the
   definitions of IPv6 routing policies, and maintain backward
   compatibility.

   It should be noted that work is underway in the RIPE RPSLng task
   force to investigate and define extensions to RPSL to include IPv6
   and IPv4/IPv6 multicast.  The current version of this document
   focuses on IPv6 unicast, but this document will be evolving within
   the work currently underway in this area.

   RFC 2622 [1] defines RPSL using IPv4 prefixes and addresses.
   Fortunately, RPSL was defined to be extensible such that new features
   can be added.  Section 10 in RFC 2622 provides guidelines for
   extending RPSL, such as adding a new routing protocol or new features
   to the existing protocols.

   Section 2 in RFC 2622 defines the usage of IPv4 addresses and
   prefixes in RPSL.  Since defining RPSL for IPv6 routing policies
   requires defining the usage of IPv6 addresses inside object
   attributes, Section 2 in RFC2622 needs to be extended to describe
   IPv6 usage.  Section 2 describes the usage of IPv6 addresses inside
   RPSL.

   Introducing IPv6 has an impact on certain classes, most notably in
   the aut-num class.  Section 3 enumerates the current RPSL classes and
   defines the new attributes, when necessary, to support IPv6.

2. IPv6 Address and Prefix Representation in RPSL

   This section is based on Section 2 in RFC 2622 [1] and takes much of
   the wording from that section.  This section extends the IP address,
   prefix and range definitions in order to include IPv6.

   It should be noted that IPv6 prefixes has been in usage in RPSL for
   quite some time.  For example, the 6bone registry [3] uses the ipv6-
   site and inet6num objects that contains IPv6 prefixes in their
   attributes.

   The following IP address representations are added or extended:
   <ipv6-address>, <address-prefix> and <address-prefix-range>

   <ipv6-address>   An IPv6 address is represented as a sequence of
   hexadecimal groups delimited with ":" representing a 128 bit address.
   The textual representation can be compressed using the "::" syntax.
   A full description of the address syntax can be found in Section 2.2
   of RFC2373 [2]

   <address-prefix>   An address prefix is represented as an IP address
   followed by the character slash "/" followed by an integer in the
   range appropriate for the IP version (from 0 to 32 for IPv4 and from
   0 to 128 for IPv6).  The following are valid IPv6 prefixes:
   3ffe:ffff:c18::/48, 2002::/16; and the following IPv6 prefixes are
   invalid: 3ffe:ffff:c18/48 (incomplete IPv6 address), fec0::1/130
   (prefix length out of bound).

   <address-prefix-range>   An address prefix range is an address prefix
   followed by an optional range operator.  The range operators are:

   ^- is the exclusive more specifics operator; it stands for the more
   specifics of the address prefix excluding the address prefix itself.
   For example, 2001::/16^- contains all the more specifics of 2001::/16
   excluding 2001::/16.

   ^+ is the inclusive more specifics operator; it stands for the more
   specifics of the address prefix including the address prefix itself.
   For example, 2001::/16^+ contains all the more specifics of 2001::/16
   including 2001::/16.

   ^n where n is an integer, stands for all the length n specifics of
   the address prefix.  For example, 3ffe:ffff::/24^48 contains all the
   more specifics of 3ffe:ffff::/24 which are of length 48 such as
   3ffe:ffff:c18::/48.

   ^n-m where n and m are integers, stands for all the length n to
   length m specifics of the address prefix.  For example,

   3ffe:ffff::/24^24-48 contains all the more specifics of
   3ffe:ffff::/24 which are of length 24 to 48 such as
   3ffe:ffff:c18::/48 and 3ffe:ffff:c00::/40.

3. Using IPv6 in RPSL classes

3.1 aut-num

   The aut-num class is used to define the automonous system routing
   policies.

   (Show aut-num class template here)

   In order to be able to specify IPv6 routing policies, IPv6 needs to
   be supported in aut-num attributes (import, export, default).  As an
   example, the aut-num import attribute can use an explicit IPv6 prefix
   as follows:

   import: from AS2 accept { 2001:410::/35 }

   Such an statement defines clearly the goal of that attribute: accept
   IPv6 prefix advertisement 2001:410::/35 from AS2.  Using the
   definitions in Section 2, this type of IPv6 policy can be
   unambiguously defined.

   But routing policies inside aut-num are often defined in term of a
   relationship to other autonomous systems, as the following example
   shows.

   	    import:      from AS3701 accept ANY
   	    export:      to AS3701 announce AS3582

   Since there is no reference to the IP protocol used, an ambiguity
   arises when introducing IPv6: Does the above mean import and export
   both IPv4 and IPv6 ?  If the IPv4 and IPv6 routing policies are to be
   kept distinct, we need some identifier to distinguish between address
   families.

   It is proposed to define new attributes inside aut-num: import6,
   export6, default6.  These would allow to unambiguously specify which
   address family is being specified inside the policy.

   	    import:      from AS3701 accept ANY
   	    import6:     from AS3702 accept ANY
   	    export:      to AS3701 announce AS3582
   	    export6:     to AS3702 announce AS3582

   The advantage of using new attributes inside aut-num for IPv6
   policies is that the backward compatibility with IPv4 IRR is assured.
   If the new attribute is not understood by an IPv4 only software, it
   is simply ignored.

Internet-Draft                  RPSL-IPv6                   October 2001


   Another approach would be to introduce a new keyword inside the
   current import, export and default attributes in order to specify the
   address family that the statement applies to.  Such an approach would
   closely match the current multiprotocol BGP implementation and would
   scale better to support address families other that IPv6 unicast.

   The import, export attributes use objects such as peering and filter.
   These classes must be defined to support IPv6.

3.2 route

   This class specifies a route originated by an autonomous system.

   (Show route class template here)

   Using the definitions in Section 2, the route attribute can specify
   IPv6 prefixes.  The following route object is an example:

               route:       3ffe:b00::/24
               origin:      AS10566

   The route class contains other attributes that use an IP address or
   prefix: Section 8 in RFC2622 describes the aggregation attributes
   used in the route class.  It remains to be further explored how/if
   these attributes will be used in IPv6.

3.3 route-set

   A route-set allows the definition of a group of prefixes under a
   common name.  Using the definitions in Section 2, the members
   attribute can new specify IPv6 prefixes.

   (Show route-set class template here)

   	      route-set: rs-viagenie
   	      members: 3ffe:b00::/24, 2001:410:800::/48

4. Using route vs using ipv6-site Objects

   The ipv6-site class (draft-ietf-ngtrans-6bone-registry-xx.txt [3])
   contains information similar to the route class:

   o  AS of the site

   o  Route prefixes which are exported by the site to the outside world

   o  Information related to the type of IPv6 connectivity (tunnel or
      native links)

   The ipv6-site class offers the similar information to what is
   available in a route class, but with some important differences:

   o  the prefix attribute is optional in ipv6-site (whereas it is
      mandatory inside the route class).

   o  the prefix attribute can appear multiple times in ipv6-site
      (similar to a route-set).

   o  ipv6-site does not offer indirect membership as offered by the
      route and route-set classes.

   o  route class offers aggregation attributes.
