NAME=VALUE
     Required.  The name of the state information (``cookie'') is NAME,   |
     and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are reserved for    |
     other uses and must not be used by applications.

     The VALUE is opaque to the user agent and may be anything the        |
     origin server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected
     printable ASCII encoding.  ``Opaque'' implies that the content is
     of interest and relevance only to the origin server.  The content
     may, in fact, be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie
     header.

Domain=domain
     Optional.  The Domain attribute specifies the domain for which the   |
     cookie is valid.  An explicitly specified domain must always start   |
     with a dot.
Max-Age=delta-seconds
     Optional.  The Max-Age attribute defines the lifetime of the
     cookie, in seconds.  The delta-seconds value is a decimal non-
     negative integer.  After delta-seconds seconds elapse, the client
     should discard the cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie should
     be discarded immediately.

Path=path
     Optional.  The Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs to which
     this cookie applies.

Version=version                                                           |
     Required.  The Version attribute, a decimal integer, identifies to   |
     which version of the state management specification the cookie       |
     conforms.  For this specification, Version=1 applies.
