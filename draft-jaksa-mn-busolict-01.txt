Internet-Draft         Requesting MN binding info              June 2006


1.  Introduction

   The tunneling of packets between the correspondent node and the
   mobile node via the home agent is known as bidirectional tunneling.
   Bidirectional tunneling ensures that the mobile node is always
   reachable when it is away from home, even if the correspondent node
   is not Mobile IPv6-capable.  The sending of packets directly between
   a mobile node and a Mobile IPv6-capable correspondent node is known
   as route optimization. [1]

   There may be usage scenarios whereby a correspondent node may wish to
   maintain the binding information for other Mobile IPv6 nodes without
   first exchanging data packets or requiring a mobile node to send
   binding updates to the correspondent node.  This draft documents a
   proposal whereby a correspondent node may query a home agent for
   binding information about another mobile node or that a correspondent
   node may solicit binding information from the MN directly.  Again,
   with such solicitation there is no requirement that a session is in
   progress or will ever happen.  The distant node simply may wish to
   have the binding information of the respective MN or wishes to have
   this information prior to beginning a session.  In particular this
   draft seeks to document a couple of usage cases.  It is assumed
   throughout this draft that the requesting correspondent node is also
   a Mobile IPv6 supported node that is requesting binding information
   from its respective Home Agent about another Mobile IPv6 node that is
   also being serviced by the same Home Agent.


2.  Terminology

   See [2] for mobility terminology used in this document.


3.  Usage Cases

   Mobile IPv6 [1] defines a process during which a mobile node sends a
   Binding Update to its home agent or a correspondent node, causing a
   binding for the mobile node to be registered.  Usage scenarios exist
   whereby a correspondent node may wish to request the mobile node's
   binding from its home agent.

   Mobile aware applications or services may need to know if another
   mobile node is connected or active.  For example, the absence of a
   binding association for a homeless mobile node may mean that the node
   is not active or connected.  Perhaps the mobile node is in nomadic
   mode and is currently inactive.  A correspondent node can make a
   request to the home agent for the binding information.  Applications
   may then use the binding cache to obtain information about on-line or

   active status for the respective mobile node.  Examples may include
   end-to-end gaming applications that may need to know if nodes within
   some predefined communication group are active (i.e., on-line).  Here
   the Home agent is providing information to a node about the current
   reachability status of another node.

   Location based service support for mobile nodes is another usage
   case.  For example, a server may wish to periodically track the
   movement and/or location of mobile nodes that are subscribing to its
   services even though there is not an active on-going session.  The
   correspondent node providing the services may periodically check the
   location of the mobile node by requesting its binding information
   from the home agent.  Services may then retrieve the binding cache
   and push location-based information to the mobile node.

   Other usage examples deal with multi-homed MN (MONAMI6 supported MNs)
   [3] [4] [5] .  Some of those are enumerated in section 4 below.  One
   example is that CN may wish to beware of flow state bindings (that
   are being discussed in MONAMI6) prior to initiating communication.
   This will allow the flows to happen that are preferred by the MN when
   the CN is the entity that is initiating communications.


4.  Mobility Message Solicitation Request option

   This section defines a mobility message solicitation option that may
   be used by a node to request through a solicit type message a Binding
   Update or mobility binding type information such as the type of flow
   information that is being discussed in MONAMI6.  Since the MONAMI6
   work is still in progress, the actual format or additional extensions
   may be modified or added to this draft at some later point in time.

4.1.  Background on Binding Refresh Request (BRR) Message

   Mobile IPv6 [1] defines the Binding Refresh Request (BRR) message
   requests a mobile node to update its already existing mobility
   binding.  As is stated in [1] the BRR message is sent by
   correspondent nodes according to the rules in the base specification.
   When a mobile node receives a packet containing a Binding Refresh
   Request message it processes the message according to the rules in
   the base specification (see Section 11.7.4) of [1].

4.2.  Binding Solicitation Request (BSR) Message

   Deployment of Mobile IPv6 will require that the distant peer node
   (correspondent node) to know information about the Mobile IPv6
   supported node prior to initiating communications.  This becomes even
   more important when the Mobile IPv6 node is multi-homed (or MONAMI6

   supported).  Even if the Mobile Node is not multi-homed a CN may wish
   to simply know the bindings of a peer.  This information may be
   initially solicited by the CN.

   Mobility aware applications may also make use of this information in
   many different ways.  Such information may include but is not limited
   to such things as

   1.  MN is on-line or off-line;
   2.  if the MN is at home or not at home;
   3.  if the MN is multi-homed or not.
   4.  if the MN is behind a NAT or not
   5.  MN is multi-homed and if so multi-homed information as well as
       other yet to be specified MONAMI6 specific information (i.e.,
       flows, etc).

   The BSR message will have similar message format as the BRR [1] ,
   e.g.,

   Additional Mobility Options to be determined in later revisions of
   this document.  Such additional options must be defined to obtain the
   specific kinds of data (such as enumerated in the above list) that a
   CN may wish to solicit.  Once MONAMI6 flow bindings are specified
   such mobility options will be defined so that a CN may solicit these
   bindings either for a MN via a direct solicitation or through a
   request to the respective HA.


5.  Security Considerations

   It is assumed throughout this draft that the requesting correspondent
   node is also a Mobile IPv6 supported node that is requesting binding
   information from its respective Home Agent about another Mobile IPv6
   node that is also being serviced by the same Home Agent.  As such
   there is already a security association between the nodes requesting
   binding information and the home agent.  Instead of sending a binding

Internet-Draft         Requesting MN binding info              June 2006


   update to the home agent, a request for another mobile nodes binding
   information is being made.

   What needs to be fretted out is a way to keep private home agent
   binding cache entries for mobile nodes that don't want to disclose
   this information.
