   Abstract 
      
   This draft describes the concept of the SRLG-based logical ring 
   configuration and recovery method using the ring-SRLG for the purpose of 
   restoration in mesh networks. In this restoration architecture, backup 
   paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path, which 
   follows the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment 
   of backup path disjointed from the working path. We also propose the 
   GMPLS signaling extension for the end-to-end restoration based on the 
   SRLG-based logical ring configuration.

   1. Introduction 
      
     With the rapid growth of the Internet, the advance of wavelength 
     division multiplexing (WDM) technology, and the integration of 
     various communication technologies, the communication network is 
     evolving to include huge bandwidth-intensive network applications. 
     Survivability refers to the ability of the network to transfer the 
     interrupted service onto spare network capacity to circumvent a point 
     of failure in the network and it is a critical requirement for IP 
     over WDM networks. In a WDM network, a link failure, fiber cut, node 
     down may be due to human error or natural disasters leading to the 
     loss of large amount of data and multiple failures of all the optical 
     paths that traverse the fiber. So, we have to develop appropriate 
     recovery architecture and strategies which minimizes the data loss 
     when a failure on a path occurs in WDM based GMPLS (Generalized Multi-
     Protocol Label Switching) networks that will offer fast recovery, 
     comparable speed to SONET, and versatile survivable functions.  
      
     Recovery techniques are broadly classified by computation timing as 
     pre-computed and dynamic and by their type of rerouting as link-based, 
     partial path-based and path-based. In dynamic techniques, a search 
     for backup path is initiated upon occurrence of a failure. A backup 
     path is computed based on availability of resource at that time of 
     failure. While dynamic techniques provide better resource utilization, 
     they suffer from long delays to search and reroute the traffic on to 
     the backup path and there is no guarantee that the connection can be 
     restored upon failure. Dynamic techniques provide a best-effort type 
     of service. In protection techniques the primary and backup routes 
     are computed and resources are reserved for backup paths before the 
     connection is established. Upon occurrence of a failure the backup

     path is established and traffic is immediately routed on to the 
     backup path. A pre-computed method avoids long delays in setting up 
     backup paths upon failure. The pre-computed techniques also provide 
     guarantee that a connection can be restored in the event of failure. 
     According to range of rerouting, the recovery techniques are 
     classified into link-based, segment-wised based and path-based 
     recovery. Link-based techniques reroute disrupted traffic around the 
     failed link. This approach requires the ability to identify a failed 
     link at both ends. It also makes recovery more difficult in the event 
     of a node failure. Furthermore, it limits the choice of backup path 
     and thus may use more capacity, while path-base techniques replace 
     the whole path between the two endpoints of a demand. The path-based 
     techniques have better resource utilization while span-based 
     techniques have shorter recovery time. Therefore, we may focus on the 
     path-based recovery, called end-to-end recovery.  
      
     Most backbone networks have a mesh physical topology. However, the 
     mesh-based schemes have some shortcomings. They are not as fast in 
     failure recovery as ring-based scheme and complicated working path 
     and backup path routing arrangements are used to achieve optimality, 
     and also the optimization procedures used for mesh-based schemes are 
     very computationally intensive, virtually impossible to solve for 
     very large networks.[12] SONET networks are, for the most part, 
     protected in the form of rings. The rings are interconnected in order 
     to provide overall network connectivity and protection. It is 
     possible to design a fast and simple recovery strategy for ring 
     network so ring protection switching is well established and robust 
     in these days. Therefore, we need the ring concept in the mesh 
     optical network.  
      
     This draft describes the Ring configuration based on SRLG information 
     and signaling extension to support end-to-end restoration from a 
     source to a destination in pre-OTN network. The restoration scheme 
     should be timely recovery from failures and also be resource 
     efficient and flexible to meet requirements. It represents the 
     protocol specific procedures for GMPLS RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation 
     Protocol-Traffic Engineering) signaling to support end-to-end 
     restoration with SRLG based ring architecture which support entire 
     LSP from the source to the destination. For the disjointness of 
     end-to-end restoration path from failed working path, we extend the 
     RSVP-TE signaling message to support SRLG through logical ring.  
       
       
   2. Logical Ring configuration in the mesh networks 
    
     Recovery mechanism having advantages both ring and mesh, namely 
     having speed like ring and efficiency like mesh has been investigated 
     in recent years as new recovery mechanism.  
    
   2.1 Cycle based recovery mechanisms

                 End-to-End restoration with SRLG            February 2004 
    
     In this part, we describe the history of the logical ring 
     configuration method for the optical networks. Ring-based schemes are 
     essentially some extensions of self-healing ring in the mesh 
     topology, and the study of logical ring in mesh network has been 
     developed. [9],[10],[11],[13]   
      
     The optical protection ring has two types.[12],[13] These are the 
     path-protection and the shared-protection optical ring. In a path 
     protection optical ring, the forward and return signals of each 
     lightpath are transmitted in the same direction around the ring from 
     a source to a destination on a working fiber. Because each wavelength is 
     protected independently, the service is assured even for failures 
     that impact a single wavelength. Each connection takes up the entire 
     ring capacity for one wavelength, however, so the maximum number of 
     optical paths that can be supported by a ring is equal to the total 
     number of wavelength channels available. In a shared optical ring 
     with 2-fiber and 4-fiber, the forward and return signals in a 
     lightpath do not circumnavigate the entire ring. Once the forward and 
     returned signals reach their end nodes, the wavelengths used to carry 
     these signals may be reused by other lightpaths on the remaining 
     spans of the ring.   
       
     P-cycle based on closed cycle routes is the one of the recovery 
     mechanisms using logical ring in mesh networks.[9] P-cycle adopted 
     the preconfiguration method to reduce the total connection time would 
     be to reduce the number of active switch. If the present routes are 
     to be useful towards the overall recovery of the network, they must 
     be set with consideration of the restoration of all possible failures 
     as it is not possible to predict. This preconfigured method made ring 
     architecture to support fast recovery. Additionally, because P-
     cycle can recover not only an on-cycle span failure but also a 
     straddling span failure it has three to six times greater demanding-
     carrying capacity than rings for a given transmission capacity 
     because p-cycle can recover not only an on-cycle span failure but 
     also a straddling span failure.  
      
     Determining patterns in p-cycle cannot be calculated at once. So it 
     separately carries out two steps to find optimal p-cycle patterns. 
     However, this procedure also has some serious problems. First problem 
     generates large file that is a database file related to ring patterns 
     which are embedded the network, primarily because of the size of the 
     set of candidate cycles to consider. Second problem is that it is 
     also difficult to solve optimality because of large file handled.  
     If an applied pattern is a cycle traversing all the nodes in the 
     network exactly once, this pattern can provide one more than spare 
     routes for any span failure. This cycle is so called Hamiltonian 
     cycle and can provide maximum restorability with minimum spare 
     links.[10] Namely, the Hamiltonian cycle of the working network can 
     provide recovery routes against a single link failure with the 
     minimal spare links.

     Restricted P-cycle (RPC) has the algorithm to search the min coast 
     pattern shaped only as the HPC a closed cycle that traverses all the 
     nodes in the network exactly once.[11] Determining patterns in p-
     cycle cannot be calculated it at once. So it carries out two steps to 
     find optical p-cycle patterns. However, this procedure also has some 
     serious problems. First problem generates large file that is a 
     database file related to ring patterns which are embedded the network, 
     primarily because of the size of the set of candidate cycles to 
     consider. Second problem is that it is also difficult to solve 
     optimality because of large files handled. RPC is modified and enhanced 
     Hamiltonian cycle to reduce the complexity of the existing method for 
     the recovery of the span failure in mesh networks by using limited 
     pattern. 
      
    
   2.2 Segment-wised Logical Ring  
    
     As a network became large, the possibility of the size of the ring 
     pattern also became large. So, applying ring does not promote 
     efficiency in terms of end-to-end delay and recovery time. In this 
     section we propose the method, called segment-wised ring, that can be 
     effectively applied to real networks without those problems. 
     Additionally, it can support fast recovery and can care for partially 
     multiple simultaneous failures. 
        
     The main concept of segment-wised ring are to partition a large network 
     into several small networks to configure ring to each small network. 
     The method to divide the large network is out of scope in this article. 
     Sub-networks can be chosen according to circumstance of a network such 
     as physical layer, call demands or QoS demands. In this article, network 
     is divided by based on physical layer. 
     In the segmented network, sub-RPC can recover failures in each sub-network.

   3. Logical Ring Configuration based on SRLG information 
    
   3.1 Logical Ring with SRLG 
    
     Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources or 
     groups of resources that share the same risk of failure.[7]  The 
     knowledge of SRLGs may be used to compute diverse paths that can be 
     used for protection in optical network. The concept of the SRLG has been 
     used for computing a path that is disjoint from a set of links sharing 
     the same risk. When tow or more links share the same risk, it means 
     that when a link failed, the others can fail at the same time.  Network 
     can be planned to recover from failures due to a single risk
     (represented by an SRLG) using different mechanism. The SRLG concept 
     generates another dimension to the existing constraint-based path 
     computation methods traditionally used in hierarchical networks 
      
     Existing logical ring architectures for recovery do not consider the 
     SRLG information for survivability of working paths and backup paths 
     and has just been configured based on topology information and 
     characteristics of network such as P-cycle or the RPC. For example, 
     the RPC mechanism provides protection switching at a fiber 
     granularity but there is a lack of true diverse fiber routes. If the 
     link from start node is broken, the network can not provide the 
     disjointness because of the SRLG property. This is very fatal 
     restriction to support survivability of connection with different 
     bandwidth requirements and QoS constraints. Existing logical ring 
     configuration does not take account into the probability of resource 
     failure and risk of the link. Therefore, the disjoint path may find 
     hardly and the probability of backup path failure increases although 
     the backup path may exist. We need to considier the possiblity of 
     failure of the logical ring configuration at the connection setup 
     stage.  
      
     We propose the network architecture as the concept of the logical ring 
     with the SRLG for reliable transmission in preconfiguration stage. The 
     network with ring-SRLG which is the set of SRLGs with contribution 
     weight per each link to avoid the danger of backup path failure and 
     guarantees the survivability of traffic. We describe the proposed network 
     architecture as the concept of the logical ring configuration with 
     SRLG for the purpose of restoration in mesh networks. In this 
    
    
   Choi et al    Expires -- August 2004                         [Page 6] 

                 End-to-End restoration with SRLG            February 2004 
    
     restoration architecture, backup paths can be easily established 
     through the end-to-end path, which follows the logical ring 
     configuration. It guarantees the establishment of backup path 
     disjointed from the working path. There are many algorithms to 
     generate logical rings in mesh network but we will use the similar 
     concept of p-cycle to make the logical ring pattern. The logical ring 
     with ring-SRLG has both a working path and a backup path in same ring with 
     one ring-SRLG and the connection in ring-SRLG must be two-connectivity, 
     which support logical ring in OXC based mesh network. In a network 
     which has a SRLG contribution weight associated with each network link 
     failure, a maximum weight spanning ring is a ring for which the sum of 
     the contribution weights of the SRLG per link is a maximum. The reason 
     of finding the maximized SRLG contribution weight ring is that is most 
     utilized the network resource of backup path and can reduce the 
     contention probability and be good resource efficiency. We repeatedly 
     find the logical ring pattern for the newly obtained maximum-weight 
     logical cycle in links and allocate the unique ring-SRLG ID in each 
     logical ring. We may consider various optimal ring selection 
     algorithms. Based on a given SRLG table, which is configured at each 
     node, one can make rings between a source node and a destination node. 
     There may be a number of rings, which include the source and the 
     destination. For the purpose of restoration, we have to select an 
     optimal ring among the rings list. The selection algorithm should be 
     restricted by a certain factors such as delay, link costs, and so on.  
      
     The ring with SRLG is preconfigured but resources are not allocated. 
     Therefore, the signaling is applied to the ring architecture for 
     backup resources after failures on working paths. In our mechanism, 
     signaling for restoration is needed along the primary route and the 
     restoration route at the time of initial connection setup. GMPLS 
     mechanism is similar to those used for setting up the primary path 
     and also be used to set up the restoration path. In shared-
     restoration related signaling, which we suggest, the signaling is 
     activated only in the case of failure. During restoration, affected 
     connections are rerouted along their alternate path and this 
     signaling can be used to reserve sufficient resources. To extend 
     network scale, the distributed system must be used than centralized 
     system. In order to configure the SRLG-based logical ring, we may use 
     a control unit handling the algorithm to set up the SRLG-based 
     logical ring as well as the GMPLS signaling. Our restoration 
     signaling on the SRLG-based logical ring can allow dynamic network 
     configuration instead of static configuration by operators or 
     management systems. The use of signaling with SRLG may reduce the 
     complexity of network configuration. 
      
    
   3.2 Resource allocation with SRLG in Logical Ring configuration 
    
     Backup resources should be allocated to the logical ring 
     configuration based on SRLG information in each node. Traditional 
     concept of SRLG is based on link. But we need the SRLG concept for the 
     end users. We can easily show the relationship between SRLG per link

     and ring-SRLG for end-to-end connection. The source node can 
     precompute the ring configuration based on SRLG information during 
     the primary path setup. The network architecture with the concept of 
     the logical ring with SRLG for reliable transmission is established 
     in preconfiguration stage.  
      
     As a matter of fact, each SRLG information per link is used to 
     alternate the failed link. In this case, the SRLG information can be 
     collected to a ring shape by the topology information. This network 
     is called as ring-SRLG, which is the set of SRLGs with contribution 
     weight per each link avoids the danger of backup path failure and 
     guarantees the survivability of traffic. The logical ring with ring-
     SRLG has both working path and backup path in same ring with one ring-
     SRLG and the connection in ring-SRLG must be two-connectivity, which 
     support logical ring in OXC based mesh network. In a network which has 
     a SRLG contribution weight associated with each network link failure, 
     a maximum weight spanning ring is a ring for which the sum of the 
     contribution weights of the SRLG per link is a maximum. 
      
     To discuss about the survivability of logical topology, we mean that 
     the logical topology is redundant (two-connectivity), that is the 
     logical topology remains connected when a physical link down. The 
     ingress nodes should have the SRLG history and ring-SRLG combined 
     with logical ring. The ingress node can precompute the ring 
     architecture before failure by using the network topology information and 
     the SRLG contribution weight factors and also configures the ring 
     architecture after failure by allocating resources by signaling for 
     backup resources.  
    
    
   3.3 Signaling for restoration of Logical Ring Configuration 
    
     We need the signaling to set up path reservation and confirmation 
     after failures. The ring with SRLG is preconfigured but resources are 
     not allocated. Therefore, the signaling is applied to the ring 
     architecture for backup resources after failures on working paths. 
     In our mechanism, signaling for restoration is needed along the 
     primary route and the restoration route at the time of initial 
     connection setup. GMPLS mechanism is similar to those used for 
     setting up the primary path and also be used to set up the 
     restoration path. In shared-restoration related signaling, which we 
     suggest, the signaling is activated only in the case of failure. 
     During restoration, affected connections are rerouted along their 
     alternate path and this signaling can be used to reserve sufficient 
     resources. To extend network scale, the distributed system must be 
     used than centralized system. In order to configure the SRLG-based 
     logical ring, we may use a control unit handling the algorithm to set 
     up the SRLG-based logical ring as well as the GMPLS signaling. Our 
     restoration signaling on the SRLG-based logical ring can allow 
     dynamic network configuration instead of static configuration by 
     operators or management systems. The use of signaling with SRLG may 
     reduce the complexity of network configuration.

     If there is just one ring pattern between a source and a destination, 
     the working path and the backup path would be configured via the ring. 
     In this case, the backup path will follow opposite direction on the 
     ring. It will simply guarantee the disjoint path between the working 
     and backup paths. We also need to consider that there is a segment-
     wised ring from the source to the destination, and then the working 
     and backup path will pass several sub-rings. It may cause confliction 
     between the working and backup paths at the cross point between rings 
     when the backup path follows the same route on the ring of next sub-
     networks. In order to guarantee to establish the backup path through 
     the different route with working path, it requires a rule which the 
     signaling is delivered a certain direction. For example, if the 
     working path is established through clock-wise direction on rings 
     from the source to the destination, the backup path should be set up 
     via counter clock-wise direction.  
      
          
   4. Signaling Extension for Restoration with SRLG  
      
     In this section, we describe the signaling extension to support the 
     ring architecture with SRLG for backup path. Also we can show the 
     message format and its definition. The ring has unique ID. With the 
     ring ID we should consider the signaling for backup ring setup.

    BACKUP Ring Object (BRO) 
      
     The BACKUP ROUTE Object (BRO)is defined to indicate that the backup 
     resources should be allocated on ring architecture. The BRO can be 
     presented in path messages and handles the backup ring corresponding 
     the failed working LSP and its SRLGs for physical/logical disjointess 
     between working LSP and backup LSP. The BRO has the following format.

   5. Conclusion 
    
     Network survivability is a critical requirement in the high-speed 
     network. So, recovery mechanisms that can provide fast recovery and 
     efficient capacity are needed. We proposed the new network restoration 
     architecture called ring-SRLG that has grouped traffic shaped logical 
     ring by considering of SRLG and sharing resources in GMPLS based networks. 
     Ring-SRLG can guarantee the survivability of backup path with 
     constraint to the other logical ring configurations. Our proposed 
     backup paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path, 
     which follows the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the 
     establishment of backup path disjointed from the working path. We

                 End-to-End restoration with SRLG            February 2004 
    
     also propose the GMPLS signaling extension for the end-to-end 
     restoration based on the SRLG-based logical ring configuration. In 
     order to configure the SRLG-based logical ring, we may use a control 
     unit handling the algorithm to set up the SRLG-based logical ring as 
     well as the GMPLS signaling. Our restoration signaling on the SRLG-
     based logical ring can allow dynamic network configuration. The use 
     of logical ring configuration and signaling with SRLG may provide 
     efficient network resources and disjointness.
