<h1><br />Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name
    and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry<br />draft-ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports-07</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document defines the procedures that the Internet Assigned
      Numbers Authority (IANA) uses when handling registration and other
      requests related to the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
      Registry. It also discusses the rationale and principles behind these
      procedures and how they facilitate the long-term sustainability of the
      registry.
</p>
<p>This document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting Sections 8 and
      9.1 of the IANA allocation guidelines [RFC2780], and it updates the IANA
      allocation procedures for UDP-Lite [RFC3828], DCCP [RFC4340] and SCTP
      [RFC4960]. It also updates the DNS SRV specification [RFC2782] to
      clarify what a service name is and how it is registered.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>For many years, the allocation of new service names and port number
      values for use with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0768'>[RFC0768]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;User Datagram Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1980.</span><span>)</span></a> have had less than clear guidelines. New
      transport protocols have been added - the Stream Control Transmission
      Protocol (SCTP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>[RFC4960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and the Datagram
      Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4342'>[RFC4342]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Kohler, E., and J. Padhye, &ldquo;Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control ID 3: TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> - and
      new mechanisms like DNS SRV records <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> have
      been developed, each with separate registries and separate guidelines.
      The community also recognized the need for additional procedures beyond
      just assignment; notably modification, revocation, and release.
</p>
<p>A key element of the procedural streamlining specified in this
      document is to establish identical assignment procedures for all IETF
      transport protocols. This document brings the IANA procedures for TCP
      and UDP in line with those for SCTP and DCCP, resulting in a single
      process that requesters and IANA follow for all requests for all
      transport protocols, including future protocols not yet defined.
</p>
<p>In addition to detailing the IANA procedures for the initial
      assignment of service names and port numbers, this document also
      specifies post-assignment procedures that until now have been handled in
      an ad hoc manner. These include procedures to de-register a port number
      that is no longer in use, to re-use a port number allocated for one
      application that is no longer in use for another application, and the
      procedure by which IANA can unilaterally revoke a prior port number
      assignment. <a class='info' href='#iana-procedures'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>IANA Procedures for Managing the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry</span><span>)</span></a> discusses the
      specifics of these procedures and processes that requesters and IANA
      follow for all requests for all current and future transport
      protocols.
</p>
<p>IANA is the authority for assigning service names and port numbers.
      The registries that are created to store these registrations are
      maintained by IANA. For protocols developed by IETF working groups, IANA
      now also offers a method for the "early assignment" <a class='info' href='#RFC4020'>[RFC4020]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kompella, K. and A. Zinin, &ldquo;Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> of service names and port numbers, as described
      in <a class='info' href='#registration'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number Registration</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document updates IANA's procedures for UDP and TCP port numbers
      by obsoleting Sections 8 and 9.1 of the IANA allocation guidelines <a class='info' href='#RFC2780'>[RFC2780]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and V. Paxson, &ldquo;IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. (Note that other sections of the IANA
      allocation guidelines, relating to the protocol field values in IPv4
      header, were also updated in February 2008 <a class='info' href='#RFC5237'>[RFC5237]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J. and S. Bradner, &ldquo;IANA Allocation Guidelines for the Protocol Field,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.) This document also updates the IANA
      allocation procedures for DCCP <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and SCTP
      <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>[RFC4960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) <a class='info' href='#RFC5237'>[RFC5237]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J. and S. Bradner, &ldquo;IANA Allocation Guidelines for the Protocol Field,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> shares the port space with UDP. The UDP-Lite
      specification says: "UDP-Lite uses the same set of port number values
      assigned by the IANA for use by UDP". Thus the update of UDP procedures
      result in an update also of the UDP-Lite procedures.
</p>
<p>This document also clarifies what a service name is and how it is
      registered. This will impact the DNS SRV specification <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, because that specification merely makes a
      brief mention that the symbolic names of services are defined in
      "Assigned Numbers" <a class='info' href='#RFC1700'>[RFC1700]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Reynolds, J. and J. Postel, &ldquo;Assigned Numbers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a>, without stating to
      which section it refers within that 230-page document. The DNS SRV
      specification may have been referring to the list of Port Assignments
      (known as /etc/services on Unix), or to the "Protocol And Service Names"
      section, or to both, or to some other section. Furthermore, "Assigned
      Numbers" is now obsolete <a class='info' href='#RFC3232'>[RFC3232]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Reynolds, J., &ldquo;Assigned Numbers: RFC 1700 is Replaced by an On-line Database,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> and has been
      replaced by on-line registries <a class='info' href='#PORTREG'>[PORTREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number           Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#PROTSERVREG'>[PROTSERVREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Protocol and Service Names Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The development of new transport protocols is a major effort that the
      IETF does not undertake very often. If a new transport protocol is
      standardized in the future, for consistency it is expected to follow as
      much as possible the guidelines and practices around using service names
      and port numbers.

Motivation</h3>

<p>Information about the registration procedures for the port registry
      has existed in three locations: the forms for requesting port number
      registrations on the IANA web site <a class='info' href='#SYSFORM'>[SYSFORM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Application for System (Well Known) Port Number,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#USRFORM'>[USRFORM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Application for User (Registered) Port Number,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, an introductory text section in the file
      listing the port number registrations themselves <a class='info' href='#PORTREG'>[PORTREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number           Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, and two brief sections of the IANA Allocation
      Guidelines <a class='info' href='#RFC2780'>[RFC2780]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and V. Paxson, &ldquo;IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the procedures surrounding service names have been
      historically unclear. Service names were originally created as mnemonic
      identifiers for port numbers without a well-defined syntax, beyond the
      14-character limit mentioned on the IANA website <a class='info' href='#SYSFORM'>[SYSFORM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Application for System (Well Known) Port Number,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#USRFORM'>[USRFORM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Application for User (Registered) Port Number,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Even that
      length limit has not been consistently applied, and some assigned
      service names are 15 characters long. When service identification via
      DNS SRV Resource Records (RRs) was introduced, the requirement by IANA
      to only assign service names and port numbers in combination, led to the
      creation of an ad hoc service name registry outside of the control of
      IANA <a class='info' href='#SRVREG'>[SRVREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;DNS SRV Service Types Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document aggregates all this scattered information into a single
      reference that aligns and clearly defines the management procedures for
      both service names and port numbers. It gives more detailed guidance to
      prospective requesters of service names and ports than the existing
      documentation, and it streamlines the IANA procedures for the management
      of the registry, so that requests can be completed in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>This document defines rules for registration of service names without
      associated port numbers, for such usages as DNS SRV records <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, which was not possible under the previous IANA
      procedures. The document also merges service name registrations from the
      non-IANA ad hoc registry <a class='info' href='#SRVREG'>[SRVREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;DNS SRV Service Types Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> and from the IANA
      "Protocol and Service Names" registry <a class='info' href='#PROTSERVREG'>[PROTSERVREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Protocol and Service Names Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>
      into the IANA "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number" registry
      <a class='info' href='#PORTREG'>[PORTREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number           Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, which from here on is the single
      authoritative registry for service names and port numbers.
</p>
<p>An additional purpose of this document is to describe the principles
      that guide the IETF and IANA in their role as the long-term joint
      stewards of the service name and port number registry. TCP and UDP have
      had remarkable success over the last decades. Thousands of applications
      and application-level protocols have service names and ports assigned
      for their use, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will
      continue into the future. It is hence extremely important that
      management of the registry follow principles that ensure its long-term
      usefulness as a shared resource. <a class='info' href='#principles'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Principles for Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry Management</span><span>)</span></a>
      discusses these principles in detail.

Background</h3>

<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0768'>[RFC0768]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;User Datagram Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1980.</span><span>)</span></a> have enjoyed a remarkable success over the
      decades as the two most widely used transport protocols on the Internet.
      They have relied on the concept of "ports" as logical entities for
      Internet communication. Ports serve two purposes: first, they provide a
      demultiplexing identifier to differentiate transport sessions between
      the same pair of endpoints, and second, they may also identify the
      application protocol and associated service to which processes bind.
      Newer transport protocols, such as the Stream Control Transmission
      Protocol (SCTP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>[RFC4960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and the Datagram
      Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4342'>[RFC4342]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Kohler, E., and J. Padhye, &ldquo;Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control ID 3: TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> have
      also adopted the concept of ports for their communication sessions and
      use 16-bit port numbers in the same way as TCP and UDP (and
      UDP-Lite <a class='info' href='#RFC3828'>[RFC3828]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Larzon, L-A., Degermark, M., Pink, S., Jonsson, L-E., and G. Fairhurst, &ldquo;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, a variant of UDP).
</p>
<p>Port numbers are the original and most widely used means for
      application and service identification on the Internet. Ports are
      16-bit numbers, and the combination of source and destination port
      numbers together with the IP addresses of the communicating end systems
      uniquely identifies a session of a given transport protocol. Port
      numbers are also known by their associated service names such as
      "telnet" for port number 23 and "http" (as well as "www" and "www-http")
      for port number 80.
</p>
<p>Hosts running services, hosts accessing services on other hosts, and
      intermediate devices (such as firewalls and NATs) that restrict services
      need to agree on which service corresponds to a particular destination
      port. Although this is ultimately a local decision with meaning only
      between the endpoints of a connection, it is common for many services to
      have a default port upon which those servers usually listen, when
      possible, and these ports are recorded by the Internet Assigned Numbers
      Authority (IANA) through the service name and port number registry <a class='info' href='#PORTREG'>[PORTREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number           Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Over time, the assumption that a particular port number necessarily
      implies a particular service may become less true. For example, multiple
      instances of the same service on the same host cannot generally listen
      on the same port, and multiple hosts behind the same NAT gateway cannot
      all have a mapping for the same port on the external side of the NAT
      gateway, whether using static port mappings configured by hand by the
      user, or dynamic port mappings configured automatically using a port
      mapping protocol like <a class='info' href='#I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp'>NAT Port
      Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cheshire, S., &ldquo;NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.cheshire&#8209;nat&#8209;pmp] or <a class='info' href='#IGD'>Internet
      Gateway Device (IGD)<span> (</span><span class='info'>UPnP Forum, &ldquo;Internet Gateway Device (IGD) V 1.0,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [IGD].
</p>
<p>Applications may use numeric port numbers directly, look up port
      numbers based on service names via system calls such as getservbyname()
      on UNIX, look up port numbers by performing queries for DNS SRV records
      <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd'>[I&#8209;D.cheshire&#8209;dnsext&#8209;dns&#8209;sd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cheshire, S. and M. Krochmal, &ldquo;DNS-Based Service Discovery,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, or determine port numbers
      in a variety of other ways like the TCP Port Service Multiplexer
      (TCPMUX) <a class='info' href='#RFC1078'>[RFC1078]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lottor, M., &ldquo;TCP port service Multiplexer (TCPMUX),&rdquo; November&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Designers of applications and application-level protocols may apply
      to IANA for an assigned service name and port number for a specific
      application, and may - after successful registration - assume that no
      other application will use that service name or port number for its
      communication sessions. Alternatively, application designers may also
      ask for only an assigned service name, if their application does not
      require a fixed port number. The latter alternative is encouraged when
      possible, in order to conserve the more limited port number space. This
      is applicable, for example, to applications that use DNS SRV records to
      look up port numbers at runtime.

Service Names</h3>

<p>Service names are the unique key in the Service Name and Transport
      Protocol Port Number Registry. This unique symbolic name for a service
      may also be used for other purposes, such as in <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>DNS SRV records<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2782]. Within the registry, this
      unique key ensures that different services can be unambiguously
      distinguished, thus preventing name collisions and avoiding confusion
      about who is the Registrant for a particular entry.
</p>
<p>There may be more than one service name associated with a particular
      transport protocol and port. There are three ways that such service name
      overloading can occur: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Overloading occurs when one service is an extension of another
          service, and an in-band mechanism exists for determining if the
          extension is present or not. One example is port 3478, which has the
          service name aliases "stun" and "turn". TURN <a class='info' href='#RFC5766'>[RFC5766]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> is an extension to the STUN <a class='info' href='#RFC5389'>[RFC5389]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> service. TURN-enabled clients wishing to
          locate TURN servers could attempt to discover "stun" services and
          then check in-band if the server supports TURN, but this would be
          inefficient. Enabling them to directly query for "turn" servers by
          name is a better approach. (Note that TURN servers in this case
          should also be locatable via a "stun" discovery, because every TURN
          server is also a STUN server.)
</li>
<li>By historical accident the service name "http" corresponds to
          the same port number as 
          "www" and "www-http". When used in SRV records <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L. Esibov, &ldquo;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, and similar service discovery mechanisms
          only the service name "http" should be used, not these additional
          names. If a
          server were to advertise "www" then it would not be discovered by
          clients browsing for "http". Advertising or browsing for the aliases
          as well as the primary service name would be inefficient, and
          achieves nothing that it not already achieved by using the service
          name "http" exclusively.
</li>
<li>As indicated in this document, in 
          <a class='info' href='#consistency'>Section&nbsp;10.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name Consistency</span><span>)</span></a>, to enable	
          legacy names to be replaced with names consistent with the	
          syntax this document prescribes. In this case, only the	
          new name should be used in SRV records, both to avoid	
          the same issues as with historical cases of multiple names,	
          as well as because the legacy names are incompatible with	
          SRV record use.
</li>
</ul><p> For future assignments, applications will not be permitted
      that merely request a new name exactly duplicating an existing service.
      Having multiple names for the same service serves no purpose.
      Implementers are requested to inform IANA if they discover other cases
      where a single service has multiple names, so that one name may be
      recorded as the primary name for service discovery purposes.
</p>
<p>Service names are assigned on a "first come, first served" basis, as
      described in <a class='info' href='#registration'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number Registration</span><span>)</span></a>. Names should be brief
      and informative, avoiding words or abbreviations that are redundant in
      the context of the registry (e.g., "port", "service", "protocol", etc.)
      Names referring to discovery services, e.g., using multicast or
      broadcast to identify endpoints capable of a given service, SHOULD use
      an easily identifiable suffix (e.g., "-disc").

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Service Name Syntax</h3>

<p>Valid service names are hereby normatively defined as follows: 
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>MUST be at least 1 character and no more than 15 characters
            long
</li>
<li>MUST contain only US-ASCII <a class='info' href='#ANSI.X3-4.1986'>[ANSI.X3&#8209;4.1986]<span> (</span><span class='info'>American National Standards Institute, &ldquo;Coded Character Set - 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange,&rdquo; 1986.</span><span>)</span></a> letters 'A' - 'Z' and 'a' - 'z',
            digits '0' - '9', and hyphens ('-', ASCII 0x2D or decimal 45)
</li>
<li>MUST contain at least one letter ('A' - 'Z' or 'a' - 'z')
</li>
<li>MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen
</li>
<li>hyphens MUST NOT be adjacent to other hyphens
</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for requiring at least one letter is to avoid service
        names like "23" (could be confused with a numeric port number) or
        "6000-6063" (could be confused with a numeric port number range).
        Although service names may contain both upper-case and lower-case
        letters, case is ignored for comparison purposes, so both "http" and
        "HTTP" denote the same service.
</p>
<p>Service names are purely opaque identifiers, and no semantics are
        implied by any superficial structure that a given service name may
        appear to have. For example, a company called "Example" may choose to
        register service names "Example-Foo" and "Example-Bar" for its "Foo"
        and "Bar" products, but the "Example" company can't claim to "own" all
        service names beginning with "Example-", they can't prevent someone
        else registering "Example-Baz" for a different service, and they can't
        prevent other developers from using the "Example-Foo" and
        "Example-Bar" service types in order to interoperate with the "Foo"
        and "Bar" products. Technically speaking, in service discovery
        protocols, service names are merely a series of byte values on the
        wire; for the mnemonic convenience of human developers it can be
        convenient to interpret those byte values as human-readable ascii
        characters, but software should treat them as purely opaque
        identifiers and not attempt to parse them for any additional embedded
        meaning.
</p>
<p>In approximately 98% of cases, the new "service name" is exactly
        the same as the old historic "short name" from the IANA web forms
        <a class='info' href='#SYSFORM'>[SYSFORM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Application for System (Well Known) Port Number,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#USRFORM'>[USRFORM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Application for User (Registered) Port Number,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. In
        approximately 2% of cases, the new "service name" is derived from the
        old historic "short name" as described below in <a class='info' href='#consistency'>Section&nbsp;10.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name Consistency</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The rules for valid service names, excepting the limit of 15 characters
        maximum, are also expressed below (as a non-normative convenience) using

Port Number Ranges</h3>

<p>TCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP and DCCP use 16-bit namespaces for
      their port number registries. The port registries for all these
      transport protocols are subdivided into three ranges of numbers, and
      <a class='info' href='#variances'>Section&nbsp;8.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges</span><span>)</span></a> describes the IANA procedures for each
      range in detail: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the System Ports, also known as the Well Known Ports, from 0-1023
          (assigned by IANA)
</li>
<li>the User Ports, also known as the Registered Ports, from
          1024-49151 (assigned by IANA)
</li>
<li>the Dynamic Ports, also known as the Private Ports, from
          49152-65535 (never assigned)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the assignable port ranges (System Ports and User Ports, i.e.,
      port numbers 0-49151), individual port numbers are in one of three
      states at any given time:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Assigned: Assigned port numbers are currently allocated to the
          service indicated in the registry.
</li>
<li>Unassigned: Unassigned port numbers are currently available for
          assignment upon request, as per the procedures outlined in this
          document.
</li>
<li>Reserved: Reserved port numbers are not available for regular
          assignment; they are "assigned to IANA" for special purposes.
          Reserved port numbers include values at the edges of each range,
          e.g., 0, 1023, 1024, etc., which may be used to extend these ranges
          or the overall port number space in the future.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to keep the size of the registry manageable, IANA typically
      only records the Assigned and Reserved service names and port numbers in
      the registry. Unassigned values are typically not explicitly listed.
      (There are an near-infinite number of Unassigned service names and
      enumerating them all would not be practical.)
</p>
<p>As a data point, when this document was written, approximately 76% of
      the TCP and UDP System Ports were assigned, and approximately 9% of the
      User Ports were assigned. (As noted, Dynamic Ports are never
      assigned.)

Service names and Port Numbers for Experimentation</h3>

<p>Of the System Ports, two TCP and UDP port numbers (1021 and 1022),
        together with their respective service names ("exp1" and "exp2"), have
        been assigned for experimentation with new applications and
        application-layer protocols that require a port number in the assigned
        ports ranges <a class='info' href='#RFC4727'>[RFC4727]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fenner, B., &ldquo;Experimental Values In IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, UDP, and TCP Headers,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Please refer to Sections 1 and 1.1 of "Assigning Experimental and
        Testing Numbers Considered Useful" <a class='info' href='#RFC3692'>[RFC3692]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., &ldquo;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> for
        how these experimental port numbers are to be used.
</p>
<p>This document registers the same two service names and port numbers
        for experimentation with new application-layer protocols over SCTP and
        DCCP in <a class='info' href='#sctpdccpexp'>Section&nbsp;10.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Port Numbers for SCTP and DCCP Experimentation</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it can be difficult to limit access to these ports.
        Users SHOULD take measures to ensure that experimental ports are
        connecting to the intended process. For example, users of these
        experimental ports might include a 64-bit nonce, once on each segment
        of a message-oriented channel (e.g., UDP), or once at the beginning of
        a byte-stream (e.g., TCP), which is used to confirm that the port is
        being used as intended. Such confirmation of intended use is
        especially important when these ports are associated with privileged
        (e.g., system or administrator) processes.

Principles for Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry Management</h3>

<p>Management procedures for the service name and transport protocol
      port number registry include allocation of service names and port
      numbers upon request, as well as management of information about
      existing allocations. The latter includes maintaining contact and
      description information about assignments, revoking abandoned
      assignments, and redefining assignments when needed. Of these
      procedures, careful port number allocation is most critical, in order to
      continue to conserve the remaining port numbers.
</p>
<p>As noted earlier, only about 9% of the User Port space is currently
      assigned. The current rate of assignment is approximately 400 ports per
      year, and has remained steady for the past 8 years. At that rate, if
      similar conservation continues, this resource will sustain another 85
      years of assignment - without the need to resort to reassignment of
      released values or revocation. The namespace available for service names
      is much larger, which allows for simpler management procedures.

Past Principles</h3>

<p>Before the publication of this document, the principles of service
        name and port number management followed a few mostly-undocumented
        guidelines. They are recorded here for historical purposes, and this
        document updates them in <a class='info' href='#upprinc'>Section&nbsp;7.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Updated Principles</span><span>)</span></a>. These
        principles were:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>TCP and UDP ports were simultaneously allocated when either was
            requested
</li>
<li>Port numbers were the primary allocation; service names were
            informative only, and did not have a well-defined syntax
</li>
<li>Port numbers were conserved informally, and sometimes
            inconsistently (e.g., some services were allocated ranges of many
            port numbers even where not strictly necessary)
</li>
<li>SCTP and DCCP service name and port number registries were
            managed separately from the TCP/UDP registries
</li>
<li>Service names could not be assigned in the old ports registry
            without assigning an associated port number at the same time
</li>
</ul><p> This document clarifies and aligns these guidelines in order
        to more conservatively manage the limited remaining port number space
        and to enable and promote the use of service names for service
        identification without associated port numbers, where possible.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h3>7.2.&nbsp;
Updated Principles</h3>

<p>This section summarizes the basic principles by which IANA handles
        the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry, and
        attempts to conserve the port number space. This description is
        intended to inform applicants requesting service names and port
        numbers. IANA are not required to be bound by these principles 
        when handling requests; other factors may come into play, 
        and exceptions may occur where deemed in the best interest of 
        the Internet.
</p>
<p>IANA will begin assigning service names that do not request an
        associated port number allocation under a simple "First Come, First
        Served" policy <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. IANA MAY, at its
        discretion, refer service name requests to "Expert Review" in cases of
        mass registrations or other situations where IANA believes expert
        review is advisable.
</p>
<p>The basic principle of service name and port number registry
        management is to conserve use of the port space where possible.
        Extensions to support larger port number spaces would require changing
        many core protocols of the current Internet in a way that would not be
        backward compatible and interfere with both current and legacy
        applications. To help ensure this conservation the policy for any
        registration request for port number allocations uses the "Expert
        Review" policy <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Conservation of the port number space is required because this
        space is a limited resource, so applications are expected to
        participate in the traffic demultiplexing process where feasible. The
        port numbers are expected to encode as little information as possible
        that will still enable an application to perform further
        demultiplexing by itself. In particular:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>IANA will allocate only one assigned port number per service or
            application
</li>
<li>IANA will allocate only one assigned port number for all
            versions of a service (e.g., running the service with or without a
            security mechanism, or for updated variants of a service)
</li>
<li>IANA will allocate only one assigned port number for all
            different types of device using or participating in the same
            service
</li>
<li>IANA will allocate port numbers only for the transport
            protocol(s) explicitly named in a registration request
</li>
<li>IANA may recover unused port numbers, via the new procedures of
            de-registration, revocation, and transfer
</li>
</ul><p> Where possible, a given service is expected to demultiplex
        messages if necessary. For example, applications and protocols are
        expected to include in-band version information, so that future
        versions of the application or protocol can share the same allocated
        port. Applications and protocols are also expected to be able to
        efficiently use a single allocated port for multiple sessions, either
        by demultiplexing multiple streams within one port, or using the
        allocated port to coordinate using dynamic ports for subsequent
        exchanges (e.g., in the spirit of FTP <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>Ports are used in various ways, notably:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>as endpoint process identifiers
</li>
<li>as application protocol identifiers
</li>
<li>for firewall filtering purposes
</li>
</ul><p> Both the process identifier and the protocol identifier uses
        suggest that anything a single process can demultiplex, or that can be
        encoded into a single protocol, should be. The firewall filtering use
        suggests that some uses that could be multiplexed or encoded could
        instead be separated to allow for easier firewall management. Note
        that this latter use is much less sound, because port numbers have
        meaning only for the two endpoints involved in a connection, and
        drawing conclusions about the service that generated a given flow
        based on observed port numbers is not always reliable.  Further,
        previous separation of protocol variants based on security
        capabilities (e.g., HTTP on TCP port 80 vs. HTTPS on TCP port 443) is
        not recommended for new protocols, because all new protocols should be
        security-capable and capable of negotiating the use of security
        in-band.
</p>
<p>IANA will begin assigning port numbers for only those transport
        protocols explicitly included in a registration request. This ends the
        long-standing practice of automatically assigning a port number to an
        application for both TCP and a UDP, even if the request is for only
        one of these transport protocols. The new allocation procedure
        conserves resources by allocating a port number to an application for
        only those transport protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP and/or DCCP) it
        actually uses. The port number will be marked as Reserved - instead of
        Assigned - in the port number registries of the other transport
        protocols. When applications start supporting the use of some of those
        additional transport protocols, the Registrant for the
        registration MUST request IANA to convert the reservation into a
        proper assignment. An application MUST NOT assume that it can use a
        port number assigned to it for use with one transport protocol with
        another transport protocol without asking IANA to convert the
        reservation into an assignment.
</p>
<p>When the available pool of unassigned numbers has run out in a
        ports range, it will be necessary for IANA to consider the Reserved
        ports for assignment. This is part of the motivation for not
        automatically assigning ports for transport protocols other than the
        requested one(s). This will allow more ports to be available for
        assignment when that time comes. To help conserve ports, application
        developers should register only the transport protocols that their
        application currently uses.
</p>
<p>Conservation of port numbers is improved by procedures that allow
        previously allocated port numbers to become Unassigned, either through
        de-registration or through revocation, and by a procedure that lets
        application designers transfer an allocated but unused port number to
        a new application. <a class='info' href='#iana-procedures'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>IANA Procedures for Managing the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry</span><span>)</span></a> describes
        these procedures, which until now were undocumented. Port number
        conservation is also improved by recommending that applications that
        do not require an allocated port should register only a service name
        without an associated port number.

IANA Procedures for Managing the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry</h3>

<p>This section describes the process for handling requests associated
      with IANA's management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port
      Number Registry. Such requests include initial registration,
      de-registration, re-use, changes to the service name, and updates to the
      contact information or description associated with an assignment.
      Revocation is as additional process, initiated by IANA.

<a name="rfc.section.8.1"></a><h3>8.1.&nbsp;
Service Name and Port Number Registration</h3>

<p>Registration refers to the allocation of service names or port
        numbers to applicants. All such registrations are made from service
        names or port numbers that are Unassigned or Reserved at the time of
        the allocation. Unassigned names and numbers are allocated according
        to the rules described in <a class='info' href='#variances'>Section&nbsp;8.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges</span><span>)</span></a> below. Reserved
        numbers and names are assigned only by Standards Action or IESG Approval,
        and MUST accompanied by a statement explaining the reason a Reserved
        number or name is appropriate for this action.
</p>
<p>When a registration for one or more transport protocols is
        approved, the port number for any non-requested transport protocol(s)
        will be marked as Reserved. IANA SHOULD NOT assign that port number to
        any other application or service until no other port numbers remain
        Unassigned in the requested range. The current Registrant
        for a port number MAY register these Reserved port numbers for other
        transport protocols when needed.
</p>
<p>A service name or port number
        registration request contains the following information. The service
        name is the unique identifier of a given service:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">

<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Service Name: A desired unique service name for the service
            associated with the registration request MUST be provided, for use
            in various service selection and discovery mechanisms (including,
            but not limited to, DNS SRV records <a class='info' href='#RFC2782'>[RFC2782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gulbrandsen, A., Vixie, P., and L.

            syntax defined in <a class='info' href='#sec-syntax'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name Syntax</span><span>)</span></a>. In order to
            be unique, they MUST NOT be identical to any currently assigned

            Service names are case-insensitive; they may be provided and
            entered into the registry with mixed case for clarity, but for the
            comparison purposes the case is ignored.
</li>
<li>Transport Protocol(s): The transport protocol(s) for which a 
            allocation is requested MUST be provided. This field is currently
            limited to one or more of TCP, UDP, SCTP, and DCCP. Requests 
            without any port allocation and only a service name are still required
            to indicate which protocol the service uses. 
</li>
<li>Registrant: Name and email address of the Registrant. This is
            REQUIRED. The Registrant is the Organization or Company
            responsible for the initial registration. For registrations done
            through IETF-published RFCs, the Registrant will be the IESG.
</li>
<li>Contact: Name and email address of the Contact person for the
            registration. This is REQUIRED. The Contact person is the
            responsible person for the Internet community to send questions
            to. This person would also be authorized to submit changes on
            behalf of the Registrant; in cases of conflict between the
            Registrant and the Contact, the Registrant decisions take precedence. 
            Additional address information MAY be
            provided. For registrations done through IETF-published RFCs, the
            Contact will be the IESG.
</li>
<li>Description: A short description of the service associated with
            the registration request is REQUIRED. It should avoid all but the
            most well-known acronyms.
</li>
<li>Reference: A description of (or a reference to a document
            describing) the protocol or application using this port. The
            description must state whether the protocol uses broadcast,
            multicast, or anycast communication. <br />
<br />
 For
            registrations requesting only a Service Name, or a Service Name
            and User Port, a statement that the protocol is proprietary and
            not publicly documented is also acceptable provided that the
            required information regarding use of broadcast, multicast, or
            anycast is given. <br />
<br />
 For registration
            requests for a User Port, the registration request MUST explain
            why a port number in the Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable for the
            given application. <br />
<br />
 For registration
            requests for a System Port, the registration request MUST explain
            why a port number in the User Ports or Dynamic Ports ranges is
            unsuitable, and a reference to a stable protocol specification
            document MUST be provided. For requests from IETF Working Groups,
            IANA MAY accept "early registration" <a class='info' href='#RFC4020'>[RFC4020]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kompella, K. and A. Zinin, &ldquo;Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> requests referencing a sufficiently
            stable Internet Draft instead of a published Standards-Track
            RFC.
</li>
<li>Port Number: If assignment of a port number is desired, 
            either the currently Unassigned or Reserved port number the 
            requester suggests for allocation, or indication of which 
            port range, user or system, that the requester requires, 
            MUST be provided. If only a service name is to be assigned, 
            this field is left empty. If a specific port number is 
            requested, IANA is encouraged to allocate the requested 
            number. If a range is specified, IANA will choose a suitable 
            number from the User or System Ports ranges. Note that the 
            applicant MUST NOT use the requested port prior to the 
            completion of the registration.
</li>
<li>Service Code: If the registration request includes DCCP as a
            transport protocol then the request MUST include a desired unique
            DCCP service code <a class='info' href='#RFC5595'>[RFC5595]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fairhurst, G., &ldquo;The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Service Codes,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, and MUST NOT
            include a requested DCCP service code otherwise. Section 19.8 of
            the DCCP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> defines
            requirements and rules for allocation, updated by this
            document.
</li>
<li>Known Unauthorized Uses: A list of uses by applications or
            organizations who are not the Registrant. This list may be augmented
            by IANA after assignment when unauthorized uses are reported.
</li>
<li>Assignment Notes: Indications of owner/name change, or any
            other assignment process issue. This list may be updated by IANA
            after assignment to help track changes to an assignment, e.g.,
            de-registration, owner/name changes, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the registration request is for the addition of a new transport
        protocol to an already assigned service name, IANA needs to confirm
        with the Registrant for the existing assignment whether
        this addition is appropriate.
</p>
<p>If the registration request is for a service name overloading a 
        port number (see Section 5), IANA needs to confirm with the 
        Registrant for the existing service name whether the registration of
        the overloading is appropriate.
</p>
<p>When IANA receives a registration request - containing the 
        above information - that is requesting a port number, IANA SHALL 
        initiate an "Expert Review" <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> in 
        order to determine whether an assignment should be made. For 
        requests that are not requesting a port number, IANA SHOULD 
        assign the service name under a simple "First Come First Served" 
        policy <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<li>Ports in the Dynamic Ports range (49152-65535) have been
                specifically set aside for local and dynamic use and cannot be
                assigned through IANA. Application software may simply use them
                for communication without any sort of registration. On the other
                hand, application software MUST NOT assume that a specific port
                number in the Dynamic Ports range will always be available for
                communication at all times, and a port number in that range hence
                MUST NOT be used as a service identifier.
</li>
<li>Ports in the User Ports range (1024-49151) are available for
                registration through IANA, and MAY be used as service identifiers
                upon successful registration. Because registering a port number
                for a specific application consumes a fraction of the shared
                resource that is the port number registry, IANA will require the
                requester to document the intended use of the port number. This
                documentation will be input to the "Expert Review" allocation
                procedure <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, by which IANA will have
                a technical expert review the request to determine whether to
                grant the registration. The submitted documentation MUST explain
                why using a port number in the Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable
                for the given application. Ports in the User Ports range may also
                be assigned under the "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" allocation
                procedures <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, which is how most
                assignments for IETF protocols are handled.
</li>
<li>Ports in the System Ports range (0-1023) are also available for
                registration through IANA. Because the System Ports range is both
                the smallest and the most densely allocated, the requirements for
                new allocations are more strict than those for the User Ports
                range, and will only be granted under the "IETF Review" or "IESG
                Approval" allocation procedures <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. A
                request for a System Port number MUST document *both* why using a
                port number from the User Ports is unsuitable *and* why using a
                port number from the Dynamic Ports ranges is unsuitable for that

Service Name and Port Number De-Registration</h3>

<p>The Registrant of a granted port number assignment can
        return the port number to IANA at any time if they no longer have a
        need for it. The port number will be de-registered and will be marked
        as Reserved. IANA should not re-assign port numbers that have been
        de-registered until all unassigned port numbers in the specific range
        have been assigned.
</p>
<p>Before proceeding with a port number de-registration, IANA needs to
        reasonably establish that the value is actually no longer in use.
</p>
<p>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that a
        given service name remain assigned even after all associated port
        number assignments have become de-registered. Under this policy, it
        will appear in the registry as if it had been created through a
        service name registration request that did not include any port
        numbers.
</p>
<p>On rare occasions, it may still be useful to de-register a service
        name. In such cases, IANA will mark the service name as Reserved. IANA
        will involve their IESG-appointed expert in such cases.
</p>
<p>IANA will include a comment in the registry when de-registration 
        happens to indicate its historic usage.

Service Name and Port Number Re-Use</h3>

<p>If the Registrant of a granted port number assignment
        no longer have a need for the assigned number, but would like to
        re-use it for a different application, they can submit a request to
        IANA to do so.
</p>
<p>Logically, port number re-use is to be thought of as a
        de-registration (<a class='info' href='#deregistration'>Section&nbsp;8.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number De-Registration</span><span>)</span></a>) followed by an
        immediate re-registration (<a class='info' href='#registration'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number Registration</span><span>)</span></a>) of the
        same port number for a new application. Consequently, the information
        that needs to be provided about the proposed new use of the port
        number is identical to what would need to be provided for a new port
        number allocation for the specific ports range.
</p>
<p>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that the
        original service name associated with the prior use of the port number
        remains assigned, and a new service be created and associated with the
        port number. This is again consistent with viewing a re-use request as
        a de-registration followed by an immediate re-registration. Re-using
        an assigned service name for a different application is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.
</p>
<p>IANA needs to carefully review such requests before approving them.
        In some instances, the Expert Reviewer will determine that the
        application that the port number was assigned to has found usage
        beyond the original requester, or that there is a concern that it may
        have such users. This determination MUST be made quickly. A community
        call concerning revocation of a port number (see below) MAY be
        considered, if a broader use of the port number is suspected.

Service Name and Port Number Revocation</h3>

<p>A port number revocation can be thought of as an IANA-initiated
        de-registration (<a class='info' href='#deregistration'>Section&nbsp;8.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number De-Registration</span><span>)</span></a>), and has
        exactly the same effect on the registry.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, it will be clear that a specific port number is no
        longer in use and that IANA can revoke it and mark it as Reserved. At
        other times, it may be unclear whether a given assigned port number is
        still in use somewhere in the Internet. In those cases, IANA must
        carefully consider the consequences of revoking the port number, and
        SHOULD only do so if there is an overwhelming need.
</p>
<p>With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL
        formulate a request to the IESG to issue a four-week community call
        concerning the pending port number revocation. The IESG and IANA, with
        the Expert Reviewer's support, SHALL determine promptly after the end
        of the community call whether revocation should proceed and then
        communicate their decision to the community. This procedure typically
        involves similar steps to de-registration except that it is initiated
        by IANA.
</p>
<p>Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
        space compared to the port number space, revoking service names is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.

Service Name and Port Number Transfers</h3>

<p>The value of service names and port numbers is defined by their
        careful management as a shared Internet resource, whereas enabling
        transfer allows the potential for associated monetary exchanges. As a
        result, the IETF does not permit service name or port number
        assignments to be transferred between parties, even when they are
        mutually consenting.
</p>
<p>The appropriate alternate procedure is a coordinated
        de-registration and registration: The new party requests the service
        name or port number via a registration and the previous party releases
        its assignment via the de-registration procedure outlined above.
</p>
<p>With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL
        carefully determine if there is a valid technical, operational or
        managerial reason to grant the requested new assignment.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The IANA guidelines described in this document do not change the
      security properties of UDP, TCP, SCTP, or DCCP.
</p>
<p>Assignment
      of a service name or port number does not in any way imply an
      endorsement of an application or product, and the fact that network
      traffic is flowing to or from an assigned port number does not mean that
      it is "good" traffic, or even that it is used by the assigned service.
      Firewall and system administrators should choose how to configure their
      systems based on their knowledge of the traffic in question, not based
      on whether or not there is an assigned service name or port number.
</p>
<p>Services are expected to include support for security, either as
      default or dynamically negotiated in-band. The use of separate service
      name or port number assignments for secure and insecure variants of the
      same service is to be avoided in order to discourage the deployment of
      insecure services.

IANA Considerations</h3>

</p>
<p>Upon approval of this document, IANA is requested to contact Stuart
      Cheshire, maintainer of the independent service name registry <a class='info' href='#SRVREG'>[SRVREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;DNS SRV Service Types Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, in order to merge the contents of that private
      registry into the official IANA registry. It is expected that the
      independent registry web page will be updated with pointers to the IANA
      registry and to this RFC.
</p>
<p>IANA is instructed to create a new service name entry in the service
      name and port number registry <a class='info' href='#PORTREG'>[PORTREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number           Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> for any

      assigned.
</p>
<p>IANA is also instructed to indicate in the Assignment Notes for "www"
      and "www-http" that they are duplicate terms that refer to the "http" service,
      and should not be used for
      discovery purposes. For this conceptual service (human-readable web
      pages served over HTTP) the correct service name to use for
      service discovery purposes is "http" (see <a class='info' href='#srvname'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Names</span><span>)</span></a>).

Service Name Consistency</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#registration'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number Registration</span><span>)</span></a> defines which character strings
        are well-formed service names, which until now had not been clearly
        defined. The definition in <a class='info' href='#registration'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number Registration</span><span>)</span></a> was
        chosen to allow maximum compatibility of service names with current
        and future service discovery mechanisms.
</p>
<p>As of August 5, 2009 approximately 98% of the so-called "Short
        Names" from existing port number registrations <a class='info' href='#PORTREG'>[PORTREG]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), &ldquo;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number           Registry,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> meet the rules for legal service names stated
        in <a class='info' href='#registration'>Section&nbsp;8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Service Name and Port Number Registration</span><span>)</span></a>, and hence for these services
        their service name will be exactly the same as their "Short Name".
</p>
<p>The remaining approximately 2% of the exiting "Short Names" are not
        suitable to be used directly as well-formed service names because they
        contain illegal characters such as asterisks, dots, pluses, slashes,
        or underscores. All existing "Short Names" conform to the length
        requirement of 15 characters or fewer. For these unsuitable "Short
        Names", listed in the table below, the service name will be the Short
        Name with any illegal characters replaced by hyphens. IANA SHALL add
        an entry to the registry giving the new well-formed primary service
        name for the existing service, that otherwise duplicates the original
        assignment information. In the description field of this new entry
        giving the primary service name, IANA SHALL record that it assigns a
        well-formed service name for the previous service and reference the
        original assignment. In the Assignment Notes field of the original
        assignment, IANA SHALL add a note that this entry is an alias to the
        new well-formed service name, and that the old service name is
        historic, not usable for use with many common service discovery
        mechanisms.

DCCP Service Code Registry</h3>

<p>Service Codes are allocated first-come-first-served according to
          Section 19.8 of the DCCP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. This document updates that section by
          extending the guidelines given there in the following ways:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>IANA MAY assign new Service Codes without seeking Expert
              Review using their discretion, but SHOULD seek expert review if
              a request seeks more than five Service Codes.
</li>
<li>IANA should feel free to contact the DCCP Expert Reviewer
              with questions on any registry, regardless of the registry
              policy, for clarification or if there is a problem with a
              request <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.10.3.2"></a><h3>10.3.2.&nbsp;
DCCP Port Numbers Registry</h3>

<p>The DCCP ports registry is defined by Section 19.9 of the DCCP
          specification <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Allocations in this
          registry require prior allocation of a Service Code. Not all Service
          Codes require IANA-assigned ports. This document updates that
          section by extending the guidelines given there in the following
          way:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>IANA should normally assign a value in the range 1024-49151
              to a DCCP server port. IANA allocation requests to allocate port
              numbers in the System Ports range (0 through 1023), require an
              "IETF Review" <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> prior to allocation
              by IANA <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>IANA MUST NOT allocate more than one DCCP server port to a
              single service code value.
</li>
<li>The allocation of multiple service codes to the same DCCP
              port is allowed, but subject to expert review.
</li>
<li>The set of Service Code values associated with a DCCP server
              port should be recorded in the service name and port number
              registry.
</li>
<li>A request for additional Service Codes to be associated with
              an already allocated Port Number requires Expert Review. These
              requests will normally be accepted when they originate from the
              contact associated with the port registration. In other cases,
              these applications will be expected to use an unallocated port,
              when this is available.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The DCCP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC4340'>[RFC4340]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kohler, E., Handley, M., and S. Floyd, &ldquo;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> notes that
          a short port name MUST be associated with each DCCP server port that
          has been assigned. This document clarifies that this short port name
          is the Service Name as defined here, and this name MUST be
          unique.
