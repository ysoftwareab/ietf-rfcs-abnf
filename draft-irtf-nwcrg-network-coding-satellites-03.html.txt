1.  Introduction

   Guaranteeing both physical layer robustness and efficient usage of
   the radio resource has been in the core design of SATellite
   COMmunication (SATCOM) systems.  The trade-off often resided in how
   much redundancy a system adds to cope from link impairments, without
   reducing the good-put when the channel quality is high.  There is
   usually enough redundancy to guarantee a Quasi-Error Free
   transmission.  However, physical layer reliability mechanisms may not
   recover transmission losses (e.g. with a mobile user) and layer 2 (or
   above) re-transmissions induce 500 ms one-way delay with a
   geostationary satellite.  Further exploiting coding schemes at higher
   OSI-layers is an opportunity for releasing constraints on the
   physical layer in such cases and improving the performance of SATCOM
   systems.

   We have noticed an active research activity on coding and SATCOM in
   the past.  That being said, not much has actually made it to
   industrial developments.  In this context, this document aims at
   identifying opportunities for further usage of coding in these
   systems.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  A note on satellite topology

   This section focuses on a generic description of the components
   composing a generic satellite system and their interaction.  A high
   level description of a multi-gateway satellites network is provided.
   There are multiple SATCOM systems, such as those dedicated to
   broadcasting TV or to IoT applications: depending on the purpose of
   the SATCOM system, ground segments are specific.  This memo lays on
   SATCOM systems dedicated to broadband Internet access that follows
   the DVB-S2/RCS2 standards.  In this context, the increase of the
   available capacity that is carried out to end users and reliability
   requirements lead to multiple gateways for one unique satellite
   platform.

   In this context, Figure 1 shows an example of a multi-gateway
   satellite system.  In a multi-gateway system, some elements may be
   centralized and/or gathered: the relevance of one approach compared
   to another depends on the deployment scenario.  More information on
   these discussions and a generic SATCOM ground segment architecture
   for a bi-directional Internet access can be found in [SAT2017].

   Some functional blocks aggregate the traffic of multiple users.
   Coding schemes could be applied on both single and aggregated
   traffic.

3.  Actual deployment of reliability schemes in satellite systems

   Figure 2 presents the status of the reliability schemes deployment in
   satellite systems.  The information is based on the taxonomy document
   [RFC8406] and the notations are the following: End-to-End Coding
   (E2E), Network Coding (NC), Intra-Flow Coding (IntraF), Inter-Flow
   Coding (InterF), Single-Path Coding (SP) and Multi-Path Coding (MP).

   X1 embodies the source coding that could be used at application level
   for instance within QUIC or other video streaming applications.  This
   is not specific to SATCOM systems since such deployment can be
   relevant for broadband Internet access discussions.

   X2 embodies the physical layer, applied to the PLFRAME, to optimize
   the satellite capacity usage.  At the physical layer, FEC mechanisms
   can be exploited.  This aspect is not in the scope of the WG
   according to the taxonomoy document [RFC8406].

   Reliability is an inherent part of the physical layer and usually
   achieved by using coding techniques.  Based on public information,
   coding does not seem to be widely used at higher layers.

4.  Details on the use cases

   This section details use-cases where coding schemes could improve the
   overall performance of a SATCOM system (e.g. considering a more
   efficient usage of the satellite resource, delivery delay, delivery
   ratio).

   It is worth noting that these use-cases mostly focus on the
   middleware and packetization UDP/IP of Figure 2.  There are already

   lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical layer in currently
   deployed systems while E2E source coding are done at the application
   level.  In a multi-gateway SATCOM Internet access, the deployment
   opportunities are more relevant in specific SATCOM components such as
   the "network function" block or the "access gateway" of Figure 1.

4.1.  Two-way relay channel mode

   This use-case considers a two-way communication between end users,
   through a satellite link.  Figure 3 proposes an illustration of this
   scenario.

   Satellite terminal A (resp.  B) transmits a flow A (resp.  B) to a NC
   server, which forwards a combination of both terminal flows.  This
   results in non-negligible capacity savings and has been demonstrated
   [ASMS2010].  Moreover, with On-Board Processing satellite payloads,
   the coding operations could be done at the satellite level, thus
   reducing the end-to-end delay of the communication.

4.2.  Reliable multicast

   Using multicast servers is a way to better exploit the satellite
   broadcast capabilities.  This approach is proposed in the SHINE ESA
   project [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization] [SHINE].
   This use-case considers adding redundancy to a multicast flow
   depending on what has been received by different end-users, resulting
   in non-negligible scarce resource saving.  We propose an illustration
   for this scenario in Figure 4.

   A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and
   B.  However packet Ni (resp.  Nj) get lost at terminal A (resp.  B),
   and terminal A (resp.  B) returns a negative acknowledgement Li
   (resp.  Lj), indicating that the packet is missing.  Then either the
   access gateway or the multicast server includes a repair packet
   (rather than the individual Ni and Nj packets) in the multicast flow
   to let both terminals recover from losses.  This could be achieved by
   using NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) [RFC5740] in situations
   where a feedback link is available, or FLUTE/ALC [RFC6726] otherwise.
   Note that both NORM and FLUTE/ALC are limited to block coding, none
   of them supporting sliding window encoding schemes [RFC8406].

4.3.  Hybrid access

   This use-case considers the use of multiple path management with
   coding at the transport level to increase the reliability and/or the
   total capacity (using multiple path does not guarantee an improvement
   of both the reliability and the total capacity).  We propose an
   illustration for this scenario in Figure 5.  This use-case is
   inspired from the Broadband Access via Integrated Terrestrial
   Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has been published as an ETSI
   Technical Report [ETSITR2017].  This kind of architecture is also
   discussed in the TCPM working group [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   To cope with packet loss (due to either end-user mobility or physical
   layer impairments), coding could be introduced in both the CPE and at
   the concentrator.

4.4.  Dealing with varying capacity

   This use-case considers the usage of coding to cope with cases where
   channel condition can change in less than a second and where the
   physical layer codes could not guarantee a QEF transmission.

   The architecture is recalled in Figure 6.  In these cases, Adaptative
   Coding and Modulation (ACM) may not adapt the modulation and coding
   accordingly and remaining errors could be recovered with higher
   layers redundancy packets.  The coding schemes could be applied at
   the access gateway or the network function block levels to increase
   the reliability of the transmission.  Coding may be applied on IP
   packets or on layer-2 proprietary format packets.

   This use-case is mostly relevant for when mobile users are considered
   or when the chosen band induce a required physical layer coding that
   may change over time (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.).  Depending on the
   use-case (e.g. very high frequency bands, mobile users) or depending
   on the deployment use-cases (e.g. performance of the network between
   each individual block), the relevance of adding coding is different.

4.5.  Improving the gateway handovers

   This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost
   during gateway handovers.  Whether this is for off-loading one given
   equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each
   gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant.  However,
   if gateways are not properly synchronized, this may result in packet
   loss.  During these critical phases, coding can be added to improve
   the reliability of the transmission and allow a seamless gateway
   handover.  Coding could be applied at either the access gateway or
   the network function block.  The control plane manager is in charge
   of taking the decision to change the communication gateway and the
   consequent routes.

   Figure 7 illustrates this use-case.  Depending on the ground
   architecture [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang] [SAT2017],
   some equipment might be communalised.

5.  Research challenges

5.1.  Towards an increased deployability in SATCOM systems

   SATCOM systems typically feature Performance Enhancement Proxy (PEP)
   RFC 3135 [RFC3135].  PEP usually split TCP end-to-end connections and
   forward TCP packets to the satellite baseband gateway that deals with
   layer 2 and layer 1 encapsulations.  PEP could host coding mechanisms

   and thus support the use-cases that have been discussed in this
   document.

   Deploying coding schemes at the TCP level in these equipments could
   be relevant and independent from the specificities of a SATCOM link.
   However, there is a research issue in the recurrent trade-off in
   SATCOM systems: how much reliability packets can be introduced to
   guarantee a better end-user QoE while optimizing capacity usage ?

5.2.  Interaction with virtualization

   Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, coding
   schemes could be easily deployed as Virtual Network Function (VNF).
   Next generation of SATCOM ground segments could rely on a virtualized
   environment.  This trend can also be seen in cellular networks,
   making these discussions extendable to other deployment scenarios
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang].  As one example, the
   coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized environment is
   presented in [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization].

   A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service
   function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other
   SATCOM specific functions, to guarantee an efficient radio usage and
   easy-to-deploy SATCOM services.

5.3.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks

   In the context of the deep-space communications, establishing
   communications from terrestrial gateways to satellite platforms can
   be a challenge.  Reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such
   links must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions.
   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking [RFC4838] is a solution to
   enable reliable internetworking space communications where both
   standard ad-hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used.
   Moreover, DTN can also be seen as an alternative solution to transfer
   the data between a central PEP and a remote PEP.

   Coding enables E2E reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-
   encoding, as proposed in [THAI15].  In this case, the use-cases
   proposed in Section 4.4 would legitimate the usage of coding within
   the DTN stack to improve the channel utilization and the E2E
   transmission delay.  In this context, the use of erasure coding
   inside a Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)
   architecture has been specified in [CCSDS-131.5-O-1].  A research
   challenge would be on how such coding can be integrated in the IETF
   DTN stack.

6.  Conclusion

   This document presents the current deployment of coding in some
   satellite telecommunications systems along with a discussion on the
   multiple opportunities to introduce these techniques at a wider
   scale.

   Even if this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
   pointing out that the some scenarios proposed may be relevant to
   other wireless telecommunication systems.  As one example, the
   generic architecture proposed in Figure 1 may be mapped to cellular
   networks as follows: the 'network function' block gather some of the
   functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access
   gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of
   functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network.
   This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this draft since
   they may be also relevant for cellular networks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are inherent to any access network.  SATCOM
   systems introduce standard security mechanisms.  In particular, there
   are some specificities related to the fact that all users under the
   coverage can record all the packets that are being transmitted, such
   as in LTE networks.  On the specific scenario of NC in SATCOM
   systems, there are no specific security considerations.
