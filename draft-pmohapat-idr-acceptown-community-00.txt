Abstract

   It may be useful for a BGP speaker in an autonomous system to receive
   and accept its own advertised route from a route reflector with more
   fine-grained route control. For example, the route reflector can
   change certain attributes of a route as desired, and then re-

   advertise it back to the originator. Though it is possible to perform
   such policy control directly at the originator, it may be
   operationally cumbersome in a network with a large number of border
   routers having complex BGP policies.

   This draft defines a new and well-known BGP community value,
   ACCEPT_OWN, that signals a BGP speaker to accept an UPDATE message
   and process the associated routes even when the ORIGINATOR_ID or the
   NEXT_HOP matches that of the receiving speaker.

   It may be useful for a BGP speaker in an autonomous system to receive
   and accept its own advertised route from a route reflector with more
   fine-grained route control. For example, the route reflector can
   change certain attributes of a route as desired, and then re-

   routers having complex BGP policies.

   As per the BGP protocol [RFC4271], a BGP speaker rejects prefix
   advertisements received that were originated by itself. In an
   autonomous system with route reflectors, the route reflector attaches
   the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute to the UPDATE messages so that if such
   prefix advertisements reach the originator, the originator can reject
   them by simply checking the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute. The BGP
   specification also mandates that a route should not be advertised to
   a peer nor accepted from a peer when the NEXT_HOP attribute matches
   the receiver's own "IP address". These integrity checks help to
   detect and prevent routing information loops.

   The draft proposes a modification to this behavior by defining a new
   well-known community [RFC1997] value. If this community value,
   ACCEPT_OWN, is attached to an UPDATE message, the originator will
   accept the UPDATE message and process the associated routes even when
   the ORIGINATOR_ID and/or the NEXT_HOP match those of the receiving
   speaker, thus enabling more fine-grained route control via a route
   reflector.


3. ACCEPT_OWN Community

   This memo defines the use of a new well-known BGP non-transitive
   community, ACCEPT_OWN, with value 0xFFFFFF05. The ACCEPT_OWN
   community has global significance. However, it SHOULD NOT be
   advertised between external BGP peers. The ACCEPT_OWN community
   SHOULD only be advertised between internal BGP peers.

   Use of this well-known community value signals readvertisement of a
   route prefix to the originator, and that the originator SHOULD accept
   and process the associated route prefixes irrespective of the
   ORIGINATOR_ID and NEXT_HOP value. The ACCEPT_OWN community
   effectively disables the ORIGINATOR_ID and NEXT_HOP integrity checks,
   however, only for those route prefixes having the ACCEPT_OWN
   community value.


4. Security Considerations

   The ORIGINATOR_ID and NEXT_HOP integrity checks outlined above help
   to detect and avoid routing information loops. It is possible with
   the use of the ACCEPT_OWN community value to introduce a routing loop
   within an autonomous system. However, BGP is already vulnerable to
   denial of service attacks including but not limited to routing loops
   based upon the injection of false routing information. The usage of
   the ACCEPT_OWN community SHOULD, therefore, be limited to internal

   (trusted) peers.


5. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new well-known community, called ACCEPT_OWN.
   It is to be assigned value 0xFFFFFF05.


6. Appendix A - Extranet application (non-normative)

   One of the applications for this behavior is auto-configuration of
   extranets within MPLS VPN networks. Consider the following topology:


   CE1 --------+
               |
              (VRF 1, RD 1, RT 1)
                       PE1 ................... RR
              (VRF 2, RD 2, RT 2)
               |
   CE2 --------+


   Within the above topology, PE1 receives a prefix X from CE1. Prefix X
   is installed in VRF 1 and is advertised to the route reflector with
   route distinguisher (RD) 1 and route target (RT) 1 as configured on
   PE1. The requirement is to import prefix X into VRF 2 and advertise
   it to CE2 in support of extranet VPN connectivity between CE1/VRF1
   and CE2/VRF2. Current BGP mechanisms for MPLS VPNs [RFC4364] require
   changing the import RT value and/or import policy for VRF 2 on PE1.
   This is operationally cumbersome in a network with a large number of
   border routers having complex BGP policies.

   Alternatively, using the new ACCEPT_OWN community value, the route
   reflector can simply re-advertise prefix X back to PE1 with RT 2
   appended. In this way, PE1 will accept prefix X despite its
   ORIGINATOR_ID value, import it into VRF 2, and will determine the
   correct adjacency rewrite within VRF 1 based on the RD value (1) and
   the prefix. The same operation needs also to happen in the reverse
   direction (VRF 1 learning a route from VRF 2) to achieve
   establishment of an extranet VPN strictly via the route reflector
   without changing the BGP policy of PE1 in anyway.

   A router performing such an extranet application can accept a route
   with its own ORIGINATOR_ID value only if the "context" in which the
   router originated the route is different than the "context" in which
   the router accepts the re-advertised route (VRF is an example of a
