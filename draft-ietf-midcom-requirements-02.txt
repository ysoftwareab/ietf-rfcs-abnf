Abstract

   Networks connecting to and forming part of the Internet are
   increasingly deploying specialised network functions to address
   security, quality of service and other administrative policy
   requirements. These devices are a subset of what can be referred to
   as 'Middleboxes'.

   While certain applications may operate unaffected in this
   environment, other types of application - or certain operational
   scenarios of a given application - may either fail to work
   completely or malfunction in some way. These classes of session-
   oriented application are typified by the use of separated data
   transfer and control sessions. Existing solutions to these problems
   deploy application specific intelligence within individual
   Middleboxes. However this leads to many difficulties including poor
   scalability of the solution and problems in reusing generic
   Middlebox functionality. In addition, trusted third parties are also
   increasingly being asked to make such policy decisions on behalf of
   the various entities participating in an application's operation. A
   need has therefore emerged for session-orientated applications to be
   able to express their communications needs to the devices in the

   network that provide enforcement of transport policy. This document
   therefore focuses on the requirements for the protocol between the
   requesting device and the Middlebox and any associated policy
   entity. It is desirable that existing IETF protocols be used to
   implement these requirements where practical to do so.

1.      Introduction

   A need has emerged for session-orientated applications to be able to
   express and communicate their needs for communications to devices in
   the network that provide, or represent, enforcement of transport
   policy. Examples of these devices include:

        - firewalls,
        - network address translators,
        - intrusion detection systems (e.g. signature management)

   These devices are a subset of what can be referred to as
   'Middleboxes'. To enable the end-to-end operation of session-
   orientated applications in this environment, trusted third parties
   have become required to make policy decisions on behalf of the
   various entities participating in an application's operation. This
   document focuses on the requirements for the protocol between the
   requesting device and the Middlebox and any associated policy
   entity. It is desirable that existing IETF protocols be used to
   implement these requirements where practical to do so.

1.1.    Background

   For a variety of reasons, Middlebox devices effectively delineate
   domains of administrative policy. Such policies may include
   translation of IP addresses (e.g. NAT) or admission control (e.g.
   firewalling). Examples of this are where a firewall may be used to
   delineate the security policy of an end user's LAN from a service
   provider's wide area network link to the Internet.

   While certain applications may operate unaffected in this
   environment, other types of application - or certain scenarios of a
   specific application - may either fail to work completely or
   malfunction in some way. Some of these examples are illustrated in
   [MIDBOXFRAME].      

   Session orientated applications represent an example of one class of
   application that encounters deployment difficulties in networks
   involving Middleboxes. This is because there are implicit
   relationships between individual packets that must be maintained
   between hosts across the network. One solution that has emerged to
   this problem has been to develop proprietary extensions (known as an
   Application Level Gateway) for a given Middlebox that enable it to
   handle a specific application. Unfortunately while this works for a
   small set of simple applications, it does not scale well. Neither
   can this approach easily handle increasingly complex scenarios such

Swale et al              Expires November 2001                       3
                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001

   as those associated with multimedia applications. This is because
   these typically involve a multiplicity of media and control streams
   that originate from a single host but may have individual packet
   streams terminating on a diverse set of hosts.

   Trusted third parties are therefore increasingly being asked to make
   policy decisions on behalf of the various entities participating in
   an application's operation. Consequently a need has developed for
   applications to be able to express their needs to the devices in the
   network providing transport policy enforcement.

   Decomposing applications requiring policy decisions by removing
   application logic from the Middlebox and instead providing a
   generalized communications interface (by use of the "MIDCOM
   Protocol") provides a number of benefits, including:-

        - improved performance,
        - lower hardware and software development costs
        - lower maintenance costs,
        - improved ability to support traversal of packet filters by
          complex protocols,
        - easier deployment of new applications, and
        - the ability to consolidate management functions.

   For example, by moving stateful inspection of protocols such as
   H.323 and SIP out of firewalls, it is possible to improve
   performance and scalability while reducing development time and
   costs.

1.2.    Scope

   This document presents a discussion of requirements for the MIDCOM
   Protocol.

   The network environment envisaged for MIDCOM includes one or more
   Middleboxes in the data path between communicating clients, servers
   or peers as described in [MIDBOXFRAME].

   This document will only deal with needs arising from the use of
   firewalls and network address translation although the solution must
   enable extension to encompass other types of device in the future.

   This document may form the basis of subsequent protocol development
   or the development of profiles of existing protocols.

   The discovery of Middleboxes in the path of an application instance
   and communications between Middleboxes is outside the scope of the
   MIDCOM Protocol and consequently this document.

2.      Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

   The terminology describing Middleboxes used in this document is
   introduced in [MIDBOXFRAME].

                   behaviour of the Middlebox.

4.      Specific functions assumed

   The MIDCOM environment [MIDBOXFRAME] involves three main entities;
   the Middlebox, the MIDCOM Agent and the Policy Server as shown in
   figure 1. The following functionality is assumed within these
   components from the view point of the MIDCOM Protocol.

                      +-----------+     +---------------+
                      |  MIDCOM   |     |    Policy     |

               Figure 1. The MIDCOM Protocol and Environment

4.1.    Middlebox functions

   As described in [MIDBOXFRAME], a Middlebox may provide a number of
   processing functions for IP packets traversing it. Essentially, a
   Middlebox forwards packets from one of its physical interfaces to
   another. In doing so it may manipulate the headers of IP packets as
   requested by a MIDCOM Agent. However the Middlebox must not alter
   packet information unless it appears in the packet header. This is
   to ensure that there is an appropriate separation of concerns
   between the MIDCOM Agent and the Middlebox.

   It is assumed that the functions provided by a Middlebox are
   externalised from a control point of view to a MIDCOM Agent through
   the use of protocol(s) meeting the requirements of the MIDCOM
   Protocol.


Swale et al              Expires November 2001                       5
                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001


   A Middlebox may establish whether the association with a specific
   MIDCOM Agent should be allowed via a Policy Server. The Middlebox
   may also communicate with a Policy Server to determine whether the
   actions requested by a specific MICOM Agent are permissible.

4.2.    MIDCOM Agent functions

   A MIDCOM Agent, as described in [MIDBOXFRAME], embodies application
   specific intelligence external to a Middlebox. In conjunction with
   an associated Middlebox, a MIDCOM Agent enables specified end-to-end
   flows between application clients and/or servers in accordance with
   the needs of the application in question.

   Control information is passed between a MIDCOM Agent and associated
   Middlebox by the protocol(s) meeting the requirements of the MIDCOM
   Protocol.

4.3.    Policy Server functions

   The MIDCOM environment allows for a Policy Server function to
   externalise policy decisions from a Middlebox. A Policy Server is a
   management entity interfacing with Middlebox functions to establish
   policies concerning authorization of MIDCOM Agents requesting access
   to the Middlebox and its resources. Its purpose may determine the
   flows supported across one or more Middleboxes.

   A MIDCOM Agent may have a pre-configured relationship with a given
   Middlebox as a trusted entity or the trust relationship may be
   established dynamically. In the case where a MIDCOM Agent is not
   pre-configured, the Middlebox will need to consult a Policy Server
   to validate requests from the agent.

   A policy server may add or remove the registration of individual
   MIDCOM Agents registered onto a Middlebox.

   The protocol facilitating the communication between a Middlebox and
   a Policy Server need not be part of the MIDCOM Protocol.

4.4.    Distribution of MIDCOM elements

   To enable the solution to scale, it must be possible for the
   functional components within the MIDCOM framework to be distributed.

   The Middlebox therefore needs to support multiple simultaneous
   MIDCOM Agents. Each Agent may be acting on behalf of one or more
   applications. There is no implicit relationship between individual
   MIDCOM Agents and a specific Middlebox should not therefore assume
   any relationship between any given set of MIDCOM Agents.

5.      Functional Requirements

   The MIDCOM Protocol needs to enable a MIDCOM Agent requiring the
   services of a Middlebox to establish an association between itself
   and the Middlebox for the purposes of requesting Pin-Hole services
   from the Middlebox and obtaining statistics and other reporting
   information.

   The syntax and semantics of the MIDCOM Protocol shall be independent
   of the application(s)requesting Middlebox services.

5.1.    Pin-Hole specification

   To enable a Middlebox to reliably establish a Pin-Hole at the
   request of a MIDCOM Agent, the MIDCOM Protocol must allow the MIDCOM
   Agent to express the nature of the Pin-Hole required to the
   Middlebox. The MIDCOM Protocol must therefore allow the MIDCOM Agent
   to describe the desired behaviour of the Middlebox for the purposes
   of requested flow(s). Two aspects of a flow have been identified as
   being necessary to specify the characteristics required; the
   addressing association required and the packet flow characteristics.

5.1.1.  Connectivity specification

   The MIDCOM Protocol must allow a MIDCOM Agent to specify a Pin-Hole
   in terms of the address and port mappings required.

   The protocol shall permit the expression of direction to be
   associated with a Pin-Hole. The direction shall be specified in
   terms that apply to external view of the Middlebox. This
   directionality shall be expressed as "in", "out" or "Loopback"
   (meaning both "in" and "out" of the same side of the same Middlebox
   realm).

5.1.2.  Flow profile specification

   To enable real-time streamed media to be supported, the MIDCOM
   Protocol must allow a MIDCOM Agent to specify a Pin-Hole in terms of
   the packet size and flow rate which is required.

   The requests communicated between a MIDCOM Agent and a Middlebox
   need to permit Pin-Holes to be specified in terms of packet size
   (maximum and minimum length, inter-packet arrival time and other
   parameters including:

           For IPv4:   source and destination IP address or group of
                        them determined by a netmask, protocol number,
                        DSCP field

           For IPv6:   source and destination IP address or group of
                        them determined by a netmask, next header
                        fields (Note: multiple fields may need to be

                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001

                        traversed until a match is found) and traffic
                        class field

            UDP:       source and destination port numbers or group of
                        them

            TCP:       source and destination port numbers or group of
                        them, "SYN packets" permission

            ICMP:      type and code

            IGMP:      type

   It shall be possible to indicate whether packets should be carried
   or discarded when a given flow specification is exceeded.

5.2.    Pin-Hole identification

   The MIDCOM Protocol must enable a given MIDCOM Agent and Middlebox
   to identify and reference in a common manner any Pin-Holes for which
   they share a relationship.

   The MIDCOM Protocol must enable a Middlebox to be able to relate
   flows across it to requests for Pin-Holes from specific MIDCOM
   Agents.

   The MIDCOM Protocol should support the concept of an aggregated
   Pinhole-Descriptor comprising a multiple of individual flows
   allowing them to be treated as an aggregate.

5.3.    Pin-Hole operations

5.3.1.  Open Pin-Hole

  An operation is needed to enable a MIDCOM Agent to request a flow,
  with a given flow specification and address translation, across a
  given Middlebox. A MIDCOM Agent that requests a flow to be
  established maintains ownership of the request for the duration of
  the flow, or until such time as the MIDCOM Agent relinquishes or
  delegates ownership.

5.3.2.  Transfer Pin-Hole

  The MIDCOM Protocol must allow the ownership of a requested flow to
  be transferred from one MIDCOM Agent to another. In doing so the
  Middlebox may need to act as a mediation point for affecting the
  transfer of ownership. This is necessary for a variety of reasons
  including scalability of the solution.

5.3.3.  Close Pin-Hole

   An operation is needed to enable a MIDCOM Agent to request a flow be
   closed that it has either established or assumed a position of
   ownership over.

Swale et al              Expires November 2001                       8
                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001


   Resources, such as a Pin-Hole Identifier, may be shared across
   MIDCOM Agents and a Middlebox. As Pin-Holes may be shared across
   Middlebox functions, a Pinhole-Descriptor may be created by one
   function, and terminated by a different one.

   A Pin-Hole may be closed such that ICMP reporting for subsequently
   discarded packets is either enabled or disabled.

5.3.4.  Pin-Hole Report

   An operation is needed to enable a MIDCOM Agent to request a status
   report concerning a flow that it has either established or assumed a
   position of ownership over.

   The Middlebox may need to report information concerning the status
   and behaviour of a flow through an established Pin-Hole to the
   associated MIDCOM Agent that owns it.

5.3.5.  Pin-Hole Refresh

   An operation is needed to enable a MIDCOM Agent to request that a
   Middlebox maintain an established Pin-Hole over which the Agent has
   ownership.

5.3.6.  Error handling

   Where the communication relationship between a Middlebox and a
   MIDCOM Agent becomes invalid, all existing Pin-Holes owned by the
   MIDCOM Agent concerned must be closed.

   The MIDCOM Protocol must allow the MIDCOM Agent access to sufficient
   information as to enable it to notify the application when a Pin-
   Hole has become invalid.

5.4.    Asynchronous behaviour

   Since Middleboxes and MIDCOM Agent(s) are likely to operate
   asynchronously, the protocol needs to permit the synchronisation of
   state machines between peer entities by adding state information to
   messages in normal operations or by the use of explicit query
   messages.

   Either the agent or the Middlebox can choose to initiate a
   connection prior to any data traffic. Alternately, either party
   (Middlebox or the MIDCOM Agent) may choose to initiate a connection
   only upon noticing application specific traffic.

6.      Non-functional requirements

6.1.    Extensibility




Swale et al              Expires November 2001                       9
                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001

   The MIDCOM Protocol must be extensible to allow for both version
   upgrades to the protocol itself and the expansion of functionality
   available to MIDCOM Agents from Middleboxes.

   The syntax and semantics of the MIDCOM Protocol need to be
   extensible to allow the requirements of future applications to be
   adopted.

   The MIDCOM Protocol needs to contain version inter-working
   capabilities to enable subsequent extensions to support different
   types of Middlebox and future requirements of applications not
   considered at this stage.

   If a peer does not understand an option it must be clear whether the
   action required is to proceed without the unknown attribute being
   taken into account or the request is to be rejected. Where
   attributes may be ignored if not understood, a means may be provided
   to inform the client about what has been ignored.

   This may be provided as a version and capability exchange mechanism.

6.2.    Reliability

   Where a multiplicity of MIDCOM Agents are interacting with a given
   Middlebox, the MIDCOM Protocol must provide mechanisms ensuring that
   the overall behaviour is deterministic.

   The MIDCOM Protocol must enable the Middlebox and any associated
   MIDCOM Agents to establish known and stable state. This must include
   the case of power failure, or other failure, where the protocol must
   ensure that any resources used by a failed element can be released.

   The protocol needs to provide per message acknowledgements, in order
   to achieve reliable communication.

6.3.    Resilience

   The MIDCOM Protocol must be able to operate in an extended network
   environment between the MIDCOM Agent and the Middlebox that may be
   susceptible to the loss of packets.

6.4.    Scalability

   The MIDCOM Protocol must scale to cope with the requirements of
   various sizes and types of Middlebox. From a physical point of view,
   these may range from single and dual port devices through to large-
   scale multi-port devices.

   The MIDCOM Protocol may allow a multiplicity of MIDCOM Agents to
   concurrently interact with a given Middlebox.

                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001

   The MIDCOM Protocol must not inhibit the deployment of real-time
   communication applications in a Middlebox environment. It therefore
   must exhibit low latency characteristics commensurate with the
   control of such applications.

   The MIDCOM Protocol should allow the aggregation of commands,
   requests and responses.

   The protocol needs to support time-constrained operation to enable
   scalability of the complete solution. This may include, amongst
   other things, the use of short messages and minimal messages per
   operation.

   The protocol must not assume 0 (zero) delay in communication paths
   to enable realistic deployment scenarios. The protocol must
   therefore be capable of being used over low speed links.

6.6.    Management

6.6.1.  Status reporting

   The MIDCOM Agent may report its status to a Middlebox with which it
   is associated.

   A Middlebox may report its status to a MIDCOM Agent with which it is
   associated.

6.6.2.  Unsolicited messages

   The protocol needs to support unsolicited messages, for event
   reporting and propagation of alarms.

6.6.3.  Protocol Failure

   To enable management systems to interact with the MIDCOM
   environment, the protocol needs to include failure reasons that
   allow the MIDCOM Agent behaviour to be modified as a result of the
   information contained in the reason. Failure reasons need to be
   chosen such that they do not make an attack on security easier.

6.7.    Security

6.7.1.  Registration and Authorisation

   The relationship between a MIDCOM Agent and a given Middlebox may be
   pre-configured through a manual configuration process or may be
   established dynamically through a registration process. In either
   case, depending upon the policy applied to the Middlebox, the
   Middlebox must appropriately authenticate the identity and
   credentials of the MIDCOM Agent seeking to make use of its services
   prior to servicing any other requests from the MIDCOM Agent.

6.7.1.1.  Deregistration

   The MIDCOM Protocol needs to allow either the MIDCOM Agent or the
   Middlebox to terminate the communications relationship between a
   MIDCOM Agent and a Middlebox. This allows either entity to close the
   session for maintenance, security or other reasons.

   Once the need for the relationship between a MIDCOM Agent and a
   Middlebox established during the registration process has lapsed, a
   deregistration process will be required. This will break the trust
   relationship between the specific Middlebox and MIDCOM Agent. Once
   this has been done, a Middlebox must not service any further
   requests from a given MIDCOM Agent without the MIDCOM Agent first
   re-establish the appropriate trust relationship with the Middlebox.

   MIDCOM session disconnection may be prompted by a successful de-
   registration request or a failure of some sort, such asa
   communications failure between the Middlebox and MIDCOM Agent.

   At the end of a MIDCOM session between a Middlebox and MIDCOM Agent,
   it should be possible for either the Middlebox or the MIDCOM Agent
   to initiate the disconnection of the relationship.

   As part of the de-registration process, any Pin-Holes or other
   Middlebox resources requested by the MIDCOM Agent must be
   immediately released by the Middlebox.

6.7.1.2.  Error handling

   The MIDCOM Protocol must enable the Middlebox and/or MIDCOM Agent to
   determine when a registration session is no longer valid. This is to
   address cases such as when either a Middlebox or MIDCOM Agent re-
   starts.

6.7.2.  MIDCOM Authentication Requirements

   The MIDCOM Protocol must allow communications between Middleboxes
   and MIDCOM Agents to be authenticated.

   Where possible, existing IETF protocols shall be used for
   authenticating MIDCOM entities such as Middleboxes and MIDCOM
   Agents.

6.7.3.  MIDCOM Protocol communications

   To protect MIDCOM messages from being tampered with, individual
   message authentication should be used in addition to host
   authentication. Further message confidentiality may be administered
   by employing appropriate techniques to MIDCOM messages, when a
   higher level of security is required. Simple Source-address based
   security is the least form of security and should be permitted only
   to the most trusted hosts.

6.7.4.  MIDCOM Protocol transport

                         MIDCOM Requirements                July 2001


   Communications between a MIDCOM Agent and a Middlebox constitute a
   flow of requests for services and associated responses. The
   transport of this information may present a security concern and
   should be appropriately protected.

6.7.5.  General Security considerations

   Security mechanisms may be specified as provided in underlying
   transport mechanisms, such as IPSEC.  The protocol, or such
   mechanisms, must:

   a.   Allow for mutual authentication at the start of an MIDCOM
   Agent-Middlebox association

   b.   Allow for preservation of the control messages once the
   association has been established.

   c.   Allow for optional confidentiality protection of control
   messages. (If provided the mechanism should allow a choice in the
   algorithm to be used.)

   d.   Operate across un-trusted domains between the MIDCOM Agent and
   Middlebox in a secure fashion.

   e.   Support non-repudiation for a customer-located Middlebox
   communicating with a network operator's MIDCOM Agent.

   g.   Define mechanisms to mitigate denial of service attacks.

   h.   Define mechanisms to mitigate replay attacks on the control
   messages.

   Note: any associated protocol document will need to include an
   extended discussion of security requirements, offering more
   precision on each threat and giving a complete picture of the
   defence including non-protocol measures such as configuration.

7.      Issues

        - Management: what should we say here? We need to balance
          management functionality with security concerns.
        - Middlebox resource discovery: how should a MIDCOM Agent be
          able to discover the resources available on a Middlebox?
          Related to this is the question of whether the MIDCOM Agent
          can automatically figure out what it has to do to get an
          application to work across a given Middlebox.
        - Do we want to have a Pin-Hole sharing operation which enables
          a MIDCOM Agent with ownership over a given flow to extend
          visibility of the Pin-Hole, for reporting or failure

          protection reasons, to another MIDCOM Agent which is
          authenticated with the same Middlebox?
