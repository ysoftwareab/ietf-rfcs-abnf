1.  Introduction 

   This memo defines an SMIv2 Management Information Base (MIB) for
   a device implementing NAT [RFC3022] function. This may be used 
   for configuration as well as monitoring of a device capable
   of NAT function.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Terminology

   The terminology used throughout this document is mostly as per RFC
   2663 [RFC2663]. Definition for the term "Symmetric NAT" may be found
   in RFC 3489 [RFC3489]. Symmetric NAT is a variation of NAPT in that 
   a address-port bind is not retained across multiple sessions from

   the same private source port. The term "NAT session" is used 
   extensively in the document and may be defined as follows.

   NAT Session - A NAT session is an association between a session 
   as seen in the private realm and a session as seen in the public 
   realm, by virtue of NAT translation. If a session in the private 
   realm were to be represented as (PrivateSrcAddr, PrivateDstAddr,
   TransportProtocol, PrivateSrcPort, PrivateDstPort) and  the
   same session in the public realm were to be represented as
   (PublicSrcAddr, PublicDstAddr, TransportProtocol, PublicSrcPort,
   PublicDstPort), the NAT session will provide the translation
   glue between the two session representations.

   The term NAT has been used, throughout the document, to represent 
   traditional NAT. In cases, where necessary, NAPT and Basic NAT will 
   be used to represent port translation and address translation 
   respectively.

   The terms public and private are used throughout the document in 
   the context of networks, while the terms local and global are used 
   when referring to addresses and ports.

4.  Overview 

   The NAT MIB module for some parts depends on the IF-MIB [RFC2863]. 
   The MIB module is split into three groups as follows.

   o the configuration group,
   o the translation group, and 
   o the statistics group.

   The configuration group consists of two tables and seven scalars:

   o natConfInterfaceTable - the interface specific configuration 
     table, which specifies the NAT config parameters for a specific
     interface.
   o natConfAddrMapTable - the address map table, which is an 
     extension of the per-interface configuration table, and specifies 
     information required to setup static/dynamic address and ports 
     maps.
   o five protocol specific scalars, specifying the bind timeout 
     values for the more common protocols, TCP, UDP and ICMP, and a 
     generic timeout value that can be used for all other protocols.

   The translation group, monitoring the dynamic activities of the NAT
   device, consists of two scalars and three tables:

   o the scalars, natAddrBindNumberOfEntries and
     natAddrPortBindNumberOfEntries, hold the number of entries

INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                   October 2003
     
     
     that currently exist in the Address bind and the Address-Port 
     bind tables respectively.
   o natAddrBindTable - the Address bind table, which holds the 
     currently active address bindings.
   o natAddrPortBindTable - the Address-Port bind table, which 
     holds the currently active transport bindings.
   o natSessionTable - the session table, holds information regarding
     active NAT sessions.

   And finally, the statistics group consists of three tables:

   o natStatsProtocolTable - the Protocol stats table, indicating
     translation statistics per protocol.
   o natStatsAddrMapTable - the Address Map stats table, indicating
     translation statistics per address map.
   o natStatsInterfaceTable - the Interface stats table, indicating 
     translation statistics per interface.

   There is also one notification defined in the MIB:

   o natPacketDiscard notifies the end user/manager of
     packets being discarded due to lack of address mappings.

4.1 Relation between the NAT configuration tables

   The association between the various configuration tables can be
   represented as follows:


     per interface config   (global config parameters)
        |                            |
        |                            |  
        |                            |
        |----------------------------|                       
        |                       
        |                      
     address map     
 
   Every interface NAT config is associated with a set of global 
   (TCP, UDP and ICMP) config parameters, represented by the five
   protocol specific scalars.
   

4.2 Relation between the translation and the configuration tables

   The association between the configuration and the translation
   tables can be represented as follows.

                          Session

   Every bind, address as well as address-port bind, is derived
   from an address map. The ifIndex inconjunction with the 
   natAddrBindMapIndex or natAddrPortBindMapIndex object 
   provide the linkage between the bind and the address map it 
   has been derived from.

   On the other hand, every NAT session is derived from a bind,
   address or address-port bind. The 
   natSessionPrivateSrcEPBindId and the 
   natSessionPrivateDstEPBindId objects represent this linkage.

4.3 Configuration via the MIB

   Entries in the Address Bind and Address-Port Bind Tables are 
   derived from the address map table. Entries must, therefore,
   not exist in the Address Bind or a Address-Port Bind Entry 
   without an associated entry in the Address Map table.

   Likewise, the session entries are derived from the Binds and 
   an entry must not exist in the Session table (except in the case
   of Symmetric NAT) corresponding Bind table entry. 
   Before deleting a bind entry, all the session entries corresponding
   to the bind entry must be deleted.
  
   A Management station may use the following steps to configure 
   entries in the NAT-MIB:
   
   -  Create an address map entry in the natConfAddrMapTable,

INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                   October 2003
   
   
   -  Create an entry in the natConfInterfaceTable specifying the
      the value of ifIndex as the interface index of the interface 
      on which NAT is being configured. 
      Set natConfAddrMapConfigName to the name of the address map 
      entry already created.
      Specify appropriate values, as applicable, for the other 
      objects e.g. natConfInterfaceRealm, natConfServiceType, in the 
      table.

   -  To configure NAT for TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols, the 
      management station can set the protocol specific scalars.

   -  The Address Bind and Address-Port Bind Table will have the 
      entries created due to this NAT configuration. A Management 
      Station may also, if deemed necessary, create Address Bind 
      or a Address-Port Bind entry and link those entries to the 
      appropriate address map configured.

4.4  Relationship to Interface MIB 
     
   The natConfInterfaceTable specifies the NAT configuration attributes
   on each interface. The concept of "interface" is as defined by 
   InterfaceIndex/ifIndex of the IETF Interfaces MIB [IF-MIB].

7. Change History

   A record of changes which will be removed before publication.

   10  September 2001

   o Added the following objects to support notifications:
     natConfAddrRiseThreshold, natConfAddrFallingThreshold,
     natAddrMapName and natPktDiscardReason.

   o Following notifications were added (there are still some 
     unclear parameters though):
     natAddressUseRising and natPacketDiscard.

   10  November 2001

   o Dynamic and Static Address Map tables are Merged.

   o Protocol Extensibility added.

   o Rearrangement of OIDs done to get things in proper sequence.


   07  February 2002

   o Config and Interface Specific tables are Merged.

   o MAX-ACCESS for the bind and session entry objects are 
     changed to be read-create.

   o natConfAddrMapType renamed to natConfAddrMapDirection.

   14 June 2002

   o Changed the syntax of natConfServiceType to BITS and renumbered
     the enumeration to start with 0.
    
   o Addressed the warning raised by smilint - all InetAddress values
     now restricted to the size range (0..20) i.e. valid InetAddress
     types are now ipv4, ipv6, ipv4z and ipv6z.

   o MIN-ACCESS for natConfInterfaceRealm restricted to read-only.

   o Changed the natConfIcmpDefIdleTimeout default value to be 300.

   o natConfProtConfigName made a part of the optional 
     natConfProtGroup.

   o RFC 3291 now referred to instead of RFC 2578

10.  Security Considerations 
   
   It is clear that this MIB can be potentially useful for 
   configuration. Unauthorized access to the write-able objects could
   cause a denial of service, and/or widespread network disturbance. 
   Hence, the  support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond those
   that SNMP Security is itself intended to address. These relate
   primarily to controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result from operator
   error, which is beyond the scope of any security architecture.
  
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in
   that they may represent NAT bind and session information.
   The NAT bind and session objects reveal the identity of private
   hosts that are engaged in a session with external end nodes. A
   curious outsider could monitor these two objects to assess the
   number of private hosts being supported by the NAT device. Further,
   a disgruntled former employee of an enterprise could use the nat
   bind and session information to break into specific private hosts
   by intercepting the existing sessions or originate new
   sessions into the host. There are no objects which are sensitive in 
   their own right, such as passwords or monetary amounts.
   It may be important to even control GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide
   features for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB. 

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms 
   (for authentication and privacy).  
      
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
