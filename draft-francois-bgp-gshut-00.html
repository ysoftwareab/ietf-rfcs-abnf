Introduction</h3>

<p> Routing changes in BGP can be caused by planned, manual,
		maintenance operations. This document discusses operational
		procedures to be applied in order to reduce or eliminate 
		losses of packets during the maintenance. These losses come from the transient lack of
		reachability during the BGP convergence following the shutdown of
		an eBGP peering session between two Autonomous System Border
		Routers (ASBR).
</p>
<p> This document presents procedures for the cases where the
	forwarding plane is impacted by the maintenance, hence when
	the use of Graceful Restart does not apply.
</p>
<p> The procedures described in this document can be applied
	to reduce or avoid packet loss for outbound and inbound traffic flows
	initially forwarded along the peering link to be shut down.
	These procedures allow routers to keep using old paths until
	alternate ones are learned, ensuring that routers always have
	a valid route available during the convergence process.
</p>
<p> The goal of the document is to meet the requirements
	described in <a class='info' href='#REQS'>[REQS]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Decraene, B., Francois, P., Pelsser, C., and Z. Ahmad, &ldquo;Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> at best without
	changing the BGP protocol or BGP implementations.
</p>
<p> Still, it explains why standardizing a community value for
	the purpose of BGP session graceful shutdown would reduce the
	management overhead bound with the solution. It would also
	allow vendors to provide an automatic graceful shutdown mechanism that
	does not require any configuration at maintenance time.

Terminology</h3>

<p> g-shut initiator : a router on which the session shutdown is performed for the maintenance. 
</p>
<p> g-shut neighbor : a router that peers with the g-shut initiator via (one of) the session(s) to be shut down.
</p>
<p> Initiator AS : the Autonomous System of the g-shut initiator.
</p>
<p> Neighbor AS : the Autonomous System of the g-shut neighbor.
</p>
<p> Affected path / Nominal / pre-convergence path : a BGP path via the peering link(s)
		undergoing the maintenance. This path will no longer exist
		after the shutdown.
</p>
<p> Affected prefix : a prefix initially reached via an affected path.
</p>
<p> Affected router : a router having an affected prefix.
</p>
<p> Backup / alternate / post-convergence path : a path toward an affected
		prefix that will be selected as the best path by an affected
		router, when the link is shut down and the BGP
		convergence is completed.
</p>
<p> Transient alternate path : a path towards an affected prefix that
		may be transiently selected as best by an affected router
		during the convergence process but that is not a
		post-convergence path.  
</p>
<p> Loss of Connectivity (LoC) : the state when a router has
	no path towards an affected prefix.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Packet loss upon manual eBGP session shutdown</h3>

<p> Packets can be lost during a manual shutdown of an eBGP
	session for two reasons. 
</p>
<p> First, routers involved in the convergence process can
	transiently lack of paths towards an affected prefix, and drop traffic
	destined to this prefix. This is because alternate paths can
	be hidden by nodes of an AS. This happens when the paths are
	not selected as best by the ASBR that receive them on an eBGP
	session, or by Route Reflectors that do not propagate them
	further in the iBGP topology because they do not select them
	as best. 
</p>
<p> Second, within the AS, routers' FIB can be transiently
	inconsistent during the BGP convergence and packets towards
	affected prefixes can loop and be dropped. Note that these
	loops only happen when BR-to-BR encapsulation is not used
	within the AS.
</p>
<p> This document only addresses the first reason.

Improving availability of alternate paths</h3>

<p>Using advertise-best-external on ASBRs improves the
		availability of alternate paths. Hence it reduces the LoC duration
		for the outbound traffic of the ISP upon an eBGP
		Session shutdown. 
</p>
<p>All solutions that improve the availability of
		paths beyond the Route Reflectors barrier also help in
		reducing the LoC. These have been discussed for years
		but are not yet available, probably due to their
		implementation complexity.

Graceful shutdown procedures for eBGP sessions</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.1"></a><h3>4.2.1.&nbsp;
Outbound traffic</h3>

<p>This section discusses a mean to render the
			affected paths less desirable by the BGP
			decision process of affected routers, still
			allowing these to be used during the
			convergence while alternate paths are
			propagated to the affected routers.
</p>
<p>A decrease of the local-pref value
				of the affected paths can be issued in
				order to render the affected paths
				less preferable, at the highest
				possible level of the BGP Decision
				Process.
</p>
<p>This operation can be performed by
				reconfiguring the out-filters
				associated with the iBGP sessions
				established by the g-shut initiator.
				
</p>
<p> The modification of the filters
				MUST supplant any other rule affecting
				the local-pref value of the old
				paths.
</p>
<p> Compared to using an in-filter of
				the eBGP session to be shut down, the
				modification of the out-filters will
				not let the g-shut initiator switch to
				another path, as the input to the BGP
				decision process of that router does
				not change. As a consequence, the g-shut
				initiator will not send a withdraw
				message over its iBGP sessions when it
				receives an alternate path over an iBGP
				session. It will however modify the
				local-pref of the affected paths so
				that upstream routers will switch to
				alternate ones.
</p>
<p> When the actual shutdown of the session is
				performed, the g-shut initiator will
				itself switch to the alternate
				paths.

Transitivity of the community</h3>

<p>If the GSHUT community is an
				extended community, it SHOULD be set
				non transitive.
</p>
<p>If a normal community is used, this
				community SHOULD be removed from the
				path by the ASBR of the peer receiving
				it. If not, the GSHUT community MAY be
				removed from the path by all the ASBRs of
				the neighboring AS, before propagating the path
				to other peers.
</p>
<p>Not propagating the community
				further in the Internet reduces the
				amount of BGP churn and avoids
				rerouting in distant ASes that would
				also recognize this community value.
				In other words, it helps concealing
				the convergence at the maintenance
				location. 
</p>
<p> There are cases where an
				interdomain exploration is to be
				performed to recover the reachability,
				e.g., in the case of a shutdown in
				confederations where the alternate
				paths will be found in another AS of
				the confederation. In such scenarios,
				the community value SHOULD be allowed
				to transit through the confederation
				but MAY be removed from the paths
				advertised outside of the
				confederation.
</p>
<p> When the local-pref value of a
				path is conserved upon its propagation
				from one AS of the confederation to
				the other, there is no need to have
				the GSHUT community be propagated
				throughout that confederation.

Graceful shutdown procedures for iBGP sessions</h3>

<p>If the iBGP topology is viable after the

		of the AS have an iBGP signaling path for all
		affected prefixes after the convergence, then the
		shutdown of an iBGP session does not lead to transient
		unreachability. 
</p>
<p>However, in the case of a shutdown of a router, a
		reconfiguration of the out-filters of the g-shut
		initiator should be performed to set a low local-pref
		value for the paths originated by the g-shut initiator
		(e.g, BGP aggregates redistributed from other
		protocols, including static routes).
</p>
<p>This behavior is equivalent to the recommended
		behavior for paths "redistributed" from eBGP sessions
		to iBGP sessions in the case of the shutdown of an
		ASBR.

Forwarding modes and forwarding loops</h3>

<p>If the AS applying the solution does not rely on
	encapsulation to forward packets from the Ingress Border
	Router to the Egress Border Router, then transient forwarding
	loops and consequent packet losses can occur during the
	convergence process, even if the procedure described above is
	applied.
</p>
<p> Using the out-filter reconfiguration avoids the forwarding
	loops between the g-shut initiator and its upstream
	neighbors. Indeed, when this reconfiguration is applied, the
	g-shut initiator keeps using its own external path and lets
	the upstream routers converge to the alternate ones. During
	this phase, no forwarding loops can occur between the g-shut
	initiator and its upstream neighbors as the g-shut neighbor keeps
	using the affected paths via its eBGP peering links. When the
	first step is finished, all the upstream routers have switched
	to alternate paths and the transition performed by the g-shut
	initiator will be loopfree.  Transient forwarding loops
	between other routers will not be avoided with this
	procedure.

Dealing with Internet policies</h3>

<p>A side gain of the maintenance solution is that it can be
	used to reduce the churn implied by a shutdown of an eBGP
	session.
</p>
<p>For this, it is recommended to apply the filters modifying
	the local-pref value of the paths to values strictly lower but
	as close as possible to the local-pref values of the
	post-convergence paths.  
</p>
<p> For example, if a peering link is shut down between a
	provider and one of its customers, and another peering link
	with this customer remains active, then the value of the
	local-pref of the old paths SHOULD be decreased to the
	smallest possible value of the 'customer' local_pref range,
	minus 1.  Thus, routers will not transiently switch to paths
	received from shared-cost peers or providers, which could lead
	to the sending of withdraw messages over eBGP sessions with
	shared-cost peers and providers.
</p>
<p> Proceeding like this reduces both BGP churn and traffic
	shifting as routers will less likely switch to transient
	paths.
</p>
<p> In our example, it also prevents transient
	unreachabilities in the neighboring AS that are due to the
	sending of "abrupt" withdraw messages to shared-cost peers and
	providers.

Propagation of updates from iBGP to iBGP in a RR hierarchy</h3>

<p>Upon the reception of the update of a primary path with a lower local-pref value, 
				Route Reflectors will either propagate the update, or select an alternate path
				and propagate it within their RR iBGP full-mesh, to their own Route Reflectors in the case
				of a multiple level Route Reflector hierarchy, and to their clients.
</p>
<p>During the convergence process controlled with the described procedure, some corner case timings can trigger
				transient unreachabilities.
</p>
<p>A typical example for such transient unreachability for a given prefix is the following :
</p>
<p>
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>1. A Route Reflector RR1 only knew about the primary path upon the shutdown.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. A member of its RR full-mesh, RR2, propagates an update of the old path with a lower local-pref.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. Another member of its RR full-mesh, RR3 processes the update, selects an alternate path, and propagates an update in the mesh.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. RR2 receives the alternate path, selects it as best, and hence withdraws the updated old path on the iBGP session
				of the mesh.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. If for any reason, RR1 receives and
			processes the withdraw generated in step 4
			before processing the update generated in step
			3, RR1 transiently suffers from unreachability
			for the affected prefix. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In such corner cases, the solution improves
			the iBGP convergence behavior/LoC but does not
			ensure 0 packet loss, as we cannot define a
			simple solution relying only on a
			reconfiguration of the filters of the g-shut
			initiator. Improving the availability of
			alternate paths in Route Reflectors, using
			advertise best external, or any flavor of

In-filter reconfiguration</h3>

<p>An In-filter reconfiguration on the eBGP session undergoing the
    maintenance could be performed instead of out-filter
    reconfigurations on the iBGP sessions of the g-shut initiator.
</p>
<p>Upon the application of the maintenance procedure, if the
    g-shut initiator has an alternate path in its Adj-Rib-In, it will
    switch to it directly.
</p>
<p>If this new path was advertised by an eBGP neighbor of the
    g-shut initiator, the g-shut initiator will send a BGP Path Update
    message over its iBGP and eBGP sessions.
</p>
<p> If this new path was received over an iBGP session, the g-shut
    initiator will select that path and directly propagate a withdraw
    message over the iBGP sessions for which it is not acting as a
    Route Reflector. There can be iBGP topologies where the iBGP peers
    of the g-shut initiator do not know an alternate path, and
    hence may drop traffic.
</p>
<p> Also, applying an In-filter reconfiguration on the eBGP session undergoing the maintenance 
may lead to transient LoC, in full-mesh iBGP topologies if 
</p>
<p>
		</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> a. An ASBR of the
					initiator AS, ASBR1 did not
					initially select its own
					external path as best, and
					
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> b. An ASBR of the
					initiator AS, ASBR2 propagates
					an Update message along its
					iBGP sessions upon the
					reception of ASBR1's update
					following the in-filter
					reconfiguration on the g-shut
					initiator, and
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> c. ASBR1 receives the
					update message, runs its
					Decision Process and hence
					propagates a withdraw of its
					external path after having
					selected ASBR2's path as best,
					and
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> d. An impacted router of the AS processes the
					withdraw of ASBR1 before processing
					the update from ASBR2.
</p>
</blockquote><p>
			
</p>
<p> Applying a reconfiguration of the out-filters prevents
	such transient unreachabilities.
</p>
<p> Indeed, when the g-shut initiator propagates an update of
	the old path first, the sending of the withdraw by ASBR2 does
	not trigger unreachability in other nodes as the old path is
	still available. Indeed, even though it receives alternate
	paths, the g-shut initiator keeps using its old path as best
	as the in-filter of the maintained eBGP session has not been
	modified yet. 
</p>
<p> Applying the out-filter reconfiguration also prevents
	packet loops between the g-shut initiator and its direct
	neighbors when encapsulation is not used between the ASBRs of
