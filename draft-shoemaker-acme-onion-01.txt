1.  Introduction

   Currently the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
   [RFC8555] only specifies how DNS identifiers and IP address
   identifiers [RFC8738] may be validated for inclusion in x.509
   certificates [RFC5280].  This document extends the protocol to
   include a validation mechanism for Tor version 3 Onion Addresses
   [TOR-REND-V3].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Onion Address Identifier

   Version 3 Onion address identifier objects MUST use the type "onion-
   v3".  The value field of the identifier MUST contain the textual
   encoding of the address as defined as onion_address in [TOR-REND-V3]
   section 6.  ACME servers MUST verify that the value field contains a
   properly encoded address by checking that it contains only two
   labels, that first label contains a valid checksum, and that the last
   byte of the first label is \x03.  [TODO: this could probably be
   specified better?]

   An identifier for the version 3 Onion address address for the
   following Ed25519 public key would be formatted like so:

   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

   {"type": "onion-v3", "value": "acmexhn3242wxpczplpn3dihkpwukevvgxptogz3xjckuqrx6pscepad.onion"}

4.  Onion CSR Challenge

   This document specifies a single new challenge type that can be used
   for validation of onion-v3 identifiers.  This challenge demonstrates
   control of the private key associated with the public key contained
   within the Onion address by signing a CSR containing special
   attributes.  The challenge object contains the following fields:

   type (required, string):  The string "onion-v3-csr"

   nonce (required, string):  A random value that uniquely identifies
      the challenge.  This value MUST have at least 64 bits of entropy.
      It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet
      as described in [RFC4648] Section 5.  Trailing '=' padding
      characters MUST be stripped.  See [RFC4086] for additional
      information on randomness requirements.

   The client prepares for validation by constructing a Certificate
   Signing Request (CSR) [RFC2986].  This CSR MUST contain two
   attributes, a caSigningNonce attribute containing the nonce provided
   in the challenge object, and a applicantSigningNonce attribute
   containing a random value picked by the client.  This random value
   MUST have at least 64 bits of entropy.  The CSR MUST be signed by the
   private key associated with the public key contained within the Onion
   address.

   The caSigningNonce and applicantSigningNonce attributes are defined
   as follows in [CABF-BR] Appendix F

   cabf-caSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 41 }

   caSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
       WITH SYNTAX             OCTET STRING
       EQUALITY MATCHING RULE  octetStringMatch
       SINGLE VALUE            TRUE
       ID                      { cabf-caSigningNonce }
   }

   cabf-applicantSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 42 }

   applicantSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
       WITH SYNTAX             OCTET STRING
       EQUALITY MATCHING RULE  octetStringMatch
       SINGLE VALUE            TRUE
       ID                      { cabf-applicantSigningNonce }
   }

   The client completes the challenge process by POSTing a JSON object
   containing the signed CSR they generated to the challenge URL.  The
   base64url encoding of the protected headers and payload is described
   in Section 6.1 of [RFC8555].  The JSON object contains the following
   fields:

   csr (required, string):  The base64url-encoded DER encoding of the
      signed CSR.

   On receiving this request from a client the ACME server verifies the
   CSR by checking that it contains the caSigningNonce attribute, and
   that it's value matches the nonce in the challenge object it created,
   the applicantSigningNonce, and that the value contains a random value
   with at least 64 bits of entropy, and that the signature can be
   verified using the public key encoded in the Onion address that is
   being validated.  If all of these checks succeed, then the validation
   is successful.  Otherwise, it is a failure.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Identifier Types

   Adds a new type to the "ACME Identifier Types" registry defined in
   Section 9.7.7 of [RFC8555] with Label "onion-v3" and Reference "I-
   D.shoemaker-acme-onion".

5.2.  Challenge Types

   Adds one new entry to the "ACME Validation Methods" registry defined
   in Section 9.7.8 of [RFC8555] as defined below.

6.  Security Considerations

   [NOTE: Probably should consider _something_ here (may want to
   reference [TOR-REND-V3] Section 2.2.7?).]
