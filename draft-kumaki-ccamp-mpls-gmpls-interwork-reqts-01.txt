1. Introduction 
    
   Recently, the deployment of a GMPLS network is planned or under 
   investigation among many service providers, and some of very advanced

   research networks have already been operated based on GMPLS 
   technology.  GMPLS is developed as an extension of MPLS-TE and allows 
   control a transport network consisting of TDM cross-connect, 
   optical/lambda switches, and fibers.  By introducing GMPLS technology, 
   some service providers expect that MPLS-TE network connectivity is 
   effectively and reliably established over the GMPLS network. If MPLS- 
   TE and GMPLS protocols can interwork with each other, the 
   introduction of GMPLS would be more beneficial for service providers, 
   because this is expected to improve the resource utilization, network 
   resiliency and manageability all over the network, less impacting the 
   existing MPLS-TE networks. 
 
   Currently, there is no clear definition and standardization work to 
   interwork between MPLS-TE routers and GMPLS routers or switches, i.e. 
   , between MPLS-TE networks and GMPLS networks. In order to accelerate 
   the deployment of GMPLS technology, MPLS-TE/GMPLS interworking is a 
   key.   
    
   In order to create the definition of MPLS-TE/GMPLS interworking 
   technology, the concrete requirement is preferably defined from the 
   point of operational experience of MPLS-TE/GMPLS networks and future 
   view on these technologies by collecting the input and requirements 
   from various service providers. 
    
   Considering such environment, this document focuses on the 
   requirement of MPLS-TE/GMPLS interworking especially in support of 
   GMPLS deployment.

3. Problem Statement  
    
   GMPLS technology is deployed or will be deployed in various forms to 
   provide a highly efficient transport for existing MPLS-TE networks, 
   depending on the deployment choices of each service provider. A GMPLS

   network may provide connectivity in terms of LSPs that are used as TE 
   links by the MPLS-TE network to support MPLS-TE LSPs. 
    
   In terms of MPLS-TE/GMPLS signaling, although GMPLS LSPs may be set 
   up triggered by the signaling of MPLS-TE LSPs, the clear mechanism of 
   how to interwork has not yet been defined. Feature richness of MPLS-
   TE and GMPLS technology allows service providers to use a set of 
   options on how GMPLS services can be used by MPLS-TE networks. In 
   this document, the requirement for MPLS-TE/GMPLS interworking is 
   presented with some operations considerations associated with use of 
   GMPLS services by MPLS-TE networks. 
    
4. Reference model 
    
   The reference model used in this document is shown in Figure 1.  As 
   indicated in [RFC3945], the optical transport network consists of, 
   for example, GMPLS controlled OXCs and GMPLS-enabled MPLS-TE routers.

   MPLS-TE network connectivity is provided through a GMPLS LSP which is 
   created between GMPLS routers. This document defines the requirements 
   for how the MPLS-TE network and the GMPLS network are interworked in 
   order to effectively operate the entire network and smoothly deploy 
   the GMPLS network. 
 
5. Detailed Requirements 
    
   This section describes detailed requirements for MPLS-TE/GMPLS 
   interworking in support of GMPLS deployment. 
 
 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.      Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 4] 
      draft-kumaki-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-01 December 2006 
 
 
5.1 Use of GMPLS optical network resources in MPLS-TE networks 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to make effective use of 
   GMPLS optical network resources (e.g. bandwidth, protection & 
   recovery) by the MPLS-TE service networks.   
    
   The GMPLS network MUST be able to support more than one MPLS-TE 
   network. Most of service providers have different networks for 
   various services; their GMPLS deployment plans are to have these 
   service networks use a common GMPLS controlled optical network as a 
   core network of various services. 
 
5.2 Mapping signaling information between MPLS-TE and GMPLS 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to map signaling information 
   between MPLS-TE and GMPLS. From an MPLS-TE signaling point of view, 
   the routers in MPLS-TE domain should be able to signal over GMPLS 
   optical domain. In this case, an interworking between MPLS-TE and 
   GMPLS protocol is required.  
    
5.3 Establishment of GMPLS LSPs triggered by end-to-end MPLS-TE LSPs 
signaling 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to establish end-to-end MPLS- 
   TE LSPs over a GMPLS optical network. GMPLS LSPs SHOULD be set up 
   triggered by the signaling of MPLS-TE LSP. 
    
5.4 Establishment of end-to-end MPLS-TE LSPs having diverse paths over 
GMPLS optical network 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to establish end-to-end 
   MPLS-TE LSPs having diverse paths including diverse GMPLS LSPs 
   corresponding to the request of the head-end MPLS LSR for protection 
   of MPLS-TE LSPs. The GMPLS optical network SHOULD assure the 
   diversity of GMPLS LSPs, even if their ingress nodes in GMPLS optical 
   network are different. 
    
5.5 Advertisement of TE information via GMPLS optical domain 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to control advertisements of 
   TE information belonging to MPLS-TE service networks across the GMPLS 
   optical network. 
   The TE information within the same MPLS-TE service networks needs to 
   be exchanged in order that a head end LSR of the MPLS-TE network can 
   compute an LSP to a tail end LSR that is reached over the GMPLS 
   optical network. 
   On the other hand, the TE information belonging to one MPLS-TE 
   service network MUST NOT be advertised to other MPLS-TE service 

 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.      Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 5] 
      draft-kumaki-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-01 December 2006 
 
 
   networks to preserve confidentiality and security, and in order to 
   avoid establishing undesirable LSPs. 
    
5.6 Selective advertisement of TE information via a border node 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to distribute TE reachability 
   information from the GMPLS optical network to MPLS-TE networks 
   selectively, which are useful for the head-end MPLS routers to 
   compute MPLS-TE LSPs. 
 
5.7 Interworking of MPLS-TE and GMPLS protection 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to select GMPLS protection 
   types for the GMPLS LSPs according to protection options defined for 
   the protected MPLS-TE LSPs.  
   If MPLS-TE LSPs are protected using MPLS FRR [RFC4090], then when an 
   FRR protected packet LSP is signaled, we SHOULD be able to select  
   protected GMPLS LSPs in the GMPLS optical network. In terms of MPLS 
   protection, the MPLS-TE Path message can include some flags in the 
   FAST REROUTE object and SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object. In terms of GMPLS 
   protection, there are both signaling aspects [RFC3471] [RFC3473] and 
   routing aspects [RFC4202].  
 
5.8 Failure recovery 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide failure recovery in the GMPLS optical 
   domain without impacting MPLS-TE domain and vice versa.   
   In case that failure in the GMPLS optical domain associates with 
   MPLS-TE domain, some kind of notification of the failure may be 
   transmitted to MPLS-TE domain and vice versa.   
    
5.9 Complexity and Risks 
    
   The solution SHOULD NOT introduce unnecessary complexity to the 
   current operating network to such a degree that it would affect the 
   stability and diminish the benefits of deploying such a solution over 
   service provider networks. 
    
5.10 Scalability consideration 
    
   The solution MUST have a minimum impact on network scalability for 
   deploying GMPLS technology in the existing MPLS-TE networks.    
   Scalability of GMPLS deployment in the existing MPLS-TE networks MUST 
   address the following consideration. 
    
   - the number of GMPLS capable nodes (e.g. the number of non-PSC GMPLS 
   capable nodes) 
   - the number of MPLS-TE capable nodes 
   - the number of GMPLS LSPs

      draft-kumaki-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-01 December 2006 
 
 
   - the number of MPLS-TE LSPs 
    
5.11 Performance consideration 
    
   The solution SHOULD be evaluated with regard to the following 
   criteria. 
 
   - Failure and restoration time 
   - Impact and scalability of the control plane due to added 
     overheads and so on 
   - Impact and scalability of the data/forwarding plane due to added 
     overheads and so on 
    
5.12 Management consideration 
    
   Manageability of MPLS-TE/GMPLS interworking MUST addresses the 
   following consideration. 
    
   - need for a MIB module for control plane and monitoring 
   - need for diagnostic tools  
 
   MIB for an interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocol SHOULD be 
  implemented. 
   In case that an interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocol is 
   done, a failure between them MUST be detected.      
 
6. Security Considerations   
    
   We will write security considerations in next version. 
    
7. IANA Considerations 
    
   This requirement document makes no requests for IANA action.
