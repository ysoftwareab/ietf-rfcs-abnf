                    Diameter Invalid Mobile Identity
         draft-avasarala-diameter-error-invalid-identity-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification documents an extension to the Diameter Base
   Protocol RFC6733.  This extension adds a new Diameter Protocol Error
   code to the Result-Code AVP to the Diameter responses for indicating
   error in the mobile identity in the Diameter requests.

   This extension is mainly applicable to the credit control
   applications defined in RFC4006 and user authorization procedures
   defined in RFC4740.

Internet-Draft      Diameter Invalid Mobile Identity        October 2017


2.  Introduction

   This document defines a new Diameter error code for indicating error
   in mobile identity e.g.  IMEI.

   The Diameter base protocol defined in [RFC6733] defines the various
   Diameter protocol errors that can occur in Diameter requests.  This
   document extends it to add the new Diameter error code to report
   invalid IMEI value.

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

3.1.  Terminology

   Diameter Node

      A RFC6733 Diameter Client, RFC6733 Diameter Server, or RFC6733
      Diameter Agent.

   Diameter Endpoint

      An RFC6733 Diameter Client or RFC6733 Diameter Server.

3.2.  Abbreviations


    IMEI    : International Mobile Equipment Identifier
    IMESISV : International Mobile Equipment Identifier Software Version


4.  Instances of invalid IMEI

4.1.  IMEI validation

   The Diameter entities that receive IMEI value as part of Diameter
   AVPs like User-Equipment-Info-Value as defined in Section 8.50 of
   [RFC4006] should validate the IMEI value as per the validation rules
   described in sections 4.2 for IMEI and Section 4.3 of [RFC7254] for
   IMEISV respectively.

4.2.  DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY Error code

   A new Diameter Protocol Error - DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY with
   code 301x is defined for entities to use to report the cases of
   invalid IMEI in Diameter AVPs

Internet-Draft      Diameter Invalid Mobile Identity        October 2017


4.3.  Use of DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY Error code

   When the Diameter endpoints determine that the IMEI value is invalid
   as per the procedure defined in Section 4 they should populate the
   Diameter Result-Code AVP with the DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY
   Error code and insert the Result-Code AVP into the Diameter response.

5.  Handling of DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY error

   Diameter nodes receiving a Diameter response with Result-Code AVP set
   to DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY SHOULD attempt to re-send the
   Diameter Request with a valid IMEI value User-Equipment-Info AVP.  If
   they cannot do this, then they need to generate appropriate response
   to the previous node and abort the transaction.

6.  Examples of use of DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY in Diameter
    Responses

   The IMEI value is received in the User-Equipment-info AVP defined in
   Section 8.50 of [RFC4006]

6.1.  Credit Control applications

   The Credit control applications can receive IMEI value as part of
   Diameter CCR message as defined in Section 8.50 of [RFC4006].

   When the server that receives the Diameter CCR message determines
   that the IMEI value obtained is invalid, SHOULD use the Result-Code
   301x (defined in this document) along with the
   DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY error to indicate invalid IMEI value
   in the Diameter CCA response.

   The Credit-control client receiving this error SHOULD attempt to re-
   send the CCR message with a valid IMEI in User-Equipment-Info AVP,
   else the request should be aborted.

6.2.  User Authorization applications

   The user authorization applications that determine the IMEI value to
   be invalid as part of user authorization procedure SHOULD use the
   Result-Code 301x (defined in this document) along with the
   DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY error to indicate invalid IMEI
   value.

7.  Security Considerations

   None

8.  Acknowledgements

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new Diameter protocol error code, 3011.  The
   required information for this registration, as specified in
   [RFC6733], is:


       Name:  DIAMETER_INVALID_MOBILE_IDENTITY

       Description:  This protocol error code is for indicating that the
                     IMEI value obtained in the Diameter request is
                     determined to be invalid.
