Abstract

   This document registers a group of 'enumservices' [2] to be used to 
   indicate that the associated resources are primarily sources for 
   information.

   Specifically, the "enumservices" registered with this document are 
   'web' and 'ft' using the URI schemes 'http:', 'https:' and 'ftp:'

1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC2916bis [2]) is a system that 
   transforms E.164 numbers [3] into domain names and then uses DNS 
   (Domain Name Service, RFC1034 [4]) services like delegation through 
   NS records and NAPTR records to look up what services are available 
   for a specific domain name.

   This document registers 'enumservices' according to the guidelines 
   given in RFC2916bis to be used for provisioning in the services 
   field of a NAPTR[6] resource record to indicate what class of 
   functionality a given end point offers. The registration is defined 
   within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System 
   [5][6][7][8][9]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application 
   defined in RFC2916bis.

   The following 'enumservices' are registered with this document: 
   'web' and 'ft'. These share a common feature in that they each 
   indicate that the functionality of the given end points and the 
   associated resources are primarily sources of information.

   According to RFC2619bis, the 'enumservice' registered must be able 
   to function as a selection mechanism when choosing one NAPTR 
   resource record from another. That means that the registration MUST 
   specify what is expected when using that very NAPTR record, and the 
   URI scheme which is the outcome of the use of it.

   Therefore an 'enumservice' acts as a hint, indicating the kind of 
   service with which the URI constructed using the regexp field is 
   associated. There can be more than one 'enumservice' included within 
   a single NAPTR; this indicates that there is more than one service 
   that can be achieved using the associated URI scheme.

   The common thread with this set of definitions is that they reflect 
   the kind of service that the end user will hope to achieve with the 
   communication using the associated URI. 

   The services specified here are intended NOT to specify the protocol 
   or even method of connection that MUST be used to achieve each 
   service. Instead they define the kind of interactive behavior that 
   an end user will expect, leaving the end system to decide (based on 
   policies outside the remit of this specification) how to execute the 
   service.

   Since the same URI scheme may be used for different services (e.g. 
   'tel:'), and the same kind of service may use different URI schemes 
   (e.g. for VoIP 'sip:', 'h323:' and 'tel:' may be used), it is 
   necessary in some cases to specify the service and the URI scheme 
   used.

   The service parameters defined in RFC2916bis allow therefore a 
   'type' and a 'subtype' to be specified. Within this set of 
   specifications the convention is assumed that the 'type' (being the 
   more generic term) is defining the service and the 'subtype' is 
   defining the URI scheme.

3.  Web Service

3.1  Introduction

   The enumservices registered in this section indicate that the 
   resource identified by the associated URI is capable of being a 
   source of information.


3.2  Web Service Registration with 'http:'

   Enumservice Name: "web"

   Type: "web"

   Subtype: "http"

   URI Scheme: 'http:'

   Functional Specification: 

   This enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the 
   associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information.

   It has to be noted that the kind of information retrieved can be 
   manifold. Usually, contacting a resource by an 'http:' URI provides 
   a document. This document can contain all different kind of 
   information, like audio or video or executable code. Thus, one can 
   not be more specific what information to expect when contacting the 
   resource.


   Security Considerations: 

   There are no specific security issues with this 'enumservice'. 
   However, the general considerations of section 6 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny
           (for author contact detail see section 8)

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

   None


3.3  Web Service Registration with 'https:'

   Enumservice Name: "web"

   Type: "web"

   Subtype: "https"

   URI Scheme: 'https:'

   Functional Specification:

   This enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the 
   associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information, 
   which can be contacted by using TLS or Secure Socket Layer protocol.

   It has to be noted that the kind of information retrieved can be 
   manifold. Usually, contacting a resource by an 'https:' URI provides 
   a document. This document can contain all different kind of 
   information, like audio or video or executable code. Thus, one can 
   not be more specific what information to expect when contacting the 
   resource.

   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'enumservice'. 
   However, the general considerations of section 6 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny
           (for author contact detail see section 8)

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

   None


4.  Ft Service Registration

   Enumservice Name: "ft"

   Type: "ft"

   Subtype: "ftp"

   URI Scheme: 'ftp:'

   Functional Specification: 

   This enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the 
   associated URI scheme is a file service from which a file or file 
   listing can be retrieved.

   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'enumservice'. 
   However, the general considerations of section 6 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny
           (for author contact detail see section 8)

   Any other information the author deems interesting:

   None


5.  Additional Information

   Editor note: Is there any necessary additional information? TBD


6.  Security Considerations 

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database. Thus any 
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously. Whilst 
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone 
   Directory, it does open the data subject to having "their" 
   information collected automatically without any indication that this 
   has been done or by whom.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate 
   lists of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are 
   used to address "spam". Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list 
   is aware that the volume of "spam" email they are sent increases 
   when they post to the mailing list; publication of a telephone 
   number in ENUM is no different, and may be used to send "junk faxes" 
   or "junk SMS" for example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use 
   "sacrificial" email accounts when posting to such lists to help 
   filter out unrequested emails sent to them. This is not so easy with 
   published telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number assignment 
   process is much more involved and usually a single E.164 number (or 
   a fixed range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access. Thus 
   providing a "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not 
   possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible 
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give their explicit 
   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.

   In addition, they should be made aware that, due to storage of such 
   data during harvesting by third parties, removal of the data from 
   publication will not remove any copies that have been taken; in 
   effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data 
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from 
   publication, and that their consent for its publication is 
   explicitly confirmed at regular intervals.

   The user SHOULD be asked to confirm opening a web page or starting
   an ftp session (particularly if the ftp client is configured to
   send the user's email address as an "anonymous" user password).

   Using a web:http or ft:ftp service is not secure, and so the user 
   should apply the same caution when entering personal data as they 
   would do if using a client application started with any other 
   method. Whilst this is not a feature of ENUM or these enumservices, 
   the ENUM-using application on the end system may appear different 
   from the user's "normal" browser, and so the user SHOULD receive an 
   indication on whether or not their communication is secured.

   As evaluating a web page can involve execution of embedded (or 
   linked) content that may include executable code, there are risks 
   involved in evaluating a web URL. If automatic evaluation of a web 
   link were to be used, the querying user would be exposed to risks 
   associated with that automatic download and execution of content. 
   Thus the client MUST ask the querying user for confirmation before 
   evaluating the web URL; the client MUST NOT download and evaluate 
   the web content automatically.

   In addition to the specific security considerations given above, all 
   security considerations given in RFC2916bis apply.
