                  Destination Claim for JSON Web Token
                    draft-campbell-oauth-dst4jwt-00

Abstract

   The Destination Claim for JSON Web Token (JWT) provides a means of
   indicating the address to which the JWT is sent.  The Claim can be
   used to preventing malicious forwarding or redirection of a JWT to
   unintended recipients.

1.  Introduction

   JWT [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token] is a compact, URL-safe means of
   representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
   Oftentimes an HTTP 302 redirect or an auto-submitted HTML form, using
   the user agent as a intermediary, is employed as the method of
   transfer.  The Destination Claim provides a standard way for for the
   Issuer to indicate the address to which it instructed the user agent
   to deliver the JWT.  The recipient of the JWT can detect and prevent
   malicious forwarding or redirection to unintended recipients by
   verifying that the address conveyed by the Destination Claim matches
   the actual location at which the JWT was received.

   While the Destination Claim bears some seeming similarity to the
   Audience Claim already defined in JWT, the distinction is that the
   Audience identifies _who_ the JWT is intended for while the
   Destination identifies _where_ the JWT is sent.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "JSON Web Token (JWT)", "Issuer"
   "Claim", "Claim Name", and "Claim Value" as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token], and the term "user agent" as defined
   by RFC 7230 [RFC7230].

2.  The Destination Claim

   The Claim Name of the Destination Claim is "dst" and its Claim Value
   is a URI [RFC3986] indicating the address to which the JWT is sent.
   Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL but, if the Claim is present, the
   recipient MUST check that the URI identifies the location at which
   the JWT was received.  If the JWT is received at a different location
   than the one conveyed by the value of the "dst" claim, then the JWT
   MUST be rejected.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  JSON Web Token Claim Registration

   This specification registers the Destination Claim defined herein in
   the IANA JSON Web Token Claims registry defined in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token].

3.1.1.  Registry Request Contents

   o  Claim Name: "dst"
   o  Claim Description: Destination
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document(s): Section 2 of this document

4.  Security Considerations

   The Destination Claim defined in Section 2 provides a means to assist
   in detecting and preventing malicious forwarding or redirection of a
   JWT to unintended recipients.  If, for example, an Issuer can be
   tricked into sending a JWT to a malicious site (perhaps due to
   inadequate checking of the target URI combined with Cross-Site
   Request Forgery) the JWT would be unusable at the legitimate site
   because the "dst" would contain a URI of the malicious site.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   o  Is there compelling reason to allow the "dst" Claim to accommodate
      multiple values?  A single value is sufficient for the cases
      envisioned and is certainly simpler.
