   WHERE DOES IT FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK

      PPVPN

   WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG

      PPVPN WG charter specifies manageability as an important aspect
   of VPN services.

   JUSTIFICATION

      As VPN technology matures, VPN services can either be VPRN,VPLS,
   or VPWS. A given provider may support any combination of these. As
   reach of VPN services expands from local Metro area to global level,
   a given provider MAY require supporting large number of VPN
   services. Well defined methods for VPN testability seriously improve
   providers ability to support a large number of VPN services.

Acronyms:

   VPN Class: A VPN class is any one of the following VPN types; L3 VPN
   (VPRN), VPLS, VPWS or any future VPN type.

   Testability: The word Testability may be used interchangeably with
   Operation and Maintenance.

   VFI - Virtual Forwarding Instance

   VSI - Virtual Switching Instance

1. Introduction

   Current VPN testability methods depend on the underlying tunneling
   method used. As a result different tunneling protocols MAY provide
   different methods or degree of testability, or sometimes may totally
   lack such capabilities. It is possible for some testability methods
   to use constructs that are largely different from the actual data
   packets, thus possibly affecting the validity of the test results.
   It is important that test packets do not violate any industry
   standards (such as IETF or IEEE standards). In this document we
   provide a framework and Requirements to address these issues.

   Architecturally VPN functionality has two major components:VPN
   service, and PE to PE VPN connectivity (tunnel connectivity). Any
   VPN testability method must have the ability to test these logical
   areas independently.

   In this document we introduce Application level VPN testability that
   is independent of the underlying tunneling implementation.
   Application level VPN tests are expected to be available across all
   implementations as a generic method of testability.

2.0 Architecture for Operation and Maintenance of VPN.

   It is important to have proper architectural definitions for VPN
   testability (Operation and Maintenance). Architectural definitions
   facilitate proper identification of Requirement and development of
   VPN testability solutions.

   In the above architecture, the distinction between application-level
   VPN testing and technology-dependent VPN testing depends on how VPN
   test packets are distinguished from actual data and control packets.
   The distinction between technology-dependent VPN test and
   technology-specific VPN test depends on whether VPN properties or
   technology properties are tested.

   The ability to identify VPN test messages from actual data and
   control packets is important for successful implementation of VPN
   testability. There are two possible approaches;

   1. Use of properties or special fields (such as reserved addresses
   or special protocol types) on actual data packet.

   2. Use of technology-dependent parameters (such as reserved labels
   in MPLS).

2.1 Scope of Application-Level VPN testability

   Application-level VPN tests are independent of the underlying tunnel
   method used. Hence it is anticipated that Application-level
   testability will be available as a generic testability method
   independent of underlying technology.


Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              3
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002


   Application-level VPN testability can be broadly classified into
   three areas:

     . VPN health test.
     . Test for VPN properties.
     . VPN performance monitoring.

2.1.1 VPN Health Test


   VPN health test is defined per specific VPN of a specific VPN class
   between two specific PE devices.

   A VPN health test specifies:

   . Availability of the specific VPN of a specific VPN class at a
   specific PE device.

   . Health and liveliness of that VPN at that PE device.

   . General PE to PE reachability for that VPN.

   . Health and operational status of the forwarding process of that
   VPN (VSI/VFI) at the local and remote PEs.

   . Connectivity from the local PE to the remote PE for that VPN.

2.1.2 Test for VPN Properties

   Test for VPN properties is defined per specific VPN of a specific
   VPN class at a specific PE device.

   The test for VPN properties specifies:

   . Availability of the specific VPN property of a specific VPN class
   at a specific PE device.

   . Health and Liveliness of that VPN with specified VPN properties at
   that PE device.

   . General PE to PE reachability for that VPN with the given
   property.

   . Health and operational status of the VSI with the specified
   property.

   Maximum Packet size and Quality of Service are some of the
   properties that can be tested per VPN context.

2.1.3 Test for VPN Performance

   Test for VPN performance is defined per specific VPN of a specific
   VPN class at a specific PE device.

Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              4
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002



   A VPN performance test at minimum MUST provide the ability to:

   . Measure round trip delay between Local and Remote PE for that VPN.

   . Measure round trip delay variation between Local and Remote PE for
   that VPN over a specified period of time.

   .. Measure one-way delay variation between Local and Remote PE for
   that VPN over a specified period of time.


2.2  Scope of Technology-Dependent VPN Test

   The technology-dependent VPN test provides methods to test
   technology-dependent aspects of a VPN. In addition, technology-
   dependent VPN tests MAY provide methods to perform the VPN tests
   defined in section 2.1 that are technology independent.

   A technology-dependent VPN test MAY provide

   . Path Trace
   . Path Reachability

2.2.1 Path Trace

   Path trace provides methods to test and trace the path that a given
   VPN data packet traverses.

   Path trace is defined per specific VPN and specific tunnel method.

2.2.2  Path (Tunnel) Reachability

   Path Reachability provides methods to test reachability of a PE
   device for a specific VPN of a specific class.

2.3 Scope of Technology-Specific Testability

   Technology-specific testability is defined per tunneling method used
   and is specific to the tunneling method used. Tunnel-specific
   testing may not be performed in the context of VPN. As an example,
   consider ping status if IP based tunnels such as GRE is used, LSP
   ping status if MPLS tunnels used, or control status if L2TP is used;
   none of these tests are VPN aware and only provide health status of
   underlying connectivity in general.

   Requirements and implementation details of tunnel-specific
   testability are provided in related documentation and considered out
   of scope in this document.

3.0 Model for VPN Testability



Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              5
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002


   Query and response method is used as the base model for VPN test. In
   this document we refer this as Base VPN test model. Using the base
   VPN test model, more elaborate VPN test models can be derived. For
   example, for an application that requires continuous periodic
   connectivity testing, it is more efficient to send the response for
   received query messages from the other side/sides embedded in the
   query messages periodically sent to that other side. This is
   siimilar to a  Hello-protocol approach. This approach reduces the
   number of required messages by half.

   A VPN test is specified from the point of view of a local PE. VPN
   test context SHOULD be specified per remote PE, per VPN class, per
   VPN. The VPN test context in a local PE is denoted by {PE, Class,
   VPN} (p). The (p) denotes the VPN property under test and may be
   omitted if specific property is not identified.

   Additional, possible, VPN-contexts are {class, VPN} and {class, VPN,
   destination-address}. When knowing the specific VPN and VPN-class,
   it may not be necessary to know the remote PE to initiate a VPN-
   test. In some cases the remote PE identity is not known. In other
   cases, the objective of VPN test procedure may be to discover the
   remote PE. For this reason, the context of {class, VPN} is a very
   important one. In this case, the messages of the VPN test procedure
   are simply forwarded along the VPN to whoever is there on the other
   side (might be one or more). The identity of the other PE-devices
   connected to the VPN is discovered from the response or responses
   received.

   The context of (Class, VPN, destination-address), in which the
   destination address is in the context of the VPN, is very useful for
   testing the VPN for packets of specific destination address. This is
   important in two cases: First, when the PE to which the CE with this
   address connects is unknown; Second, for testing the forwarding
   database of the VPN for the specific CE destination address.


4.0 Requirements for Operation and Maintenance (Test) of VPN

4.1 General Requirements

4.1.1 Standard Compliant

   . VPN test methods MUST not violate standards (IETF, IEEE, ITU) for
   the purpose of testability.

4.1.2 Scope of VPN Test

   . Test results of one VPN SHOULD not be used to deduce the test
   result of another VPN.

   . Results of VPN test of specific PE MUST not be used to deduce the
   test results of another PE.


Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              6
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002


   . Test results of a specific VPN test layer (Application, Tunnel and
   Tunnel specific) SHOULD not be used to deduce the results of another
   layer.

4.1.3 Forwarding Policies and VPN Test

   . A PE device MUST honor local forwarding policies. As an example; a
   test response MUST not be generated if there was a violation of a
   local forwarding policy.

4.1.4 Scalability

   Presence of VPN test solutions MUST not affect the scalability of
   the VPN solution.

4.1.5 Measurement of Performance

   VPN test methods SHOULD provide methods to measure performance.

4.1.6 Technology Independent

   VPN test MUST not depend on the underlying tunnel methods. Such
   dependencies MUST only be used to test technology specific aspects
   of VPN.

4.1.7 Extensibility

   The protocol should be extensible, to allow new measurements and new
   items to be monitored.

4.1.8 Security

   It is recommended that implementation provide an optional policy for
   handling VPN test queries arriving on access ports. Absence of such
   policy may lead to undefined behavior of VPN testability and may
   lead to exploitation of security infrastructure.

   VPN test MUST honor local Forwarding and Security polices.


4.2 Requirements for Application Level VPN Test.

   The discussion below is from the point of view of a specific end-
   point of a VPN (a specific PE participating in a VPN). This end-
   point is regarded as the local-PE.

4.2.1 VPN Health Test

   . MUST be defined VPN-context.

   . MUST indicate the availability and health of VPN-context.

   . SHOULD indicate the health of VSI/VFI of VPN-context instance.

Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              7
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002



   . A PE device SHOULD generate a response with specific error
   indication if:
       - the specified VPN-context instance is not configured.
       - the health check criteria has failed for the VPN-context.
       - the reachability between the querying PE and the responding PE
   for the instance {PE,class, VPN} has either not established,
   partially established, or failed.

   . Test results of one VPN-context MUST not be used to deduce the
   results of any other VPN-context.


4.2.3 Requirements for Test of VPN Properties

   . MUST be defined VPN-context (p) where p is the property tested.
   Maximum Packet size and Quality of Service are some of the
   properties that can be tested per VPN context.

   . MUST indicate the availability and health of VPN-context (p).

   . SHOULD indicate the health of VSI/VFI of VPN-context (p) instance.

   . A PE device MUST not generate a response if:
       - the specified VPN-context(p) instance is not configured.
       - the health check criteria has failed for the VPN-context(p).
       - the reachability between the querying PE and the responding PE
   for the instance {PE,class, VPN}(p) has either not established,
   partially established, or failed.

   . Test results of one VPN-context(p) MUST not be used to deduce the
   results of any other VPN-context(p).


4.3 Requirements for Technology Dependent VPN Test

   . Adaptation of tunnel encapsulation for testability MUST be
   compliant with the appropriate standards in use.

   . Construct of tunnel encapsulation for testability MUST be as close
   as possible to the tunnel encapsulation used for VPN data (ie: label
   depth etc.).

   . Tunnel test methods must not violate the configuration parameters
   of the tunnels used in data forwarding.

   . Test method and data plane both MUST used the same encapsulation
construct (ie GRE vs GRE but not GRE vs MPLS).

5. Application Level VPN Testability

   Application level VPN test requires methods to identify VPN test
   packets from control or data packets.

Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              8
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002



   There are two possible approaches:

   1. Use of reserved address for that VPN class (e.g. reserved MAC
   address).

   2. Use of VPN test protocol Type on the Data packet (e.g. VPN-
   OAMprotocol type on IP).


5.1 Implementation of specific VPN liveliness

   We propose to use two approaches to meassure VPN liveliness.

   1. Reserved address for the purpose of specific VPN liveliness.

   Use of reserved addresses provide direct method of testing using the
   same data forwarding logic.

   For example, for VPLS a specific MAC address may be reserved (the
   actual MAC address to be determined). The implementation that
   complies with application level VPN liveliness MUST identify such
   MAC address at forwarding plane and process as explained in this
   document.

   2. Use of special VPN protocol type for purpose of specific VPN
   liveliness.

   For layer 3 VPN obtaining a reserved address may be difficult.
   127.0.0.x can lead to violation of the forwarding rules at the
   originating PE.

   Another reason for using a protocol-type/Ethernet-type field for VPN
   test messages is the fact that when messages are identified as VPN
   test messages according to the protocol/type field, the VPN behavior
   for a packet with a specific destination address can be tested. This
   is valid for layer 2 as well as for layer 3 VPNs.

   We propose to use a new IP protocol type VPN-OAM to identify IP
   packets that are intended for the purpose.

   Similarly, each class of VPN SHOULD define protocol type (upper
   layer identifier) for Application Level VPN test purpose.


5.3 Discussion

   Application level test query/responses are created using a similar
   template as data packets. For example, if VPN testability is
   performed on a layer 3 VPN, the testability packet is an IP packet.
   This similarity allows application level VPN tests to test a wider
   range of properties.


Senevirathne   Informational - Expiration February 2003              9
                  draft-tsenevir-app-vpn-test-02.txt       October 2002


   Application level VPN tests MAY include testability for varied
   packet sizes. A local PE may generate a "liveliness" request to a
   remote PE with specified packet size. Specific packet size is
   implied by the size of the actual liveliness query packet. The
   responding PE MUST respond without an error indication only if the
   above specified criteria are satisfied and there are no packet size
   violations.

   Successful response to a "liveliness" query of a specific packet
   size MAY be used to deduce the support for a data packet of that
   size along the path.

   Application level VPN testing MAY include testability for quality of
   service. As explained in the Requirement section, quality of service
   testing MUST be encoded in exactly the same manner as data packets
   encode quality of service. For example, queried quality of service
   for IP packets may encoded as a Type of Service (or Differential
   Service Code Point (DSCP)). In VPLS, this may be encoded as 802.1Q
   Priority bits.


5.4. Advantages

   - Independent of tunneling methods used.

   - Ability to test operation and health of actual forwarding process
   (VFI) at remote PE.

   - Ability to test application level properties such as quality of
   service, packet size. TTL processing, etc.

   - No extra burden/modification on tunneling methods. For example, in
   the MPLS-based testability methods proposed, a special label is used
   or label depth is increased. Such variations impact the validity of
   testability.

   - Ability to test VPN service across mixed mode tunnel
   configurations.

   - Provides a generic VPN testability method. Absence of a generic
   method requires vendors to implement scores of testability methods
   and service providers MAY require using a combination of such
   methods. Hence generic VPN testability provides ease of
   implementation and deployment.

6.1.2 VPN Class Header (VCH)

   The VCH depends on whether the VPN is a layer 3 VPN, layer 2 VPN,
   VPLS, etc. In the case of a layer 3 VPN, the VCH is an IP header and
   MUST contain VPN-OAM IP protocol Type. In the case of VPLS, the VCH
   MUST contain an Ethernet header with  DA:SA:EtherType. The Ethertype
   field MUST be set to the VPN-OAM Ethertype. The DA MAY be set to the
   VPN-OAM reserved MAC address. We propose to treat Layer 2 VPN as a
   subset of VPLS, for the purpose of definition of VPN class header.

6.1.3 VPN Test Header (VTH)

   This is the common VPN test header. A VPN test header MUST be
   present in all VPN test packets.

6.1.4 Class Independent VPN Test Message (VTM):

   Class independent VPN test messages define class independent, well
   known VPN tests, such as liveliness test. There can be either, no,
   one, or more than one class independent VPN test messages per VPN
   test message.

   Class independent VPN test messages MUST be according to the VPN
   test message format specified below. The message content MUST be
   defined according to the specification of the VPN test message.

6.1.5 Class Specific VPN Test Message (CTM)

   The class specific VPN test message defines class specific VPN
   tests. There can be either, no, one, or more than one class
   independent VPN test messages per VPN test message.

   The class specific VPN test message MUST be according to the VPN
   test message format specified below. The Message content MUST be
   defined according to the specification of the VPN class test
   message.

6.1.6 User Defined VPN Test Messages (UTM)

   User defined VPN test messages are defined by the user and are
   considered out of scope in this document. However, user defined VPN
   test messages MUST be according to the VPN test message format
   specified below.
   Message Types 128-255 are reserved for user defined VPN test

6.3 VPN Test Message Type Codes:

   Message Type                 Description
         0                        Last Message Type
         1                        VPN Class Header
         2                        VPN Padding
         3                        VPN liveliness
         4                        Round Trip Delay
         5                        One-way Delay variation
         6-127                    TBD

          128-255                 Reserved For User defined Messages

     Comments:
       1. Need a different message type for query/response for each of
          the types (e.g. VPN-liveliness query and VPN-liveliness
          response).
       2. We can do VPN-liveliness / round-trip-delay / one-way-delay-
          variation with a single set of query/response messages.
       3. There is still work to do about how each measurement is
          performed and which specific fields are required for each
          measurement.
       4. Hello-protocol messages (query + response in the same
          message).

7. Security Considerations

   The methods presented in this document do not introduce any
   additional security risks on PE to PE side.

   It is recommended that implementation provide an optional policy for
   handling VPN test queries arriving on access ports. Absence of such

   a policy may lead to undefined behavior of VPN testability and may
   lead to exploitation of security infrastructure.
