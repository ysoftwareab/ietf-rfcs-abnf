1.  Introduction

   This document is aimed at presenting ANCP with a vendor specific
   protocol extension. GSMPv3 [1] which is used as foundation for the
   ANCP protocol [2] already has vendor specific functionality defined,
   but since ANCP defines new capability negotiations and only include
   few specific messages from GSMPv3, it is necessary to define a new
   vendor specific message handling for ANCP. 

   This proposal aims at collecting feedback from the ANCP community in 
   order to work towards consensus. Eventually, text derived from the 
   material in section 4. would be intended to be incorporated in the
   "ANCP Protocol I-D" [2].


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Vendor specific messages in GSMPv3

   GSMPv3 [1] defines vendor specific ranges for vendor private 
   extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol. GSMPv3 defines vendor specific
   ranges for the following functionalities:

      -  Message Type Name Space
      -  Label Type Name Space
      -  Failure Response Message Name Space
      -  Model Type Name Space 

   The one which could be interesting to ANCP, is the Message Type Name
   Space that GSMPv3 divides into four ranges as follows:

Internet-Draft      Vendor Specific Message for ANCP       February 2008


      -  Message Types 0-99.
              Message Types in this range are part of the GSMPv3 base
              protocol.  Message types in this range are allocated
              through an IETF consensus action [19].

      -  Message Types 100-199.
              Message Types in this range are Specification Required
              [19].  Message Types using this range must be documented
              in an RFC or other permanent and readily available
              references.

      -  Message Types 200-249.
              Message Types in this range are Specification Required
              [19] and are intended for Abstract and Resource Model
              Extension Messages.  Message Types using this range must
              be documented in an RFC or other permanent and readily
              available references.

      -  Message Types 250-255.
              Message Types in this range are reserved for vendor
              private extensions and are the responsibility of
              individual vendors.  IANA management of this range of the
              Message Type Name Space is unnecessary.


4.  Vendor specific messages in ANCP

   The proposal in this document is to define a new capability type for
   vendor specific data as part of the ANCP protocol capability 
   negotiations, and further more define a separate vendor specific 
   message extension.


4.1 Vendor Specific Capability Negotiation 

   Capability Type : Vendor-Specific Data = 0x06 (TBD)  

   Length (in bytes) : multiply of 4. 
   Every Enterprise with vendor specific data supported will add 4 
   bytes to the length field.

   Capability Data : list of Enterprise numbers.
   "Enterprise NumberN" is a vendor's Enterprise Number as registered
   with IANA [3].  It is a four-byte integer value in network byte-
   order.

4.2 Vendor Specific Extensions

   GSMPv3 [1] "Vendor Specific" message (type 255) MUST be used by 
   the BRAS and the Access Node to exchange vendor specific data
   as part of the ANCP protocol communication.

   The Vendor Specific message uses the GSMPv3 [1] basic defined
   message format as shown below:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Partition ID  |            Transaction Identifier             |

   |                                                               |
   ~                          Message Body                         ~
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   The Message body in the ANCP vendor specific message MUST follow
   the format shown below:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   .                                                               .
   .                                                               .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The Message Type for Vendor Specific messages is 255 (TBD).

   The one-byte Length field is the length of the data carried in the
   Message Body in bytes.  The length includes the length of the first
   Enterprise Number; the minimum length is 4 bytes.

   "Enterprise NumberN" is a vendor's Enterprise Number as registered
   with IANA [3].  It is a four-byte integer value in network byte-
   order. The Enterprise number used in the Vendor Specific message
   MUST match the numbers agreed upon in the capability negotiation.
   If an Enterprise number used in the Vendor Specific Message Body is
   different from the capability negotiations then the vendor specific
   data for this Enterprise number MAY silently be discard by the 
   receiver.

   DataLenN is the length of the data associated with the Enterprise
   Number.

   The Vendor Specific Data is an opaque sequence of bytes.

   The Vendor-Specific Message includes at least one Enterprise Number
   and carries opaque data defined by the organization identified by 
   the Enterprise Number. The ANCP end node, Access Node or BRAS, MAY
   include data associated with more than one vendor's Enterprise 
   Number within a single instance of the Vendor Specific Message.

   Of course, the Vendor-Specific data are vendor-specific. This
   specification does not establish any requirements on the data in the
   message. Vendors who make use of this message type are encouraged to
   document their usage in order to make interoperability possible.


5.  Security Considerations

   The BRAS and DSLAMs are implicitly in a trusted domain, so security 
   for vendor specific messages in ANCP do not put forth other security
   considerations not already mentioned in the ANCP Protocol draft [2].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new capability type as well as a new message
   type which need to be reserved with IANA, as part of the overall
   ANCP Protocol [2] IANA reservation.
