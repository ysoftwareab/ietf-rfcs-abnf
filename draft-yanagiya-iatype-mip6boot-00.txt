Abstract 
    
    When we use DHCPv6 to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 service, stateful DHCP 
   should be used to assign the home address. In [RFC3315], two types of 
   IA are specified: IA_NA and IA_TA. When stateful DHCPv6 is used in a 
   local network, the "care-of address" is carried as one of the IA_NA 
   options. On the other hand, when autoconfiguration [FRC2462] is used, 
   care-of address is generated on mobile node and there is no way to 
   assign home address stateful. Thus, we introduce a new IA type to 
   assign the home address.

1. Introduction 
   
    When we use DHCPv6 to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 service, stateful DHCP 
   should be used to assign the home address. In [RFC3315], two types of 
   IA are specified: IA_NA and IA_TA. When stateful DHCPv6 is used in a 
   local network, the "care-of address" is carried as one of the IA_NA 
   options. On the other hand, when autoconfiguration [FRC2462] is used, 
   care-of address is generated on mobile node and there is no way to 
   assign home address stateful. Thus, we introduce a new IA type to 
   assign the home address. 
 
    In this document we specify a new IA type for assigning the home 
   address. We describe DHCP options for assigning Mobile IPv6 
   bootstrapping information such as the home address and home agent∆s 
   address. 
 
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[1]. 
    
   Most of terms used in this draft are defined in Mobile IPv6[MIP6] 
   and RFC3315[RFC3315], RFC3633[RFC3633]. 
 
3. Background 
    
    In [RFC3315], two types of IA are specified for assigning the 
   address: IA_NA and IA_TA. When a mobile node is in a network where

Internet Draft  IA type for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping    May 20.2005 
 
 
   stateful DHCPv6 is used to assign the address (care-of address for 
   the mobile node), the mobile node can use the IA address option to 
   obtain the care-of address. The DHCP server may assign the home 
   address as one of the IAaddr-options. In that case, some issues 
   should be considered. 
    
   o For mobile node handoff to another attachment point, the mobile 
      node may use DHCP to obtain the new care-of address. At this time, 
      the mobile node has to change home address and home agent. 
   o The DHCPv6 server cannot maintain the state of the home address  
      explicitly. 
   o When DHCP is used in the home network, the mobile node can be 
      assigned the home address by means of several different options.  
    
   On the other hand, when IPv6 address autoconfiguration is used in a 
   local network, there is no IA type for obtaining home address.  
 
4. IA type and DHCP options for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping 
  4.1.   IA type for home address assignment 
    
    We introduce a new IA type to assign home network parameters such 
   as the home address and the IP address of the home agent. This IA 
   type is called IA_Home. 
    
  4.2.   IA_Home Option  
    
   The IA_Home option is used to carry the parameters that are used in 
   the home network.

     IAID         The unique identifier for this IA_Home; the 
                  IAID must be unique among the identifiers for all  
                  of this client's IA_Home options.   
                  The number space for IA_Home IAIDs is separate 
                  from the number space for IA_TA IAIDs and 
                  IA_NA IAIDs. 
    
     T1           The time at which the client contacts the server  
                  from which the address in the IA_Home 
                  was obtained to extend the lifetimes of the 
                  address assigned to the IA_Home; T1 is a  
                  time duration relative to the current time  
                  expressed in units of seconds. 
 
     T2           The time at which the client contacts any available  
                  server to extend the lifetimes of the addresses 
                  assigned to IA_Home; T2 is a time duration relative

     IA_Home-options  Options associated with this IA_Home. 
 
  4.3.     IA Home Address Option 
    
   The IA_Home_Address option is used to assign the home IPv6 address 
   associated with an IA_Home. The IA_Home_Address option must be 
   encapsulated in the IA_Home-options field of an IA_Home option.  The 
   IA_HoA-options field encapsulates those options that are specific to 
   the home address. The format of the IA Home Address option is:

   assign the IPv6 address of the home agent (HA) to the mobile node. 
   The IA_Home_Agent_Address option is encapsulated in the IA HoA-
   options field. The format of the Preference option is: 
   0                   1                   2                   3

    IPv6 address of HA    The IP address of the home agent with which 
                          the mobile node should register the Binding 
                          update. 
 
5. Security considerations 
    
    Secure delivery of the home agent∆s address and the home address 
   from a DHCP server to the mobile node (DHCP client) relies on the 
   overall DHCP security. The particular option defined in this draft 
   does not have any additional impact on DHCP security.
