                     draft-ietf-oauth-reciprocal-01

Abstract

   There are times when a user has a pair of protected resources that
   would like to request access to each other.  While OAuth flows
   typically enable the user to grant a client access to a protected
   resource, granting the inverse access requires an additional flow.
   Reciprocal OAuth enables a more seamless experience for the user to
   grant access to a pair of protected resources.

1.  Introduction

   In the usual three legged, authorization code grant, the OAuth flow
   enables a resource owner (user) to enable a client (party A) to be
   granted authorization to access a protected resource (party B).  If
   party A also has a protected resource that the user would like to let
   party B access, then a second complete OAuth flow, but in the reverse
   direction, must be performed.  In practice, this is a complicated
   user experience as the user is at Party A, but the OAuth flow needs
   to start from Party B.  This requires the second flow to send the
   user back to party B, which then sends the user to Party A as the
   first step in the flow.  At the end, the user is at Party B, even
   though the original flow started at Party A.

   Reciprocal OAuth simplifies the user experience by eliminating the
   redirections in the second OAuth flow.  After the intial OAuth flow,
   party A obtains consent from the user to grant party B access to a
   protected resource at party A, and then passes an authorization code
   to party B using the access token party A obtained from party B to
   provide party B the context of the user.  Party B then exchanges the
   authorization code for an access token per the usual OAuth flow.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Reciprocal Scope Request

   When party B is providing an access token response per [RFC6749]
   4.1.4, 4.2.1, 4.3.3 or 4.4.3, party B MAY include an additional query
   component in the redirection URI to indicate the scope requested in
   the reciprocal grant.

   reciprocal OPTIONAL.  The scope of party B's reciprocal access
   request per [RFC6749] 3.3.

   If party B does not provide a reciprocal parameter in the access
   token response, the reciprocal scope will be a value previously
   preconfigured by party A and party B.

   If an authorization code grant access token response per [RFC6749]
   4.1.4, an example successful response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {
      "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
      "token_type":"example",
      "expires_in":3600,
      "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
      "reciprocal":"example_scope",
      "example_parameter":"example_value"
    }

   If an authorization code grant access token response per [RFC6749]
   4.2.2, an example successful response (with extra line breaks for
   display purposes only):

    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://example.com/cb#
        access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&
        state=xyz&token_type=example&
        expires_in=3600&
        reciprocal="example_scope"

3.  Reciprocal Authorization Flow

   The reciprocal authorization flow starts after the client (party A)
   has obtained an access token from the authorization server (party B)
   per [RFC6749] 4.1 Authorization Code Grant.

3.1.  User Consent

   Party A obtains consent from the user to grant Party B access to
   protected resources at party A.  The consent represents the scopes
   party B had preconfigured at party A.

3.2.  Reciprocal Authorization Code

   Party A generates an authorization code representing the access
   granted to party B by the user.  Party A then makes a request to
   party B's token endpoint authenticating per [RFC6749] 2.3 and sending
   the following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded" format per [RFC6749] Appendix B with a character encoding
   of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body:

   grant_type REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:reciprocal".

Internet-Draft              Reciprocal OAuth                October 2018


   code REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by party A.

   client_id REQUIRED, party A'a client ID.

   access_token REQUIRED, the access token obtained from Party B.  Used
   to provide user context.

   For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using TLS
   (with extra line breaks for display purposes only):

 POST /token HTTP/1.1
 Host: server.example.com
 Authorization: Basic ej4hsyfishwssjdusisdhkjsdksusdhjkjsdjk
 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

 grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3reciprocal&code=hasdyubasdjahsbdkjbasd&client_id=example.com&access_token=sadadojsadlkjasdkljxxlkjdas

   Party B MUST verify the authentication provided by Party A per
   [RFC6749] 2.3

   Party B MUST then verify the access token was granted to the client
   identified by the client_id.

   Party B MUST respond with either an HTTP 200 (OK) response if the
   request is valid, or an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" if it is not.

   Party B then plays the role of the client to make an access token
   request per [RFC6749] 4.1.3.

4.  Authorization Update Flow

   After the initial authorization, the user may add or remove scopes
   available to the client at the authorization server.  For example,
   the user may grant additional scopes to the client using a voice
   interface, or revoke some scopes.  The authorization server can
   update the client with the new authorization by sending a new
   authorization code per 3.2.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.
