              Figure 1: MASQUE Authentication Format Example

   When the server receives this CONNECT request, it verifies the
   signature and if that fails responds with code "405 Method Not
   Allowed", making sure its response is the same as what it would
   return for any unexpected CONNECT request.  If the signature
   verifies, the server responds with code "101 Switching Protocols",
   and from then on this HTTP stream is now dedicated to the MASQUE
   protocol.  That protocol provides a reliable bidirectional message
   exchange mechanism, which is used by the client and server to
   negotiate what protocol options are supported and enabled by policy,
   and client VPN configuration such as IP addresses.  When using QUIC,
   this protocol also allows endpoints to negotiate the use of QUIC
   extensions, such as support for the DATAGRAM extension
   [I-D.pauly-quic-datagram].
