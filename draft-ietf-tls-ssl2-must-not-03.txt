Abstract 

   This document requires that when TLS clients and servers establish 
   connections that they never negotiate the use of Secure Sockets Layer 
   (SSL) version 2.0.  This document updates the backward compatibility 
   sections found in the Transport Security Layer (TLS).

1. Introduction 

   Many protocols specified in the IETF rely on Transport Layer Security 
   (TLS) [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2] for security services.  This is a good 
   thing, but some TLS clients and servers also support negotiating the 
   use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0 [SSL2]; however, this 
   version does not provide the expected level of security. SSL version 
   2.0 has known deficiencies. This document describes those 
   deficiencies, and it requires TLS clients and servers never negotiate 
   the use of SSL version 2.0. 

   This document updates the backward compatibility sections found in 
   TLS [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119]. 

2. SSL 2.0 Deficiencies 

   SSL version 2.0 [SSL2] deficiencies include: 

   o Message authentication uses MD5 [MD5].  Most security-aware users 
     have already moved away from any use of MD5 
     [I-D.turner-md5-seccon-update]. 

   o Handshake messages are not protected.  This permits a man-in-the-
     middle to trick the client into picking a weaker cipher suite than 
     they would normally choose. 

   o Message integrity and message encryption use the same key, which is 
     a problem if the client and server negotiate a weak encryption 
     algorithm.

   o Sessions can be easily terminated.  A man-in-the-middle can easily 
     insert a TCP FIN to close the session and the peer is unable to 
     determine whether or not it was a legitimate end of the session. 

3. Changes to TLS 

   Because of the deficiencies noted in the previous section: 

   o TLS clients MUST NOT negotiate or use SSL 2.0. 

   o TLS clients MUST NOT send SSL 2.0 CLIENT-HELLO messages. 

   o TLS servers MUST NOT negotiate or use SSL 2.0. 

   As described in TLSv1.2 ([TLS1.2] Appendix E.2), TLS servers that do 
   not support SSL 2.0 MAY accept version 2.0 CLIENT-HELLO messages as 
   the first message of a TLS handshake for interoperability with old 
   clients. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This entire document is about security considerations.
