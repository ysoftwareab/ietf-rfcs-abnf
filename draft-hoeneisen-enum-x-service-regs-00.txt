Internet-Draft    Eperimental Enumservice Registrations         Mar 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a guide to the creation of new IANA
   registrations of experimental Enumservices.  This document aims to
   enhance section 3 of RFC 3761 [2], where the registration procedure
   for Enumservices was initially documented at a high level.  It
   further complements the Guide and Template for IANA Registrations of
   Enumservices [3].

   The Experimental Enumservice registration is intended to allow people
   to use the normal Enumservice template to describe what X-
   Enumservice strings exist in NAPTRs and to describe how they are
   used, but not (yet) to require a full IETF review and change control.

   This is needed as some trials use URL schemes that are not
   registered, and so cannot be used in Standards Track Enumservice
   registrations.  Also, until trials have been completed, it may not be
   appropriate to produce a Standards Track document, as Enumservice
   syntax details, use and issues of security / privacy may not have
   been analysed fully at that point.

   For the purpose of this document, 'registration document' and
   'registration' refers to an Internet Draft proposing the IANA
   registration of an experimental Enumservice following the procedures
   outlined above.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Required Sections and Information

   A document for registration of experimental is similar to a ordinary
   Enumservice registration as described in Guide and Template for IANA
   Registrations of Enumservices [3] except for the following:

   o  Enumservice Name:

         The Service name contains the string experimental, or it is
         prefixed with "X-"

         e.g.  "X-Foo"

Internet-Draft    Eperimental Enumservice Registrations         Mar 2007


   o  Enumservice Type:

         The Type MUST be prefixed with "x-".

         e.g. "x-foo"

   o  URI Schemes:

         The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [5] Schemes, which are
         used with an experimental Enumservice do not necessarily need
         to be documented in an IETF document.  In case there is no
         publically referencable document, the URI Scheme MUST be
         described in the registration document.

   o  Functional Specification:

         This section quite depends on how much publically available
         documentation about the service already exists.

   o  Intended Usage:

         For the Intended Usage RFC 3761 [2] is extended with
         "EXPERIMENTAL", "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL".  One of those is to be
         used.

         e.g.  "TRIAL"


4.  Expert Review

   A new experimental Enumservice MUST undergo Expert Review before
   publication.  This expert review will include an initial evaluation
   of whether this specification will have issues in transferring to a
   Standards Track document (for example, if it uses an unregistered URL
   scheme, or that the security and privacy analysis is incomplete at
   this stage).

   It will also indicate whether the use of this Enumservice will clash
   with any others or cause damage to other compliant ENUM components,
   and should be used only in private configurations where all involved
   components are aware of its use.

   The results of such an expert review should be appended to the
   specification and will be recorded along with the specification
   itself.

   However, the exact procedure is to be defined.

5.  Security Considerations

   Since this document does not introduce any technology or protocol,
   there are no security issues to be considered for this memo itself.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces three new strings for Intended Usage as
   defined in RFC 3761 [2].  These new strings are: "EXPERIMENTAL",
   "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL".  The revision of RFC 3761 [2] RFC3761bis [4]
   shall contain the new string.  In case the revision is not yet ready
   at publication time of this memo, an intermediary regime needs to be
   defined.

   An IANA Registry for experimental Enumservices is to be defined.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   [RFC Editor: This section should be empty before publication]
   o  Sync with RFC3761bis: e.g.  Intended Usage "EXPERIMENTAL",
      "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL"
   o  Is there a need for "duration of Registration?"
   o  Define process for Expert Review
   o  Will there be an additional (IANA) Registry or just use the same
      IANA Registy as for ordinary Enumservice registrations?"
   o  Require a first Security analyses for trial registrations?
