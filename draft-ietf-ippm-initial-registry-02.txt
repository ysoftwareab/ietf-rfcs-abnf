1.  Introduction

   Note: Efforts to synchronize structure and terminology with
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] will likely be incomplete until both
   drafts are stable.

   This memo proposes an initial set of entries for the Performance
   Metric Registry.  It uses terms and definitions from the IPPM
   literature, primarily [RFC2330].  Proponents of Passive Performance
   Metrics are encouraged to develop a similar document.

   Although there are several standard templates for organizing
   specifications of performance metrics (see [RFC2679] for an example
   of the traditional IPPM template, based to large extent on the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group's traditional template in
   [RFC1242], and see [RFC6390] for a similar template), none of these
   templates were intended to become the basis for the columns of an

   IETF-wide registry of metrics.  While examinating aspects of metric
   specifications which need to be registered, it became clear that none
   of the existing metric templates fully satisfies the particular needs
   of a registry.

   Therefore, [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] defines the overall format
   for a Performance Metric Registry.  Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] also gives guidelines for those
   requesting registration of a Metric, that is the creation of entry(s)
   in the Performance Metric Registry: "In essence, there needs to be
   evidence that a candidate Registered Performance Metric has
   significant industry interest, or has seen deployment, and there is
   agreement that the candidate Registered Performance Metric serves its
   intended purpose."  The process in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry]
   also requires that new entries are administered by IANA through
   Expert Review, which will ensure that the metrics are tightly
   defined.

2.  Scope

   This document defines the initial set of Performance Metrics Registry
   entries, for which IETF approval (following development in the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group) will satisfy the
   requirement for Expert Review.  Note that all are Active Performance
   Metrics, which are based on RFCs prepared in the IPPM working group
   of the IETF, according to their framework [RFC2330] and its updates.

3.  Registry Categories and Columns

   This section provides the categories and columns of the registry, for
   easy reference.  An entry (row) therefore gives a complete
   description of a Registered Metric.

4.  UDP Round-trip Latency Registry Entry

   This section gives an initial registry entry for the UDP Round-trip
   Latency.

   Note: Each Registry entry only produces a "raw" output or a
   statistical summary.  To describe both "raw" and one or more
   statistics efficiently, the Identifier, Name, and Output Categories
   can be split and this section can become two or more closely-related
   metrics.  See Section 7 for an example specifying multiple Registry
   entries with many common columns.

4.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entry: the
   element ID and metric name.

4.1.4.  Description

   This metric assesses the delay of a stream of packets exchanged
   between two hosts (which are the two measurement points), and the
   Output is the Round-trip delay for all successfully exchanged packets
   expressed as the 95th percentile of their conditional delay
   distribution.

   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

4.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>



Morton, et al.             Expires May 2, 2017                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                October 2016


   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between Src
   and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric tightens
   the definition further to recognize that the host in the "Src" role
   will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately receive the
   corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to
   the value of Round-trip delay in metric definitions and methods.  The
   variable "dT" has been re-used in other IPPM literature to refer to
   different quantities, and cannot be used as a global variable name.

4.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   <list and specify Fixed Parameters, input factors that must be
   determined and embedded in the measurement system for use when
   needed>

   Type-P as defined in Section 13 of [RFC2330]:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  TTL: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 17 (UDP)

   o  IPv6 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  Hop Count: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 17 (UDP)

   o  UDP header values:

      *  Checksum: the checksum MUST be calculated

   o  UDP Payload

   Other measurement parameters:

   o  Tmax: a loss threshold waiting time

      *  3.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
         decimal64 with fraction digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of
         [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with
         lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
         section 6 of [RFC5905].

4.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

4.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Tmax defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the RTT value MAY enforce the Tmax threshold on
   stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for
   details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values
   of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis
   choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-ambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the
   format of sequence numbers and time-stamps, if they are conveyed in
   the packet payload.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which MUST be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

4.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be described by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <section/specification references, and description of any new
   generation parameters, if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of [RFC2330] provides three methods to generate
   Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the average
   packet spacing, thus the Run-time Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda = 1/
   lambda, in seconds.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 SHALL be used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Run-time Parameter, Trunc), and the Src sends each packet at the
   computed times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

4.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   The measured results based on a filtered version of the packets
   observed, and this section provides the filter details (when
   present).

4.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf a time, the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a end time date is ignored and
      Tf is interpreted as the Duration of the measurement interval.

   Reciprocal_lambda  average packet interval for Poisson Streams
      expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
      decimal64 with fraction digits = 5 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020])
      with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless
      conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of
      [RFC5905].

      0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless conversion to/from the
      32-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of [RFC5905] (values above
      this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value). (if fixed,
      Trunc = 30.0000 seconds.)

   >>> should Poisson run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if
   modeling a specific version of MBA tests.

4.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src  launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
      Dst.

   Dst  waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to Src.

4.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

4.4.1.  Type

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value corresponding to the 95th percentile, as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of Round-trip delay for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   Round-trip delay values in the conditional distribution.  See section
   11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic
   using the EDF.

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].

   Tf the end of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].

   Raw -- REMOVED IN VERSION 01

   For Act_IP_UDP_Round-trip_Delay_Poisson_95th-percentile:

   95Percentile  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction
      digits = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of
      0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from
      the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

4.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The 95th Percentile of Round-trip Delay is expressed in seconds.

4.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

5.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

5.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   See section 2.6 and 3.6 of [RFC3393] for general singleton element
   calculations.  This metric entry requires implementation of the PDV
   form defined in section 4.2 of [RFC5481].  Also see measurement
   considerations in section 8 of [RFC5481].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet
   arrival.  Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a
   packet lost.  Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined
   delay.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival
   within Tmax.  Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process
   which calculates the one-way delay value MAY enforce the Tmax
   threshold on stored values before calculations.  See section 4.1 of
   [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude
   undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully-arriving
   packet.  Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-ambiguate
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime parameters are passed to
   that process.  The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the
   format of sequence numbers and time-stamps, if they are conveyed in
   the packet payload.

5.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of [RFC2330] provides three methods to generate
   Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the average
   packet spacing, thus the Run-time Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda = 1/
   lambda, in seconds.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 SHALL be used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Run-time Parameter, Trunc), and the Src sends each packet at the
   computed times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the
   Poisson distribution.  A random value greater than Trunc is set equal
   to Trunc instead.

   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds (for Poisson Streams).
      lambda = 1 packet per second

   o  Upper limit on Poisson distribution (values above this limit will
      be clipped and set to the limit value).  Upper limit = 30 seconds.

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile",
   is the smallest value of one-way PDV for which the Empirical
   Distribution Function (EDF), F(95Percentile) >= 95% of the singleton
   one-way PDV values in the conditional distribution.  See section 11.3

   EDF.

5.4.2.  Reference Definition

   <the output type and data format for each type of result>

   T0 the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3 of
      [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of

5.4.3.  Metric Units

   <insert units for the measured results, and the reference
   specification>.

   The 95th Percentile of one-way PDV is expressed in seconds.

5.4.4.  Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the
   systematic and random errors of a time measurement.  In-situ
   calibration could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes
   as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g.,
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention.
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for
   measurement).  In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the
   source and destination are needed to estimate the systematic error
   due to imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are
   smoothed, thus the random variation is not usually represented in the
   results).

   time_offset  The time value of the result is expressed in units of
      seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits
      = 9 (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001
      seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit
      NTP timestamp as per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905]

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a
   normal measurement with additional indication that it is a
   calibration result.  In any measurement, the measurement function
   SHOULD report its current estimate of time offset as an indicator of
   the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be
   used to estimate the *available accuracy* of the Output Metric Units.
   For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the Output result resolution which is the result of system
   noise, and thus inaccurate.

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-value sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample are
   defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For DNS Response Latency, the entities in [RFC1035] must be mapped to
   [RFC2681].  The Local Host with its User Program and Resolver take
   the role of "Src", and the Foreign Name Server takes the role of
   "Dst".

   Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between Src
   and Dst at T" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric
   tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in the
   "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
   receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
   lost).

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section

   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Timeout defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The method requires sequence numbers or other send-order information
   to be retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-
   ambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.  Sequence number is part of
   the payload described under Fixed Parameters.

   DNS Messages bearing Queries provide for random ID Numbers, so more
   than one query may be launched while a previous request is
   outstanding when the ID Number is used.

   IF a DNS response does not arrive within Tmax, the result is
   undefined.  The Message ID SHALL be used to disambiguate the
   successive queries.

   >>> This would require support of ID generation and population in the
   Message.  An alternative would be to use a random Source port on the
   Query Message, but we would choose ONE before proceding.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which shall be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

6.3.2.  Packet Generation Stream

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet rate, thus the Run-time Parameter is 1/lambda.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 is used, where given a start time (Run-time Parameter), the
   subsequent send times are all computed prior to measurement by
   computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-packet send times,
   (truncating the distribution as specified in the Run-time
   Parameters), and the Src sends each packet at the computed times.

7.  UDP Poisson One-way Delay Registry Entries

   This section gives an initial registry entry for the UDP Poisson One-
   way Delay.

   Note: Each Registry "Name" below specifies a single registry entry,
   whose output format varies according to a component of the name that
   specifies one form of statistical summary.

   IANA is asked to assign a different numeric identifiers to each Name.
   All column entries beside the Summary and Output categories are the
   same, thus this section proposes five closely-related registry
   entries.  As a result, IANA is also asked to assign corresponding
   URIs and URLs.

7.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

7.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

7.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-One-way-Delay-
   Poisson-Stream in section 3.6 of [RFC2679] and section 4.6 of
   [RFC2679] using the Type-P and Timeout defined under Fixed
   Parameters.

   The method requires sequence numbers or other send-order information
   to be retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-
   ambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.  Sequence number is part of
   the TWAMP payload described under Fixed Parameters.

7.3.2.  Packet Generation Stream

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals.  The reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet rate, thus the Run-time Parameter is 1/lambda.

   Method 3 or equivalent SHALL used, where given a start time (Run-time
   Parameter), the subsequent send times are all computed prior to
   measurement by computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-
   packet send times, (truncating the distribution as specified in the
   Run-time Parameters), and the Src sends each packet at the computed
   times.

7.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   o  Src, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905]).  When T0 is "all-zeros", a
      start time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the
      Duration of the measurement interval.

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905]), interpreted as the Duration of the
      measurement interval.

   o  1/lambda, average packet rate (for Poisson Streams).  (1/lambda =
      1 packet per second, if fixed)

   o  Upper limit on Poisson distribution (values above this limit will
      be clipped and set to the limit value). (if fixed, Upper limit =
      30 seconds.)

   The format for 1/lambda and Upper limit of Poisson Dist.  are the
   short format in [RFC5905] (32 bits) and is as follows: the first 16
   bits represent the integer number of seconds; the next 16 bits
   represent the fractional part of a second.

   >>> should Poisson run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if
   modeling a specific version of tests.  Note in the NAME, i.e.

7.4.2.1.  Percentile95

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional
   distribution of all packets with a finite value of One-way delay
   (undefined delays are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic
   streams using associated parameters.

   o  incT, the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit

   o  dT, the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times

   o  T0, the actual start time

   NOTE: an initiation process with a number of control exchanges
   resulting in unpredictable start times (within a time interval) may
   be sufficient to avoid synchronization of periodic streams, and
   therefore a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random
   from a fixed interval.

   These stream parameters will be specified as Run-time parameters.

8.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   NA

8.3.4.  Sampling Distribution

   NA

8.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   o  Src, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905]).  When T0 is "all-zeros", a
      start time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the
      Duration of the measurement interval.

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905]), interpreted as the Duration of the
      measurement interval.

   o  incT, the nominal duration of inter-packet interval, first bit to
      first bit

   o  dT, the duration of the interval for allowed sample start times

   The format for incT and dT are the short format in [RFC5905] (32
   bits) and is as follows: the first 16 bits represent the integer
   number of seconds; the next 16 bits represent the fractional part of
   a second.

   >>> should Periodic run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if
   modeling a specific version of tests.  Note in the NAME, i.e.
   Poisson3.3

8.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src - launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
   Dst. This is the TWAMP Session-Sender.

   Dst - waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to
   Src. This is the TWAMP Session-Reflector.

8.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

8.4.1.  Type/Value (two diff terms used)

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   See subsection titles in Data Format for Types.

8.4.2.  Data Format

   <describe the data format for each type of result>

   For all output types ---

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905])

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905])

8.4.2.1.  95Percentile

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional
   distribution of all packets with a finite value of One-way delay
   (undefined delays are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95.

   Data format is a 32-bit signed value, *similar to* the 32-bit short
   NTP Time format in Section 6 of [RFC5905] and is as follows: the
   first 16 bits represent the *signed* integer number of seconds; the
   next 16 bits represent the fractional part of a second.

   The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a
   positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see

   ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as
   per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905].

8.4.2.2.  Mean

   The mean SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.2.2 of [RFC6049] for details on calculating this
   statistic, and 4.2.3 of [RFC6049].

   The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a
   positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see
   section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0
   ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as
   per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905].

8.4.2.3.  Min

   The minimum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for details on calculating this
   statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].

   The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a
   positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see
   section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0
   ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as
   per section 6 of RFC [RFC5905].

8.4.2.4.  Max

   The maximum SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of One-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded), a single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3.2 of [RFC6049] for a closely related method for
   calculating this statistic, and 4.3.3 of [RFC6049].  The formula is
   as follows:

            Max = (FiniteDelay [j])

                  such that for some index, j, where 1 <= j <= N
                  FiniteDelay[j] >= FiniteDelay[n] for all n

   The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a
   positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see
   section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0
   ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as

10.1.9.  Reference Specification(s)

   [RFC3611][RFC4566][RFC6776][RFC6792][RFC7003]

10.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.  Section 3.2 of
   [RFC7003] provides the reference information for this category.

10.2.1.  Reference Definition

   Packets Discarded in Bursts:

   The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.  The
   measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value exceeds
   0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-
   range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the value
   0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.

10.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Threshold: 8 bits, set to value = 3 packets.

   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e., the number of
   successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and following
   a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to be regarded as
   part of a gap.  Note that the Threshold is set in accordance with the
   Gmin calculation defined in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC3611].

   Interval Metric flag: 2 bits, set to value 11=Cumulative Duration

   This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard metrics
   are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:




Morton, et al.             Expires May 2, 2017                 [Page 52]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                October 2016


   I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the most
   recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics
   reports.

   I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
   accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

   Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01.

10.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.  For the Burst/Gap Discard
   Metric, it appears that the only guidance on methods of measurement
   is in Section 3.0 of [RFC7003] and its supporting references.
   Relevant information is repeated below, although there appears to be
   no section titled "Method of Measurement" in [RFC7003].

10.3.1.  Reference Method

   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  Measurements of these metrics are made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics
   block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes
   measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).

   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the
   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this metrics block.  If not, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

10.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Since RTCP-XR Measurements are conducted on live RTP traffic, the
   complete description of the stream is contained in SDP messages that
   proceed the establishment of a compatible stream between two or more
   communicating hosts.  See Run-time Parameters, below.

10.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.

   o  Value: Packets Discarded in Bursts

   o  Data Format: 24 bits

   o  Reference: Section 3.2 of [RFC7003]

10.3.4.  Metric Units

   The measured results are apparently expressed in packets, although
   there is no section of [RFC7003] titled "Metric Units".

10.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   SDP Parameters: As defined in [RFC4566]

   Session description v= (protocol version number, currently only 0)

11.  Revision History

   This section may be removed for publication.  It contains partial
   information on updtes.

   This draft replaced draft-mornuley-ippm-initial-registry.

   In version 02, Section 4 has been edited to reflect recent discussion
   on the ippm-list: * Removed the combination or "Raw" and left 95th
   percentile. * Hanging Indent on Run-time parameters (Fixed parameters
   use bullet lists and other indenting formats. * Payload format for
   measurement has been removed. * Explanation of Conditional delay
   distribution.

   Version 03 addressed Phil Eardley's comments and suggestions in
   sections 1-4. and resolved the definition of Percentiles.

   Version 04 * All section 4 parameters reference YANG types for
   alternate data formats. * Discussion has concluded that usecase(s)
   for machine parse-able registry columns are not needed.

   Still need: * suggestion of standard naming format for parameters.

   Note: lambda parameter description is correct in section 4, elsewhere
   needs fix.

12.  Security Considerations

   These registry entries represent no known security implications for
   Internet Security.  Each referenced Metric contains a Security
   Considerations section.

13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to populate The Performance Metric Registry defined
   in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] with the values defined above.

   <more is needed here>

14.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo, for identifying the IPFIX metric
   with Flow Key as an example, and for many other productive
   suggestions.  Thanks to Peter Koch, who provided several useful
   suggestions for disambiguating successive DNS Queries in the DNS
   Response time metric.
