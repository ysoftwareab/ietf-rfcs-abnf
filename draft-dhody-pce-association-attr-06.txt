     Path Computation Element communication Protocol extension for
                relationship between LSPs and Attributes
                  draft-dhody-pce-association-attr-06

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).

   This document defines a mechanism to create associations between a
   set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration
   parameters).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
   configuration parameters) and is equally applicable to the active and
   passive modes of a stateful PCE and a stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
   LSPs with a set of attributes.

   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of
   MPLS-TE and GMPLS tunnels.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the
   active stateful PCE model, without the need for local configuration
   on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.  The mechanism
   described in this document is equally applicable to these deployment
   models.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   AAG:  Attribute Association Group.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multi-protocol Label Switching.

   PAG:  Policy Association Group.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

3.  Motivation

   This section discusses in more detail the motivation and use cases
   for such an association including but not limited to -

3.1.  Opaque Identifier

   An opaque identifier may represent attributes such as configured
   parameters or constraints that a PCEP speaker may invoke on a peer.
   Thus a PCEP speaker may only need an opaque identifier to invoke
   these attributes (parameters or constraints) rather than encoding
   them explicitly in each PCEP message.

   This can also be used for tagging bunch of LSP to a particular
   customer or for creation of virtual network like in case of
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN)
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-requirements].  (See
   [I-D.leedhody-pce-vn-association])

3.2.  Bundled requests

   In some scenarios(e.g.,the topology example described in Section 4.6
   of [RFC6805]), there is a need to send multiple requests with the
   same constraints and attributes to the PCE.  Currently these requests
   are either sent in a separate path computation request (PCReq)
   messages or bundled together in one (or more) PCReq messages.  In
   either case, the constraints and attributes need to be encoded
   separately for each request even though they are exactly identical.

   If a association is used to identify these constraints and attributes
   shared by multiple requests and grouped together via association
   mechanism, thus simplifying the path computation message exchanges.

4.  Overview

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], LSPs are associated with
   other LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common
   association group.  This grouping can then be used to define
   associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set
   of attributes (such as configuration parameters).  A new optional
   Association Object-type is defined based on the generic Association
   object -

   o  Attribute Association Group (AAG)

   Thus this document defines a new association type called "Attribute
   Association Type" of value TBD1.  An AAG can have one or more LSPs
   and its associated attributes.  The scope and handling of AAG
   identifier is similar to the generic association identifier defined
   in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

Internet-Draft                 ASSOC-ATTR                     March 2017


   One or more LSP are grouped via a single group identifier as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  The attributes that may be
   associated with this set of LSPs may either are -

   o  known to the PCEP peers via some external means like
      configuration, policy enforcement etc (can be considered as 'out-
      of-band').  PCEP speaker simply use the AAG identifier in the PCEP
      message and the peer is supposed to be aware of the associated
      attributes.  This is suitable for stateless PCE where the PCEP
      peers should be aware of the association and its significance
      outside of the protocol.

   o  or communicated to the PCEP peer via PCEP itself on first use (can
      be considered as 'in-band').  PCEP speaker creates a new AAG by
      using a new identifier and the associated attributes are
      communicated via TLVs in association object.  This is applicable
      for stateful PCE only.

   Error handling would be taken up in future revision.

   The format of the generic Association object used for AAG is shown in
   Figure 1:

                   Figure 2: ATTRIBUTE-OBJECT-TLV format

   The type of the TLV is TBD2 and it has a variable length.  The value
   part consist of a 32-bit Flag filed followed by a PCEP object
   (including common header [RFC5440] identifying the object) that is
   associated with this AAG.

   Following Flags are defined:

      R (Remove - 1 bit): This is set to indicate that the attribute is
      being removed from the attribute-list.

      M (Modify - 1 bit): This is set to indicate that a previous
      attribute is being modified, and the peer should overwrite the
      attribute with the new value as per the object-body.

   This TLV identifies the attributes associated with this group.  For
   each attribute a separate TLV is used.  Future PCEP message exchanges
   may only carry the AAG with no ATTRIBUTE-OBJECT-TLV.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new types for association and a new
   ATTRIBUTE-OBJECT-TLV which do not add any new security concerns
   beyond those discussed in [RFC5440], [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] in itself.

   Some deployments may find the associations and their implications as
   extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like TCP-AO or [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps].

   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry to manage the Flag field of
   the ATTRIBUTE-OBJECT-TLV.  New values are to be assigned by Standards
   Action [RFC5226].  Each bit should be tracked with the following
   qualities:

   o  Bit number (counting from bit 0 as the most significant bit)

   o  Capability description

   o  Defining RFC
