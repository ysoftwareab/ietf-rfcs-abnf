1.  Introduction

   [RFC2675] defines the IPv6 Jumbo Payload Option, which enables
   Jumbograms, IPv6 datagrams that carry a payload greater than 65,535
   octets.  Jumbograms have seen little deployment in the open Internet
   and there are currently no known active Internet deployments.

   Note: "Jumboframe" is a commonly term that is used to describe frames
   that exceed 1500 bytes in length, and is different to an IPv6 Jumbo
   Payload Option, or Jumbogram.

   When published, this document changes the status of RFC2675 to
   historic.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Rationale

   Jumbograms have seen little deployment, A Roadmap for Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP) Specification Documents ([RFC7414]) explains
   some of the protocol reasons behind this:

   "This document states that jumbograms are to only be used when it can be
    guaranteed that all receiving nodes, including each router in the
    end-to-end path, will support jumbograms.  If even a single node that does
    not support jumbograms is attached to a local network, then no host on
    that network may use jumbograms.  This explains why jumbogram use has been
    rare, and why this document is considered a performance optimization and
    not part of TCP over IPv6's basic functionality."

   Over time, the IPv6 Node Requirements document series has reported on
   the deployment of Jumbograms, as follows:

   *  RFC4294: "IPv6 Jumbograms "[RFC-2675]" MAY be supported."

   *  RFC6434: "To date, few implementations exist, and there is
      essentially no reported experience from usage."

   *  RFC8504: "Removed Jumbograms (RFC 2675) as they aren't deployed."

   This document removes support for Jumbograms, and therefore paves the
   way for the removal of their support from operating system stacks.
   This also removes the need for testing Jumbogram support, which
   otherwise require links with a MTU greater than 65,535 bytes, making
   testing of implementations impractical without significant effort.

4.  RFCs Referencing Jumbograms

   This section summarises document in the RFC series that mention
   support for IPv6 Jumbograms.

   The Jumbo option is mentioned in a set of documents:

   *  Protocols that consider the larger possible sized enabled by
      Jumbograms, for encryption ciphers (AES [RFC3686] and [RFC4309]).

   *  Protocols that are unable to support Jumbograms, due to their
      increased length (SRTP [RFC3711] and ROHC [RFC5225]).

   *  Protocols that consider the jumbogram option field as a possible
      length format (IPFIX [RFC5102], IPv6 transition [RFC8468]).

   TCP specifications have also refered to Jumbograms.  Adding support
   for TCP jumbograms required modification to the Maximum Segment Size
   and Urgent Pointer fields to interpret a value of 65,535 as infinite.
   These modifications resulted in references to [RFC2675] in several
   TCP Documents ([RFC4614], [RFC6691], [RFC7323], [RFC7414]) and the
   TCP Roadmap [RFC7414], which describes the fundamental changes to TCP
   required to support Jumbograms.

   UDP Usage Guidlines [RFC8085] refers to Jumbogram support for large
   unfragmentable datagrams:

   "IPv6 allows the option of transmitting large packets ("jumbograms")
   without fragmentation when all link layers along the path support this
   [RFC2675]."

   References also appear in documents that acknowledge the existence of
   the jumbo option, but do not define new mechanisms.  Jumbograms are
   mentioned in IPv6 node requirements [RFC4294], UDP Guidelines
   [RFC5405] (histroric), IPv6 Avian Carriers [RFC6214], IPv6 node
   requirements [RFC6434], DTN convergence [RFC7122].

   If published, this document changes the status of RFC2675 to
   historic.  Use of Jumbograms will no longer be specified as an IETF
   mechanism for use with these IETF-specified protocols.

5.  Security Considerations

   XXX security considerations XXX

   The security considerations for in RFC2675 state: "The Jumbo Payload
   option and TCP/UDP jumbograms do not introduce any known new security
   concerns".

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   Relevant quotes from PS and BCP documents that reference [RFC2675].

   Using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Counter Mode With IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) ([RFC3686]):

   "This construction can produce enough key stream for each packet
   sufficient to handle any IPv6 jumbogram [JUMBO]."

   "Note that ESP with 32- bit Sequence Numbers will not exceed 2^64
   blocks even if all of the packets are maximum-length IPv6 jumbograms
   [JUMBO]."

   "A 28-bit block counter value is sufficient for the generation of a key
   stream to encrypt the largest possible IPv6 jumbogram [JUMBO]; however,
   a 32-bit field is used.  This size is convenient for both hardware and
   software implementations."

   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) ([RFC3711]):

   "The AES has a block size of 128 bits, so 2^16 output blocks are
   sufficient to generate the 2^23 bits of keystream needed to encrypt the
   largest possible RTP packet (except for IPv6 "jumbograms" `[RFC2675]`,
   which are not likely to be used for RTP-based multimedia traffic)."

   Using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) CCM Mode with IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) ([RFC4309]):

   "L  L indicates the size of the length field in octets.  CCM defines
       values of L between 2 octets and 8 octets.  This specification only
       supports L = 4.  Implementations MUST support an L value of 4
       octets, which accommodates a full Jumbogram [JUMBO]; however, the
       length includes all of the encrypted data, which also includes the
       ESP Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields."

   "payload
       The payload of the ESP packet.  The payload MUST NOT be longer than
       4,294,967,295 octets, which is the maximum size of a Jumbogram
       [JUMBO]; however, the ESP Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header
       fields are also part of the payload."

   "This construction provides more key stream for each packet than is
   needed to handle any IPv6 Jumbogram [JUMBO]."

   Information Model for IP Flow Information Export ([RFC5102],
   Obsolete):

   "5.4.30.  payloadLengthIPv6

      Description:
        This Information Element reports the value of the Payload
        Length field in the IPv6 header.  Note that IPv6 extension
        headers belong to the payload.  Also note that in case of a
        jumbo payload option the value of the Payload Length field in
        the IPv6 header is zero and so will be the value reported by
        this Information Element."

   "5.7.1.  ipPayloadLength

      Description:
        The effective length of the IP payload.  For IPv4 packets, the
        value of this Information Element is the difference between
        the total length of the IPv4 packet (as reported by
        Information Element totalLengthIPv4) and the length of the
        IPv4 header (as reported by Information Element
        headerLengthIPv4).  For IPv6, the value of the Payload Length
        field in the IPv6 header is reported except in the case that
        the value of this field is zero and that there is a valid
        jumbo payload option.  In this case, the value of the Jumbo
        Payload Length field in the jumbo payload option is reported."

   RObust Header Compression Version 2 (ROHCv2): Profiles for RTP, UDP,
   IP, ESP and UDP-Lite ([RFC5225]):

   "IPv6 headers using the jumbo payload option of RFC 2675 `[RFC2675]` will
   not be compressible with this encoding method since the value of the
   payload length field does not match the length of the packet.

   UDP Usage Guidelines ([RFC5405], Obsolete):

   "IPv6 allows the option of transmitting large packets ("jumbograms")
   without fragmentation when all link layers along the path support this
   `[RFC2675]`."

   TCP Extensions for High Performance ([RFC7323]):

   "Expanding the TCP window beyond 64 KiB for IPv6 allows Jumbograms
   `[RFC2675]` to be used when the local network supports packets larger
   than 64 KiB.  When larger TCP segments are used, the TCP checksum
   becomes weaker."

   "The same technique applies to IP version 6, except in the case of IPv6
   Jumbograms.  When IPv6 Jumbograms are supported, [RFC2675] requires
   additional steps for dealing with the Urgent Pointer; these steps are
   described in Section 5.2 of `[RFC2675]`."

   UDP Usage Guidelines [RFC8085]:

   "IPv6 allows the option of transmitting large packets ("jumbograms")
   without fragmentation when all link layers along the path support this
   `[RFC2675]`."

   IPv6 Node Requirements ([RFC8504]):

   "Removed Jumbograms (RFC 2675) as they aren't deployed."
