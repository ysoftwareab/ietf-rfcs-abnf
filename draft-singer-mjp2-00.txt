Abstract

   This document serves to register and document the standard MIME types
   associated with Motion JPEG 2000 files..


1 Introduction

   JPEG 2000 is a modern wavelet-based codec that is expected to be
   widely used for still images.  Its use for motion sequences is
   expected to be similar to JPEG:  in those environments where only a
   single codec is required, and JPEG 2000 is available (e.g. digital
   still cameras recording short motion sequences) or where frame-by-
   frame coding is desired (no inter-frame coding).

2 MIME Types

   Within WG1 of ISO there is an effort under way to define a standard
   file format for motion JPEG 2000 sequences.  This file format permits
   the carriage of audio as well.  Though the format is based in the MP4
   format, it represents JPEG 2000 as a 'peer' coding system to MPEG-4
   visual, and the only permitted visual coder in a motion Jpeg 2000
   file is Jpeg 2000.

   Therefore, to identify this restricted usage, a new mime type is
   desirable.

   This file type is intended always to contain a video sequence, though
   simple audio is permitted.  Therefore it falls correctly under the
   "video" branch of mime types.

MIME media type name:              video
MIME subtype name:                 mjp2

Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
Encoding considerations:           base64 generally preferred; files are
                                   binary and should be transmitted
                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                   stripping etc.
Security considerations:           None known at the time of writing
Interoperability considerations:   A number of interoperating
                                   implementations exist within the
                                   MPEG-4 community;  and that community
                                   has reference software for reading
                                   and writing the file format.
                                   Reference software for MJP2 will also
                                   be available.
Published specification:           Pending (ISO/IEC 15444-3, JPEG 2000).
Applications:                      Multimedia
