                Segment Routing for Enhanced VPN Service
                draft-dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn-05

Abstract

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to enable it to
   support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that
   are associated with 5G services.  These applications require better
   isolation from both control and data plane's perspective and have
   more stringent performance requirements than can be provided with
   overlay VPNs.  The characteristics of an enhanced VPN as perceived by
   its tenant needs to be comparable to those of a dedicated private
   network.  This requires tight integration between the overlay VPN and
   the underlay network topology and resources in a scalable manner.  An
   enhanced VPN may form the underpinning of 5G network slicing, but
   will also be of use in its own right.  This document describes how to
   use segment routing based mechanisms to provide the enhanced VPN
   service with the required network topology and resources.  The
   overall mechanism of providing segment routing based enhanced VPN
   service is also described.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to
   both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment
   routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

1.  Introduction

   Driven largely by needs arising from the 5G mobile network design,
   the concept of network slicing has gained traction [NGMN-NS-Concept]
   [TS23501][TS28530] [BBF-SD406].  In [TS23501], Network Slice is
   defined as "a logical network that provides specific network
   capabilities and network characteristics", and Network Slice Instance
   is defined as "A set of Network Function instances and the required
   resources (e.g. compute, storage and networking resources) which form
   a deployed Network Slice".  Network slicing requires to partition the
   physical network to several pieces to provide each network slice with
   the required networking, computing, and storage resources and
   functions to meet the requirement of slice tenants.

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], a transport network
   slice is a virtual (logical) network with a particular network
   topology and a set of shared or dedicated network resources, which
   are used to provide the network slice consumer with the required
   connectivity, appropriate isolation and specific Service Level
   Agreement (SLA).  In order to meet the requirement of transport
   network slicing, there is a need to create virtual networks with
   enhanced characteristics.  Such a virtual network can provide a
   customized network topology, some degree of isolation and performance
   guarantee to meet the slice tenant's requirement.  Additionally, a
   network slice tenant may ask for some level of control to their
   virtual network, e.g. to customize the service paths in the network
   slice.

   The enhanced VPN service (VPN+) as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] is targeted at new applications which
   require better isolation from both control plane and data plane's
   perspective, and have more stringent performance requirements than
   can be provided with existing overlay VPNs.  An enhanced VPN may form
   the underpinning of network slicing, but will also be of use in its
   own right.

   Although a VPN can be associated with a set of dedicated RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209] LSPs with bandwidth reservation to provide some level of
   guarantee to service performance, such mechanisms would introduce
   per-VPN per-path states in the network, which is known to have
   scalability issues [RFC5439] and has not been widely adopted in
   production networks.

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] specifies a mechanism to steer packets
   through an ordered list of segments.  A segment is often referred to



Dong, et al.             Expires April 18, 2020                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   by its Segment Identifier (SID).  With SR, explicit source routing
   can be achieved without introducing per-path state into the network.
   Compared with RSVP-TE, currently SR does not have the capability of
   reserving or identifying a particular set of network resources
   reserved for particular services or customers.  Although a
   centralized controller can have a global view of network state and
   can provision different services onto different SR paths, in packet
   forwarding it still relies on traditional DiffServ QoS mechanism
   [RFC2474] [RFC2475] to provide coarse-grained traffic differentiation
   in the network.  While such kind of mechanism may be sufficient for
   some types of services, it cannot meet the stringent requirement of
   some enhanced VPN services which need to be isolated from other
   services in the network.  Also the number of such enhance VPN
   services would be larger than the number of classes in DiffServ QoS.

   This document extends the SR paradigm by introducing additional
   Segment Identifiers (SIDs) to represent different virtual network
   topologies and the corresponding set of network resources allocated
   to the virtual networks on each network segment.  A group of SR SIDs
   can be used to specify the customized topology of an enhanced VPN,
   and can be further used to steer the service traffic to be processed
   with the corresponding set of network resources.  The proposed
   mechanism is applicable to SR with both MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and
   IPv6 data plane (SRv6).  The overall mechanism of providing segment
   routing based enhanced VPN is also described.

2.  Segment Routing with Topology and Resource Awareness

   In order to support enhanced VPN service, the overlay VPNs need to be
   integrated with the underlay network in terms of network topology and
   network resources.  More specifically, enhanced VPNs need to be
   mapped to different virtual topologies to provide customized
   connectivity, and different set of network resources may be allocated
   to different enhanced VPNs, or different groups of enhanced VPNs, to
   meet the diverse performance requirement.  When SR is used as the
   data plane to enable enhanced VPNs, it is necessary that the SR
   service paths are computed within a particular virtual network
   topology, and are instantiated with a particular set of network
   resources.

   In the segment routing architecture [RFC8402], several types of
   segments are defined to represent either topological or service
   instructions.  A topological segment can be a node segment or an
   adjacency segment.  A service segment may be associated with specific
   service function for service chaining purpose.  This document
   introduces additional SR segments which can be associated with
   particular network topology and particular set of network resources.

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   This section describes the mechanisms to identify the associated
   virtual network topology and resource information with the two SR
   data plane instantiations: SR-MPLS and SRv6.

2.1.  SR-MPLS

   In SR-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], IGP Adjacency
   Segment (Adj-SID) is an IGP-segment attached to a unidirectional
   adjacency or a set of unidirectional adjacencies.  IGP Node segment
   is an IGP-Prefix segment that identifies a specific router (e.g., a
   loopback).  In [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe], PeerAdj SID
   is used as instruction to steer over a specific local interface
   towards a specific peer node in a peering Autonomous System (AS).
   These types of SIDs can be extended to represent both topological
   elements and the resources allocated on a particular network element.

   For one particular IGP link, multiple Adj-SIDs SHOULD be allocated,
   each of which is associated with a particular virtual network
   topology, and MAY represent a subset of link resources.  Several
   approaches can be used to partition the link resource, such as
   logical sub-interfaces, dedicated queues, etc.  The detailed
   mechanism of resource partitioning is out of scope of this document.
   Similarly, for one particular IGP node, multiple node-SIDs SHOULD be
   allocated, each of which is associated with a specific virtual
   network topology, and may represent a subset of the node resource
   (e.g. the processing resources).  For one inter-domain link, multiple
   BGP PeerAdj SIDs [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] can be
   allocated, each of which is associated with a specific virtual
   network topology which spans multiple domains, and MAY represent a
   subset of link resource on the inter-domain link.  Note that this
   per-segment resource allocation complies to the SR paradigm, which
   avoids introducing per-path state into the network.

   A group of adj-SIDs and node-SIDs associated with the same virtual
   network can be used to construct the SR SID-lists (either strict or
   loose) to steer the traffic of a particular enhanced VPN service.
   This group of SIDs MAY also represent the set of network resources
   which are reserved for a specific enhanced VPN, or a group of
   enhanced VPNs.

   In data packet forwarding, the adj-SID and node-SID are used to
   identify the virtual network the packet belongs to, so that a virtual
   network specific next-hop can be determined.  The adj-SIDs MAY be
   used to steer traffic of different enhanced VPNs into different set
   of link resources.  The node SIDs MAY be used to steer traffic of
   different enhanced VPNs into different set of node resources.  When a
   node-SID is used in the SID-list to build an SR loose path, the
   transit nodes use the node-SID to identify the virtual network, and



Dong, et al.             Expires April 18, 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   MAY process the packet using the local resources allocated for the
   corresponding virtual network.  Note in this case, Penultimate Hop
   Popping (PHP) [RFC3031] MUST be disabled.

   This mechanism requires to allocate additional node-SIDs and adj-SIDs
   for each virtual network (network slice).  As the number of virtual
   networks increases, the number of SIDs would increase accordingly.
   It is expected that this mechanism is applicable to a network with a
   limited number of network slices.

2.2.  SRv6

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], an SRv6
   Segment Identifier (SID) is a 128-bit value which consists of a
   locator (LOC) and a function (FUNCT), optionally it may also contain
   additional arguments (ARG) immediately after the FUNCT.  The LOC of
   the SID is routable and leads to the node which instantiates that
   SID, which means the LOC can be parsed by all nodes in the network.
   The FUNCT part of the SID is an opaque identification of a local
   function bound to the SID, which means the FUNCT and ARG parts can
   only be parsed by the node which instantiates that SID.

   In order to support multiple virtual networks in a SRv6 network, all
   the nodes (including the edge nodes and transit nodes) belonging to
   one particular virtual network MUST have a consistent view of the
   virtual network and performs consistent computation and forwarding
   behavior to comply to the network topology and resource constraints.
   A node which participates in multiple virtual networks MUST be able
   to distinguish packets which belong to different virtual networks.

   Taking the above into consideration, for a particular network node,
   multiple SRv6 LOCs SHOULD be allocated, each of which is associated
   with a virtual network topology, and MAY represent a subset of the
   network resources associated with the virtual network.  The SRv6 SIDs
   of a particular virtual network SHOULD be allocated from the SID
   space using the virtual network specific LOC as the prefix.  These
   SRv6 SIDs can be used to represent virtual network specific local
   functions.

   A group of SRv6 SIDs associated with the same virtual network can be
   used to construct the SR SID-lists (either strict or loose) to steer
   the traffic of a particular enhanced VPN service.  This group of SIDs
   MAY also represent the set of network resources which are reserved
   for a particular enhanced VPN, or a group of enhanced VPNs.

   In data packet forwarding, the LOC part of SRv6 SID is used by
   transit nodes to identify the virtual network the packet belongs to,
   so that a virtual network specific next-hop can be determined.  The

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   LOC MAY also be used to indicate the set of local network resources
   on the transit nodes to be used for the forwarding of the received
   packet.  The SRv6 segment endpoint nodes use the virtual network
   specific SRv6 SID to identify the virtual network the packet belongs
   to, and the particular local function to perform on the received
   packet.  The local SRv6 SID MAY also be used to identify the set of
   network resource to be used for executing the local function.

   This mechanism requires to allocate additional SRv6 Locators and SIDs
   for each virtual network (network slice).  As the number of virtual
   networks increases, the number of Locators and SIDs would increase
   accordingly.  It is expected that this mechanism is applicable to a
   network with a limited number of network slices.

3.  Control Plane Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document makes use of a centralized
   controller that collects the information about the network
   (configuration, state, routing databases, etc.) as well as the
   service information (traffic matrix, performance statistics, etc.).
   The controller is also responsible for the centralized computation
   and optimization of the SR paths within virtual networks for
   different enhanced VPNs.  The SR SIDs can be either explicitly
   provisioned by the controller, or dynamically allocated by network
   nodes then reported to the controller.  The interaction between the
   controller and the network nodes can be based on PCEP [RFC5440],
   Netconf/YANG [RFC6241] [RFC7950] and BGP-LS [RFC7752].  In some
   scenarios, extensions to some of these protocols is needed , which
   are out of the scope of this document and will be specified in
   separate documents.

   A distributed control plane can be used for the collection and
   distribution of the network topology and state information of the
   virtual networks among network nodes.  Distributed route computation
   for services of a particular enhanced VPN is also needed.  The IGP
   extensions for SR based enhanced VPN are specified in
   [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn].

4.  Procedures

   This section describes the procedures of provisioning enhanced VPN
   service in SR based virtual networks.

   According to the requirement of an enhanced VPN service, a
   centralized network controller calculates a subset of the physical
   network topology to support the enhanced VPN.  Within this topology,
   the set of network resources needed on each network element is also
   determined.  This network topology and the set of network resources



Dong, et al.             Expires April 18, 2020                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   together constitute a virtual network (or network slice).  Depending
   on the service requirement, the network topology and resource can be
   dedicated for a particular enhanced VPN, or they can be shared among
   multiple enhanced VPNs.

   Following the segment routing paradigm, the network topology and
   resource are represented using a group of dedicated SIDs.  The group
   of node-SIDs and adj-SIDs allocated for a virtual network will be
   used by network nodes and the network controller to build a SR based
   virtual network, which is used as the underlay of the enhanced VPN
   service.  The extensions to IGP protocol to distribute the SIDs and
   the associated resources allocated for a virtual network are
   specified in [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn].

   Suppose tenant A requests for an enhanced VPN service from the
   network operator.  The requirement is that service of tenant A does
   not experience unexpected interference from other services in the
   same network, such as other tenants' VPN services, or the non-VPN
   services in the network.  The detailed requirements can be described
   with characteristics such as the following:

   o  Service topology: the service sites and the connectivity between
      them.

   o  Service bandwidth: the bandwidth requirement between service
      sites.

   o  Isolation: the level of isolation from other services in the
      network.

   o  Reliability: whether fast local repair or end-to-end protection is
      needed or not.

   o  Latency: the maximum latency for specific service between specific
      service sites.

   o  Visibility: the customer may want to have some form of visibility
      of the virtual network delivering the service.

4.1.  Virtual Network Topology and Resource Computation

   As described in section 4, a centralized network controller is
   responsible for the computation of a virtual network for the
   provisioning of enhanced VPNs.  The controller collects the
   information of network connectivity, network resources, network
   performance and other relevant network states of the underlay
   network.  This can be done using either IGP [RFC5305] [RFC3630]
   [RFC7471] [RFC7810] or BGP-LS [RFC7752] [RFC8571].



Dong, et al.             Expires April 18, 2020                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   Based on the information collected from the underlay network,
   controller obtains the underlay network topology and the information
   about the allocated and available network resources.  When an
   enhanced VPN service request is received from a tenant, the
   controller computes the subset of the network topology, along with
   set of the resources needed on each network element (e.g. links and
   nodes) in the topology to meet the tenant's service requirements,
   whilst maintaining the needs of the existing tenants that are using
   the same network.  The subset of network topology and resource
   constitute a virtual network, which will be used as the underlay of
   the requested enhanced VPN.

4.2.  Network Resource and SID Allocation

   According to the result of virtual network computation, network
   controller instructs the network devices involved in the virtual
   network to allocate the required network resources for the enhanced
   VPN.  This can be done with either PCEP [RFC5440] or Netconf/YANG
   [RFC6241] [RFC7950] with necessary extensions.  The network resources
   are allocated in a per-segment manner.  In addition, a set of
   dedicated SIDs, e.g.  node-SIDs and adj-SIDs are allocated to
   represent the virtual network and the network resources allocated on
   each network segment for this virtual network.

   In the underlay forwarding plane, there can be multiple ways of
   partitioning and allocating a set of network resource to a virtual
   network.  For example, [FLEXE] may be used to partition the link
   resource into different sub-channels to achieve hard isolation
   between each other.  The candidate data plane technologies to support
   enhanced VPN can be found in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].  The SR
   SIDs are used as a network layer abstraction for various network
   resource partitioning and allocation mechanisms in the underlay
   forwarding plane.

 Figure 1. SID allocation for different virtual networks

   Figure 1 shows a SR network to support enhanced VPN.  Note that the
   format of the SIDs in this figure are for illustration, both SR-MPLS
   and SRv6 can be used as the data plane.  In this example, three
   virtual networks: red (r) , green (g) and blue (b) are created for
   different enhanced VPNs.  Both the red and green virtual networks
   consist of nodes A, B, C, D, and E with all their interconnecting
   links, whilst the blue virtual network only consists of nodes A, B, C
   and D with all their interconnecting links.  Note that different
   virtual networks may have a set of shared nodes and links.  On each
   link, a dedicated Adj-SID is allocated for each virtual network it
   participates in.  For example, r:1002:1G means that on one link, 1
   gigabit link bandwidth is allocated to virtual network red, and is
   represented using Adj-SID 1002.  Similarly, on each node, a dedicated
   Node-SID is allocated for each virtual network it participates in.
   The Adj-SIDs can be associated with different set of link resources
   (e.g. bandwidth) allocated to different virtual networks, so that the
   Adj-SIDs can be used to steer service traffic into different set of
   link resources in packet forwarding.  The Node-SIDs can be associated
   with the nodal resources allocated to different virtual network.  In
   addition, the Node-SIDs can be used to build loose SR path within

   each virtual network, in this case it can be used by the transit
   nodes to steer different service traffic into different set of local
   network resources in the forwarding plane.

   In Figure 1, the notation x:nnnn:y means that in virtual network x,
   the adj-SID nnnn will steer the packet over a link which has
   bandwidth y reserved for that virtual network.  Thus the note
   r:1002:1G in link C->D says that the red virtual network has a
   reserved bandwidth of 1Gb/s on link C->D, and will be used by packets
   arriving at node C with an adj-SID 1002 at the top of the label
   stack.

4.3.  Construction of SR Virtual Networks

   To make both the network controller and network nodes aware of the
   information of the virtual networks created in the network, each
   network node MUST advertise the virtual networks it participates,
   together with the set of SIDs and the associated resource attributes
   both into the network and to the controller.  This can be achieve by
   means such as IGP extensions [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn], BGP-LS
   [RFC7752] with necessary extensions, NETCONF/YANG [RFC6241]
   [RFC7950].

   Based on the collected information of network topology, network
   resource and SIDs information, both the controller and network nodes
   are able to construct the SR virtual network and generate the
   forwarding entries of each virtual network based on the node-SIDs and
   adj-SIDs allocated for each virtual network.  Unlike classic segment
   routing in which network resources are always shared by all the
   services and tenants, different SR virtual networks can be associated
   with different set of resource allocated in the underlay network, so
   that they can be used to meet the service requirement of enhanced
   VPNs and provide the required isolation from other services in the
   same network.

   Figure 2 shows the SR based virtual networks created in the network
   in Figure 1.

Figure 2.  SR based virtual networks with different groups of SIDs

   In each SR virtual network, SR path is computed within the virtual
   network, taking its network topology and resource as constraints.
   The SR path can be an explicit path instantiated using SR policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], in which the segment-list
   is built with the SIDs allocated to the virtual network.  The service
   path can also be an IGP computed path associated with a particular
   node-SIDs of the virtual network.  Different service paths in the
   same virtual network would share the network resources allocated to
   the virtual network.

   For example, to create an explicit path A-B-D-E in the virtual
   network red in Figure 2, the SR segment list encapsulated in the
   service packet would be (1001, 1002, 1003).  For the same explicit
   path A-B-D-E in virtual network green, the SR segment list would be
   (2001, 2002, 2003).  In the case where we wish to construct a loose
   path A-D-E in virtual network green, the service packet SHOULD be
   encapsulated with the SR segment list (201, 204, 205).  At node A,
   the packet can be sent towards D via either node B or C using the
   link and node resources allocated for virtual network green.  At node
   D the packet is forwarded to E using the link and node resource
   allocated for virtual network green.  Similarly, a packet to sent via
   loose path A-D-E in virtual network red would be encapsulated with
   segment list (101, 104, 105).  In the case where an IGP computed path
   can meet the service requirement, the packet can be simply
   encapsulated with the node SID of egress node E in the corresponding
   virtual network.

4.4.  VPN Service to SR Virtual Network Mapping

   The enhanced VPN services can be provisioned using the customized SR
   virtual networks as the underlay network.  Different enhanced VPNs
   may be provisioned in different SR virtual networks, each of which
   would use the network resources allocated to a particular virtual
   network, so that they will not interfere with each other.  In another
   case, a group of enhanced VPNs which have similar characteristic and



Dong, et al.             Expires April 18, 2020                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2019


   requirement can be provisioned in the same virtual network, in this
   case the network resources allocated to the virtual network are
   shared by this set of enhanced VPNs, but will not be shared with
   other services in the network.

4.5.  Virtual Network Visibility to Customer

   The tenants of enhanced VPNs may request different granularity of
   visibility to the network which deliver the service.  Depending on
   the requirement, the network can be exposed to the tenant either as a
   virtual network, or a set of computed paths with transit nodes, or
   simply the abstract connectivity between endpoints without any path
   information.  The visibility can be delivered through different
   possible mechanisms, such as IGPs (e.g.  IS-IS, OSPF) or BGP-LS.  In
   addition, network operator may want to restrict the visibility of the
   information it delivers to the tenant by either hiding the transit
   nodes between sites (and only delivering the endpoints connectivity),
   or by hiding portions of the transit nodes (summarizing the path into
   fewer nodes).  Mechanisms such as BGP-LS allow the flexibility of the
   advertisement of aggregated virtual network information.

5.  Benefits of the Proposed Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism provides several key characteristics:

   o  Flexibility: Multiple customized virtual networks can be created
      in a shared network to meet different tenants' connectivity and
      service requirement.  Each tenant is only aware of the topology
      and attributes of his own virtual network, and provision services
      on the virtual network instead of the physical network.  This
      provides an efficient mechanism to support network slicing.

   o  Isolation: Each virtual network can have independent SR path
      computation and instantiation.  In addition, a virtual network can
      be associated with a set of network resources, which can avoid
      resource competition and performance interference from other
      services in the network.  The proposed mechanism also allows
      resource sharing between different services in the same enhanced
      VPN, or between a group of enhanced VPNs which are provisioned in
      the same virtual network.  This gives the operator and the
      enhanced VPN tenants the flexibility in network planning and
      service provisioning.  The performance of critical services in a
      particular enhanced VPN can be further ensured using the
      mechanisms defined in [DetNet].

   o  Scalability: The proposed mechanism seeks to achieve a balance
      between the state limitations of traditional end-to-end TE
      mechanism and the lack of resource awareness in basic segment

      routing.  Following the segment routing paradigm, network
      resources are allocated to network segments in the virtual
      networks, thus there is no per-flow state introduced in the
      network.  Operator can choose the granularity of resource
      allocation to network segments.  In network segments where
      resource is scarce such that the service requirement may not
      always be met, the SR approach can be used to allocate specific
      resources to the segment in a particular virtual network.  By
      contrast, in other segment of the network where resource is
      considered plentiful, the resource may be shared between a number
      of virtual networks.  The decision to do this is in the hands of
      the operator.  Because of the segmented nature of the virtual
      network, resource aggregation is easier and more flexible than
      RSVP-TE based approach.

6.  Service Assurance

   In order to provide service assurance for enhanced VPNs, it is
   necessary to instrument the network at multiple levels.  The network
   operator needs to ascertain that the underlay is operating correctly.
   A tenant needs to ascertain that their services are operating
   correctly.  In principle these can use existing techniques.  These
   are well known problems and solutions either exist or are in
   development to address them.

   New work is needed to instrument the virtual networks that are
   created for the enhanced VPNs.  Such instrumentation needs to operate
   without causing disruption to other services using the network.
   Given the sensitivity of some applications, care needs to be taken to
   ensure that the instrumentation itself does not cause disruption
   either to the service being instrumented or to other services.  In
   case of failure or performance degradation of a service path in a
   particular virtual network, it is necessary that either local
   protection or end-to-end protection mechanism is used to switch to
   another path which could meet the service performance requirement and
   does not impact other services in the network.

8.  Security Considerations

   The normal security considerations of VPNs are applicable and it is
   assumed that industry best practise is applied to an enhanced VPN.

   The security considerations of segment routing are applicable and it
   is assumed that these are applied to an enhanced VPN that uses SR
   based virtual networks.

   Some applications of enhanced VPNs are sensitive to packet latency;
   the enhanced VPNs provisioned to carry their traffic have latency
   SLAs.  By disrupting the latency of such traffic an attack can be
   directly targeted at the customer application, or can be targeted at
   the network operator by causing them to violate their SLA, triggering
   commercial consequences.  Dynamic attacks of this sort are not
   something that networks have traditionally guarded against, and
   networking techniques need to be developed to defend against this
   type of attack.  By rigorously policing ingress traffic and carefully
   provisioning the resources provided to critical services this type of
   attack can be prevented.  However case needs to be taken when
   providing shared resources, and when the network needs to be
   reconfigured as part of ongoing maintenance or in response to a
   failure.

   The details of the underlay MUST NOT be exposed to third parties, to
   prevent attacks aimed at exploiting a shared resource.
