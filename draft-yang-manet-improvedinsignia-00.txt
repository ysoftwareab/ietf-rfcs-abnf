               Internet-Draft Improved INSIGNIA Based on Network measurement  July 2009 
                
               Abstract 
                   
                  This document specifies an improved version of INSIGNIA[1][2], which 
                  is a framework supporting quality of service(QOS) in mobile ad hoc 
                  networks. INSIGNIA is an in-band signaling system, and 'in-band 
                  signaling' means the control information is carried along with data 
                  in IP packets. In this memo we introduce network measurement into 
                  INSIGNIA, and then this system can highly responsive to changes of 
                  performance on mobile ad hoc networks.

               1.                   Introduction 
                   
                  INSIGNIA is an in-band signaling system that supports fast flow 
                  reservation, restoration and adaptation algorithms that are 
                  specifically designed to deliver adaptive real-time services in 
                  mobile ad hoc networks. For full details of INSIGNIA please see[2]. 
                   
                  In INSIGNIA requested bandwidth should be adjusted based on the 
                  measured channel capacity/utilization. As only bandwidth information 
                  can not reflect the performance comprehensively, this memo provides a 
                  supplement for INSIGNIA. More performance metrics can be used for 
                  admission control and resource reservation based on network 
                  measurement. 
                   
               1.1                    Assumptions 
                   
                  We assume that performance metrics, e.g. one-way delay, one-way loss 
                  rate, one-way jitter, can be obtained through some network 
                  measurement technology in the mobile ad hoc network. 
                   
                   
               2.                   Improved INSIGNIA protocol 
                   
                  We add a new bit into INSIGNIA IP options, which is used to load the 
                  performance metrics measured by intermediate nodes on a path.

               2.1                    Improved IP options 
                   
                  INSIGNIA uses a new IP option to setup restore and adapt resource 
                  between packets with source-destination pairs. Based on INSIGNIA IP 
                  options, we add QOS parameters (QOS_PARA) fields into the INSIGNIA IP 
                  options, which is illustrated in Figure 1.

                  The MAX_QAddr field indicates the address of node with the largest 
                  queue delay on a path. The BNAddr field indicates the address of 
                  bottleneck node along a path. The BN field indicates the bottleneck 
                  bandwidth of a path. The OWD field indicates the one-way delay. The 
                  OWL field indicates one-way loss. The OWJ field indicates one-way 
                  jitter.    
                   
                  Note that the fields in QOS_PARA should be tailored in accordance 
                  with required types of performance metrics.

               Internet-Draft Improved INSIGNIA Based on Network measurement  July 2009 
                
                  The new adaptation operation based on INSIGNIA is different among 
                  source nodes, intermediate nodes and destination nodes.  
                   
                  New adaptation procedures on source nodes: 
                   
                  [1] Fields in QOS_PARA should be initialized in accordance with 
                  required types of performance metrics before forwarding reservation 
                  request packets toward destination node. 
                   
                  [2] When QOS reports are sent to source host, some data processing 
                  are done according to the data in QOS_PARA field. For example, an 
                  active flow is rerouted to avoid passing the bottleneck node or node 
                  with the largest queue delay on the path according to data in BNAddr 
                  field or MAX_QAddr field, respectively; bandwidth requirements of the 
                  flow specified in the bandwidth request field is reduced if data in 
                  BN field is smaller than requested; The service type may be degraded 
                  adaptively according to the OWD or OWL field; generation rate of the 
                  flow is reduced if value of OWJ field is larger than a threshold.  
                   
                  New adaptation procedures on intermediate nodes: 
                   
                  [1] When intermediate nodes receive request packets, they attempt to 
                  reserve, restore or adapt resources forwarding data packets toward 
                  the destination and do some measurement.  
                   
                  [2] The measured performance metrics are encapsulated into the 
                  QOS_PARA field.  
                   
                  New adaptation procedures on destination nodes: 
                   
                  [1] Destination nodes generate QOS reports which include QOS 
                  statistics obtained by intermediate nodes, and sent them to source. 
                   
                   
               4.                   Security Considerations 
                   
                  Active network measurement should be tuned well to avoiding active 
                  attacks.
