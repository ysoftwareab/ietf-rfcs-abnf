c = d,  is a comparison operator, returning true if the value of the
      left side (c) is equal to the value of the right side (d). c and d
      may be values, network addresses, or unordered lists (they must be
      of the same type).  If c and d are unordered lists, then they are
      considered to be equal if c contains d and d contains c (i.e.,
      they contain the same set of elements, regardless of the order in
      which they are recorded in the lists).  If c and d are network
      addresses, they are considered equal only if both addresses and
      prefix lengths are equal (i.e., they represent the same ).

I_manet = true) then:

Type = LOCAL_IF, as defined in Table 1.

Value = LOST also performs the function of an Address Block TLV with
Type = OTHER_NEIGHB and the same Value.  Including the latter
Type = LINK_STATUS and Value = SYMMETRIC, include the neighbor
Type = LINK_STATUS.

Type = OTHER_NEIGHB.

I_manet = true, unless it is known that the corresponding MANET
Value = LOST
