Abstract

     While plaintext passwords have very poor security characteristics
     by themselves, there are a number of contexts where they are useful
     or necessary.  This defines a plaintext password mechanism for SASL
     [SASL] which is intended to be used in combination with an external
     encryption layer, as a transition mechanism from a legacy
     authentication database, or to use (insecurely) a legacy
     authentication database which can not practically be replaced.

     In hopes of promoting the future elimination of unencrypted
     plaintext passwords, this defines error codes for use with POP3 and
     IMAP4: one to indiciate the need for a transition to a stronger
     mechanism, a second to indicate that a SASL mechanism is too weak
     for per-user security policy for a given service, and a third to
     indicate that a SASL mechanism is only accepted in combination with
     an external strong encryption mechanism.  Any protocol offering the
     PLAIN mechanism SHOULD also support equivalent error codes.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
     in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
     use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].


2. Security Impact of Plaintext Passwords

     Use of unencrypted plaintext passwords over the Internet is a
     severe security risk.  In particular, a passive observer can get
     the password with any packet sniffer.  This requires no technical
     expertise, as one can simply plug a consumer level computer into
     the network and run widely available network snoop programs.  Such
     attacks are difficult or impossible to detect, and can only be
     prevented by complete physical and virtual security of the network
     between the client and server -- something which is usually
     impossible to achieve.

     Unfortunately, most modern servers use legacy authentication
     databases, usually tightly integrated with the operating system,
     which apply a one-way function to the user's password preventing
     the use of any mechanism other than plaintext passwords.  This
     means that plaintext passwords are the only authentication
     technology today which will work with the vast majority of deployed
     authentication databases.  Often the cost of deploying a new
     authentication technology or having different authentication
     credentials for different services outweighs the security risks of
     plaintext passwords.

     Thus there are three situations where plaintext passwords are
     necessary or useful:

     (1) As a method to transition, on a per-user basis, from a legacy
     authentication database a secure password mechanism such as
     CRAM-MD5 [CRAM-MD5].

     (2) As the only feasible mechanism when a legacy authentication
     database is in use, multiple remote services are offered, there is
     no way to transition all the remote services, and it is
     unacceptable to have different passwords for different services.

     (3) In conjunction with a strong encryption layer.

     In all other cases, plaintext passwords SHOULD NOT be used.  In
     addition, any client or server supporting this mechanism SHOULD
     also support a strong encryption layer or a stronger authentication
     mechanism.

3. Plaintext Password SASL mechanism

     The mechanism name associated with plaintext passwords is "PLAIN".

     The mechanism consists of a single message from the client to the
     server.  The client sends the authorization identity, followed by a
     US-ASCII NUL character, followed by the authentication identity,
     followed by a US-ASCII NUL character, followed by the plaintext
     password.  The client may leave the authorization identity empty to
     indicate that it is the same as the authentication identity.

     The server will verify the authentication identity and password
     with the system authentication database and verify that the
     authentication credentials permit the client to login as the
     authorization identity.  If both these steps succeed, the user is
     logged in.

     When used as a transition mechanism, the password will be stored in
     a new authentication database capable of supporting stronger
     authentication mechanisms.  Once this is completed, the server MAY
     refuse future use of the PLAIN mechanism by that authentication
     identity.

     Non-US-ASCII characters are permitted as long as they can be
     represented in UTF-8 [UTF8].  Use of non-visible characters or
     characters which a user may be unable to enter on some keyboards is
     discouraged.

     The formal grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF
     [ABNF] follows.

     message         = [authorize-id] NUL authenticate-id NUL password

     NUL             = %x00

     US-ASCII-SAFE   = %x01..09 / %x0B..0C / %x0E..7F
                      ;; US-ASCII except CR, LF, NUL

     UTF8-SAFE       = US-ASCII-SAFE / UTF8-1 / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3
                          / UTF8-4 / UTF8-5

     UTF8-CONT       = %x80..BF

     UTF8-1          = %xC0..DF UTF8-CONT

     UTF8-2          = %xE0..EF 2UTF8-CONT

     UTF8-3          = %xF0..F7 3UTF8-CONT

Internet Draft     Plaintext Password SASL Mechanism           July 1997


     UTF8-4          = %xF8..FB 4UTF8-CONT

     UTF8-5          = %xFC..FD 5UTF8-CONT

     authenticate-id = 1*255UTF8-SAFE

     authorize-id    = 1*255UTF8-SAFE

     password        = 1*255UTF8-SAFE


4. New Error/Response Codes

     When used as a transition mechanism, two new response codes are
     helpful to provide guidance to clients.  A third response code is
     useful to indicate the need for an external encryption mechanism.

     The failure codes for use with IMAP4 [IMAP4] are defined here:

     TRANSITION-NEEDED
          This IMAP response code occurs on the tagged NO response to an
          AUTHENTICATE command after an attempt to use a mechanism other
          than PLAIN.  It indicates that that mechanism is not currently
          usable, but will be usable once "AUTHENTICATE PLAIN" or LOGIN
          is used.


     AUTH-TOO-WEAK
          This IMAP response code occurs on the tagged NO response to a
          LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE command.  It indicates that the
          requested mechanism is not available to the specified user
          based on site security policy.  This may also be used on the
          untagged OK response to a LOGIN or "AUTHENTICATE PLAIN"
          command to indicate that plaintext passwords will not be
          accepted from that user at a later date.


     ENCRYPT-NEEDED
          This IMAP response code occurs on the tagged NO response to a
          LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE command.  It indicates that the
          specified mechanism may only be used in combination with an
          external strong encryption service.  This is intended
          primarily for use with plaintext passwords.

Internet Draft     Plaintext Password SASL Mechanism           July 1997


     The failure codes for use with POP3 [POP3] are defined here:

     -ERR [TRANSITION-NEEDED] A password transition is needed.
          The portion between the "[" and "]" is a machine parsable
          message, interpreted in a case insensitive fashion.  The
          remainer of the line may contain any implementation-specific
          human readable text.

          This occurs in response to an APOP or AUTH [POP-AUTH] command
          that is not currently available, but will be available after
          the use of the PLAIN mechanism or the USER/PASS commands.


     -ERR [AUTH-TOO-WEAK] Plaintext passwords forbidden
          This occurs in response to a USER, PASS, APOP or AUTH command
          and indicates that the server no longer permits the requested
          authentication mechanism due to site security policy.  It may
          also occur on a "+OK" line after a successful PASS or AUTH
          PLAIN command to indicate that plaintext passwords will not be
          accepted from that user at a later date.


     -ERR [ENCRYPT-NEEDED] Plaintext passwords need encryption
          This occurs in response to a USER, PASS, APOP or AUTH command
          and indicates that the server does not permit use of the
          specified mechanism except with an external encryption
          mechanism for the specified user.  This is intended primarily
          for use with plaintext passwords.


5. Example

     Here is a sample transition exchange between an IMAP client and
     server.  In this example, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the
     client and server respectively.  If such lines are wrapped without
     a new "C:" or "S:" label, then the wrapping is for editorial
     clarity and is not part of the command.

     Note that this example uses the IMAP profile [IMAP4] of SASL.  The
     base64 encoding of challenges and responses, as well as the "+ "
     preceding the responses are part of the IMAP4 profile, not part of
     SASL itself.  Newer profiles of SASL will include the client
     message with the AUTHENTICATE command itself so the extra round
     trip below (the server response with an empty "+ ") can be
     eliminated.

     In this example, the user's authentication identifier is "tim", his
     authorization identifier is the same, and his password is

6. Security Considerations

     Security considerations are discussed throughout this document.

     A man in the middle or a spoof server may be able to aquire the
     user's password by pretending no strong authentication mechanisms
     are available.  The are two steps the client can take to help
     defeat such attacks.  First, clients MAY record the occurance of an
     AUTH-TOO-WEAK or ENCRYPT-NEEDED error for a given user, server and
     protocol combination and refuse to use unencrypted plaintext
     passwords for that combination in the future.  Second, clients
     SHOULD get permission from the user prior to using an unencrypted
     plaintext password, especially in response to a TRANSITION-NEEDED
     response code.  If the user normally makes a secure connection and
     suddenly sees a warning, this might prevent a password compromise.

     Unencrypted plaintext passwords are visible to any network snooper,
     as discussed in section 2.  Servers SHOULD have the ability to
     enable the AUTH-TOO-WEAK or ENCRYPT-NEEDED errors on a per-user
     basis to ease the transition away from unencrypted plaintext
     passwords.
