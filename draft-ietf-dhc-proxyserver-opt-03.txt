Abstract

   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP) option, which can be used to configure the TCP/IP host's Proxy
   Server configuration for standard protocols like HTTP, FTP, NNTP,
   SOCKS, Gopher, SLL and etc.  Proxy Server provides controlled and
   efficient access to the Internet by access control mechanism for
   different types of user requests and caching frequently accessed
   information (Web pages and possibly files that might have been
   downloaded using FTP and other protocols).

Internet-Draft    DHCP Option for Proxy Server Configuration   Apr 2005


        DHCP Client: A DHCP [RFC-2131] client is an Internet host that 
                uses DHCP to obtain configuration information such as
                network address.



        DHCP Server: A DHCP server [RFC-2131] is an Internet host that 
                returns configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

        Proxy Server: In a enterprise network that connects to Internet,
                a proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary
                between a workstation user and the Internet so that the
                enterprise can ensure security, administrative control,
                and caching service. A Proxy server MAY be associated 
                with or part of a gateway server that separates the 
                enterprise network from the outside network (Usually 
                Internet) and a firewall server that protects the 
                enterprise network from outside intrusion.

2. Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC-2131] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network.  This document describes a DHCP configuration option that
   can be used to inform a DHCP client, the IP addresses of one or more
   proxy services that are either available to it or that must be used
   in order to access internet services, for example through a coporate
   firewall.

   The following diagram depicts the typical setup providing proxy
   service to clients on a network that is protected by a firewall.
   
   +---------------------------+		+-----------+
   |                           |		|Remote HTTP|	
   |                           |	HTTP	|Server	    |
   |  +------------+        +-------------+<--->+-----------+
   |  | Clients    |        |Proxy Server |
   |  | Inside the |<------>|    +        | FTP +-----------+
   |  | Firewall   |        |Firewall     |<--->|Remote FTP |
   |  +------------+        +-------------+	|Server	    |
   |                           |  ^		+-----------+
   |                           |  |
   |                           |  |		+-----------+
   +---------------------------+  |  NNTP	|Remote NNTP|
				  +------------>|Server	    |
					        +-----------+

   The primary use of proxies is to allow access to the World Wide Web
   from within a firewall. A proxy service typically runs on firewall 
   machine. It waits for a request from inside the firewall, forwards

   the request to the remote server outside the firewall, reads the 
   response and then sends it back to the client. Usually, all the 
   clients use the same proxy within a given network, which helps in 
   efficient caching of documents that are requested by a number of 
   clients. This behavior makes proxies attractive to clients not 
   inside a firewall.


   A proxy server increases the network security and user productivity 
   by content filtering and controlling both internal and external 
   access to information. Also, it provides several other 
   functionalities that are not discussed here.


3. Requirements terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

4. Proxy Server Configuration Option

   This document defines a new DHCP Option called the Proxy Server 
   Configuration Option. The format of the Proxy Server configuration
   option is:

   	   Code    Len    Proxy Server Configuration Entry
   	 +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+
   	 |  TBD  |   N  |  e1  |  e2  |  e3  |  e4  |      |  en  |
   	 +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+

   Code is TBD and will be assigned by IANA according to [RFC-2939].
   The length N gives the total number of octets in the Proxy Server 
   Configuration entries.
   
   
   The Proxy Server Configuration entry normally consists of a 
   sequence of Protocol Type (p), len (l), flag (f), IP 
   address and port. But it can also be a sequence of Protocol 
   Type (p), Len and RDF[RDF-SYN] metadata.
   	  
   	+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
	|p |l | f |IP address|port |
	+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The Protocol(p) is a two octet integer in network byte order, 
   length (l) and flag (f) are one octet each; each IP 
   address is four octets, and each port number is a two-octet 
   integer encoded in network byte order.

   The protocol type(p) specifies the type of Protocol and MUST be 
   one of the following assigned numbers.

       +-------------------------------+
       | protocol     |       Number   |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   HTTP       |         80     |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   FTP        |         21     |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   NNTP       |         119    |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   Gopher     |         70     |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   SSL        |         TBD    |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   SOCKS      |         1080   |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   WAIS       |         210    |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   IMAP       |         220    |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   RDF        |         TBD    |
       +-------------------------------+

   If the protocol type field is RDF[RDF-SYN], then it MUST be 
   followed by len (length of RDF metadata) and the actual RDF 
   metadata.

   The length field (l) specifies the length of the Proxy Server
   Configuration entry. If some new protocol is introduced in the
   future and if some version of dhcpclient doesn't support, then
   that particular entry can be ignored and process the following
   Proxy Server Configuration Entry, if any.

   The flag field (f) is by default 0.  Otherwise, it can either
   have "-" or "#".

   If it is "-", then the entry becomes a destination address for
   exclusion from forwarding to the proxy.  If it is "#", then the proxy
   requires authentication.

   In cases where it makes sense to specify more than one proxy server
   for a given protocol, these proxy servers MUST be specified as
   additional IP addresses and ports within the same entry.  The list is
   ordered by precedence, with the most preferred proxy server appearing
   first in the list, andthe least preferred proxy server appearing last
   in the list.  The DHCP client SHOULD honor this ordering.

   More than one Proxy Server Configuration Entries MAY be specified in
   the option.  In that case, the list is ordered by precedence, with
   the most preferred proxy server appearing first in the list, and the
   least preferred proxy server appearing last in the list.  The DHCP
   client SHOULD honor this ordering.

   The format of the Proxy Server Configuration using Metadata type is:


            p       Len        RDF Metadata for the Proxy    
   	 +-------+------+----------------------------------+
   	 |  RDF  |  N   |             RDF                  |
   	 +-------+------+----------------------------------+

   The RDF payload is freeform RDF metadata for describing proxy
   properties.  The length N gives the number of octets in the RDF
   metadata field.

   The following entry specifies the sample format of the RDF Meta
   data field
   
   HTTP proxy:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE rdf:RDF [<!ENTITY xsd "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#">]>
   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
	     xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">

   </rdf:Description>
   </rdf:RDF>

   FTP proxy:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE rdf:RDF [<!ENTITY xsd "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#">]>
   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"

	<dc:date>2004-06-15</dc:date>
   </rdf:Description>
   </rdf:RDF>

   As such there is no minimum length to specify a proxy using RDF
   metadata.  But the minimum sensible statement would be a literal
   description of the proxy (<dc:title>License Gate Proxy</dc:title>)
   giving a total of 418 characters including the overhead.

   For example, with a description element of 60 characters, an URI of
   80 characters plus a minimum XML/RDF syntax conformation/namespace
   declaration of:

   21 Octets <?xml version="1.0"?>
   70 Octets <!DOCTYPE rdf:RDF [<!ENTITY xsd "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#">]>
   64 Octets <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   45 Octets xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
   109 Octets <rdf:Description rdf:about="..80 characters..">
   81 Octets <dc:title>..60 characters..</dc:title>
   18 Octets </rdf:Description>
   10 Octets </rdf:RDF>

   ,the minimum length would be 418 octes.

5. Option Usage

   The Proxy Server Configuration entries SHOULD not repeat the same
   type of proxy entries. The port MUST be a valid TCP/UDP port.
   If the length of the Proxy Server Configuration Option exceeds the 
   maximum permissible within a single option (255 octets), then the 
   option MUST be represented in the DHCP message as specified 
   in [RFC-3396].

   The following example shows how an RDF version of proxy server 
   configuration entry of 400 octets is represented in the option.
    
    Code     Len   Proto   Len
   +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+
   |  TBD  | 255  |  RDF |  253 | RDF Meta Data.............|
   +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+
    Code     Len   Proto   Len
   +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+
   |  TBD  | 149  |  RDF |  147 | RDF Meta Data.............|
   +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+
 
   The following example shows how the same RDF version of proxy 
   server configuration entry of 400 octets is represented in the
   option along with a normal version (p|l|f|IP|port) of proxy 
   server configuration entry.
   
   +---+---+----+-+-+-------------+----+---+---+...-+---+-----+
   |TBD|255|HTTP|7|0|192.168.5.10 |8080|RDF|243| RDF Meta Data|
   +---+---+----+-+-+-------------+----+---+---+...-+---+-----+

   +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+
   |  TBD  | 159  |  RDF |  157 | RDF Meta Data.............|
   +-------+------+------+------+------+------+-....-+------+

   More than one RDF type of Proxy Server Configuration Entry MUST
   not be sent in this option. This is because, the RDF Meta Data is
   generally more than 255 octets and always require more than one
   option of this type as per [RFC-3396]. However, more than one proxy
   server configuration (FTP, HTTP, SOCKS) can be specified with the

6. Security Considerations

   The DHCP Options defined here allow an intruder DHCP server to
   misdirect a client, causing it to access a nonexistent or malicious 
   proxy server. This allows for a denial of service or man-in-the-middle 
   attack. This is a well known property of the DCHP protocol; this option 
   does not create any additional risk of such attacks.
   
   DHCP provides an authentication mechanism, as described in [RFC-3118],
   which may be used if authentication is required.


7. IANA Considerations
   
   IANA is requested to assign an option code to the Proxy Server
   Configuration Option and protocol numbers for the SSL and RDF
   protocol.
