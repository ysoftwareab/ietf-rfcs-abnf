           Prenegotiated options for IP, ICMP and TCP headers
                 draft-rosenau-prenegotiated-options-00

Abstract

   In many cases (example: PPTP [RFC2637]) a data transfer between two
   hosts is initiated by using "generic" protocols (in the case of PPTP
   this is UDP) and later on "special" protocols (in the case of PPTP
   this is GRE) are used.

   The drawback in this case is that the IANA has to assign protcol
   numbers (in the case of GRE this is 47)

   The same is true for TCP header "options" and ICMP packet "types".

   To avoid assigning numbers by the IANA this document proposes to
   reserve a range of protocol numbers for "negotiation" instead.
   During the phase using "generic" protocols the two hosts negotiate a
   protocol number in that range.

   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents

1.  Introduction

   Currently about 140 different layer 4 protocol numbers are assigned
   by the IANA to be used in the "next header" field (IPv6; IPv4:
   "protocol" field).  Only 250 different protocol numbers are
   supported.

   Because of the development of new protocols the number of possible
   values might be exceeded soon.

   Furthermore the IANA has the work to assign a protocol number, TCP
   option or ICMP packet type.

   This document proposes to assign a range of numbers for
   "negotiation".

   This means that in a data transfer between two hosts first negotiate
   to use a certain number from the range reserved from "negotiation"
   instead of using a pre-defined protocol number.

2.  Current situation

   Currently the IANA is assigning protocol numbers, TCP options and
   ICMP packet types of all "non-experimental" protocols.

   However in many situations a data transfer is initiated not using
   pre-assigned numbers.  The following example shows a PPTP session:

3.  Proposed future behaviour

   If no assigned number is necessary for the first data packets both
   hosts should first negotiate a protocol number from a certain range
   to be assigned by the IANA.

   It is not necessary that both hosts negotiate one value; instead it
   is also possible that both hosts tell each other which value to be
   used.  For each packet the value desired by the destination host is
   used.

   The following example shows some EXample Protocol (EXP) using this
   approach:

          Host A                    Host B
            |                           |
            +---------- UDP ----------->|
            |   (Desired value = 240)   |
            |                           |
            |<--------- UDP ------------+
            |   (Desired value = 241)   |
            |                           |
            +---------- EXP ----------->|
            |    (Packet type = 241)    |
            |                           |
            |<--------- EXP ------------+
            |    (Packet type = 240)    |
            |            ...            |

4.  Proposed ranges

4.1.  Most use cases

   RFC 4727 [RFC4727] specifies values 253 and 254 to be used for
   "experimental" purposes in the following fields:

   o IPv4 "protocol" field
   o IPv6 "next header" field
   o ICMPv4 "type" field
   o TCP "option" type

   Because the range immediately before the number 253 is unassigned for
   all of these fields this document proposes the range from 240 to 252
   for use with negotiation.

4.2.  ICMPv6 types

   RFC 4727 [RFC4727] specifies values 100 and 101 to be used for
   "experimental" error codes in the ICMPv6 "type" field.

   Because the range before the number 100 is unassigned this document
   proposes the range from 90 to 99 to be used for "negotiated" error
   codes.

   RFC 4727 [RFC4727] specifies values 200 and 201 to be used for
   "experimental" non-error packet types in the ICMPv6 "type" field.

   Because the range before the number 200 is unassigned this document
   proposes the range from 190 to 199 to be used for "negotiated" non-
   error packets.

4.3.  IPv6 destination options

   Currently this document does not propose the use of negotiated IPv6
   destination options.

4.4.  When not to use negotiated values

   Because these options must be negotiated between two hosts these
   options MUST NOT be used whenever more than two hosts must understand
   these options.

   Examples for this situation are:

   o IPv4 header options
   o IPv6 hop-by-hop options
   o Fields in non-unicast packets (anycast, multicast, broadcast)
