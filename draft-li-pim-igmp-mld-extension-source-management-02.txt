1.  Introduction

   Among protocols for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast, there is no
   protocol specification for the source registration so far.  The
   current protocol focuses more on data control.  This document
   specifies some new messages to extend IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and MLDv2
   [RFC3810] for exchanging source registration information and data
   transmission control information between sources and routers.

   In addition, combined with the multicast management process based on
   SDN architecture described in [I-D.li-pce-based-bier], the
   transmission of multicast source data can be effectively controlled,
   enhancing the security and controllability of the multicast service.

4.  Overview of Multicast Source Management

   Multicast source management includes multicast source registration
   and authorization, multicast data transmission and termination, and
   receiver information statistics.  Currently, multicast source
   management is mainly used in Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
   scenario.  If multicast source management is to be applied to Any-
   Source Multicast (ASM) scenarios, other mechanisms are needed.  ASM
   scenario is not discussed in this document.

   This document specifies IGMP and MLD protocol extensions for
   multicast source management, including Multicast Source Registration
   (MSR) described in Section 5.1, Multicast Data Notification (MDN)
   described in Section 5.2 and Multicast Receiver Statistics (MRS)
   described in Section 5.3.

Internet-Draft   IGMP/MLD Extension for Multicast Source   November 2021


4.1.  Multicast Source Registration and Authorization

   Source systems send Multicast Source Registration messages to routers
   informing them that there are multicast sources available to provide
   services.  The Multicast Source Registration message must contain the
   multicast source address, service start time and validity period of
   the request.  In some scenarios, The Multicast Source Registration
   message also needs to contain credential for controlling multicast
   source access.

   After receiving the registration message from the source system and
   authenticating, the routers send Multicast Source Registration
   messages with valid registration status response to the source
   systems and inform the source systems that the requests are approved.
   The routers will trigger a timer and maintain the registration status
   for the source systems until the timer expires.

   In contrast, the source systems can also send Multicast Source
   Registration messages to routers to withdraw the registration
   requests.  Then the routers will revoke the registration status and
   reply to the source systems.

   The source systems need periodically send registration messages to
   the routers to inform the router that the multicast source is alive.
   Then routers will refresh the timer of the registration status.  If
   routers receive multicast data from multicast sources, they will
   refresh the timer.  During data delivery, the source systems does not
   have to send registration messages periodically.

   When the timer expires or the registration validity period expires,
   the router will release the registration status and send a Multicast
   Source Registration message with invalid registration status to the
   source system to inform it.

4.2.  Multicast Data Transmission and Termination

   Within the service validity of registration, when the first receiver
   joins a multicast group with SSM address and requests to receive data
   from a specific multicast source, the first hop router will send
   Multicast Data Notification message carrying multicast group address
   to inform the source system that the source can send data to this
   multicast group.

   For a specific (S, G) tuple, when the last receiver leaves the
   multicast group, the first hop router will send Multicast Data
   Notification message carrying multicast group address to inform the
   source system that the source should stop sending data to this
   multicast group.

Internet-Draft   IGMP/MLD Extension for Multicast Source   November 2021


4.3.  Receiver Information Statistics

   For certain scenarios, a first hop router can learn receiver
   statistics for a specific (S, G) tuple.  For example, in SDN
   scenario, the receiver statistics of each egress router can be
   centrally managed by the controller.  The controller then aggregates
   these statistics and informs the first-hop router.

   In this case, if the first hop router has sent Multicast Data
   Notification message to the source system to inform the source system
   sending data, the first-hop router should periodically send Multicast
   Receiver Statistics messages to the source system synchronizing the
   receiver statistics.  In this way, the source system can perform
   analysis based on the receiver statistics, facilitating further
   optimization and scaling.

5.  Message Formats

   There are three types of IGMP and MLD messages associated with
   multicast source advertisement described in this document.

5.1.  Multicast Source Registration Message

   MSR message is sent by multicast source to request multicast data
   transmission service activation or by router responding to the
   request from the multicast source.

   MSR message has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Type (8 bits): IGMP and MLD messages types, they need to be
   registered by the IANA.

   E(E-bit): E-bit set to 1 to indicate that extension is present in the
   message.  E-bit set to 0 to indicate that extension is not present in
   the message.  The E-bit MUST be set to 1 to indicate that the
   extension is present.  Otherwise, it MUST be 0.

   I (Identity flag, 1 bit): The I flag set to 1 indicates that the
   message is sent by multicast source.  The I flag set to 0 indicates
   that the message is sent by router.

   R (Request flag, 1 bit): The R flag set to 1 indicates the request to
   activate transmission service.  The R flag set to 0 indicates
   revocation of the request.

   A (Authentication flag, 1 bit): The A flag set to 1 indicates success
   of request.  The A flag set to 0 indicates failure of request or
   revocation of the request.

   Checksum (16 bits): The Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of
   the one's complement sum of the whole IGMP or MLD message (the entire
   IP payload).  For computing the checksum, the Checksum field is set
   to zero.  When receiving packets, the checksum MUST be verified
   before processing a message.

   Multicast Source Address (Variable length): contains IPv4 or IPv6
   address of the multicast source requested.  If the MSR Message is

   Message is used in MLD, the length of the address is 128 bits.

   Start Timestamp (8 bytes): indicates the start time when the
   multicast source can provide data services.  Before this time, the
   multicast source cannot send data to multicast groups.

   Duration (1 byte): indicates the maximum duration that the multicast
   source can provide data services in a valid registration request.

   Credential (Variable length): is used for authorization of multicast
   sources.

   Extension: It is defined and described in
   [I-D.ietf-pim-igmp-mld-extension].It may contain a variable number of
   TLVs for flexible extension.

5.2.  Multicast Data Notification Message

   MDN message is sent by router to notify multicast source to start or
   stop sending multicast packets.  For different (S, G) tuples, the
   router needs to send multiple MDN messages.

   MDN message has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   registered by the IANA.

   C (Control flag, 1 bit): The C flag set to 1 indicates starting
   sending multicast packets.  The C flag set to 0 indicates stopping
   sending multicast packets.

   Checksum (16 bits): The Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of
   the one's complement sum of the whole IGMP/MLD message (the entire IP
   payload).  For computing the checksum, the Checksum field is set to
   zero.  When receiving packets, the checksum MUST be verified before
   processing a message.

   Multicast Group Address (Variable length): contains IPv4 or IPv6
   address of the multicast group requested.  If the MDN message is used
   in IGMP, the length of the address is 32 bits.  If the MDN message is
   used in MLD, the length of the address is 128 bits.

5.3.  Multicast Receiver Statistics Message

   MRS message is sent by router to multicast source to synchronize
   receiver statistics of a group.  For different (S, G) tuples, the
   router needs to send multiple MRS messages.

   MRS message has the following format:

    Figure 4: Topology of multicast source management for PCE based BIER

   For PCE based BIER, the transmission of multicast source registration
   and authorization and receiver information statistics depends on the
   PCRpt message and PCUpd message, defined in [RFC8231] and extended in
   [I-D.li-pce-based-bier], between the router and the controller.

   S1, S4, S8 and S10 in the figure are multicast source advertisement
   related processes.  S1 is the process by which multicast sources send
   messages and data to router.  S4, S8 and S10 are the process by which
   router send messages to multicast sources.  The other steps are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Step 1(S1): Source sends IGMP or MLD MSR message to R1 requesting to
   activate the multicast data transmission service.

   Step 2(S2): R1 sends multicast information registration to controller
   via PCRpt message.

   Step 3(S3): The controller sends PCUpd message to the R1, carrying
   authentication result.

   Step 4(S4): R1 sends authentication result to the source via IGMP or
   MLD MSR message.  Source will conduct subsequent processing based on
   the authentication result, such as reapplying after the failure of
   authentication.

   Step 5(S5): Receivers send IGMP or MLD messages to R7 requesting to
   join or leave a multicast group.

   Step 6(S6): R7 converts the IGMP or MLD messages of receivers into
   PCRpt message and send it to the controller.

   Step 7(S7): The controller sends PCUpd message to R1 to start or stop
   forwarding, carrying BitString.

   Step 8(S8): R1 sends IGMP or MLD MDN message to the source to notify
   the source sending multicast packets to the specific multicast group.

   Step 9(S9): Source sends multicast data to R1.

   Step 10(S10): R1 sends IGMP or MLD MSR messages with multicast
   receivers' statistics to the source periodically.
