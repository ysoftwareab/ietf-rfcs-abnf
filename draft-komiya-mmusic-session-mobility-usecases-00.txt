 Abstract  
     
    Session mobility allows a user to transfer an ongoing session from 
    one device to another device. This document attempts to summarize 
    the use cases for session mobility in multimedia applications. For 
    each use case, we provide possible motivation for the user to 
    initiate a session transfer from one device to another.

 1.Introduction 
     
    IP-based multimedia streaming applications like VoD (Video on 
    Demand) and real-time applications like interactive video games, 
    video-conferencing and video surveillance are important current or 
    potential usages of mobile devices. Mobile devices provide 
    convenience of mobility but have limited capability compared to 
    stationary devices; for example, smaller screens and computing 
    power than stationary devices. Proliferation of IP-based multimedia 
    capable devices and increasingly ubiquitous wireless access would 
    create more opportunities for interaction among devices, both 
    static and mobile. For maintaining the continuity of a user's 
    multimedia experience, it is expected that the service in mobile 
    device is transferred to another device in some situations, such 
    as, that the battery is almost discharged, or, user wants to use a 
    target device with a big display and/or a more suitable 
    network(Factors like bandwidth, cost, etc). On the other hand, when 
    a user leaves home or office, she may need to transfer a service 
    received by a stationary devices to her mobile device. Session 
    mobility allows a user to transfer an ongoing session from one 
    device to another device. 
     
    The general approach to achieve session mobility by SIP [1] 
    including the discovery process to locate transfer target devices and 
    signaling procedures  has been described in [6]. 3GPP also proposed

    session mobility as a part of the vision of 3GPP All-IP networks 
    [7]. 
     
    The above documents [6][7] have not presented use case scenarios in 
    detail. The purpose of this document is to describe and classify 
    use cases for session mobility in the context of multimedia 
    applications.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]. 
     
    Device: A software or hardware appliance, which is represented by a 
    SIP UA. 
     
    Session: A session is a set of senders and receivers and the data 
    stream flowing from senders to receivers, or, logically the linked 
    sending/receiving of data/control stream between the sender and 
    receiver. A multimedia conference is an example of a session. 
     
    Session Mobility: The ability for a communication session to be 
    moved from one device to another under the control of the user. 
     
    Session Transfer: The act of moving a communication session from 
    one device to another under the control of the user. 
     
 3. Use Cases 
     
    The use cases listed up in this section are applied in the IP-based 
    network environments. Currently, WLAN-based IP mobile phones are 
    already being used in some environments. IP-based wide-area mobile 
    communications services are expected to be deployed using a 
    technology like WiMax. Furthermore, the cellular industry is moving 
    toward the all-IP network architecture[7]. The following use cases 
    will be supported by such emerging IP-based wireless communications 
    technologies. 
  
 3.1  Transferring a whole session from one device to another device 
  
    First we deal with technically simpler cases - a session transfer 
    from a device to another device, and describe use cases classified 
    according to the reason or motivation by which a user may want to 
    invoke a session transfer. Some scenarios may be related to 
    multiple reasons.

                     Use Cases for Session Mobility      February 2006 
  
  
 3.1.1 Achieving user mobility  
  
    A user can avoid a loss of a session by transferring the session to 
    a mobile device when the user moves away from the current device 
    that is fixed. 
     
    A user, while driving, is listening to a music concert streamed 
    over the wireless Internet from an audio on demand service. She is 
    using an Internet radio device embedded in the dash board of the 
    car. After parking the car, she leaves the car for her home. Not 
    wanting to miss any part of the concert, she transfers the 
    streaming session from the vehicular Internet radio to her cell 
    phone that is capable of connecting to the Internet audio streaming 
    service. 
     
    Another scenario is as follows. A user is watching a live Cricket 
    match on her IP-TV at home, but has to leave for work. She simply 
    pushes a button on her mobile and transfers the live match from the 
    TV to her mobile without missing a shot. Thus, allowing her to 
    seamlessly experience multimedia content without affecting her 
    mobility. 
     
    Session transfer between fixed devices can be used to serve mobile 
    users, as well. For example, a user is watching a cricket match on a 
    TV in her living room. The sensors in her home track her location 
    using the mobile as reference. When the user moves from the living 
    room to a study-room, the session is transferred from the TV in the 
    living room to a TV in the study-room based on her location. Thus 
    the user can watch the game continuously. 

 3.1.2 Achieving better user perception of service 
  
    A user, in her office, receives a call on her cell phone. 
    Unfortunately the signal reception of the cell phone is not good 
    and thus the voice quality is poor. Instead of hanging up the phone 
    and calling back the other person, the user simply transfers the 
    call from the cell phone to a desktop VoIP phone in her office. The 
    desktop VoIP phone is wired to the office LAN that has a broadband 
    connection to the Internet, thus, the voice quality is better.  
     
    Another example scenario is as follows. A user finds an interesting 
    movie broadcasted over the wireless Internet while browsing the 
    Internet streaming services on her mobile phone in the backyard of 
    her house. The user enters the house's living room in which there 
    is a plasma TV with a big screen. The user sits on the sofa, turns 
    on the TV, and transfers the movie to the TV. Now the video and 
    audio qualities get much better as the video and audio stream 

  
  
 komiya                  Expires   August 2006                [Page 4] 
                     Use Cases for Session Mobility      February 2006 
  
  
    characteristics are adjusted for playback on the TV, taking 
    advantage of the larger bandwidth, screen and superior audio 
    capability available with the TV. 
    One more scenario is as follows. A user is using a PDA to see a 
    live soccer game broadcasted over wireless internet while walking 
    into her house. After he enters her room, she wants to free hand 
    without holding the PDA, so she moves to the TV, then pushes a 
    button on the PDA to transfer the service to the TV. It is 
    transferred immediately, she does not miss the scene of shoot 
    happened at that moment. Thus, she is not only able to leverage 
    larger display and resources of the TV but also utilize the broad-
    band internet connection if available. 

 3.1.3 Avoiding a loss of the current session because of resource 
 shortage 
     
    A user can avoid a loss of a session by transferring the session to 
    a new device when her current device cannot support the current 
    session any longer because of resource shortage. 
     
    A user, in her office, receives a call from an important customer 
    on her cell phone. During the video conference call, she finds that 
    her cell phone's battery is almost completely discharged. It is a 
    critical conversation for her business and thus she must continue 
    it without any disruption. So instead of asking her customer to 
    hang up the call and resume, she transfers the call to her desktop 
    phone by pushing the button on her cell phone. During the transfer, 
    without any media skipping or overlapping, the customer does not 
    know the user on a different phone. 

 3.1.4 Lowering the communication cost 
     
    Typically communications services over a cellular network are more 
    expensive than similar services over a wired network/unlicensed 
    wireless network (WLAN, etc)/enterprise networks. So if a call is 
    transferred from a cellular phone to a desktop phone, it is likely 
    that the user lowers the communication cost. 
     
    For example, when a user receives a call on her cell phone in the 
    office, the user transfers the call to the desktop phone in the 
    office without asking the caller to do anything. Such a session 
    transfer is much more acceptable and convenient than asking the 
    caller to hang up and wait for a callback. 
  
    In the above scenarios, the ongoing session established between 
    current device and corresponding node/media server is transferred 
    to a new device, which is depicted in figure 1. In figure 1, the

    current device and the new device connect with the different access 
    networks, whereas these two devices can also belong to the same 
    access network.

 3.2 Transferring a whole session from one device to multiple devices 
  
    While motivated with the same four reasons, a user or a group of 
    users may invoke session transfers that involve more than two 
    devices. 
     
    Here is an example scenario. A couple is accessing a live music 
    concert by a PDA while taking a car. After parking, they walk into 
    their house, both of them want to watch this service continuously, 
    but the wife wants to go to kitchen for preparing a meal whereas 
    her husband wants to go to his study-room for checking email. So 
    she pushes a button on her PDA to transfer the streaming service to 
    TV in kitchen and PC in study room.

    Please note that this scenario can be realized as a session fork 
    and a session transfer. That is, while the session is on the TV, a 
    replicated session is forked on the PDA. After that, the session on 
    the TV is transferred to the mobile phone. 
  
 3.3 Transfer with the Split of Audio and Video 
  
    A user may want to transfer a media stream or a subset of streams 
    in a session from a device to different devices. 
     
    Here is an example scenario. A user is playing an interactive game 
    on her mobile device over a WLAN in the house. The user wants to 
    play it on a big TV screen. But the TV is in a room where a family 
    member is working on a computer. The user does not want to bother 
    the family member by the sound of the game. So the user just 
    transfers the video stream to the TV, keeps the audio stream on the 
    mobile device.

    Another scenario is transferring the audio and the video streams to 
    two different devices separately. For example, a user starts a 
    video conference call by her mobile phone in an office. During the 
    conference, it becomes necessary to invite other project members to 
    the video conference. She moves to a conference room and transfers 
    the audio stream to a speaker system and the video stream to a 
    projector.
