1.  Introduction

   One motivation for the definition and use of YANG models is to allow
   'automation' of network configuration and operation.  Automation is
   particulary attractive in when offering services like Network as a
   Service (NAAS).  The word 'service' implies that an operator's
   customers have a high degree of flexibility in their use of the
   network resources provided by the service this leads to concepts such
   as Network on Demand (NoD).  Automation is key to the effective
   realisation services of this type.  Management/control of multilayer
   networks is also an area where automation may be useful.  SDN is a
   key part of the automation toolkit and there is an emerging
   realisation that (standard) information and data models are a key
   part of this technology.  It is important that we develop YANG models
   that support the needs of the application(s) and that we provide
   guidance as to their potential limitations as well.  We point some
   simple additions to the current TEAS TE-topology model
   [IETF-TEAS-TOPO] which are necessary to support some applications.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Layer networks

   We first illustrate a topology server/service in the context of a
   single layer network and then generalise to the multilayer case.  You
   need to be able to reference and, therefore, name the thing you
   attach to.

3.1.  Single Layer Network

   Figure 1 shows an illustration of the major components of a single
   layer network.  The managment, control and data planes are familiar
   and well understood concepts in IETF and elsewhere.  The 'Topology
   server' component is, perhaps, less familiar but its function is
   straightforward, it provides an interface - shown here as the
   'Topology Service Interface' (TSI) - through which clients may
   examine and, perhaps, control the network's topology.  The term
   'client(s)' is used here soley to conotate an entity that uses the
   Topology Service Interface without futher distinction.  There are
   many ways in which a topology service could be implemented and many
   protocols and encodings that could be used for one.  In this document
   consider the case where the objects can be manipulated via that
   inteface are described by the YANG model described in [IETF-TEAS-TE-
   TOPO].  Note that 'YANG models' are but one component of TSI

   In Figure 1 the nodes A and Z are border nodes of what may be an
   arbitrarily complex network which we illustrate and refer to on the
   line between them in the illustration as an 'abstract A-Z topology'.
   Further recognise that the notations CPA and CPZ stand for 'concrete'
   - to distinguish them from abstract - ports on nodes A and Z, i.e
   they are ports on those nodes which do not yet have links attached
   but which may eventually, in the case that is of particular interest
   to us here, have client equipment attached.

                                 Figure 1

   If we consider the layer network in Figure it should be clear that
   the topology server can only provide details of the topology of the
   network resources under its control.

3.2.  Multi Layer Networks

   Most networks or combinations of networks that are of practical
   interest have multiple layers and/or technolgies.  Figure 2 shows a
   hierarchical client/server arrangement of two networks;a specific
   example is a transport network - the server layer - providing
   connectivity to a - client layer - router network.  The 'concrete'
   ports of figure 1 have here become client ports that are connected to
   ports in the server layer (SPA, SPZ).

   Note that in general there may be multiple layers in such a hierarchy
   and we talk of being able to recurse through it i.e to find instances
   of the same model at the different layers.  In Figure 2 we show the
   bottom two layers only, the server layer is recognizable as a layer
   where the recursion terminates because there is no server layer (or
   topology server) below it whereas the client layer, in contrast, has

   In Figure 2 the 'concrete' ports refered to previously have become
   'client' ports and are connected to ports in the server layer (SPA,
   SPZ).  In the general case the client and server networks may use
   different technologies (e.g Etherenet and OTN) and in that case
   adaptation between those must be effected somewhere.

   In a multilayer network the ports we illustrate are on different
   sides of what is, in the general case, a policy boundary of some
   sort.  Configurations of this sort have been studied in a number of
   other organizations [ITU-T_G.8080] [OIF] and the ports and links
   joining them have various names therein e.g termination and
   adaptation point (TAP), transitional link etc.  The coordination,
   translation, resolution of TAP names between client and server layer
   control entities is often a clerical operation of some kind and is
   thus a suitable candidate for automation.

   It is well known that in SDN controllers provide interfaces to allow
   manipulation of objects representing the resources unders their
   control, such as those represented by the data model in [IETF-TEAS-
   TOPO].  These interfaces are used by other SDN software components
   known variously as higher level controllers, orchestrators or
   applications and these may be adjuncts or extensions of the
   capabilities of existing EMS, NMS and OSS components.

   We previously explained - in the single network layer example - that
   what we represent as an abstract link may be an arbitrarily complex
   network, the same applies at the server layer where what is shown as
   the server layer connection represents an arbitrarily complex path
   through that layer.

   Although we allow abstract representation of an arbitrarily complex
   network and recognise that modelling of such should, subject to
   policy etc, allow examination of more or less detail of the
   underlying (real) resources many applications can be satisfied using
   a very abstract model.  In the limit we can represent the network as
   an abstract or virtual switch.  We examine this case below.

4.  Optical network as a virtual switch

   In the case where a network operator is providing transport service
   for router interconnect a very simple i.e highly abstract
   representation of the topology may be adequate for a large class of
   customers, specifically we suggest that representing the (optical)
   network as a virutal siwtch is sufficient for many applications.

   In such a highly abstract and therefore simple model the topology
   service of the optical server layer represents client ports (SPA and
   SPZ in Figure 2) as connected ports on a abstract virtual switch.  By

   making the virtual switch abstract, in the sense that is used in
   [IETF-TEAS-TOPO] arbitrary detail can be provided, subject to policy,
   to those clients that require it.

   Support of this model requires a number of modifications to [IETF-
   TEAS-TOPO].  An object must be provided to model the ports; amongst
   the neccesary attributes are that the ports MUST be capable of being
   'named' and MUST support switching types as defined in [RFC7074].  A
   virtual switch object MUST be provided that supports port objects and
   connections between them.

   Future versions of this draft will provide YANG definitions for these
   objects.
