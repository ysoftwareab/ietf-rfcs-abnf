 1. Abstract
  
  
  This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
  image/tiff-f.  The baseline encoding is defined by [TIFF].
  
  
 2. TIFF-F Definition
  
  
  The Application F of TIFF (Tag Image File Format) is defined in
  detail <draft-ietf-fax-tiff-04.txt>.  The intended usage of this
  application content is for bi-level facsimile images.
  
  
 3. MIME Definition for TIFF-F
  
 3.1 image/tiff-f
  
  
  The image/tiff-f sub-type is defined to contain only TIFF-F fax
  content as defined in [TIFF-F].  It is recommended that applications
  which read and writeTIFF-F encoded fax images use this MIME content
  type.  Applications can then uniquely identify the contents as a
  TIFF-F image.
  
  
 3.2 image/tiff
  
  
  The image/tiff sub-type previously defined in RFC 1528 as containing
  TIFF 5.0 encoded image data was redefined in [TIFFREG] to refer to
  TIFF 6.0 encoded image data.  The TIFF 6.0 specification [TIFF] is a
  cleaner document and is compatible with previous TIFF 5.0 encoded
  image data.
  
  TIFF-F is a derivative of TIFF and as a result is a valid encoding
  for this content.  Applications may choose to use this more generic
  content type for TIFF-F image data if the unique identification of
  TIFF-F data is not important.
  
  The image/tiff-f MIME content type is functionally equivalent to
  "image/tiff;application=f", where application is an optional
  parameter.   The image/tiff-f content type permits TIFF-F image data
  to be uniquely identified using a MIME type and subtype, so that the
  application parameter (i.e. application=f) is not needed in this
  case.

 4.  IANA Registration
  
  
       To: ietf-types@iana.org
       Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/tiff-f
  
       MIME media type name: image
  
       MIME subtype name: tiff-f
  
       Required parameters: none
  
       Optional parameters: none
  
       Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred
  
       Security considerations: none
  
       Interoperability considerations:
  
          The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
          applications of TIFF may not be ubiquitous.  As a result,
          the absence of the application parameter would force
          implementations to decode and attempt to display the encoded
          TIFF image data in order to determine if it could actually
          be viewed.
  
       Published specification:
  
          TIFF (Tag Image File Format) - Application F is defined in
            <draft-ietf-fax-tiff-04.txt>.
  
       Applications which use this media type:
  
          Imaging, fax, messaging and multi-media
  
       Additional information:
  
         Note that the same file identifiers as TIFF are recommended
            for use with TIFF-F.
