          1.  Status of this Memo

          This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
          experimental extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this
          memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the editor.

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing SIP (SMDS Interface Protocol)
          objects.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
          three components.  They are:

               RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.  RFC 1212 defines a more concise description
               mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

               RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed
               objects for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213,
               defines MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on
               implementation experience and new operational
               requirements.

               RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
               network access to managed objects.


          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in [9].

          Internet Draft           SIP Objects               August 1991


          5.  Overview

          These objects are used when the particular media being used to
          realize an interface is a SIP interface.  At present, this
          applies to these values of the ifType variable in the
          Internet-standard MIB:

               sip (31)

          The definitions contained herein are based on the SIP
          specifications in Bellcore TR-TSV-000772 Issue 1, and TR-TSV-
          000773 Issue 1 [11,12].

          The SIP (SMDS Interface Protocol) protocol stack is defined as
          follows in [11]:

                              ____________________
                              |                   |
                              | SIP Level 3 [11]  |
                              |___________________|
                              |                   |
                              | SIP Level 2 [11]  |
                              |___________________|
                              |                   |
                              | PLCP [12]         |
                              |___________________|
                              |                   |
                              | DS1 or DS3 [12]   |
                              |___________________|

          The PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Procedure) adapts the
          capabilities of the transmission system (DS1 or DS3 formats)
          to the service expected by SIP Level 2.  Managed objects for
          DS1 and DS3 Interface Types are defined in [13] and [14]
          respectively (and amended in [17]), and can be utilized for
          management of SIP interfaces. This document defines managed
          objects for the remaining protocol levels of the SIP Interface
          Type.  This document does not specify objects for the
          management of subscription or configuration of Subscriber
          Network Interfaces (SNIs). Those objects are defined in [18].
          Bellcore requirements on these objects are specified in [16].
