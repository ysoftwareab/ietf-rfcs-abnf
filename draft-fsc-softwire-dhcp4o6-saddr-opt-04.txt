                DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Source Address Option
                draft-fsc-softwire-dhcp4o6-saddr-opt-04

Abstract

   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] describes a mechanism for dynamically
   configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms and
   deployment scenarios, the operator must learn the /128 IPv6 address
   that the client will use as the source of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This
   address, in conjunction with the IPv4 address and the Port Set ID
   allocated to the DHCP 4o6 client are used to create a binding table
   entry in the softwire tunnel concentrator.  This memo defines two
   DHCPv6 options used to communicate the source tunnel IPv6 address
   between the DHCP 4o6 client and server.  It also describes a method
   for configuring the client with the IPv6 address of the border router
   so that the softwire can be established.  It is designed to work in
   conjunction with the IPv4 address allocation process.

1.  Introduction

   Deterministic IPv4-over-IPv6 transition technologies require that
   elements are pre-configured with binding rules for routing traffic to
   clients.  This places a constraint on the location of the client's
   tunnel endpoint: The tunnel endpoint has to be a pre-determined
   prefix which is usually be configured on the home gateway device.
   [RFC7597] describes a DHCPv6 based mechanism for provisioning such
   deterministic softwires.

   A dynamic provisioning model, such as using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   [RFC7341] allows much more flexibility in the location of the IPv4-
   over-IPv6 tunnel endpoint, as the IPv6 address is dynamically
   signalled back to the service provider so that the corresponding

Internet-Draft            DHCP 4o6 SADDR option            November 2015


   tunnel configuration in the border router (BR) can be created.  The
   DHCP 4o6 client and tunnel client could be run on end devices
   attached to any routable IPv6 prefix allocated to an end-user,
   located anywhere within an arbitrary home network topology.  Dynamic
   allocation also helps to optimize IPv4 resource usage as only clients
   which are currently active are allocated IPv4 addresses.

   This document describes a mechanism for provisioning dynamically
   created softwires using DHCPv4 over DHCPv4 (DHCP 4o6), including
   proivisioning the client with the address of the softwire border
   router (BR) and informing the service provider of client's binding
   between the dynamically allocated IPv4 address and Port Set ID and
   the IPv6 address that the softwire Initiator will use for accessing
   IPv4-over-IPv6 services.

   It is used with DHCP 4o6 message flows to communicate the binding
   over the IPv6-only network.  The service provider can then use this
   binding information to provision other functional elements in their
   network accordingly, e.g. using the client's binding information to
   synchronise the binding table in the border router.

2.  Applicability

   The mechanism described in this document is only suitable for use for
   provisioning softwire clients via DHCP 4o6.  The options described
   here are only applicable within the DHCP 4o6 message exchange
   process.  Current mechanisms suitable for extending to incorporate
   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 with dynamic IPv4 address leasing include
   [RFC7597] and [RFC7596].

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Solution Overview

   The solution in this document is intended for the dynamic
   establishment of IPv4-over-IPv6 softwires.  DHCP 4o6 [RFC7341]
   supports dynamically allocating (shared) IPv4 address.  For a
   softwire to be successfully created, the IPv4 address has to be
   linked to the client's IPv6 tunnel source address.  Within this
   process, the DHCP 4o6 client uses a DHCPv6 option to signal its
   tunnel source IPv6 address to the DHCP 4o6 server so that the
   operator's provisioning system can create the binding and configure
   the tunnel concentrator accordingly.

Internet-Draft            DHCP 4o6 SADDR option            November 2015


   Two new DHCPv6 options are defined in this memo:
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT and OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR.  They are
   intended to be used alongside the normal DHCPv4 IPv4 address
   allocation message flow in the context of DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   [RFC7341].  If a DHCP 4o6 client supports this mechanism, it MUST
   include the code of OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT in the Option Request
   Option (ORO) [RFC3315] when requesting IPv4 configuration through
   DHCP 4o6.

   The communication of parameters between the client and server is a
   two-way process: OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT is optionally used by the
   DHCP 4o6 server to indicate to the client a preferred IPv6 prefix for
   binding the received IPv4 configuration and sourcing tunnel traffic.
   This may be necessary if there are multiple IPv6 prefixes in use in
   the customer network (e.g.  ULAs), or if the specific IPv4-over-IPv6
   transition mechanism requires the use of a particular prefix for any
   reason.  When the client has selected an IPv6 address to bind the
   IPv4 configuration to, it passes the address back to the DHCP 4o6
   server through OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR.

4.1.  Providisioning the BR Address

   To configure a softwire, the initiator also requires the IPv6 address
   of the BR.  Section 4.2 of [RFC7598] defines option 90
   (OPTION_S46_BR) for this purpose, but mandates that the option can
   only be used when when encapsulated within one of the softwire
   container options: OPTION_S46_CONT_MAPE, OPTION_S46_CONT_MAPT or
   OPTION_S46_CONT_LW.  From Section 3 of [RFC7598]:

      "Softwire46 DHCPv6 clients that receive provisioning options that
      are not encapsulated in container options MUST silently ignore
      these options."

   This document updates [RFC7598] to remove this restriction for DHCPv6
   option 90 (OPTION_S46_BR) allowing it to appear directly within the
   list of options in the client's ORO request and directly withing
   subsequent messages sent by the DHCPv6 server.

5.  IPv6/IPv4 Binding Message Flow

   The following diagram shows the client/server message flow and how
   the options defined in this document are used.  In each step, the
   relevant DHCPv4 message is given above the arrow and the relevant
   options below the arrow.  The DHCPv4 messages are encapsulated in
   DHCPv4-query or DHCPv4-response messages, and those options are
   included in the 'options' field of the DHCPv4-query or
   DHCPv4-response message.

                      IPv6/IPv4 Binding Message Flow

   A client attempting dynamic softwire configuration includes the
   option code for OPTION_BR_PREFIX, OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT in the
   DHCPv6 ORO in all DHCPv4-query messages it sends.

   When a DHCP 4o6 Server replies with a DHCPOFFER message, it SHOULD
   include an OPTION_S46_BR.  It MAY also include
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT, which is used to indicate a preferred
   prefix that the client should use to bind IPv4 configuration to.  If
   this option is received, the client MUST perform a longest prefix
   match between cipv6-prefix-hint and all prefixes/addresses in use on
   the device.  If a match is found, the selected prefix MUST then be
   used to bind the received IPv4 configuration to.  If the client
   doesn't receive OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT the client can select any
   valid /128 IPv6 prefix to use.

   OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR is used by the client to inform the DHCP 4o6
   Server which IPv6 address the IPv4 configuration has been bound to.
   The client MUST put the selected IPv6 address into this option and
