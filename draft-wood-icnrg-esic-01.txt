                   Encrypted Sessions In CCNx (ESIC)
                        draft-wood-icnrg-esic-01

Abstract

   This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside an
   encrypted session between peers that share a traffic secret, such as
   that which is derived from [CCNxKE].  The peers create an outer
   naming context to identify the encryption session in one direction
   between the consumer and the producer.  The consumer sends encrypted
   Interest messages to the producer, who responds with encrypted
   Content Objects.  Inside the outer context, the consumer sends
   Interests with different names, which the producer may respond to or
   may send InterestReturns for.  There does not need to be a naming
   relationship between the outer names and the inner names.  The inner
   content is still protected by normal CCNx authentication mechanisms
   and possiby encrypted under other schemes.

1.  Introduction

   CCNx packets [MESSAGES] contain a fixed header, optional hop-by-hop
   headers, a CCNx Message, and a validation section.  Encrypted
   Sessions in CCNx (ESIC) describes how to to transport encrypted CCNx
   packets inside other CCNx packets.  The outer packet (the wrapper)
   uses a CCNx name that identifies the encrypted session while the
   inner (encrypted) portion remains hidden and private to an outside
   observer.

Internet-Draft                  CCNx-ESIC                 September 2017


   ESIC defines a new field Encapsulated (T_ENCAP) that may occur in
   both an Interest (T_INTEREST) and Content Object (T_OBJECT).  The
   T_ENCAP field contains the encryption of the inner CCNx Packet.

   Because the use of an outer CCNxPacket, the total packet length of
   the inner CCNxPacket may need to be limited to less than the maximum
   of 64 KB.  ESIC allows the use of a compressor before the encryptor,
   so it is likely that a packet that would overflow the 64 KB limit
   could be compressed by enough to allow for an outer CCNxPacket.  This
   consideration for the PacketLength is separate from concerns about
   path MTU.

   It is a requirement of ESIC that one inner packet fit in one outer
   packet.  This is because ESIC does not define a method to issue extra
   outer interests to fetch extra outer content objects.  It relies
   entirely on Interests generated by the consumer application.

   ESIC defines a control channel within the outer context by using
   special names with the inner packets.  These names allow signaling
   between the two encryption endpoints for features such as alerts and
   rekeying requests.

   ESIC defines how to use a traffic secret (TS), such as derived from
   CCNxKE, to encrypt multiple packets in a consumer-producer session.
   Each direction will use separate derived keys.  If one wishes to have
   a reverse traffic flow (interests from producer fetching content
   objects from the consumer), then one must share a second TS and use
   it with the roles reversed, but otherwise it works exactly as in the
   first case.

   The mechanism by which this symmetric key is obtained is outside the
   scope of this document; These keys could be pre-shared or derived
   from an online key-exchange protocol [CCNxKE].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used:

   o  Inner Packet: A fully-formed CCNx packet (fixed header through
      validation) that is carried encrypted inside a T_ENCAP TLV.

   o  Outer Packet: A fully-formed CCNx packet that carries the outer
      context of an encrypted session.

   o  Outer Name: The name of the outer packet.

   o  Inner Name: The name of the inner packet (not visible in
      transport).

   o  Control channel: the use of Inner Packets to convey control
      signaling between encryption endpoints using a special Inner Name.

2.  Stateless packet keys

   ESIC assumes that the consumer and producer share a Traffic Secret
   (TS), usually derived as per CCNxKE.  Regardless of how the TS is
   derived (TODO: it needs to meet some so-far unstated requirements),
   there are four secrets derived from the TS, as per CCNxKE
   Section 9.5.  This specifies how to generate the Client Write Key,
   Server Write Key, Client Write IV, and Server Write IV.

   The AEAD nonce (IV) is derived as specified in [TLS13].  In
   particular, the length of the IV for each AEAD operation is set to
   max(8 bytes, N_MAX), where N_MIN must be at least 8 bytes [RFC5116].
   With this length, the nonce is initialized by:

   1.  Padding the 64-bit per-packet AEAD sequence number to the left
       with zeroes so that its length is equal to the IV length.

   2.  This padded sequence number is then XORed with the consumer or
       producer IV, depending on the role.

   TODO: Should we allow CCNxKE to specify the starting chunk number so
   it does not always start at 0?  It would need to be encoded in the
   MoveToken.

3.  Inner and Outer Contexts

   The inner context is a CCNx packet with meaning to the consumer and
   producer.  They may be clear text or they make use additional
   encryption, such as group keying, broadcast encryption, homomorphic
   encryption, or something else.  The consumer sends an Interest packet
   with an Inner Name (plus other optional fields as normal) and
   expectes to get back a Content Object or InterestReturn packet with
   corresponding name and fields.

   The outer context names the encryption session and sequences packets.
   ESIC does not expect a one-to-one correspondence of outer name and
   inner name.  If a consumer, for example, sends 3 interests with outer
   names NO1, NO2, NO3 and inner names NI1, NI2, and NI3, the producer
   can return those names in any order.  It could put content objects
   with name NI3 in NO1, NI1 in NO2, and NI2 in NO3.  ESIC does expect

   normal CCNx processing rules to be followed for the inner packets,
   therefore we would expect at most one inner packet returned for each
   inner Interest.  That inner packet could be either a Content Object
   or Interest Return.

3.1.  Outer Context Names

   The outer context name is a routable prefix PREFIX followed by a
   session ID (SID) followed by a ChunkNumber (Chunk).  The chunk number
   is a monotonically increasing number.  The outer name is clear text,
   visible to all observers.

   The PREFIX and SID are derived outside of ESIC.  In normal use with
   CCNxKE, the PREFIX is either the same prefix as used in the key
   exchagne or it is derived from within CCNxKE from Prefix2 or the
   MoveToken.  The SID is created by the producer and given to the
   consumer inside CCNxKE.

   OuterName := ccnx:/PREFIX/SID=sid/CHUNK=chunk

   Chunk numbers are limited to 8 bytes and do not wrap around.  When
   the consumer gets near the end of the sequence number space, it must
   request a re-keying via the control channel.  Because CCNx in a pull-
   driven model, the consumer is reponsible for the chunk number and
   thus responsible for requesting the re-keying.  The producer may also
   request a re-keying for its own reasons.

3.2.  Outer Packet

   The outer packet will have a Fixed Header, per hop headers, a CCNx
   Message with the Outer Name, and a Validation section (ValidationAlg
   and ValidationPayload).  The outer packet is visible to 3rd parties
   in its entirety.  Only the 'value' of T_ENCAP TLV field inside the
   CCNx Message is encrypted.  The T_ENCAP TLV Value is the AEAD
   'plaintext' that will be converted to the 'ciphertext'.  In the outer
   packet, only the CCNx Message and the ValidationAlg are covered by
   the authentication token

   The Outer Packet has a Validation section.  The ValidationAlg will
   have a 0-length ValidationType of T_SESSION, which indidates that the
   encryption context must be derived from the SID in the name.

   The Associated Data (in AEAD) covered by the validation output is
   from the beignning of the CCNx Message up to but not including the
   T_ENCAP Value concatendated with the ValidationAlg TLV.  That is, it
   skips the T_ENCAP TLV Value.

   The ValidationPayload contains the AEAD authentication token.

   If the Producer cannot satisfy an Inner Packet Interest, it will
   encapsualte an InterestReturn inside an OuterPacket of PacketType
   ContentObject.  That is, the InterestReturn is end-to-end signaling
   about the inner context.

   If the Producer has an error with the Outer Context, it may return an
   InterestReturn for the outer context as normal for Interest
   processing.

3.2.1.  Consumer Outer Packet

   The outer packet from the consumer to the producer will always be of
   PacketType Interest.  They may have any of the normal Interest per-
   hop headers (e.g.  InterestLifetime), which will be visible to 3rd
   parties and not protected by the encryption or authentication.

   The Outer Context has a T_INTEREST message type, which contains a
   T_NAME of the Outer Name.  It may have other additional metadata in
   clear text.  The T_INTEREST container is protected by the encryption
   authenticator.  Finally, the T_INTEREST has a T_ENCAP field that
   contains the encryption of the Inner Packet.  The encryption will use
   the algorithm negotiated as part of the SID (i.e.  AES-GCM).

3.2.2.  Producer Outer Packet

   The producer will only send PacketType ContentObject back to the
   consumer.  The Inner packet may be either an InterestReturn or a
   ContentObject corresponding to the Inner Packet interest.

   The outer packet may have per-hop headers (e.g.
   RecommendedCacheTime) that affect the encrypted packet.  These are
   independent from the inner Per Hop headers.  The outer MessageType is
   always T_OBJECT.  It may have normal metadata for a content object,
   such as ExpiryTime, which affect only the outer packet.  Finally, it
   has a T_ENCAP that contains the wrapped inner Packet.

3.3.  Processing Chain

   The processing chain from the Source to the Sink is shown below.  The
   compression/decompression stages are optional and are not strongly
   tied to the encrypted session.  If used, we assume the compression
   protocol is session specific to avoid state snooping (e.g. such as in
   CRIME attack).

   o  Source: The source of an Inner Packet.

   o  Compressor: Optional component to reduce the size before
      encryption.

   o  Encrypter/Framer: Creates the ciphertext of the CCNx(z)packet to
      produce the T_ENCAP, constructs the outer packet, computes the
      authentication token and generates the ValidationPayload.

   o  Channel: Carries the wireformat outer packet

   o  Deframer/Decrypter: Verifies the authenticator, decrypts the
      T_ENCAP, and passes the Inner Packet to the Decompressor.

   o  Decompressor: Optional component to expand the inner packet

   o  Sink: The sink of an Inner Packet.

   The Encrypter/Framer will generate outer names with sequential outer
   name chunk numbers.

   The Deframer/Decryptor will extract the SID and chunk number from the
   outer name and use those to create the packet key (see below).  Using
   the packet key, it will verify the authentication token and if
   successful decrypt the T_ENCAP.  The output of the T_ENCAP will then
   be passed to the Sink.

3.4.  Transport State Machine

   ESIC uses a state machine to manage the ephemeral session such that
   the Producer knows when the Consumer is finished with the SID.  It
   also will try to re-request packets that fail authentication before
   sending its own InterestReturn up the Sink.

   The protocol begins with each side knowing the four keys (see
   Stateless Packet Keys below), the Session ID (SID), and the routable
   prefix PREFIX.

   The receiving process uses a replay buffer to prevent replay attacks.
   The buffer tracks the last N out-of-order verified chunks plus the
   cumulative verified chunk number.  TODO: Sort this out how to avoid
   replay attacks without requiring reliable in-order delivery.

   Protocol of Encrypter/Framer:

   o  Initialize: set NextChunkNumber = 0, State = Waiting

   o  Waiting: Wait for packet from Source (or compressor).  On packet
      receive, State = Send

   o  Send:

      *  Generate packet key for NextChunkNumber

      *  Create outer packet with name /PREFIX/SID=sid/
         CHUNK=NextChunkNumber and the input packet as cleartext in the
         T_ENCAP.

      *  Run the AEAD scheme authenticating and encrypting.  Note the
         prior description of the split Associated Data before and after
         the plaintext.

      *  Increment NextChunkNumber

      *  Send the packet

      *  State = Waiting

   Protocol of the Deframer/Decrypter:

   o  Initialize the replay buffer to empty, State = Waiting.

   o  Waiting: wait for packet, on input from channel State = Receive

   o  Receive:

      *  Extract the SID and ChunkNumber from name

      *  If replay, drop

      *  Authenticate the packet

         +  If failed on producer, send failure message to Sink so it
            can send end-to-end InterestReturn back over channel (if
            desired) with "Y Error" (TBD)

      *  Add packet to replay buffer

      *  Decrypt packet

      *  Pass decrypted packet to Sink/Source (or decompressor)

4.  Control Channel

   The consumer and producer will need to exchange signaling about the
   encryption context.  Control and data traffic should be
   indistinguishable to an external observer.  Therefore, all control
   signaling is done within the same outer names as data traffic.

   Control signaling is done with a normal Inner Packet that pushes data
   to the other side.  We use an Interest with an Inner Name of the form
   shown below, where '_direction_' is 'up' from the consumer to
   producer or 'down' for the producer to consumer.  This allows each
   side to maintain its own sequence number space in the 'seqnum'.  This
   is similar to the use of the sequence number in the DTLS record
   layer.

   Like DTLS, ESIC control messages are unreliable, though they are
   uniquely named.

   The payload of the control Interest uses a TLV equivalent of the TLS
   record format for handshake and alert messages.  Application data is
   never communicated in these records, as they use an Inner Packet with
   a different Inner Name.  Inside the payload, a TLV type of Alert (21)
   or Handshake (22) indicates the purpose of the TLV value.  One may
   concatenate multiple records in to one payload.

   ControlName := ccnx:/localhost/esic/_direction_/SID=sid/SEQNUM=seqnum

4.1.  ESIC Control Packets

   A control packet is a CCNx Interest Inner Packet.  The name of the
   control packet is as above in the /localhost/esic namesapce.  The
   Payload of the Interest is the actual data.

   The ESIC control packet SHOULD be padded out to a length that is
   indistinguishable from other traffic in the given _direction_.

Internet-Draft                  CCNx-ESIC                 September 2017


   The Payload of the Interest contains a set of TLV records using the
   normal CCNx TLV encoding.  The TLV types and values are defined in
   the next section.

   In the 'up' direction from the consumer to the producer, a control
   packet can be inserted into the Interest stream as normal.  The
   producer may use this extra outer name to return its own control
   message or send a "no-op" back to consume the extra name.

   In the 'down' direction from the producer to the consumer, there is
   no pre-allocated outer name available.  The producer can only send
   the consumer a control message if the consumer has outstanding
   Interests up to the producer.  If there is one or more oustanding
   interests in the outer name space, the producer normally would send a
   Content Object or Interest Return corresponding to some inner name.
   In this case, the producer would instead inject a control packet
   Interest in the downstream.  This means the producer is now short one
   outer Interest in the upstream direction.  Therefore, whenever the
   Deframer/Decrypter sees a control message in the downstream
   direction, it MUST insert an upstream "no-op" packet, padded out to
   statistically undetectable length, to give the producer back a
   missing name slot.

   We allow one ESIC control packet in one outer packet.  However, we
   allow multiple Alert messages to be encoded in the payload, so long
   as it remains indistinguishable from other packets in the given
   _direction_.

   Example from a consumer to a producer, where "NO" means "name outer"
   and "NI" means "name inner".

   Consumer                                   Producer
      | >------- NO1 : NI1 (Interest) -------->   |
      | >------- NO2 : NI2 (Interest) -------->   |
      | <------- NO1 : NI1 (ContentObject) ---<   |
      | >------- NO3 : NI /local/esic/up/2/1 ->   |
      | <------- NO3 : no-op -----------------<   | (no-op)
      | <------- NO2 : NI2 (ContentObject) ---<   |

   Here is an example from a producer to a consumer.  The producer uses
   the second avaialble name NO2 to send a control message to the
   consumer.  The consumer must then send a no-op packet back up to the
   producer so it can return the final data packet NI2 inside NO3.

4.2.  ESIC Control Messages

   ESIC adopts the TLS 1.3 Alert Protocol for its control messages.  The
   TLV type of the message inside the control packet payload is taken
   from the enum AlertDescription.  As per TLS 1.3, fatal Alert messages
   are an immediate close of the ESIC session.

   As per TLS 1.3, each party MUST send a close_nofity message closing
   the write side of the connection.  In ESIC, this means that when a
   consumer is done requesting data, it should send a final
   close_notify.  The producer should then use this outer name to send
   back its own close_notify.  If for some reason the producer must
   close before the consumer, it should inject its own close_notify
   discarding all remaining data and the consumer should send back
   upstream a close_notify.

   The KeyUpdate messages function as per TLS 1.3 Sec 6.3.5.3.  Either
   side may generate a KeyUpdate message and begin transmitting with the
   new key.  The other side must update their own key and issue its own
   KeyUpdate message.

5.  The ESIC API

   In this section we describe the ESIC API.  Before doing so, we
   highlight some details that molded the API for both consumers and
   consumers.

   o  Encrypted sessions are bound to names instead of addresses.
      Consequently, in addition to a set of trusted keys, sessions
      between a consumer and producer require only a name to be created.

   o  Sessions are created by an active consumer with a passive peer
      (producer).  Thus, the API must reflect these roles.

   o  Consumers send and receive whole CCNx messages over a session.
      Thus, simple read and write functions must be exposed via the API.

   o  Sessions are not full duplex by default.  A producer must specify
      in its ServerConfiguration construct that it wishes to send
      interests to the consumer.  To maintain transparency, the modality
      of the resulting session is not reflected in the API.

   These observations are distilled in the following ESIC API.

# @Consumer: create a secure session with a producer
CCNxSecureSession *ccnxSecureSession_Connect(CCNxPortal *portal,
    PARCIdentity *identity, CCNxName *servicePrefix);

# @Producer: create a passive listener
CCNxSecureSession *ccnxSecureSession_CreateServer(CCNxPortal *portal,
    CCNxKeyExchangeConfig *config, CCNxName *servicePrefix);

# @Producer: accept uni- and bi-directional sessions
CCNxSecureSession *ccnxSecureSession_AcceptConnection(CCNxSecureSession *session);
CCNxSecureSession *ccnxSecureSession_AcceptBidirectionalConnection(CCNxSecureSession *session);

# Send a CCNx message
# Override the outer name with the `response` parameter if needed
void ccnxSecureSession_SendMessage(CCNxSecureSession *session,
    CCNxTlvDictionary *message, const CCNxStackTimeout *timeout, CCNxName *response);

# Receive and decapsulate a CCNx message
# Store the outer name in the `response` parameter.
CCNxMetaMessage *ccnxSecureSession_ReceiveMessage(CCNxSecureSession *session,
    const CCNxStackTimeout *timeout, CCNxName **response);

6.  Security Considerations

   It may be possible for an observer to identify which outer packets
   contain a control (alert) message if the ACK response time shows
   significant statistical timing different from the normal flow of
   messages.

   TODO.
