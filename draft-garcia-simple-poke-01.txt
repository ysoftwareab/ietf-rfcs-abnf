Internet-Draft                    POKE                     February 2009


1.  Introduction

   Some existing messaging platforms include the capability to send a
   message to a user requesting his attention (e.g.  XMPP [XEP-0224]).
   This feature is usually known as poke, nudge or buzz, and in desktop
   applications the notification is usually implemented using a
   combination of sound and the vibration of chat windows.

   This document describes the XML message format to encode this
   attention request.

   This message can be used inside an instant messaging session (for
   example a MSRP session) or as a standalone message (for example in a
   SIP MESSAGE).  In session mode, the poke message is sent as part of
   the messaging stream and its usage is negotiated just like any other
   media type in that stream, with details depending on the session mode
   protocol.

   The receiver of this message can present it to the user in different
   ways depending on the device capabilities and the user preferences.
   The message format does not include support to specify sender
   preferences for the realization of the attention request.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Message Content

   The only XML element of the message is the poke element.  This is the
   root element of the message and doesn't define any additional
   attribute.  The schema (Section 3) should be consulted for the
   normative message format.

   In order to include additional functionality, the XML schema can be
   extended in future documents.  Additional elements MUST use their own
   namespaces and MUST be designed such that receivers can safely ignore
   such extensions.  Adding elements to the namespace defined in this
   document is not permitted.

   This is the example of a poke message:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <poke xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:im-poke"/>

3.  XML Document Format


   <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
     targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:im-poke"
     xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:im-poke"
     elementFormDefault="qualified"
     attributeFormDefault="unqualified">
     <xs:element name="poke">
       <xs:complexType>
         <xs:sequence>
           <xs:any namespace="##other" processContents="lax"
             minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
         </xs:sequence>
       </xs:complexType>
     </xs:element>
   </xs:schema>


4.  Security Considerations

   The poke message is a specialized type of instant messaging, all the
   security considerations for the instant messages also applies to the
   poke messages.

   Pokes rate MUST be controlled and limited in the receiving side to
   minify the effect of malicious nodes sending these messages too often
   (the limit is an implementor decission).


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Content-Type Registration for 'application/im-poke+xml'

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/
      im-poke+xml
   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: im-poke+xml
   Required parameters: (none)
   Optional parameters: charset; Indicates the character encoding of
      enclosed XML.  Default is UTF-8.
   Encoding considerations: Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit characters,
      depending on the character encoding used.  See [RFC3023],
      section 3.2.
   Security considerations: This content type is designed to carry
      information about current user activity, which may be considered
      private information.  Appropriate precautions should be adopted to
      limit disclosure of this information.
   Interoperability considerations: This content type provides a common
      format for sending attention requests.
   Published specification: RFC XXXX
   Applications which use this media type: Instant messaging systems.
   Additional information: none
   Person & email address to contact for further information: Gustavo
      Garcia, ggb@tid.es
   Intended usage: LIMITED USE
   Author/Change controller: This specification is a work item of the
      IETF SIMPLE working group, with the mailing list address
      simple@ietf.org.
   Other information: This media type is a specialization of
      application/xml [RFC3023], and many of the considerations
      described there also apply to application/im-poke+xml.
