          Revision to Capability Codes Registration Procedures
         draft-scudder-idr-capabilities-registry-change-01.txt

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration
   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range
   formerly designated "Reserved for Private Use" is divided into three
   new ranges, respectively designated as "First Come First Served",
   "Experimental" and "Reserved".

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5492] designates the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as
   "Reserved for Private Use".  Subsequent experience has shown this to
   be not only useless, but actively confusing to implementors.  BGP
   Capability Codes do not meet the criteria for "Reserved for Private
   Use" described in [RFC5226] S. 4.1.  An example of a legitimate
   "private use" code point might be a BGP community [RFC1997] value
   assigned for use within a given AS, but no analogous use of
   Capabilities exists.

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for
   the range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in
   [RFC5226]:

   128-238: First Come First Served

   239-254: Experimental Use

   255: Reserved

   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,
   remaining "IETF Review" and "First Come First Served" respectively.

2.  Discussion

   The reason for providing an Experimental Use range is to preserve a
   range for use during early development.  Although there are few
   practical differences between Experimental and Private Use, the
   change both makes it clear that code points from this space should
   not be used long-term or in shipping products, and reduces the
   consumption of the scarce Capability Code space expended for this
   purpose.  Once classified as Experimental, it should be considered

   difficult to reclassify the space for some other purpose in the
   future.

   The reason for reserving the maximum value is that it may be useful
   in the future if extension of the number space is needed.

   Finally, we note that since the range 128-255 was formerly
   ungoverned, implementors may have chosen to use code points within
   that range prior to publication of this document.  Although it is not
   possible to know what code points implementors may have used,
   experience suggests 128 is a likely value.  For that reason, this
   document asks IANA to reserve that value, to minimize the risk of
   conflict with existing implementations.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to revise the "Capability Codes" registry as
   described in Section 1.  Since the range 128-238 is adjacent to the
   existing First Come First Served range, after this change the entire
   First Come First Served range will be 64-238.

   IANA is requested to allocate value 128 as "Reserved".

4.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing [RFC5492] and
   [RFC4271].
