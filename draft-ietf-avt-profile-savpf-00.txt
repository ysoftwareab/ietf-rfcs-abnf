   An RTP profile (SAVP) is defined for secure real-time 
   communications, and another profile (AVPF) is specified to provide 
   timely feedback from the receivers to a sender.  This memo defines 
   the combination of both profiles to enable secure RTP 
   communications with feedback.

1  Introduction 
    
   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/RTCP) [1] and the associated 
   profile for audiovisual communications with minimal control [2] 
   define mechanisms for transmitting time-based media across an IP 
   network.  RTP provides means to preserve timing and detect packet 
   losses, among other things, and RTP payload formats provide for 
   proper framing of (continuous) media in a packet-based environment.  
   RTCP enables receivers to provide feedback on reception quality and 
   allows all members of an RTP session to learn about each other. 
    
   The RTP specification provides only rudimentary support for 
   encrypting RTP and RTCP packets.  SRTP [4] defines an RTP profile

   ("SAVP") for secure RTP media sessions, defining methods for proper 
   RTP and RTCP packet encryption, integrity and replay protection. 
   The initial negotiation of SRTP and its security parameters needs 
   to be done out of band, using e.g. the Session Description Protocol 
   (SDP) [6] together with extensions for conveying keying material 
   [7][8]. 
    
   The RTP specification also provides limited support for timely 
   feedback from receivers to senders, typically by means of reception 
   statistics reporting in somewhat regular intervals depending on the 
   group size, the average RTCP packet size, and the available RTCP 
   bandwidth.  The extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback 
   ("AVPF") [3] allows receivers statistically to provide immediate 
   feedback while maintaining the average RTCP data rate for all 
   senders.  As for SAVP, the use of AVPF and its parameters need to 
   be negotiated out-of-band by means of SDP [6] and the extensions 
   defined in [3]. 
    
   Both SRTP and AVPF are RTP profiles and need to be negotiated.  
   This implies that either one or the other may be used, but both 
   profiles cannot be negotiated for the same RTP session (using one 
   SDP session level description).  However, using secure 
   communications and timely feedback together is desirable.  
   Therefore, this document specifies a new RTP profile ("SAVPF") that 
   combines the features of SAVP and AVPF. 
    
   As SAVP and AVPF are largely orthogonal, the combination of both is 
   mostly straightforward.  No sophisticated algorithms need to be 
   specified in this document.  Instead, reference is made to both 
   existing profiles and only the implications of their combination 
   and possible deviations from rules of the existing profiles are 
   described as is the negotiation process. 
    
    
   1.1  Definitions 
    
   The definitions of [1], [2], [3], and [4] apply.  
    
   The following definitions are specifically used in this document: 
    
   RTP session: 
        An association among a set of participants communicating with 
        RTP as defined in [1]. 
         
   (SDP) media description: 
        This term refers to the specification given in a single m= 
        line in an SDP message.  An SDP media description may define 
        only one RTP session.  Grouping of m= lines in SDP may cause 
        several SDP session level descriptions to define (alternatives 
        of) the same RTP session for the same media type.

   Media session: 
        A media session refers to a collection of SDP media 
        descriptions that are semantically grouped to represent 
        alternatives of the same communications means.  Out of such a 
        group, one will be negotiated or chosen for a communication 
        relationship and the corresponding RTP session will be 
        instantiated.  Or the media session will be rejected. 
        In the simplest case, a media session is equivalent to an SDP 
        media description and equivalent to an RTP session. 
         
    
   1.2  Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
   [5]. 
    
    
2  SAVPF Rules 
    
   SAVP is defined as an intermediate layer between RTP (following the 
   regular RTP profile AVP) and UDP.  This yields a two layer 
   hierarchy within the Real-time Transport Protocol.  In SAVPF, the 
   upper (AVP) layer is replaced by the extended RTP profile for 
   feedback (AVPF).   
    
   AVPF modifies timing rules for transmitting RTCP packets and adds 
   extra RTCP packet formats specific to feedback.  These functions 
   are independent of whether or not RTCP packets are subsequently 
   encrypted and/or integrity protected.  The functioning of the AVPF 
   layer remains unchanged in SAVPF. 
    
   The AVPF profile derives from [1] the (optional) use of the 
   encryption prefix for RTCP. The encryption prefix MUST NOT be used 
   within the SAVPF profile (it is not used in SAVP, as it is only 
   applicable to the encryption method specified in [1]).  
    
   The SAVP part uses extra fields added to the end of RTP and RTCP 
   packets and executes cryptographic transforms on (some of) the 
   RTP/RTCP packet contents.  This behavior remains unchanged in 
   SAVPF.  The average RTCP packet size calculation done by the AVPF 
   layer for timing purposes MUST take into account the fields added 
   by the SAVP layer. 
    
   The SRTP part becomes only active whenever the RTP or RTCP was 
   scheduled by the "higher" AVPF layer or received from the transport 
   protocol, irrespective of its timing and contents.

   2.1  Packet Formats 
    
   AVPF defines extra packet formats to provide feedback information.  
   Those extra packet formats defined in [3] (and further ones defined 
   elsewhere for use with AVPF) MAY be used with SAVPF.   

    
   SAVP defines a modified packet format for SRTP and SRTCP packets 
   that essentially consists of the RTP/RTCP packet formats plus some 
   trailing protocol fields for security purposes.  For SAVPF, all 
   RTCP packets MUST be encapsulated as defined in section 3.4 of [4]. 

    
    
   2.2  Extensions 
    
   Extensions to AVPF RTCP feedback packets defined elsewhere MAY be 
   used with the SAVPF profile provided that those extensions are in 
   conformance with the extension rules of [3]. 

    
   Additional transforms defined for SAVP following the rules of 
   section 6 of [4] MAY also be used with the SAVPF profile.  The 
   overhead per RTCP packet depends on the transforms chosen.  New 
   transforms added in the future MAY introduce yet unknown further 
   per-packet overhead. 
    
    
   2.3  Implications from combining AVPF and SAVP 
    
   The AVPF profile aims at -- statistically -- allowing receivers to 
   provide timely feedback to senders.  The frequency at which 
   receivers are, on average, allowed to send feedback information 
   depends on the RTCP bandwidth, the group size, and the average size 
   of an RTCP packet.  SRTCP adds extra fields (some of which are of 
   variable size) at the end of each RTCP packet that are probably at 
   least some 10 to 20 bytes in size (14 bytes as default).  Note that 
   transforms defined in the future MAY add greater overhead.  With 
   this, the average size of an RTCP packet will increase -- roughly 
   estimated by some e.g. 10% to 30% -- and thus reduce the frequency 
   at which (timely) feedback can be provided.  Application designers 
   need to be aware of this, and take precautions so that the RTCP 
   bandwidth shares are maintained.  This MUST be done by adjusting 
   the RTCP variable "avg_rtcp_size" to include the size of the fields 
   that will be added by SRTCP (index, E-bit, authentication tag, and 
   when present, the MKI). This means, for example, that the 
   definition of the avg_rtcp_size in Section 3.4 of [3] shall be

   calculated on the resulting SRTCP packet as described in Section 
   3.4 of [4].  
    
    
    
3  SDP Definitions 
    
   3.1  Profile Definition 
    
   The AV profiles defined in [2], [3], and [4] are referred to as 
   "AVP", "AVPF", and "SAVP", respectively, in the context of e.g. the 
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [3].  The combined profile 
   specified in this document is referred to as "SAVPF". 
    
    
   3.2  Attribute Definitions 
    
   SDP attributes for negotiating SAVP sessions are defined in [7] and 
   [8].  Those attributes MAY also be used with SAVPF.  The rules 
   defined in [7] and [8] apply. 
    
   SDP attributes for negotiating AVPF sessions are defined in [3].  
   Those attributes MAY also be used with SAVPF.  The rules defined in 
   [3] apply. 
    
    
   3.3  Profile Negotiation 
    
   Session descriptions for RTP sessions may be conveyed using 
   protocols dedicated for multimedia communications such as the SDP 
   offer/answer model [10] used with SIP, RTSP [11], or SAP [12] but 
   may also be distributed using email, NetNews, web pages, etc. 
    
   The offer/answer model allows the resulting session parameters to 
   be negotiated using the SDP attributes defined in [7] and [8].  In 
   the following subsection, the negotiation process is described in 
   terms of the offer/answer model.  RTSP does not use the 
   offer/answer model; however specific negotiation support is 
   provided by [7] as discussed in subsection 3.3.2. 

    
    
   3.3.1 Offer/Answer-based Negotiation of Session Descriptions 
    
   Negotiations are carried out on a per-media session basis.  If 
   negotiating one media session fails, others MAY still succeed.   
    
   Different RTP profiles MAY be used in different media sessions.

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-avt-profile-savpf-00.txt  19 October 2003 

   For negotiation an media description, the four profiles AVP, AVPF, 
   SAVP, and SAVPF are mutually exclusive.  Note, however, that SAVP 
   and SAVPF entities MAY be mixed in a single RTP session (see 
   section 4).  Therefore, both MAY be offered as alternatives for the 
   same media session (e.g. using the same transport parameters).  
    
   An offerer that is capable of supporting multiple of these profiles 
   for a certain media session SHOULD always offer all alternatives 
   acceptable in a certain situation.  At least, SAVP and SAVPF SHOULD 
   be offered as this does not impact security. However, the offers 
   SHOULD NOT include both a secure alternative (SAVP and SAVPF) and 
   an insecure alternative (e.g. AVP and AVPF) in the same offer as 
   this will most likely open up for bidding down attacks. 
    
   If a media description in an offer uses SAVPF and the answerer does 
   not support SAVPF, the media session MUST be rejected. 
    
   If a media description in an offer does not use SAVPF but the 
   answerer wants to use SAVPF, the answerer SHOULD reject the media 
   session.  Alternatively, depending on whether or not offer is 
   otherwise acceptable, the answerer MAY accept the media description 
   and provide a counter-offer with a media description indicating 
   SAVPF in a subsequently initiated offer/answer exchange. 
    
    
   3.3.2 RTSP-based Negotiation of Session Descriptions 
    
   RTSP [11] does not support the offer/answer model.  However, RTSP 
   supports negotiating media session parameters (including profile 
   and address information) by means of the "Transport:" header.  SDP-
   based key management as defined in [7] adds a parameter to support 
   conveying keying material. 
    
   Hence, the RTSP "Transport:" header MAY be used to pass keying 
   information and negotiate the profile for the media session.  The 
   interoperability rules defined in section 3.3.1 SHALL apply. 
    
    
   3.3.3 Announcing Session Descriptions 
    
   Protocols that do not allow to negotiate session descriptions 
   interactively (e.g. SAP, descriptions posted on a web page or sent 
   by mail) pose the responsibility for adequate access to the media 
   sessions on the initiator of a session. 
    
   The initiator SHOULD provide alternative session descriptions for 
   multiple RTP profiles as far as acceptable to the application and 
   the purpose of the session.  If security is desired, SAVP may be 
   offered as alternative to SAVPF -- but AVP or AVPF sessions SHOULD

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-avt-profile-savpf-00.txt  19 October 2003 

   not be announced unless other security means not relying on SRTP 
   are employed.  
    
   The SDP attributes defined in [7] and [8] may also be used for the 
   security parameter distribution of announced session descriptions.   
    

   The security scheme description defined in [8] requires a secure 
   communications channel to prevent third parties from eavesdropping 
   on the keying parameters.  Therefore, SAP encryption (as defined in 
   [12]), S/MIME [13], HTTPS [14], or other suitable mechanisms SHOULD 
   be used for distributing or accessing these session descriptions. 
    
    
   3.3.4 Describing Alternative Session Profiles 
    
   SAVP and SAVPF entities MAY be mixed in the same RTP session (see 
   also section 4) and so may AVP and AVPF entities.  Other 
   combinations -- i.e. between secure and insecure profiles -- in the 
   same RTP session are not possible and SHALL NOT be used. 
    
   If both insecure and secure profiles shall be offered, different 
   RTP sessions MUST be used, expressed through different addresses 
   and/or port numbers.  A grouping mechanisms as defined in [9] 
   SHOULD be used to indicate semantic equivalence between the 
   individual sessions and ensure that any receiver only joins one of 
   them. 
    
   [JO: Note that there is an open issue currently discussed in MMUSIC 
   regarding whether or not the same transport address may be used in 
   two or more m= lines and, if so, whether or not an explicit 
   grouping mechanism is required. The respective semantics also need 
   to be documented.] 
    
   For SAVP and SAVPF, the same RTP session MAY be used but it may be 
   advisable to also use different ones in order to allow optimal 
   support for feedback-enabled receivers. 
    
   In case the same RTP session shall be used for both SAVP and SAVPF, 
   two media sessions need to be defined in SDP.  For the same RTP 
   session both will use the same address and port numbers.  Those two 
   media sessions SHOULD be grouped by using the mechanism defined in 
   [9] to indicate semantic equivalence between the individual 
   sessions and ensure that any receiver only joins one of them.

   Example 1: The following session description indicates a secure 
   session made up from audio and DTMF [18] for point-to-point 
   communication in which the DTMF stream uses Generic ACKs.  The key 
   management protocol is indicated in MIKEY.  This session 
   description (the offer) could be contained in a SIP INVITE or 200 
   OK  message to indicate that its sender is capable of and willing 
   to receive feedback for the DTMF stream it transmits.  The 
   corresponding answer may be carried in a 200 OK or an ACK.  The 
   parameters for the security protocol are negotiated as described by 
   the SDP extensions defined in [7].

   the same contents.  A sample mechanism by which this can be 
   achieved is defined in [9]. 
    
    
4  Interworking of AVP, SAVP, AVPF, and SAVPF Entities 
 
   The SAVPF profile defined in this document is a combination of the 
   SAVP profile [4] and the AVPF profile [3](which in turn is an 
   extension of the RTP profile as defined in [2]).   
    
   SAVP and SAVPF use SRTP [4] to achieve security.  AVP and AVPF use 
   plain RTP [1] and hence do not provide security (unless external 
   security mechanisms are applied as discussed in section 9.1 of 
   [1]).  SRTP and RTP and not meant to interoperate, the respective 
   protocol entities are not supposed to be part of the same RTP 
   session.  Hence, AVP and AVPF on one side and SAVP and SAVPF on the 
   other MUST NOT be mixed. 

    
   RTP entities using the SAVP and the SAVPF profiles MAY be mixed in 
   a single RTP session.  The interworking considerations defined in 
   section 5 of [3] apply. 
    
    
5  Security Considerations 
    
   The SAVPF profile inherits its security properties from the SAVP 
   profile; therefore it is subject to the security considerations 
   discussed in [4].  The SAVP profile does not add, nor take away, 
   any security services compared to SAVP.    
    
   There is a desire to support security for media streams and, at the 
   same time, for backward compatibility with non-SAVP(F) nodes.  
   Application designers should be aware that security SHOULD NOT be 
   traded for interoperability.  If information is to be distributed 
   to closed groups (i.e. confidentially protected), it is RECOMMENDED 
   not to offer alternatives for a media session other than SAVP and 
   SAVPF as described in sections 3.3 and 3.4, unless other security 
   mechanisms will be used, e.g. the ones described in Section 9.1 of 
   [1]. Similarly, if integrity protection is considered important, it 
   is RECOMMENDED not to offer the alternatives other than SAVP and 
   SAVPF (unless other mechanisms are known to be in place that can 
   guarantee it, e.g. lower-layer mechanisms as described in Section 9 
   of [1]). 
    
   Offering secure and insecure profiles simultaneously may open to 
   bidding down attacks. Therefore, such a mix of profile offer SHOULD 
   NOT be made.

   AVPF makes packets larger than AVP. This has to be taken into 
   consideration with respect to the number of keystream bits that can 
   be generated for a given encryption transform in SRTP, to avoid 
   keystream re-use. For the pre-defined SRTP transforms, see [SRTP] 
   for maximum values. 
    
   Note that the rules for sharing master keys apply as described in 
   [7] (e.g., Section 9.1). 
    
   [Editors' note: The last paragraph needs expansion; parts of SRTP 
   should explicitly be spelled out here.] 
    
   Different media sessions may use a mix of different profiles, 
   particularly including a secure profile and an insecure profile. 
   However, mixing secure and insecure media sessions may reveal 
   information to third parties and thus the decision to do so MUST be 
   in line with a local security policy.  For example, the local 
   policy MUST specify whether it is acceptable to have e.g. the audio 
   stream not secured and the related video secured. 
    
   The security considerations in [3] are valid too. Note in 
   particular, applying the SAVPF profile implies mandatory integrity 
   protection on RTCP.  While this solves the problem of false packets 
   from members not belonging to the group, it does not solve the 
   issues related to a malicious member acting improperly.

   All the SDP attribute defined for RTP/SAVP and RTP/AVPF are valid 
   for RTP/SAVPF, too.
