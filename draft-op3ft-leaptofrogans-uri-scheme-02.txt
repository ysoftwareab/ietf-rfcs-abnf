                     The 'leaptofrogans' URI Scheme
                draft-op3ft-leaptofrogans-uri-scheme-02



Abstract

   This document describes the 'leaptofrogans' Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) scheme, which enables applications to launch Frogans
   Player on a given Frogans site.  Frogans is a medium for publishing
   content and services on the Internet, defined as a generic software
   layer on the Internet.  Frogans Player is software enabling end users
   to browse Frogans sites.

1.  Background Information

1.1.  About Frogans

   Frogans is a medium for publishing content and services on the
   Internet.  From its inception in 1999, the medium was designed as a
   generic software layer running on top of the original Internet
   infrastructure, i.e. the TCP and IP protocols and the Domain Name
   System (DNS), alongside other existing layers such as E-mail or the
   World Wide Web.

   As a medium, Frogans is not meant for publishing Web sites, but
   Frogans sites, a kind of site founded upon a different format,
   enabling a different kind of communication between end users and
   publishers of content and services.

   Frogans is intended to be complementary to the World Wide Web, and
   not to replace it.  This is just like instant messaging, which was
   not intended to and did not replace E-mail.

   Compared to the World Wide Web, Frogans suggests visual rather than
   text-based communication, focused content rather than long pages, and
   natural interaction rather than complex user interfaces (see [FSDL]
   Section 1.4 "Frogans sites and Web sites").

   The technology making up the medium, i.e. the Frogans technology,
   includes multiple components such as:

   o  An XML-based language, called Frogans Slide Description Language
      [FSDL], used to develop Frogans sites.

   o  International identifiers, called Frogans addresses [IFAP], used
      to access Frogans sites.  Each Frogans site has its own Frogans
      address.

   o  Browsing software, called Frogans Player, enabling end users to
      browse Frogans sites.  An end user opens a Frogans site by
      entering its Frogans address in Frogans Player.

   o  A registry, called the Frogans Core Registry (FCR), that contains
      all Frogans addresses registered by Frogans site publishers.  The
      registry operator, called the FCR Operator, ensures the resolution
      of Frogans addresses when end users enter them in Frogans Player.

1.2.  About the OP3FT

   Created in 2012, the OP3FT [OP3FT] is a dedicated, non-profit
   organization whose purpose is to hold, promote, protect and ensure
   the progress of the Frogans technology, in the form of an open
   standard, available to all, free of charge.

   As part of its mission, the OP3FT develops and releases technical
   specifications, reference implementations (including Frogans Player),
   and various policies which define the rights and responsibilities of
   all stakeholders involved in the technology worldwide.


2.  The Need for a New URI Scheme and its Purpose

   Generic software layers running on top of the Internet offer
   mechanisms enabling end users to easily go from one layer to another,
   in both directions.  This is commonly achieved using URIs [RFC3986].

   As regards the Frogans layer, in the outgoing direction, FSDL enables
   Frogans site publishers to include in their Frogans sites way-out
   buttons enabling end users to launch their usual Web browser on a
   given Web page, or to launch their usual E-mail client with a given
   E-mail address.  This is achieved by associating a URI with each of
   those way-out buttons (the scheme of the URI can be either 'http',
   'https', or 'mailto').

   Conversely, in the incoming direction, Web site publishers should
   have a means to include in their Web pages links enabling end users
   to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans site.  Likewise, people
   writing E-mail messages should have a means to include in their
   messages links enabling recipients to launch Frogans Player on a
   given Frogans site.  More generally, any end-user application should
   be able to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans site.

   In order to achieve this, a new URI scheme, containing a Frogans
   address, is needed.

   Given that Frogans as a medium does not enable deep linking for
   Frogans sites, there is no need for additional information in the new
   URI scheme other than the Frogans address.


3.  The Choice of the Scheme Name

   [RFC Editor: Please delete this section before publication]

   The name chosen for the new URI scheme is 'leaptofrogans'.

Internet-Draft          leaptofrogans URI Scheme          September 2018


   This scheme name was chosen in compliance with [RFC7595] Section 3.8
   "Scheme Name Considerations".

   As regards the length of the scheme name, shorter names were
   discussed but were not chosen:

   o  'ltf': this name, an acronym for "leap to Frogans", was considered
      insufficiently descriptive, especially for typical end users who
      have little technical knowledge.

   o  'leapto': this name was considered overly general, and is not
      specifically associated with Frogans.

   o  'frogans': this name was rejected because it could create
      confusion between URIs based on this scheme and those Frogans
      addresses that start with "frogans".


4.  Scheme Syntax

   Frogans addresses [IFAP] are international identifiers made up of
   Unicode characters, so the new scheme will be also useful as an IRI
   [RFC3987].  As a result, in compliance with [RFC7595] Section 1.1.
   "URIs and IRIs", the corresponding URI syntax is defined and the IRI
   usage follows the rules and transformations defined in [RFC3987].

4.1.  URI Scheme

   The syntax for the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme is:

      leaptofrogans-uri = "leaptofrogans:" mapped-frogans-address

   where mapped-frogans-address is a Frogans address compliant with
   [IFAP] and encoded in UTF-8 [UTF-8], which is mapped according to the
   method specified in [RFC3987] Section 3.1.  "Mapping of IRIs to
   URIs".

4.2.  IRI Usage and Encoding

   The syntax for IRIs corresponding to the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme
   is:

      leaptofrogans-iri = "leaptofrogans:" frogans-address

   where frogans-address is a Frogans address compliant with [IFAP] and
   encoded in UTF-8 [UTF-8].

   Given that Frogans addresses cannot contain U+0025 PERCENT SIGN

   characters, the conversion specified in [RFC3987] of an original IRI
   to a URI (Section 3.1.  "Mapping of IRIs to URIs"), then back to an
   IRI (Section 3.2.  "Converting URIs to IRIs") will result exactly in
   the original IRI.

   End-user applications can use either a URI or an IRI based on the
   'leaptofrogans' URI scheme when launching Frogans Player on a given
   Frogans site.  This is because Frogans Player interprets both URIs
   and IRIs based on the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme.  If the U+0025
   PERCENT SIGN character is found in the string, then the string is
   interpreted as a URI, otherwise it is interpreted as an IRI.


5.  Rights to Use the Trademark

   In order to enable all users worldwide to use the Frogans technology
   in a clearly defined, secure and perpetual environment, the OP3FT
   Bylaws [BYLAWS] provide for the implementation of an intellectual
   property policy.

   In this context, the OP3FT is the holder of the "Frogans" trademark
   which is registered in France, the United States, and other countries
   around the world.

   However, this does not cause any problems with rights to use the
   scheme name in IETF specifications and Internet protocols because, in
   compliance with [RFC5378] Section 3.4.  "Rights to Use Trademarks",
   the OP3FT hereby grants to the IETF Trust a perpetual license to use
   the "Frogans" trademark as part of the scheme name.


6.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC Editor: Please replace 'xxxx' with assigned RFC number before
   publication]

   In accordance with the guidelines and registration procedures for new
   URI schemes [RFC7595], this section provides the information needed
   to register the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme.

   Scheme name: 'leaptofrogans'

   Status: permanent

   URI Scheme Syntax: See Section 4 of RFC xxxx.

   URI Scheme semantics: See Section 2 of RFC xxxx.

Internet-Draft          leaptofrogans URI Scheme          September 2018


   Encoding Considerations: See Section 4 of RFC xxxx.

   Applications/protocols that use this scheme name: Frogans Player as
   well as any end-user application (such as a Web browser or an E-mail
   client) wishing to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans site.

   Interoperability Considerations: There are no known interoperability
   concerns related to use of the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme.

   Security Considerations: See Section 7 of RFC xxxx.

   References: RFC xxxx.


7.  Security Considerations

   The author of a Web page can create a link where the true nature of
   the URI is hidden in the link text which is visible to end users.
   The same applies for an E-mail message as well as for other end-user
   applications.

   As concerns URIs based on the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme, this risk
   of confusion is mitigated because Frogans Player always displays the
   real Frogans address contained in the URI, and requires confirmation
   by the end user before opening the corresponding Frogans site.

   Also, an end-user application may provide a URI containing a Frogans
   address that is not valid.  This does not represent a risk because,
   before asking for confirmation by the end user, Frogans Player always
   verifies that the Frogans address contained in the URI is compliant
   with [IFAP], and raises an error if the Frogans address is not
   compliant.
