1. Introduction 
   
   This document provides an evaluation of the applicability of the 
   NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9 as an IPFIX protocol. 
   First, the general NetFlow architecture is introduced and its 
   application to the communication between an IPFIX exporting process 
   and an IPFIX collecting process is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 
   discusses in detail, to which degree requirements stated in [IPFIX-
   REQ] are met. 
    
   This document uses the terminology defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
    
   Note that the generic term NetFlow refers to multiple different 
   notions: the metering process, the exporting process and the export 
   protocol, as defined in the IPFIX terminology section of [IPFIX-
   REQ]. 
   Even if the metering process and exporting process form a single 
   NetFlow process on the Cisco Systems devices, this document will 
   sometimes refer to NetFlow metering process and NetFlow exporting 
   process for the sake of clarity. But the export protocol will always 
   be referred to as the NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9.   
 
   -  How and where is it documented? 
             
   All documentation related to NetFlow can be found at: 
   http://www.cisco.com/go/netflow 
    
   More specifically, the ôNetFlow Services Solutions Guideö covers a 
   NetFlow overview, the basic and advanced concepts, the explanation 
   of the different versions along with the data types exported, some 
   configuration examples, etc. For reference, see:

   The new flexible and extensible NetFlow flow record export version 9 
   is described in the IETF draft "Cisco Systems NetFlow Services 
   Export Version 9" [NETFLOW9], as well as in the following document: 
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/iosw/prodlit/ntfo_wp.htm 
   Note that [NETFLOW9-1] is about to be submitted to the rfc-editor.   
    
   -  Are there concrete plans for standardizing it? 
    
   The way to standardize NetFlow is via the IETF IPFIX Working Group. 
   In parallel, Cisco Systems intention is to produce an Information 
   RFC out of [NETFLOW9].  
    
   -  Is standardization already in progress? 
    
   No other standardization than the participation to the IETF IPFIX 
   Working Group is currently taking place. 
    
   -  Is it proprietary to a certain company? 
    
   NetFlow is a proprietary protocol from Cisco Systems. 
    
   -  Does it include any technology protected by patents? 
    
   NetFlow is protected by the following patent: 
   United States Patent 6,243,667 Kerr, et al. June 5, 2001 
    
   Abstract: 
   The invention provides a method and system for switching in networks 
   responsive to message flow patterns. A message "flow" is defined to 
   comprise a set of packets to be transmitted between a particular 
   source and a particular destination. When routers in a network 
   identify a new message flow, they determine the proper processing 
   for packets in that message flow and cache that information for that 
   message flow. Thereafter, when routers in a network identify a 
   packet which is part of that message flow, they process that packet 
   according to the proper processing for packets in that message flow. 
   The proper processing may include a determination of a destination 
   port for routing those packets and a determination of whether access 
   control permits routing those packets to their indicated 
   destination.

   Nevertheless, Cisco Systems has no intention to use this patent to 
   prevent other vendors to implement a NetFlow-like solution. 
    
   An Intellectual Property Right message has been sent to the IETF 
   rfc-editor team to post a similar message at 
   http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html 
    
   -  Is it already implemented? 
 
   The NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9 protocol is 
   currently at the stage of the Early Field Test, while NetFlow flow 
   record export versions 1, 5, 7 and 8 have been implemented for years 
   now. 
    
   -  Is it already in commercial use? 
    
   Some Cisco Systems partners are currently developing NetFlow 
   Collectors (the correct term is ôcollecting processö according to 
   [IPFIX-REQ]) able to receive NetFlow version 9 flow records. 
   While many different companies or organizations have already 
   implemented NetFlow Collectors for the previous NetFlow flow record 
   export protocols versions. Ex: Concord Communications, Hewlett 
   Packard, Narus, Xacct, Portal, Apogee Networks, Infovista, etc. to 
   name just a few. 
    
   -  Is it available from more than one source? 
    
   As the inventor of NetFlow, Cisco Systems is the only company 
   implementing this new version 9 on its devices. But, if we speak of 
   the previous NetFlow flow record export protocol versions, then the 
   majority of our competitors implemented those versions.  
    
   -  Is it already widely used? 
    
   The new NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9 is in Early 
   Field Test right now, while the previous NetFlow flow record export 
   versions have been implemented by our competitors. As a consequence, 
   NetFlow is widely used through out the industry. 
    
2. Architectural Considerations

Evaluation Of NetFlow Version 9 Against IPFIX Requirements    Oct. 2002 
 
 
   This section introduces the architecture of the NetFlow and suggests 
   a way of applying it to the communication between an IPFIX exporting 
   process and an IPFIX collecting process. 
    
2.1 NetFlow Protocol Overview 
    
   This section discusses the most recent evolution of the NetFlow flow 
   record export protocol, which is known as Version 9. The 
   distinguishing feature of the NetFlow Version 9 format compared to 
   the previous versions, is that it is template based. Template is a 
   collection of fields along with the description of their structure 
   and semantics.  
    
   This approach gives the following advantages: 
    
   - The template mechanism being flexible, allows the export of the   
   required fields alone from the IP Flows to the collecting process.     
   This helps to reduce the exported flow data volume, and generates 
   possible memory savings at the metering process and collecting 
   process. Sending the required information only, reduces the network 
   load too.  
    
   - Using the template mechanism, new fields can be added to NetFlow   
   export records without changing the structure of export record  
   format. With the previous NetFlow flow record export versions,  
   adding a new field in the flow record implied a new version of the  
   export protocol format and a new version of the collecting process  
   that supports the parsing of this new export protocol format.  
    
   - Templates which are sent to the collecting process contains the  
   structural information about the exported Flow Records fields. So,  
   even if the collecting process does not understand the semantics of  
   new fields, it can still interpret the Flow Record.  
    
   - Even if the NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9 has been 
   created with a IP flow record background in mind, note that the 
   Information Model can be extended with any data types and could 
   potentially serve any reporting purposes. E.g. the NetFlow metering 
   process configuration.

2.2 General Applicability 

2.2.1 Flow Definition 
   A NetFlow flow is identified as a unidirectional stream of packets 
   between a given source and destinationùboth defined by a network-
   layer IP address and transport-layer source and destination port 
   numbers. Typically in case of ingress NetFlow, a flow is identified 
   as the combination of the following seven key fields: source IP 
   address, destination IP address, source port number, destination 
   port number, layer 3 protocol type, ToS byte, input logical 
   interface (ifIndex). In case of egress NetFlow, a flow is identified 
   as the combination of the following seven key fields: source IP 
   address, destination IP address, source port number, destination 
   port number, layer 3 protocol type, ToS byte, output logical 
   interface (ifIndex). 

   These seven key fields define a unique flow. If a new observed 
   packet contains a different set of these seven key fields, then this 
   packet will create a new flow. Note that a flow contains other 
   accounting fields (such as the number of packets, number of bytes, 
   the BGP AS, etc). 

2.2.2 Observation Point 
   NetFlow can be enabled per interface (physical/logical) per linecard 
   or per system. However implementation restrictions apply on a 
   platform basis. 

2.2.3 The Metering Process and the Flow Record 

   NetFlow operates by creating a NetFlow cache that contains the 
   information for all active flows. A flow record is maintained within 
   the NetFlow cache for all active flows. Each flow record in the 
   NetFlow cache contains key fields that can be later used for 
   exporting to a collecting process. 

2.2.4 The Exporting Process 

   The NetFlow enabled platform checks the NetFlow cache on regular 
   basis and expires the flows if no more traffic of these flows is 
   observed. Once expired, the flow records are directly exported to 
   the collecting process.

Evaluation Of NetFlow Version 9 Against IPFIX Requirements    Oct. 2002 
 
 
   To achieve efficiency in terms of processing at the Exporter while 
   handling high volume of export, the NetFlow export packet is 
   encapsulated into UDP [UDP] datagrams for export to the collecting 
   process. Nevertheless NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9 
   has been designed to be transport protocol independent. Hence, it 
   can also operate over congestion aware protocols like TCP [TCP] or 
   SCTP [SCTP].  
   Note that the UDP port to which the NetFlow flow records are 
   exported is configurable. 

2.2.5 The Collecting Process 
 
   The NetFlow Collector (the collecting process) provides the data 
   collection from multiple export devices exporting NetFlow flow 
   records. It will process and store the flow records. Some extra 
   actions on these flow records could be executed on the collecting 
   process but per [IPFIX-REQ], these actions are out of the scope of 
   the IPFIX work.

   Except the terminology difference again described below, there is no 
   difference between the NetFlow and IPFIX architecture.

   Note that the generic term NetFlow refers to multiple different 
   notions: the metering process, the exporting process and the export 
   protocol, as defined in the IPFIX terminology section of [IPFIX-
   REQ]. 
   Even if the metering process and exporting process form a single 
   NetFlow process on the Cisco Systems devices, this document will 
   sometimes refer to NetFlow metering process and NetFlow exporting 
   process for the sake of clarity. But the export protocol will always 
   be referred to as the NetFlow flow record export protocol version 9.  
    
3. Item Level Compliance Evaluation 
    
   This section evaluates the compliance of the NetFlow protocol with 
   the IPFIX requirements item by item. Requirements are addressed by 
   their section numbers and item numbers in [IPFIX-REQ]. For each 
   requirement it is explained to what degree protocol NetFlow flow 
   export version 9 meets the requirement and how this is achieved. The 
   degree of compliancy is explicitly stated using five grades: 
    
     -T  Total compliance: The requirement is met completely by the 
         protocol specification without any extensions required. 
    
     -E  Extension required for total compliance: The protocol is 
         prepared to be extended and it is possible to extend it in a 
         way that it meets the requirement. This grade is only 
         applicable to protocols that are explicitly open to externally 
         defined extensions, such as SNMP is extended by MIB modules or 
         DIAMETER is extended by application modules. It is not 
         applicable to protocols, where the protocol specification   
         itself needs to be extended in order to comply with the     
         requirement. 
    
     -P  Partial compliance: The requirement is met partially by the 
         protocol specification. 
    
     -U  Upcoming compliance: The requirement is not met or met 
          partially by the protocol specification, but there is a 
          concrete plan for an upcoming version of the protocol. 
    
     -F  Failed compliance: The requirement is not met by the protocol 
     specification.

   Information Model associated with NetFlow flow record export version 
   9 [NETFLOW9] contains all the data types needed to satisfy the 
   requirements of the different applications described in the section 
   ôApplications Requiring IP Flow Information Exportö from [IPFIX-
   REQ]. 
    
3.3 Distinguishing Flows (4) 
    

3.3.1 Interface (4.1) 
    
   Total Compliance of the interface as a flow distinguisher. 
   In case of ingress NetFlow, a flow is identified, amongst other 
   fields, by the input logical interface (ifIndex). In case of egress 
   NetFlow, a flow is identified, amongst other fields by output 
   logical interface (ifIndex). All flow records will report both the 
   input and output ifIndexes. 
    

3.3.2  IP Header Fields (4.2) 
 
    source IP address (MUST): Total Compliance 
    destination IP address (MUST): Total Compliance 
    protocol type (TCP,UDP,ICMP,...) (MUST): Total Compliance 
    IP version number (SHOULD): Upcoming Compliance 
 

3.3.3  Transport Header Fields (4.3) 
    
   Total Compliance of the port numbers of the transport header as a 
   flow distinguisher. 
    

3.3.4  MPLS (4.4) 
    
   Total Compliance of the MPLS label as a flow distinguisher, if the 
   observation point is located at a device supporting Multiprotocol 
   Label Switching.

3.3.5  DiffServ Code Point (4.5) 
    
   Total Compliance, as NetFlow distinguishes flow by the TOS byte 
   (DiffServ Code Point).  

3.3.6  Header Compression and Encryption (4.6) 
    
   Total Compliance. 
    
3.4 Metering Process (5)  
    

3.4.1 Reliability (5.1) 
    
   The metering process is reliable on most of the Cisco network 
   elements. Total Compliance.  
   On the network elements where the metering process could not meter 
   some flow records due to some overload, an Options Template with the 
   number of missed flows could be sent to the collector. Note that the 
   counters are available in the network elements. Nevertheless, 
   Extension required for total compliance. 
    

3.4.2  Sampling (5.2) 
    
   ôThe metering process MAY support packet sampling.ö, as defined in 
   [IPFIX-REQ]ô. Total Compliance. NetFlow supports packet sampling. 
    
   ôIf sampling is supported the sampling configuration MUST be well 
   defined. The sampling configuration includes the sampling method and 
   all its parameters.ö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. Total Compliance.  
   See the Options Template from [NETFLOW9]: a template that describes 
   the format of the Flow measurement parameters (like the sampling 
   algorithm, sampling interval) done at the metering process. 
    
   ôIf the sampling configuration is changed during operation, the new 
   sampling configuration with its parameters MUST be indicated to all 
   collecting processes receiving the affected flow records. Changing 
   the sampling configuration includes: start sampling, stop sampling, 
   change sampling method, and change sampling parameter.ô, as defined 
   in [IPFIX-REQ]ô.  
   Start sampling: Total Compliance 
   Stop sampling: Extension Required  
   Change sampling method: Total Compliance 
   Change sampling parameter: Total Compliance

3.4.3  Overload Behavior (5.3) 
    
   ôIn case of an overload, for example lack of memory or processing 
   power, the metering process MAY change its behavior in order to cope 
   with the lack of resources.ö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ].  
   Total Compliance.  
    
   ôFor some flows, the change of behavior might have an impact on the  
   data that would be stored in the associated flow records after the 
   change, for example if the packet classification is changed or the 
   sampling rate. These flows MUST be considered as terminated and the  
   associated flow records MUST be exported separately from new ones 
   generated after the behavior change. ö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
    
   ôThe terminated flow records and new ones generated after the 
   behavior change MUST NOT be merged by the metering process.ö, as 
   defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
    
   ôThe collecting process MUST be able to distinguish the affected 
   flow records generated before and after the change of behavior.ö, as 
   defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
    
   Let me address the 3 requirements above together. 
    
   If the metering process configuration is changed, then Total 
   Compliance. A new Template ID for the new template configuration 
   will be generated and the collecting process will be able to 
   distinguish the new flow records from the old ones. 
    
   In case of memory, flow records or CPU overload, Total Compliance.  
   Overload of memory: not possible because NetFlow allocates the 
   entire cache memory at initialization. 
   Overload of flow records: not possible because in case the NetFlow 
   cache becomes full, the flow records will be expired with a smaller 
   timeout! This change in the exporting process behavior doesnÆt need 
   to be reported: anyway the flow records contain the absolute 
   timestamps. 
   Overload of CPU: the throughput will be lowered in order for NetFlow 
   to account all traffic. 
    
   In case of cpu overload, in order to avoid a lower throughput, some 
   new automatic actions (like new template with sampling NetFlow 
   instead of full NetFlow or new template with higher sampling rate 
   etcà) could be implemented without much effort. 
   Note that in both examples above, a new Template ID for the new 
   template configuration will be generated and the collecting process 
   will be able to distinguish the new flow records from the old ones.

3.4.4  Timestamps (5.4) 
    
   Total Compliance. 
    

3.4.5  Time Synchronization (5.5) 
    
   Total Compliance. 
   The export packet header contains the UTC time of the export packet 
   generation. This header also contains the router sysUpTime at the 
   time of the export packet generation. The UTC time the router booted 
   can therefore be deduced. The flow records contain the flow start 
   and flow end sysUpTime, so that the NetFlow collector can deduce the 
   flow start and flow end UTC time. 
    

3.4.6  Flow Expiration (5.6) 
    
   Total Compliance of the NetFlow flow expiration mechanism with the 
   IPFIX requirements. 
   The routing device checks the NetFlow cache once per second and 
   expires the flow in the following instances: 

       1. Transport is completed (TCP FIN or RST). 

       2. The flow cache has become full.  

       3. The inactive timer has expired after 15 seconds of traffic 
          inactivity. This inactive timer is configurable, with a 
          minimum value of 0 for a immediate expiration.  

       4. The active timer has expired after 30 minutes of traffic 
          activity. This active timer is configurable. 
           

3.4.7 Multicast (5.7) 
    
   Total Compliance of the multicast support with the IPFIX 
   requirements. 
    

3.4.8 Packet Fragmentation (5.8)

   ôThe metering process MAY keep state of IP packet fragmentation in 
   order to map fragments that do not contain sufficient header 
   information correctly to flows.ö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
   Extension Required for Total Compliance. 
    

3.4.9 Ignore Port Copy (5.9) 
    
   Total Compliance. The metering process ignores packets that are 
   generated by a port copy function acting at the device where the 
   observation point of a flow is located. 
    
3.5 Data Export (6)  
    

3.5.1 Information Model (6.1) 
 
   ôThe exporting process MUST be able to report the following 
   attributes for each metered flowö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]: 
   1. IP version number: Total Compliance 
   2. source IP address: Total Compliance 
   3. destination IP address: Total Compliance 
   4. IP protocol type (TCP,UDP,ICMP,...) : Total Compliance 
   5. source TCP/UDP port number: Total Compliance 
   6. destination TCP/UDP port number: Total Compliance 
   7. packet counter: Total Compliance 
   8. byte counter: Total Compliance 
   9. type of service octet (in case of IPv4), traffic class octet (in  
   case of IPv6): Total Compliance 
   10. in case of IPv6, Flow Label: Total Compliance 
   11. if MPLS is supported at the observation point: the top MPLS 
    label or the corresponding forwarding equivalence class (FEC, 
   [RFC3031]) bound to that label. Total Compliance for the top MPLS 
   label and the corresponding FEC. 
   12. timestamp of the first packet of the flow: Total Compliance 
   13. timestamp of the last packet of the flow: Total Compliance 
   14. if sampling is used, sampling configuration: Total Compliance 
   15. unique identifier of the observation point: Total Compliance 
   (the ifIndex) 
   16. unique identifier of the exporting process: Total Compliance 
   (the IP address and the Observation Domain Identifier) 
 
   ôThe exporting process SHOULD be able to report the following 
   attributes for each metered flowö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]: 
   17. input interface (ifIndex): Total Compliance 
   18. output interface (ifIndex): Total Compliance 
   19. multicast replication factor. Total Compliance

   ôThe exporting process MAY be able to report the following 
   attributes for each metered flowö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]: 
   20. Time To Live: Extension required for Total Compliance 
   21. IP header flags: Extension required for Total Compliance 
   22. TCP header flags: Total Compliance 
   23. dropped packet counter at the observation point: Extension 
   required for Total Compliance 
   24. fragmented packet counter: Extension Required for Total 
   Compliance 
   25. Next hop IP address: Total Compliance 
    
   In addition, the exporting process MAY be able to report attributes 
   related to inter-autonomous system routing of a flow, for example by 
   reporting BGP Autonomous System numbers. Total Compliance 
 

3.5.2 Data Model (6.2) 
     
   ôThe data model MUST be extensibleö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
   Total Compliance. While all data types discussed in [NETFLOW9] 
   concern the IP flows and the metering process, nothing prevents 
   NetFlow version 9 to export whatever type of data. For example, a 
   MIB variable or the output of a ôshow commandö on the router. 
   NetFlow version 9 is extensible to whatever data type. 
    
   ôThe data model used for exporting flow information MUST be flexible 
   concerning the flow attributes contained in flow recordsö, as 
   defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
   Total Compliance. 
 
   ôThe Data Model SHOULD be independent of the underlying transport 
   protocol, i.e. the data transferö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
   Total Compliance. 
    

3.5.3 Data Transfer (6.3) 

3.5.3.1   Congestion Awareness (6.3.1) 
    
   ôFor the data transfer, a congestion aware protocol MUST be 
   supportedö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
   Upcoming Compliance with SCTP. 
   Note that the flow record export protocol version 9 is independent 
   of the underlying transport protocol.

3.5.3.2   Reliability (6.3.2) 
 
   Total Compliance. A sequence ID exists per export packet so that the 
   collecting process would know if it misses export packets or if 
   packets reordering occurred in the network. 
    

3.5.3.3   Security (6.3.3) 
    
   Extension Required for total Compliance for confidentiality, 
   integrity and authenticity for the flow record export protocol 
   version 9 itself. 
   But note that exporting the NetFlow flow records from the exporting 
   process to the metering process over an IPSEC [IPSEC] tunnel would 
   fulfill all the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity 
   requirements.  
    

3.5.4 Push and Pull Mode Reporting (6.4) 
 
   NetFlow is a Push Mode Reporting mechanism and doesnÆt support the 
   Pull Mode.  
    

3.5.5 Regular Reporting Interval (6.5) 
    
   Total Compliance. For long aging flows, the exporting process 
   exports the flow records on regular basis, in order to: 
           1. report the flow records periodic accounting information 
               to the collecting process 
           2. avoid counter wrapping 
   This activity timeout is configurable 
    

3.5.6 Notification on Specific Events (6.6) 
    
   Failed Compliance.  
    

3.5.7 Anonymization (6.6) 
    
   ôThe exporting process MAY be capable of anonymizing source and 
   destination IP addresses in flow data before exporting them.ö  
   Total Compliance.

   ôThe exporting process MAY support anonymization of port numbers and 
   other fields.ö 
   Total Compliance. 
    
   Router-based aggregations of flow records can be enabled in order to 
   aggregate the flow records and as a consequence, anonymize some of 
   the flow records data types. Typical example: the source and 
   destination IP addresses will be hidden. Instead the network 
   prefixes will be reported. 
   Another solution would simply be not to report the data types we 
   want to anonymize. Typical example: the network prefixes are 
   reported instead of the IP addresses but the network prefixes are 
   meaningful. As a consequence, the template would export none of the 
   IP addresses and the prefixes. 
 
 
3.6 Configuration (7)

3.7 General Requirements Compliance (8) 
     

3.7.1  Openness (8.1)

3.7.2 Number of Exporting Processes (8.2) 
    
   ôData collection from hundreds of different exporting processes MUST 
   be supported.ö, as defined in [IPFIX-REQ]. 
   Total Compliance. 
    
   ôThe collecting process MUST be able to distinguish several hundred 
   exporting processes by their identifiers.ö, as defined in [IPFIX-
   REQ].

   Total Compliance, the identifier being the IP address of the 
   exporting process and the Observation Domain identifier. 
    
   The Observation Domain is defined as: 
   The set of observation points which is the largest aggregatable set 
   of flow information at the metering process is termed as an 
   Observation Domain. The Observation Domain presents itself a unique 
   identifier to the collecting process for identifying the export 
   packets generated by it. One or more Observation Domains can 
   interface with the same export process. Example: The Observation 
   Domain could be a router line-card, composed of several interfaces 
   with each interface being an observation point. 
    

3.7.3 Several Collecting Processes (8.3) 
    
   Total Compliance. The exporting process is able to export flow 
   information to two different collecting processes and the flow 
   records can be identified thanks to a sequence ID, the Observation 
   Domain and the Exporter IP address.

   Note that some of the requirements in the table above are not 
   necessarily applicable for the strict selection of the candidate 
   protocol. Up to the evaluation team not to consider those. 
    
4. Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations for the IPFIX protocol are covered by the 
   comparison against the specific Security requirements in the IPFIX 
   requirements document [IPFIX-REQ] where they are specifically 
   addressed by sections 6.3.3 and 10. 
    
   The NetFlow flow record export protocol could be run on the top of 
   IPSEC [IPSEC] to assure security.
