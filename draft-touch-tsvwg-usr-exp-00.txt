                     draft-touch-tsvwg-usr-exp-00.txt


Abstract

   This document defines user ports for experiments using transport
   protocols. It describes the use of experiment identifiers to enable
   shared use of these user ports, as well as updating the use of
   system ports for experiments [RFC4727] in the same manner.

1. Introduction

   Various network codepoints have been allocated for experimental use,
   including those for IP, ICMP, UDP, and TCP [RFC4727]. These include
   transport protocol port numbers 1021 and 1022, using the service
   names "EXP1" and "EXP2".

   There has always been an expectation that experiments needing
   privileged (system) ports use these assignments and unprivileged
   ports use those from the dynamic range [RFC7605]. However, dynamic
   ports can be difficult to reserve in some systems or blocked from
   traversing some firewalls. As a consequence, there is a need for
   non-privileged, non-dynamic ports - i.e., user ports - for
   experiments.

   This document reserves user ports experimentation and describes the
   use of experiment identifiers to differentiate shared use of these
   ports for concurrent experiments.

2. User Ports for Experiments

   The system, user, and dynamic ranges vary in their properties
   [RFC7605]. System ports often include privileged access, sometimes
   known as 'root'. Dynamic ports are used as client ports when
   establishing associations with services on registered ports. User
   ports have neither privilege nor the risk of use by other
   connections. User ports are also more likely to allow configuration
   to pass through firewalls, where system and dynamic ports can be
   difficult to 'un-block'.

Internet-Draft        User Ports for Experiments             March 2022


   This document registers USR-EXP1 and USR-EXP2 for user port
   experiments, using port numbers #UPORT1 and #UPORT2. These ports are
   assigned from the user range, allowing non-privileged experiments
   without the need to use ports from the dynamic range.

   This document also creates a registry for port experiment
   identifiers (PExIDs), in the same manner as those created for shared
   TCP option experiments [RFC6994]. Experimenters are encouraged to
   register PExIDs with IANA and to include them in at the beginning of
   their transport data, i.e., at the front of each separate message or
   byte stream, in network standard byte order. The use of PEdIDs helps
   differentiate experiments without the need for additional port
   assignments.

   This document also encourages the use of these PExIDs for
   experiments using existing experiment ports, i.e., system ports EXP1
   and EXP2.

   PExIDs differentiate experiments but are not intended to be specific
   to a given experiment port, whether system or user, so a single
   registration is used for all experiment ports. It is the
   responsibility of the experimenter to determine which port(s) each
   experiment uses.

3. Security Considerations

   The creation of new ports for experiment purposes does not create
   any new security considerations. At best, it potentially reduces the
   use of privileged system ports for such experiments, which avoids
   the associated risk of unnecessary privileged access.

   Experimenters are encouraged to include security in any new
   experiment, regardless of port (per Section 7.4 of [RFC7605]).

4. IANA Considerations

   This document hereby requests the assignment of two user ports for
   experimental purposes below. IANA is asked to replace instances of
   #UPORT1 and #UPORT2 throughout this document based on the actual
   allocation.

   ---

   IANA has assigned the following user ports for experiments:

      USR-EXP1 #UPORT1 (desired port 1031) all transports

      USR-EXP2 #UPORT2 (desired port 1032) all transports

   This document requests IANA create a "Port Experimental Option
   Experiment Identifiers (PExIDs)" registry.  The registry records 32-
   bit PExIDs, consisting of a brief description, document pointer if
   available, assignee name, and e-mail contact for each entry. Once
   registered, PExIDs can be used with either the system (EXP1, EXP2)
   or user (USR-EXP1, USR-EXP2) ports and with any transport protocol.

   Entries are assigned on a First Come, First Served (FCFS) basis
   [RFC5226]. IANA will also record known duplicate uses to assist the
   community in both debugging assigned uses as well as correcting
   unauthorized duplicate uses.

   IANA should impose no requirements on making a registration request
   other than indicating the desired codepoint and providing a point of
   contact. A short description or acronym for the use is desired but
   not required.
