Abstract

   This document proposes an enhanced handover scheme of the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) with partial bicasting in wireless networks. In
   the proposed PMIPv6 handover scheme, when a mobile node (MN) moves
   into a new network and thus its Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) performs
   the binding update to the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), the LMA begins
   the 'partial' bicasting of data packets will be buffered at the new
   MAG as well as the previous MAG. Then, the data packets will be
   buffered at the new MAG during handover and then forwarded to MN
   after the handover operations are completed. The proposed scheme can
   reduce handover delays and packet losses, and can also use the
   network resource of wireless links more effectively.

1. Introduction

   The Mobile IPv6 was designed as an IPv6-bsed mobility scheme [1], in
   which each Mobile Node (MN) should be equipped with the MIPv6
   functionality to perform the mobility management signaling. Such a
   protocol is referred to as 'host-based mobility management' protocol.
   In the wireless network environment, however, it is not effective
   that each MN performs the MIPv6 protocol operations, due to the
   scarce resources of wireless network such as link bandwidth or MN
   power. Moreover, this scheme requires all the host to implement the
   mobility control software.

   Recently, a network-based mobility control is proposed to enable IP
   mobility for a host, in which the network is responsible for managing
   the IP mobility control operations on behalf of the host. It is
   referred to as the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol [2], which has
   been standardized in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In
   PMIPv6, the mobile agent, called Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), located
   in the network will perform the mobility signaling instead of MN and
   will keep track of the movement of MN.

   It is noted that the PMIPv6 is used mainly for binding update of the
   location of MNs. The PMIPv6 may be used for support IP handover.
   However, there are still a lot of issues that need to be solved in
   the perspective of seamless handover.

   In this document, we consider the 'bicasting' for handover, in which
   the PMIPv6 Local Mobility Agent (LMA) will bicast the data packets to
   the Previous MAG (P-MAG) and New MAG (N-MAG) toward MN, when MN is in
   the overlapping region between the two associated MAGs. Then, the
   bicasting can be used to minimize the packet loss and handover
   latency at a MN during handover. However, when the bicasting function
   is used support the PMIP handover, the following issues shall be

   disposed. First, this scheme may stil incur data losses during
   handover when the underlying link is switched, since MN can receive
   data packets from only one of the two links at a time. Next, the PMIP
   handover with bicasting, tends to waste the resources of wireless
   links by sending duplicated packets.

   To solve these issues, we propose a new handover scheme of PMIPv6
   with Partial Bicasting, in which the bicasting is done by using the
   PMIP tunnel in the partial network region between LMA and MAGs. In
   additions, the N-MAG will buffer the data packets to reduce the data
   packet losses that may occur at the link switching time.

3. Protocol Detail

   This document proposes an enhanced scheme for seamless handover, in
   which we will extend the PMIPv6 handover scheme. The proposed scheme
   can be used to reduce the packet loss and handover delay during
   handover in the PMIPv6 wireless network.

                       Figure 1 Network Architecture

   Figure 1 shows a network model for PMIPv6 handover schemes. The
   document considers a network architecture, in which MN moves from P-
   MAG to N-MAG during communications with a correspondent node (CN)
   that is not located in the same PMIPv6 domain. Note that P-MAG and N-
   MAG as the first IP-level nodes in the viewpoint of MN.

   In this document, it proposes an enhanced scheme for seamless
   handover, in which it will extend the PMIPv6 handover scheme. The
   proposed scheme can be used to reduce the packet loss and handover
   latency during handover in the PMIPv6 wireless network.

   The operation of the PBB-PMIPv6 is shown as figure 2. First, when the
   P-MAG receives a link layer signaling message between MN and P-MAG,
   it requests N-MAG to establish a new PMIP tunnel with LMA by sending
   a Handover Init (HI) message that includes the MN's Proxy-CoA and
   Home address (MN-HoA). The N-MAG receives HI message, it should
   examine whether a tunnel to the LMA already exists or not. If the
   tunnel has not been established, it should establish the tunnel with
   the LMA.

   To establish the tunnel, N-MAG sends a PBU message to LMA. It
   includes MN-Identifier and MN-HoA. On reception of PBU from N-MAG,
   the LMA creates a new binding cache entry. It then sets the tunnel
   with N-MAG, which is used to send and receive the data packets
   between N-MAG and LMA.

   After the successful establishment of the PMIP tunnel, the LMA will
   transmit the data packets to both P-MAG and N-MAG. From this phase,
   the bicasting transmissions begin, in which LMA may employ the
   transient binding scheme for PMIPv6. However, the bicasting
   transmission is performed in the 'partial' network region between LMA
   and N-MAG, rather than between LMA and MN.

   On reception of the PBA message from LMA, the N-MAG will begin to
   buffer the data packets arriving from LMA. At the same time, it will
   request P-MAG to stop bicasting by sending a Handover Init Ack
   message. In turn, the P-MAG will release the old PMIP tunnel by
   sending a PBU message to the LMA.

   After the new link is established, the N-MAG forwards the buffered
   data packets to MN. After that, the normal data transfer operation
   will be performed between MN and LMA.

6. Conclusions

   This document proposes an enhanced handover scheme of the PMIPv6,
   which is based on partial bicasting. The bicasting of data packets is
   performed to the N-MAG as well as P-MAG. In addition, the N-MAG
   performs the buffering of data packet, until the link established
   between N-MAG and MN. The proposed scheme can reduce the packet

   losses by using the buffering at the N-MAG. Moreover, the proposed
   scheme can minimize the network resources by releasing the old PMIP
   tunnel in advance.
