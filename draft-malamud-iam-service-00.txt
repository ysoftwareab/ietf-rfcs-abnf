1.  Overview

   The WHOIS Protocol is used to provide "information about registered
   domain names" in "human-readable format."[RFC3912]  Provision of
   WHOIS service by registries and registrars is required by ICANN under
   a mandatory operating agreement.[ICANN-Registrar]

   Although the WHOIS service provides a simple unformatted interface
   for the end user, a variety of efforts are used to control the
   population of that information in databases through a complex
   interaction between domain name registrants, registrars, and
   registries.[RFC3707]

   The purpose of mandating accurate WHOIS information in domain name
   registries is to provide a contact mechanism and accountability.  As
   such ICANN in their WDRP regulations mandate registrars to remind
   registrants "that provision of false Whois information can be grounds
   for cancellation of their domain name registration."[WDRP] The
   monetary value of the compilation of registrants is a tempting target
   for direct marketing and ICANN has regulated such use in the
   WMRP.[WMRP]

   Accountability of registrants coupled with restrictions on bulk
   access are thus design goals which are attempted to be met by the
   WHOIS service.  Unfortunately, a complex set of protocols is used to
   govern the interaction of registrants, registrars, registries, and
   regulators.  This document proposes that this chain of protocols is a
   good example of "the rise of the middle" and proposes an alternative
   service based on end-to-end design principles.[RFC3724]

   Three sets of requirements are intermingled:
   1.  A method for registrants to provide registrars their contact
       information for use in registering a domain name and for
       operational purposes such as maintaining host records, updating
       billing information, or confirming transfers.  The current
       EPP/CRISP efforts address this requirement.
   2.  Authorized use of the compilation of names in a registry appears
       to be in the purview of ICANN and TLD administrators.
       Unauthorized use of the compilation has proven to be a continuing
       problem with the current WHOIS-based architecture.
   3.  A method for members of the public to determine who owns a domain
       name and how to contact them.

   The centralized approach to meeting requirement 3, public access, has
   resulted in unauthorized use of the compilation in requirement 2.
   Indeed, one could argue that use of a compilation for further
   marketing of services is not a requirement at all and could be
   eliminated or moved into a more limited role.  However, that issue is

2.  Service Definition

   Per the requirements of [RFC3403] the iam service is defined as an
   NAPTR-based application.  The service provides for a single
   NAPTR-based lookup on a domain name, returning a URI.  The "first
   known domain-name" is thus derived as direct input from the user.

   The allowed values of the NAPTR fields are as follows:
   o  The Order and Preference fields SHALL be used as specified in
      [RFC3403].
   o  The Flags field SHALL always contain the value "U", which
      signifies that the record is terminal and contains a URI.
   o  The Service field SHALL always start with the string "iam+",
      followed by exactly one additional service parameter, currently
      limited to values "opaque" and "rfc2629" as specified in Section
      3.
   o  The Regular Expression field SHALL contain a regexp expression
      which will transform the lookup key into a valid URI as further
      specified in Section 3.
   o  The Replacement field SHALL contain a valid domain name and is not
      used in this application.  The character "." MAY be used as the
      string.

   The expected output of the single rule chosen is the terminal rewrite
   rule which is always a URL.

3.  Service Parameters

   An iam application retrieves all NAPTR records conforming to the
   lookup key, and MUST discard all records where the initial service
   parameter is not "iam".

   The field MUST contain a second service parameter, which contains a
   valid "parameter type" contained in the iam Services Registry as
   defined in Section 7.1.

   Two "parameter type" values are defined in this document:
   o  "opaque"
   o  "rfc2629"

3.1  The iam+opaque Service Parameter

   If the service parameter field contains "iam+opaque", the regular
   expression will result in a valid URI, limited to the following URI
   schemes:
   o  "http" as specified in [RFC2616].
   o  "https" as specified in [RFC2660].
   o  "ftp" as specified in [RFC0959].

   The content of the document retrieved from the URI is not specified
   in this document.  Designers of documents which are retrieved using
   the iam service are encouraged to vary the content and format of
   these documents.  Documents should be easily viewable by human
   beings, but there is no requirement for structure that would assist
   automated applications in harvesting contact information.

   A simple example is as follows.  If the registrant of the
   "example.com" domain wishes to provide contact information using the
   iam service, the first step is to construct a valid NAPTR record:

   example.com.
      ;;       order pref flags service
      IN NAPTR 100   10   "U"  "iam+opaque"
               "/^.*$/http:\/\/example.com\/contact.html/"  .
      ;;       regexp                                       replacement

   The regular expression will always resolve to the URI
   "http://example.com/contact.html".  The content of this document
   might be the following:

     If you need to reach me, my username is jdoe and my isp
     is example.net.  My favorite color is blue and you can
     find more information about me
     <a href="http://example.com/moreinfo.html">here</a>
       </p>
     </body>
   </html>


3.2  The iam+rfc2629 Service Parameter

   If the service parameter field contains "iam+rfc2629", the regular
   expression will result in a valid URI, which will return a document
   that conforms to the "<reference>" as specified in [RFC2629].  As
   with the "iam+opaque", the set of NAPTR records MUST contain at least
   one of the "http", "https", or "ftp" URI schemes, but MAY include
   records of equal "order" with other URI schemes.  (Simply put, if you
   offer an "rsync" resource record, you must also have a resource
   record with a "basic" URI scheme.)

   An example of a NAPTR resource record of this type is:

   example.com.
      ;;       order pref flags service
      IN NAPTR 100   10   "U"  "iam+rfc2629"
               "/^.*$/https:\/\/example.com\/contact.xml/"  .
      ;;       regexp                                      replacement

   The regular expression will always resolve to the URI
   "http://example.com/contact.xml".  The content of this document might
   be the following:

     <format type='More Info'
                target='http://example.com/moreinfo.html' />
   </reference>

   [RFC2629] requires an anchor attribute on the "<reference>" element,
   but this attribute is not used by the iam service.  The "<date>"
   element SHOULD contain the date this document was last updated.  The
   "<abstract>", "<seriesInfo>", and "<format>" elements MAY be used at
   the discretion of the document designer.

3.3  Multiple NAPTR Responses

   If a lookup results in multiple NAPTR resource records, an
   application SHOULD use the following rules in sequence to choose one
   record:
   1.  The application MUST discard all resource records where the first
       characters of the service parameter are not "iam".
   2.  The application MAY discard all resource records based on the
       second service parameter.  For example, if some resource records
       are returned with a service parameter field of "iam+rfc2629" and
       others have "iam+opaque", the application MAY choose which set to
       process.
   3.  The application MUST discard all resource records with an Order
       field higher than the minimum value of the remaining set of
       resource records.
   4.  The application SHOULD choose a resource record with a lower
       Preference value but MAY choose a record with a higher preference
       value.

3.4  Use of DNSSEC

   An application SHOULD verify all DNSSEC signatures as the records are
   retrieved and SHOULD discard all resource records that fail the
   verification procedures as outlined in the DNSSEC documents.

4.  Discussion (Non-Normative)

   Upon being presented with an early draft of this document, Paul Vixie
   commented that "naptr is pretty hard compared to srv, don't you
   think?"  Upon further prodding he proposed the following solution
   using the SRV[RFC2782] resource record:

   $ORIGIN example.com.

   _whois._tcp         SRV 0 1 23 myisp.example.net.
                       SRV 0 3 23 myownbox.example.com.

   This solution preserves the existing investment in the WHOIS
   protocol, while still allowing a domain name registrant to specify
   the location of the relevant WHOIS servers and thus spares the
   end-user a three-step lookup consisting of:
   1.  Find the registry for the TLD in question.
   2.  Query the registry.
   3.  Query the registrar.

   The SRV-based approach thus has many of the same attributes as the
   "iam+rfc2629" of allowing the domain registrant to present structured
   text with contact information.

   On the other hand, one of the attractive attributes of the
   "iam+opaque" service parameter is the very fact that structured text
   is not necessarily present and thus discourages automated harvesting
   of contact information.  The iam service also eliminates the need for
   a WHOIS server, a service that may not be present in many common
   web-hosting environments, which typically offer a LAMP service
   (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhP).

   One argument for the current system of WHOIS information furnished
   through the registrant/registrar/registry chain is that this somehow
   provides more accountability and more accurate information.  However,
   repeated investigations have shown that the present system does not
   do anything to promote such accuracy.[ICANN-Integrity]

   Creation and registration of a domain name has become confused under
   the current system with a perceived need for registries and
   registrants to publish contact information for end users.  Allowing
   domain registrants to provide their own public contact information is
   a more flexible approach, and can draw on DNSSEC, server
   certificates, and other existing authentication mechanisms instead of
   making the domain registration process bear that additional
   publication burden.

6.  Security Considerations

   This application is only as secure as the DNS on which it is based.
   The use of DNSSEC as defined in [I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnssec-intro] and
   related specifications is thus highly recommended in conjunction with
   this application.  In particular, use of the "https" URL scheme
   without the use of DNSSEC makes the unwarranted illusion of
   authenticity and the possibility of active attacks a serious concern.

7.  ICANN Considerations

7.1  iam Services Registry

   As described in Section 3, a new registry is created which lists
   valid entries for the second service parameters entry in the NAPTR
   resource record.

   The registry type, is "Specification Required", meaning that the
   field "must be documented in an RFC or other permanent and readily
   available reference, in sufficient detail so that interoperability
   between independent implementations is possible."[RFC2434]

   The registry contains three fields:
   o  "service parameter" contains an alphanumeric string.
   o  "description" contains a short verbal description.
   o  "reference" contains a reference to an RFC or other archival
      document meeting the "Specification Required" standard.

   The initial values of the registry are:

   Service Parameter   Description                       Reference
   =================   ================================  =========
   opaque              The resulting URI has no          [RFCXXXX]
                       predefined structure.
   rfc2629             The resulting URI conforms to     [RFCXXXX]
                       the <reference> as defined
                       in RFC2629.


7.2  URL Scheme Registration Template

   Per the requirements of [RFC2717], the "iam" URL scheme is registered
   under the IETF tree, and should be added to the Official IANA
   Registry of URI Schemes[IANA-URI] as follows:

   Scheme Name     Description                                    Reference
   -----------     -----------------------------------------      ---------
   iam             iam service                                    [RFCXXXX]

   The syntax of the scheme, defined as a subset of the generic
   components of [RFC2396], modified to conform to [RFC2234]  is as
   follows:

         netpath       = "//" authority

         host          = hostname
         hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
         domainlabel   = alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
         toplabel      = alpha / alpha *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
         alpha         = lowalpha / upalpha
                         ; note: domain names are not case sensitive

         lowalpha = "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" /
                    "j" / "k" / "l" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" / "q" / "r" /
                    "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"

         upalpha  = "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "I" /
                    "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "O" / "P" / "Q" / "R" /
                    "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z"

         digit    = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" /
                    "8" / "9"

         alphanum = alpha / digit

   Additional Considerations Per the Requirements of the Registration
   Template:
   o  Character encoding considerations are based on the underlying DNS.
      In particular, non-USASCII names are based on the IDN standards as
      detailed in  [RFC3490], [RFC3491], and [RFC3492].
   o  The intended usage of this application is to furnish contact
      information for a domain name.
   o  Applications and/or protocols which will use this URL scheme name
      are client applications which provide an alternative to
      WHOIS-based domain name lookup.
   o  Any interoperability considerations are based on the underlying
      DNS.
   o  Security considerations are discussed in Section 6 of this
      document.
   o  Contact information is included in this document.
   o  Change control of this scheme will be with the IETF.

Appendix A.  Reference Implementation (Non-Normative)

   A set of NAPTR records have been installed in the "simians.net"
   subdomain and can be retrieved using "dig" or other DNS utilities:

   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;simians.net.                   IN      NAPTR

   A simple utility written in PERL accepts a lookup key and returns a
   URL using the specifications in this document:

   #!/usr/bin/perl
   use strict;

   # http://www.net-dns.org/
   use Net::DNS;

   my $target = $ARGV[0];
   &usage()
     if ( $target eq "" )
     || ( $target !~ /^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z.-]*/ )
     || ( $target =~ /help/i );
   my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;
   my $query = $res->query( "$target", "NAPTR" );
   if ( !$query ) {
       warn "Query failed: ", $res->errorstring, "\n";
       exit;
   }
   my @rr = $query->answer;
