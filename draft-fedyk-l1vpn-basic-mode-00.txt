     Abstract 
         
        This draft describes the basic mode of Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPN BM) 
        that is port based VPNs. In L1VPN BM, the basic unit of service 
        is a Label Switched Path (LSP) between a pair of customer ports 
        within a given VPN port-topology. This draft defines the 
        operational model using either provisioning or a VPN auto-
        discovery mechanism and the signaling extensions for the L1VPN 
        BM. This draft uses BGP as an example of the auto-discovery 
        mechanism.

     1. Introduction 
         
         
        In this document, we consider a service provider network that 
        consists of devices that support GMPLS (e.g., Lambda Switch 
        Capable devices, Optical Cross Connect, SDH Cross Connect, 
        etc.). We partition these devices into P (provider) and PE 
        (provider edge) devices. In the context of this document we'll 
        refer to the former devices as just "P", and to the latter 
        devices as just "PE". The Ps are connected only to the devices 
        within the provider's network. The PEs are connected to the 
        other devices within the provider network (either Ps, or PEs), 
        as well as to the devices outside of the provider network. 
        We'll refer to such other devices as Client Edge Devices (CEs). 
        An example of a CE would be a router, an SDH cross-connect, or 
        an Ethernet switch. 
         
        The [GMPLS-OVERLAY] draft is the basis for signaling from the 
        CE to the PE. In the [GMPLS-OVERLAY] draft the terms Core Node 
        (CN) and Edge Node (EN) correspond to PE and CE respectively.

        Figure 1: Generalized Layer 1 VPN Reference Model 
         
        This draft specifies how the L1VPN Basic Mode (BM) service can 
        be realized using VPN auto-discovery and Generalized Multi-
        Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)Signaling [GMPLS-RSVP-TE], 
        Routing [GMPLS-Routing] and LMP [GMPLS-LMP] mechanisms. The 
        L1VPN auto-discovery has similar requirements to the L3VPNs 
        auto-discovery [L3VPN-REQ]. As with L3VPNs there are protocol 
        options to be made with auto-discovery. For illustration 
        purposes BGP is used as a protocol example but other protocols 
        or methods of VPN distribution may be equally well suited.   
        GMPLS routing and signaling are used without extensions within 
        the provider network to establish and maintain Lambda Switch 
        Capable (LSC) or SONET/SDH (TDM) connections between provider 
        nodes. This follows the model in [GMPLS-Overlay]. LMP can be 
        used to automate link discovery and augment routing as well as 
        failure handling capabilities.   
      
     2. Layer 1 VPN Services 
         
        Layer 1 services on the interfaces of customer and provider 
        ports could be any of the L1 interfaces supported by GMPLS. 
        Since the mechanisms specified here use GMPLS as the signaling 
        mechanism, and since GMPLS applies to both SONET/SDH (TDM) and 
        Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) interfaces, it results that L1VPN 
        services includes but is not restricted to Lambda Switch 
        Capable or TDM based equipment. Note that this document 
        describes Basic Mode L1 VPNs and as such assumes that (1) GMPLS 
        RSVP-TE is used for signaling both within the service provider 
        (between PEs), as well as between the customer and the service 
        provider (between CE and PE); (2) GMPLS RSVP-TE is used not 
        just as a signaling mechanism, but also as a routing mechanism 
        within the provider network. Basic Mode L1 VPNs do not assume

        for GMPLS Routing on the CE-PE link since outside the scope of 
        a basic mode of operation.  
         
        A CE is connected to a PE via one or more links. In the context 
        of this document a link is the same as a GMPLS Traffic 
        Engineering (TE) link construct, as defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING]. 
        In the context of this document a link is a logical construct 
        that is a member of a VPN hence introducing the notion of 
        membership to a set of CEs forming the VPN. Interfaces at the 
        end of each link could be any of the interfaces that are 
        supported by GMPLS. Likewise, CEs and PEs could be any devices 
        that are supported by GMPLS (e.g., optical cross connects, SDH 
        cross-connects, LSRs, etc). 
         
        Each link may consist of one or more channels or sub-channels 
        (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot respectively). For 
        the purpose of this discussion we assume that all the channels 
        within a given link have shared similar characteristics (e.g.,  
        switching capabilities, encoding, type, etc_), and can be 
        selected independently from the CE's point of view. Channels on 
        different links of a CE need not have the same characteristics. 
      
        There may be more than one link between a given CE PE pair. A 
        CE may be connected to more than one PE (with at least one port 
        per each PE). And, of course, a PE may have more than one CE 
        from different VPNs connected to it.  
         
        If a CE is connected to a PE via multiple links and all these 
        links belong to the same VPN, then for the purpose of this 
        document these links could be treated as a single link using 
        the link bundling constructs [LINK-BUNDLING]. 
      
        A link may have only data bearing channels, or only control 
        bearing channels, or both.  For the purpose of this discussion 
        we assume that for a given CE-PE pair at least one of the links 
        between them has at least one data bearing channel, and at 
        least one control bearing channel, or there is IP reachbility 
        between the CE and the PE that could be used to exchange 
        control information.  
      
        A point-to-point link has two end-points - one on the CE and 
        one on the PE. In the context of this document we'll refer to 
        the former as "CE port", and to the latter as "PE port". From 
        the above it follows that a CE is connected to a PE via one or 
        more ports, where each port may consist of one or more channels 
        or sub-channels (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot 
        respectively), and all the channels within a given port have 
        shared similar characteristics (e.g., capabilities, encoding, 
        etc_), and can be interchanged from the CEs point of view. Just 
        like links, in the context of this document, ports are logical 
        construct that are used to represent grouping of physical

        resources on a per L1VPN basis that are used to connect a CE to 
        a PE.  
         
        At any given point in time, a given port on a PE is associated 
        with at most one L1VPN, or to be more precise with at most one 
        Port Information Table maintained by the PE (although different 
        ports on a given PE could be associated with different L1VPNs, 
        or to be more precise with different Port Information Tables). 
        The association of a port with a VPN may defined by 
        provisioning the relationship on the provider devices. In other 
        words the context of a VPN membership in Basic mode is enforced 
        by service provider control.  
         
        This document assumes that the interface between the CE and PE 
        used for the purpose of signaling is capable to 
        initiate/process GMPLS protocols messages [GMPLS-RSVP-TE] and 
        follows the procedures described in [GMPLS-OVERLAY]. 
         
        An important goal of L1VPN services (particularly with respect 
        to basic mode services) is the ability to support what is known 
        as "single end provisioning", where the addition of a new port 
        to a given L1VPN would involve configuration changes only on 
        the PE that has this port.  The extension of this model to the 
        CE is outside the scope of the L1VPN BM.  In L1VPN BM a CE 
        device could be provisioned with the corresponding port 
        information in much the same manner an overlay service is 
        provisioned today.  
        Another important goal in the L1VPN service is the ability to 
        establish/terminate an LSP between a pair of (existing) ports 
        within a L1VPN from the CE devices without involving 
        configuration changes in any of the provider's devices. In 
        other words, the VPN topology is under the CE device control.  
         
        The mechanisms outlined in this document aim at achieving these 
        above goals. Specifically, as part of the L1VPN service 
        offering, these mechanisms (1) enable the service provider to 
        restrict the set of ports to which a given port could be 
        connected, (2) enable a CE to establish the actual LSP to a 
        subset of ports. Finally, the mechanisms allow arbitrary L1VPN 
        topologies to be supported ranging from hub-and-spoke to full 
        mesh point to point connections. Other more advanced service and 
        topology support such as point to multi point (P2MP) services 
        etc. is for further study. 
      
        The L1VPN BM draft does not specify the exchange of CE routing 
        or topology information to the provider. This type of 
        information is not precluded from the architecture but is 
        beyond the scope of this document.

        GMPLS established conventions for Addressing and link numbering 
        are discussed in the [GMPLS-Arch] documents.  This section 
        builds on those definitions for the L1VPN case where we now 
        have Customer and Provider addresses in a Layer 1 Context.  
         
     3.1 Service Provider Realm 
         
        This document assumes that a service provider, or a group of 
        service providers that collectively offer L1VPN service, have a 
        single addressing realm that spans all PE devices involved in 
        providing the L1VPN service. This is necessary to enable GMPLS 
        mechanisms for path establishment and maintenance. We will 
        refer to this realm as the service provider addressing realm. 
        This document further assumes that each L1VPN customer has its 
        own addressing realm. We will refer to such realms as the 
        customer addressing realms. Customer addressing realms may 
        overlap with each other, and may also overlap with the service 
        provider addressing realm. 
         
     3.2 Layer 1 Ports and Index 
      
        Within a given L1VPN each port on a CE that connects the CE to 
        a PE has an identifier that is unique within that L1VPN (but 
        need not be unique across several L1VPNs). One way to construct 
        such an identifier is to assign each port an address that is 
        unique within a given L1VPN, and use this address as a port 
        identifier. Another way to construct such an identifier is to 
        assigned each port on a CE an index that is unique within that 
        CE, assign each CE an address that is unique within a given 
        L1VPN, and then use a tuple <port index, CE address> as a port 
        identifier. Note that both the port and the CE address may be 
        an address in several formats.  This includes, but not limited 
        to IPv4, IPv6, and NSAP. Note that NSAP addresses may be 
        carried in IPv6 Fields as specified in [NSAP-IPv6]. This 
        identifier is part of the Customer Addressing Realm and is used 
        by the CE device to identify the CE port and the CE remote port 
        for signaling.  CEs do not know or understand the Provider 
        Realm addresses.   
      
        Within a service provider network, each port on a PE that 
        connects that PE to a CE has an identifier that is unique 
        within that network. One way to construct such an identifier is 
        to assign each port on a PE an index that is unique within that 
        PE, assign each PE an IP address that is unique within the 
        service provider addressing realm, and then use a tuple <port 
        index, PE IP address> as a port identifier within the provider 
        network. Another way to construct such an identifier is to 
        assign an IP address that is unique within the service provider 
        addressing realm to each such port. Either way, this IP address 
        is internal to the service provider network and is used for 
        GMPLS signaling within the service provider network. 
      
      
     Fedyk & Rekhter.                                          [Page 6]

        As a result, each link connecting the CE to the PE is 
        associated with a CE port that has a unique identifier within a 
        given L1VPN, and with a PE port that has a unique identifier 
        within the service provider network. We'll refer to the former 
        as the customer port identifier (CPI), and to the latter as the 
        provider port identifier (PPI). 
         
     3.3 Port and Index Mapping 
      
        This document assumes that each PE port that has a PPI also has 
        an identifier that is unique within the L1VPN customer 
        addressing realm of the L1VPN associated with that port.  One 
        way to construct such an identifier is to assign each port an 
        address that is unique within a given L1VPN customer addressing 
        realm, and use this address as a port identifier. Another way 
        to construct such an identifier is to assign each port an index 
        that is unique within a given PE, assign each PE an IP address 
        that is unique within a given L1VPN customer addressing realm 
        (but need not be unique within the service provider network), 
        and then use a tuple <port index, PE IP address> that acts as a 
        port identifier.  We'll refer to such port identifier as the 
        VPN-PPI.  
         
        For L1VPNs it is a requirement that provider operations are 
        independent of the VPN customers addressing realm and the 
        provider addressing realm is hidden from the customer. To 
        achieve this we have created two identifies, one customer 
        facing and the other provider facing. The PE IP address used 
        for the VPN-PPI is independent of the PE IP address used for 
        the PPI (as the two are taken from different address realms, 
        the former from the provider's addressing realm and the latter 
        from a VPN customer's addressing realm). If for a given port on 
        a PE, the PPI and the VPN-PPI are both unnumbered, then they 
        both could use exactly the same port index. This is a mere 
        convenience since the PPI and VPN_PPI can be in any combination 
        of valid formats.

        For a given link connecting a CE to a PE, if the CPI is an IP 
        address, then the VPN-PPI has to be an IP address as well. And 
        if the CPI is an <port index, CPI IP address>, then the VPN-PPI 
        must be a <port index, PE IP address>. However, for a given 
        port on PE, whether the VPN-PPI of that port is an IP address 
        or a <port index, PE IP address> is independent of whether the 
        PPI of that port is an IP address or a <port index, PE IP 
        address>. 
         
        This document assumes that assignment of the PPIs is controlled 
        solely by the service provider (without any coordination with 
        the L1VPN customers), while assignment of addresses used by the 
        CPIs and VPN-PPIs is controlled solely by the administrators of 
        L1VPN . The L1VPN administrator is the entity that controls the 
        L1VPN service specifics for the L1VPN customers. This function 
        may be owned by the service provider but may also be performed 
        by a third party who has agreements with the service provider. 
        And, of course, each L1VPN could assign such addresses on its 
        own, without any coordination with other L1VPNs. This document 
        also assumes that there is an IP control channel between the CE 
        and the PE. This channel could be either a single IP hop, or a 
        tunnel (GRE or IP-in-IP) or an IP private network, or even an 
        IP VPN for example. We'll refer to the CE's address of this 
        channel as the CE Control Channel Address (CE-CC-Addr), and to 
        the PE's address of this channel as the PE Control Channel 
        Address (PE-CC-Addr). Both CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr are 
        required to be unique within the L1VPN they belong to, but are 
        not required to be unique across multiple L1VPNs. Control 
        channel addresses are not shared amongst multiple VPNs. 
        Assignment of CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr are controlled by the 
        administrators of the L1VPN. 
         
        Multiple ports on a CE could share the same control channel 
        only as long as all these ports belong to the same L1VPN. 
        Likewise, multiple ports on a PE could share the same control 
        channel only as long as all these ports belong to the same 
        L1VPN.  
         
     4. Port Based L1VPN Basic Mode 
         
        An L1VPN is a port-based VPN service where a pair of CEs could 
        be connected through the service provider network via a GMPLS-
        based LSP within a given VPN port topology. It is precisely 
        this LSP that forms the basic unit of the L1VPN service that 
        the service provider network offers. If a port by which a CE is 
        connected to a PE consists of multiple channels (e.g., multiple 
        wavelengths), the CE could establish LSPs to multiple other CEs 
        over this single port. 
      
        In the L1VPN, the service provider does not initiate the 
        creation of an LSP between a pair of PE ports. This is done 
      
     Fedyk & Rekhter.                                          [Page 8] 
      

      
     Internet Draft   draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-00.txt     Oct. 2005 
      
        rather by the CEs, which attach to the ports. However, the SP, 
        by using the mechanisms/toolkit outlined in this document, 
        restricts the set of other PE ports, which may be the remote 
        endpoints of LSPs that have the given port as the local 
        endpoint. Subject to these restrictions, the CE-to-CE 
        connectivity is under the control of the CEs themselves. In 
        other words, the SP allows a L1VPN to have a certain set of 
        topologies (expressed as a port-to-port connectivity matrix; 
        CE-initiated signaling is used to choose a particular topology 
        from that set. 
         
        For each L1VPN that has at least one port on a given PE, the PE 
        maintains a port information table (PIT) associated with that 
        L1VPN. A PIT contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all the 
        ports within its L1VPN. In addition, for local PE ports of a 
        given L1VPN the tuples also include the VPN-PPIs of these 
        ports.

     4.1 L1VPN Port Information Tables 
         
        A PIT may be populated entirely by provisioning. This allows 
        the PE to PE ports to be connected on demand.  This means that 
        the table entries are provisioned either on each PE box for 
        each corresponding L1VPN or on a provisioning system in the 
        provider control. This may or may not mean that CE addresses 
        are entered multiple times on multiple PEs. As the network 
        grows some form of automation is desirable.  
      
     Fedyk & Rekhter.                                          [Page 9] 
      

      
     Internet Draft   draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-00.txt     Oct. 2005 
      
        The PIT is by nature VPN-specific in that entries for a L1VPN 
        are only required on a PE if that PE locally supports that 
        L1VPN by having CEs belonging to that VPN attached to the PE. 
        However, the full set of PITs with all L1VPN entries for 
        multiple VPNs may also be available to all PEs.   
         
        Another option is to have an auto-discovery mechanism; for 
        example BGP Auto-discovery could be modified for L1VPN. L1VPN 
        auto-discovery has the advantage of reducing the configuration 
        for L1VPNs which could be desirable in large VPNs.  
         
        A PIT on a given PE is populated from two sources:  
         
          1. The information related to the CEs' ports attached to the 
             ports on that PE (this information could be optionally 
             received from the CEs, however in Basic Mode we assume 
             this information is provisioned.) Beyond Basic Mode this 
             information could be discovered by several mechanism such 
             as LMP, IGPs or BGP.  
          2. The information received from other PEs. This is the 
             information that is auto-discovered within the Provider 
             Network. 
         
        We'll refer to the former as the "local" information, and to 
        the latter as the "remote" information.  
         
        A way to propagate this local information to other PEs is by 
        using BGP VPN auto-discovery procedures, as specified in [BGP-
        VPN-AUTODISCOVERY]. In this case to restrict the flow of this 
        information to only the PITs within a given L1VPN, we use BGP 
        route filtering based on the Route Target Extended Community 
        [BGP-COMM], as follows: 
         
        Each PIT on a PE is configured with one or more Route Target 
        Communities, called "Export Route Targets" that are used to tag 
        the local information when it is exported into provider's BGP. 
        The granularity of such tagging could be as fine as a single 
        <CPI, PPI> pair. In addition, each PIT on a PE is configured 
        with one or more Route Target Communities, called "Import Route 
        Targets". Import Route Targets restrict the set of routes that 
        could be imported from the provider's BGP into the PIT to only 
        those routes that include at least one of these Communities.    
         
        When a service provider adds a new L1VPN port to a particular 
        PE, this port is associated at provisioning time with a PIT on 
        that PE, and this PIT is associated (again at provisioning 
        time) with that L1VPN.  
         
        For the purpose of L1VPN BM the CE only knows the local CPI 
        addresses and the remote CPI Addresses.   
      
     4.2 CE to CE LSP Establishment 
      
     Fedyk & Rekhter.                                         [Page 10] 
      

      
     Internet Draft   draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-00.txt     Oct. 2005 
      
         
        In order to establish an LSP, a CE needs to identify all other 
        CEs in the CE's L1VPN it wants to connect to. A CE may already 
        have obtained this information through provisioning or through 
        some other schemes (such schemes are outside the scope of this 
        document). 
         
        Ports associated with a given CE-PE link, in addition to their 
        CPI and PPI may also have other information associated with 
        them that describes characteristics and constraints of the 
        channels within these ports, such as encoding supported by the 
        channels, bandwidth of a channel, total unreserved bandwidth 
        within the port, etc. This information could be further 
        augmented with the information about certain capabilities of 
        the Service Provider network (e.g., support RSOH DCC 
        transparency, arbitrary concatenation, etc.). This information 
        is used to ensure that ports at each end of an LSP have 
        compatible characteristics, and that there are sufficient 
        unallocated resources to establish an LSP between these ports.  
         
        It may happen that for a given pair of ports within an L1VPN, 
        each of the CEs connected to these ports would concurrently try 
        to establish an LSP to the other CE. If having a pair of LSPs 
        between a pair of ports is viewed as undesirable, the way to 
        resolve this is to require the CE with the lower value of the 
        CPI to terminate the LSP originated by the CE. This option 
        could be controlled by configuration on the CE devices. 
      
     4.3 Signaling  
         
        In L1VPN BM a CE needs to be configured with the CPIs of other 
        ports. Once a CE is configured with the CPIs of the other ports 
        within the same L1VPN, which we'll refer to as "target ports", 
        the CE uses a (subset of) GMPLS signaling, to request the 
        provider network to establish an LSP to a target port.  
         
        For inter-CE connectivity, the request originated by the CE 
        contains the CPI of the port on the CE that CE wants to use for 
        the LSP, and the CPI of the target port. When the PE attached 
        to the CE that originated the request receives the request, the 
        PE identifies the appropriate PIT, and then uses the 
        information in that PIT to find out the PPI associated with the 
        CPI of the target port carried in the request. The PPI should 
        be sufficient for the PE to establish an LSP. Ultimately the 
        request reaches the CE associated with the target CPI (note 
        that the request still carries the CPI of the CE that 
        originated the request). If the CE associated with the target 
        CPI accepts the request, the LSP is established.  
         
        Note that a CE need not establish an LSP to every target port 
        that CE knows about - it is a local CE matter to select a

        subset of target ports to which the CE will try to establish 
        LSPs. 
          
        The procedures for establishing an individual connection 
        between two corresponding CEs is the same as the procedure 
        specified for GMPLS overlay. [GMPLS-OVERLAY] 
          
     4.3.1 Signaling Procedures 
      
        When a CE sends an RSVP Path message to a PE, the source IP 
        address in the IP packet that carries the message is set to the 
        appropriate CE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address in the 
        packet is set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr. When the PE sends 
        back to the CE the corresponding Resv message, the source IP 
        address in the IP packet that carries the message is set to the 
        PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address is set to the CE-CC-
        Addr. 
         
        Likewise, when a PE sends an RSVP Path message to a CE, the 
        source IP address in the IP packet that carries the message is 
        set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP 
        address in the packet is set to the appropriate CE-CC-Addr. 
        When the CE sends back to the PE the corresponding Resv 
        message, the source IP address in the IP packet that carries 
        the message is set to the CE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP 
        address is set to the PE-CC-Addr. 
         
        In addition to being used for IP addresses in the IP packet 
        that carries RSVP messages between CE and PE, CE-CC-Addr and 
        PE-CC-Addr are also used in the Next/Previous Hop Address field 
        of the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object that is carried between CEs and 
        PEs. 
         
        In the case where a link between CE and PE is a numbered non-
        bundled link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used for the 
        Type 1 or 2 TLVs of the IF_ID RSVP HOP object that is carried 
        between the CE and PE. In the case where a link between CE and 
        PE is an unnumbered non-bundled link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of 
        that link are used for the IP Address field of the Type 3 TLV. 
        In the case where a link between CE and PE is a bundled link, 
        the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used for the IP Address 
        field of the Type 3 TLVs. 
         
        When a CE originates a Path message to establish an LSP from a 
        particular port on that CE to a particular target port the CE 
        uses the CPI of its port in the Sender Template object. If the 
        CPI of the target port is an IP address, then the CE uses it in 
        the Session object. And if the CPI of the target port is a 
        <port index, IP address> tuple, then the CE uses the IP address 
        part of the tuple in the Session object, and the whole tuple as 
        the Unnumbered Interface ID subobject in the ERO. When the Path 
        message arrives at the ingress PE, the PE selects the PIT 
      
     Fedyk & Rekhter.                                         [Page 12] 
      

      
     Internet Draft   draft-fedyk-l1vpn-basic-mode-00.txt     Oct. 2005 
      
        associated with the L1VPN, and then uses this PIT to map CPIs 
        carried in the Session and the Sender Template objects to the 
        appropriate PPIs. Once the mapping is done, the ingress PE 
        replaces CPIs with these PPIs. As a result, the Session and the 
        Sender Template objects that are carried in the GMPLS signaling 
        within the service provider network carry PPIs, and not CPIs. 
        At the egress PE, the PE performs the reverse mapping - it maps 
        PPIs carried in the Session and the Sender Template object into 
        the appropriate CPIs, and then sends the Path message to the CE 
        that has the target port.  
         
        At the egress PE, the reverse mapping operation is performed. 
        The PE extracts the ingress/egress PPI values carried in the 
        SENDER_TEMPLATE and SESSION objects (respectively). The egress 
        PE identifies the appropriate PIT to find out the appropriate 
        CPI associated with the PPI of the egress CE. Once the mapping 
        is retrieved, the egress PE replaces the ingress/egress PPI 
        values with the corresponding CPI values. As a result, the 
        SESSION and the SENDER_TEMPLATE objects included in the GMPLS 
        RSVP-TE Path message sent from the egress PE to the egress CE 
        carry CPIs, and not PPIs. Here also, for the GMPLS RSVP-TE Path 
        messages sent from the egress PE to CE, the source IP address 
        (of the IP packet carrying this message) is set to the 
        appropriate PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address (of the 
        IP packet carrying this message) is set to the appropriate CE-
        CC-Addr.  
         
        When the Path message reaches the egress CE, and gets 
        processed, the latter initiates towards the egress PE the 
        exchange of the Resv message. Here, the FILTER_SPEC object is 
        process similarly to the SENDER_TEMPLATE object. Both egress 
        and ingress PE (in sequence), performs the same mapping 
        operation as with the corresponding Path message. Once the Resv 
        message reaches the ingress CE, the switched connection is 
        established. 
        An ingress PE may receive and potentially reject a Path message 
        that contains ERO (Explicit Route Object), or ERO and so cause 
        the switched connection setup to fail. However, the ingress PE 
        may accept EROs, which include a sequence of [<ingress PE 
        (strict), egress CE CPI (loose)>].  
        -    Path message without ERO: when an ingress PE receives a 
        Path message from an ingress CE that contains no ERO, it MUST 
        calculate a route to the destination for the PE-to-PE LSP and 
        include that route in a ERO, before forwarding the Path 
        message. One exception would be if the egress core node were 
        also adjacent to this core node.  
        -    Path message with ERO: when an ingress PE receives a Path 
        message from an ingress CE that contains an ERO (of the form 
        detailed above), the former computes a path to reach to reach 
        the egress PE. It then inserts this path as part of the ERO 
        before forwarding the Path message.

        An ingress or an egress PE may include an RECORD_ROUTE object 
        and remove/filter the RRO from the received Path message before 
        forwarding it. Further an egress or an ingress PE may 
        remove/filter the RRO from a Resv message before forwarding it. 
        Filtering a RRO consist in editing its content and include only 
        the subobjects based on a local or global policy. This allows 
        the ingress/egress CE to be aware of the selected link and 
        labels on the egress/ingress CE side, respectively, for the 
        switched connections constituting this L1VPN. 
      
        The exact format of the extensions is TBD in a future revision.  
         
         
     5. Security Considerations 
         
        Since association of a particular port with a particular L1VPN 
        (or to be more precise with a particular PIT) is done by the 
        service provider as part of the service provisioning process 
        (and thus can't be altered via signaling between CE and PE), 
        and since signaling between CE and PE is assumed to be over a 
        private network (and thus can't be spoofed by entities outside 
        the private network), the solution described in this document 
        doesn't require authentication in signaling.
