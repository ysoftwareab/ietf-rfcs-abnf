Abstract

   This document is a proposal to redefine the existing DNS AAAA
   resource record into two resource records: an RG record to define the
   routing topology of an IPv6 address and an aAA record to define the
   End System Identifier of an IPv6 address.  The document will define
   the synthesis of the RG and aAA record at the DNS primary server,
   which will return an AAAA record to DNS resolvers.  The objective of
   this work is to split the AAAA record in the DNS into location and
   identifier to provide future capabilities for dynamic renumbering of
   addresses.  This work was spawned by the GSE - Alternate Addressing
   Architecture Proposal for IPv6.

1. Introduction

   This document is a proposal to redefine the existing DNS AAAA
   resource record [3,4] into two resource records: an RG record to
   define the routing topology of an IPv6 address and an aAA record to
   define the End System Identifier of an IPv6 address.  The document
   will define the synthesis of the RG and aAA record at the DNS primary
   server, which will return an AAAA record to DNS resolvers.  The
   objective of this work is to split the AAAA record in the DNS into
   location and identifier to provide future capabilities for dynamic
   renumbering of addresses.  This work was spawned by the GSE -
   Alternate Addressing Architecture Proposal for IPv6 [5].

   The design objective of these two record types is to make it
   transparent to existing DNS resolvers and the DNS protocol used  to
   query for AAAA records.

   This proposal is dependent on the IPng WG buying into new definitions
   via a new addressing architecture proposal, support for clear
   boundaries for an end system identifier, and the definition of the
   routing goop to define location for the end system identifier.  Upon
   completion of that work in the WG if it moves forward the author can
   finish this specification where "????" and "TBD" exists presently.



2. Terminology and Definitions

   node         - A device that implements IPv6.

   interface    - A node's attachment to the link.

   address      - An IP layer identifier for an interface or a set
                  of interfaces.




3. New Resource Record Definitions

   Two new record types are defined to store a node's IPv6 address. A
   node that has more than one IPv6 address must have more than one such
   record or record combinations.



3.1 aAA record type

   The aAA resource record type is a new record specific to the Internet
   class that stores a single IPv6 address for a nodes interface.  It is
   an ESD as defined in TBD.

   The value of the type is TBD (decimal).

3.2 RG record type

   The RG resource record type is a new record specific to the Internet
   class that stores a single IPv6 address for a nodes location within a
   routing domain.  It is RG as defined in TBD.

   The value of the type is TBD (decimal).



3.3 aAA data format

   A ??? bit IPv6 ESD address is encoded in the data portion of an aAA
   resource record in network byte order (high-order byte first).



3.4 RG data format

   A ??? bit IPv6 RG address is encoded in the data portion of an RG
   resource record in network byte order (high-order byte first).



3.5 AAAA query

   An AAAA [1,2,4] query for a specified domain name in the Internet
   class returns all associated AAAA resource records in the answer
   section of a response.  The DNS primary server [2] will synthesize
   the RG and aAA records to produce an AAAA record in the answer
   section of the response for a query for an AAAA record.

   A type AAAA query does not perform additional section processing.




3.6 Textual format of aAA and RG records

   The textual representation of the data portion of an aAA and RG
   resource record used in a master database file is the textual
   representation of a IPv6 address as defined in [3 + update for aAA
   and RG TBD].



4. Modifications to existing Query Types

   Query processing as defined for AAAA records [4] would continue to be
   processed as defined presently for IPv6.  The DNS primary server
   would bee responsible for concatentating the RG and aAA records to
   respond to an AAAA query from resolvers.  There may be multiple RG's
   defined for each aAA record, and in those cases the DNS primary
   server after synthesis of RG's to a specific aAA record must return
   muliple AAAA record types in the answer section of a query response
   for AAAA records.

   The exception for the present AAAA records as defined is the IP6.INT

   domain.  The IPng WG at present is discussing a new methodology to
   obtain addresses for names in a query but use of an ICMP message to
   determine the name for an address.  This needs further investigation
   to determine it if has an affect on AAAA records.

   But the same synthesis of RG + aAA records can be done for the
   reverse address requirement for DNS PTR records [2], to process AAAA
   reverse lookups in the DNS.



5. Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
