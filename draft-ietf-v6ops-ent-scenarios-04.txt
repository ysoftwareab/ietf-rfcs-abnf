 enterprise networks.  It defines a small set of basic enterprise
 scenarios and includes pertinent questions to allow enterprise
 administrators to further refine their deployment scenarios.
 Enterprise deployment requirements are discussed in terms of
 coexistence with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications, and in
 terms of basic network infrastructure requirements for IPv6
 deployment.  The scenarios and requirements described in this

Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


1.  Introduction

 This document describes the scenarios for IPv6 deployment within
 enterprise networks.  It defines a small set of basic enterprise
 scenarios and includes pertinent questions to allow enterprise
 administrators to further refine their deployment scenarios.
 Enterprise deployment requirements are discussed in terms of
 coexistence with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications, and in
 terms of basic network infrastructure requirements for IPv6
 deployment.  The scenarios and requirements described in this
 document will be the basis for further analysis to determine what
 coexistence techniques and mechanisms are needed for enterprise
 IPv6 deployment.  The results of that analysis will be published in
 a separate document.

 The audience for this document is the enterprise network team
 considering deployment of IPv6.  The document will be useful for
 enterprise teams that will have to determine the IPv6 transition
 strategy for their enterprise.  It is expected those teams include
 members from management, network operations, and engineering. The
 scenarios presented provide an example set of cases the enterprise
 can use to build an IPv6 network scenario.

 To frame the discussion, the document will describe a set of
 scenarios and network infrastructure for each scenario. It is
 impossible to define every possible enterprise scenario that will
 apply to IPv6 adoption and transition.

 Each enterprise will select the transition that best supports their
 business requirements. Any attempt to define a default or one-
 size-fits-all transition scenario, will simply not work. This
 document does not try to depict the drivers for adoption of IPv6 by
 an enterprise.

 While it is difficult to quantify all the scenarios for an
 enterprise network team to plan for IPv6, it is possible to depict
 a set of abstract scenarios that will assist with planning. The
 document presents three base scenarios as a general use case to be
 used as a model as input for the enterprise to define specific
 scenarios.

 The first scenario assumes the enterprise decides to deploy IPv6 in
 conjunction with IPv4.  The second scenario assumes the enterprise
 decides to deploy IPv6 because of a specific set of applications
 the enterprise wants to use over an IPv6 network.  The third
 scenario assumes an enterprise is building a new network or re-
 structuring an existing network and decides to deploy IPv6 as the
 predominant protocol within the enterprise coexisting with IPv4.
 The document then briefly reviews a set of network infrastructure
 components that must be analyzed, which are common to most
 enterprises.

 The document then provides three specific scenario examples using
 the network infrastructure components to depict the requirements.
 These are common enterprise deployment cases to depict the
 challenges for the enterprise to transition a network to IPv6.

 The document then discusses the issues of supporting legacy


draft-ietf-v6ops-ent-scenarios-04.txt  Expires January 2005 [Page 3]


Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


 functions on the network, while the transition is in process, and
 the network infrastructure components required to be analyzed by
 the enterprise.  The interoperation with legacy functions within
 the enterprise will be required for all transition except possibly
 by a new network that will be IPv6 from inception.  The network
 infrastructure components will depict functions in their networks
 that require consideration for IPv6 deployment and transition.

 Using the scenarios, network infrastructure components, and
 examples in the document an enterprise can define its specific
 scenario requirements. Understanding the legacy functions and
 network infrastructure components required, the enterprise can
 determine the network operations required to deploy IPv6. The tools
 and mechanisms to support IPv6 deployment operations will require
 enterprise analysis.  The analysis to determine the tools and
 mechanisms to support the scenarios will be presented in subsequent
 document(s).

Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


2.  Terminology

 Enterprise Network - A network that has multiple internal links,
                      one or more router connections, to one or
                      more Providers and is actively managed by a
                      network operations entity.

 Provider           - An entity that provides services and
                      connectivity to the Internet or
                      other private external networks for the
                      enterprise network.

 IPv6 Capable       - A node or network capable of supporting both
                      IPv6 and IPv4.

 IPv4 only          - A node or network capable of supporting only
                      IPv4.

 IPv6 only          - A node or network capable of supporting only
                      IPv6.  This does not imply an IPv6 only
                      stack, in this document.

3.  Base Scenarios

 Three base scenarios are defined to capture the essential
 abstraction set for the enterprise. Each scenario has assumptions
 and requirements. This is not an exhaustive set of scenarios, but a
 base set of general cases.

 Below we use the term network infrastructure to mean the software,
 network operations and configuration, and the methods used to
 operate a network in an enterprise.

 At this time it is assumed for the base scenarios that any IPv6
 node is IPv6 capable.

Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


3.1  Base Scenarios Defined

 Scenario 1:   Wide-scale/total dual-stack deployment of IPv4
               and IPv6 capable hosts and network infrastructure.
               Enterprise with an existing IPv4 network wants to
               deploy IPv6 in conjunction with their IPv4 network.

 Assumptions:  The IPv4 network infrastructure used has an
               equivalent capability in IPv6.

 Requirements: Do not disrupt existing IPv4 network
               infrastructure assumptions with IPv6. IPv6
               should be equivalent or "better" than the
               network infrastructure in IPv4, however, it
               is understood that IPv6 is not required to
               solve current network infrastructure problems,
               not solved by IPv4. It may also not be feasible
               to deploy IPv6 on all parts of the network
               immediately.


 Scenario 2:   Sparse IPv6 dual-stack deployment in IPv4 network
               infrastructure.  Enterprise with an existing IPv4
               network wants to deploy a set of particular IPv6
               "applications" (application is voluntarily loosely
               defined here, e.g. peer to peer). The IPv6
               deployment is limited to the minimum required to
               operate this set of applications.

 Assumptions:  IPv6 software/hardware components for the
               application are available, and platforms for the
               application are IPv6 capable.

 Requirements: Do not disrupt IPv4 infrastructure.


 Scenario 3:   IPv6-only network infrastructure with some
               IPv4-capable nodes/applications needing to
               communicate over the IPv6 infrastructure.
               Enterprise deploying a new network or
               re-structuring an existing network, decides IPv6
               is the basis for most network communication.
               Some IPv4 capable nodes/applications will need
               to communicate over that infrastructure.

 Assumptions:  Required IPv6 network infrastructure is available,
               or available over some defined timeline,
               supporting the enterprise plan.

 Requirements: Interoperation and Coexistence with IPv4 network
               network infrastructure and applications are
               required for communications.

3.3  Specific Scenario Examples

 This section presents a set of base scenario examples and is not an
 exhaustive list of examples.  These examples were selected to
 provide further clarity for base scenarios within an enterprise of
 a less abstract nature.  The example networks may use the scenarios
 depicted in 3.1 and the infrastructure components in 3.2, but there
 is no direct implications specifically within these example
 networks.  Section 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 should be used in unison for
 enterprise IPv6 deployment planning and analysis.



 Example Network A:

 A distributed network across a number of geographically
 separated campuses.

   - External network operation.
   - External connectivity required.
   - Multiple sites connected by leased lines.
   - Provider independent IPv4 addresses.
   - ISP does not offer IPv6 service.
   - Private Leased Lines no Service Provider Used

 Applications run by the enterprise:

   - Internal Web/Mail.
   - File servers.
   - Java applications.
   - Collaborative development tools.
   - Enterprise Resource Applications.
   - Multimedia Applications.
   - Financial Enterprise Applications.
   - Data Warehousing Applications.

 Internal network operation:

   - In house operation of the network.
   - DHCP (v4) is used for all desktops, servers use
     static address configuration.
   - The DHCP server updates naming records for dynamic
     desktops uses dynamic DNS.
   - A web based tool is used to enter name to address
     mappings for statically addressed servers.
   - Network management is done using SNMP.
   - All routers and switches are upgradeable to IPv6.
   - Existing firewalls can be upgraded to support IPv6


draft-ietf-v6ops-ent-scenarios-04.txt  Expires January 2005[Page 10]


Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


     rules.
   - Load balancers do not support IPv6, upgrade path
     unclear.
   - Peer-2-Peer Application and Security supported.
   - IPv4 Private address space is used within the
     enterprise.

 Example Network B:

 A bank running a large network supporting online
 transaction processing (OLTP) across a distributed
 multi-sited network, with access to a central database
 on an external network from the OLTP network.

   - External connectivity not required.
   - Multiple sites connected by VPN.
   - Multiple sites connected by Native IP protocol.
   - Private address space used with NAT.
   - Connections to private exchanges.

 Applications in the enterprise:
   - ATM transaction application.
   - ATM management application.
   - Financial Software and Database.
   - Part of the workforce is mobile and requires
     access to the enterprise from outside networks.

 Internal Network Operation:
   - Existing firewalls can be upgraded to support
     IPv6 rules.
   - Load balancers do not support IPv6, upgrade
     path unclear.
   - Identifying and managing each node's IP address.

 Example Network C:

 A Security Defense, Emergency, or other Mission
 Critical network operation:

   - External network required at secure specific points.
   - Network is its own Internet.
   - Network must be able to absorb ad-hoc creation of
     sub-networks.
   - Entire parts of the network are completely mobile.
   - All nodes on the network can be mobile
     (including routers)
   - Network high-availability is mandatory.
   - Network must be able to be managed from ad-hoc
     location.
   - All nodes must be able to be configured from stateless
     mode.

 Applications run by the Enterprise:

   - Multimedia streaming of audio, video, and data for
     all nodes.
   - Data computation and analysis on stored and created
     data.


draft-ietf-v6ops-ent-scenarios-04.txt  Expires January 2005[Page 11]


Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


   - Transfer of data coordinate points to sensor devices.
   - Data and Intelligence gathering applications from all
     nodes.

 Internal Network Operations:
   - All packets must be secured end-2-end with encryption.
   - Intrusion Detection exists on all network entry points.
   - Network must be able to bolt on to the Internet to share
     bandwidth as required from Providers.
   - VPNs can be used but NAT can never be used.
   - Nodes must be able to access IPv4 legacy applications
     over IPv6 network.



3.4  Applicability Statement

 The specific network scenarios selected are chosen to depict a base
 set of examples, and to support further analysis of enterprise
 networks.  This is not a complete set of network scenarios.
 Regarding Example Network C, though this is a verifiable use case,
 at this time the scenario defines an early adopter of enterprise
 networks transitioning to IPv6 as a predominant protocol strategy
 (e.g.  IPv6 Routing, Applications, Security, and Operations),
 viewing IPv4 as legacy operations immediately in the transition
 strategy, and at this time may not be representative of many
 initial enterprise IPv6 deployments. Each enterprise planning team
 will need to make that determination as IPv6 deployment evolves.




4.  Network Infrastructure Component Requirements

 The enterprise will need to determine what network infrastructure
 components require enhancements or to be added for deployment of
 IPv6. This infrastructure will need to be analyzed and understood
 as a critical resource to manage.  The list in this section is not
 exhaustive but are the essential network infrastructure components
 to consider for the enterprise before they begin to define more
 fine tuned requirements such as QOS, PKI, or Bandwidth requirements
 for IPv6 as examples. The components are only identified here and
 the details of the components will be discussed in the analysis
 document for enterprise scenarios.  Where there are references at
 this time for a component they are provided.



4.1  DNS

 DNS will now have to support both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS records and the
 enterprise will need to determine how the DNS is to be managed and
 accessed, and secured.  The range of DNS operational issues are out
 of scope for this work.  Users need to consider all current DNS
 IPv4 operations and determine if those operations are supported for
 IPv6.  However, DNS resolution and transport solutions for both IP
 protocols are influenced by the chosen IPv6 deployment scenario.
 Users need to consider all current DNS IPv4 operations and


draft-ietf-v6ops-ent-scenarios-04.txt  Expires January 2005[Page 12]


Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


 determine if those operations are supported for IPv6 [DNSV6].



4.2  Routing

 Interior and Exterior routing will be required to support both IPv4
 and IPv6 routing protocols, and the coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6
 over the enterprise network.  The enterprise will need to define
 the IPv6 routing topology, any ingress and egress points to
 provider networks, and transition mechanisms they wish to use for
 IPv6 adoption. The enterprise will also need to determine what IPv6
 transition mechanisms are supported by their upstream providers.



4.3  Configuration of Hosts

 IPv6 introduces the concept of stateless autoconfiguration in
 addition to stateful autoconfiguration, for the configuration of
 hosts within the enterprise.  The enterprise will have to determine
 the best method of host configuration, for their network. The
 enterprise will need to determine if they are to use stateless or
 stateful autoconfiguration, and how autoconfiguration is to operate
 for DNS updates.  The enterprise will need to determine how prefix
 delegation is done from their upstream provider and how those
 prefixes are cascaded down to the enterprise IPv6 network.  The
 policy for DNS or choice of autoconfiguration is out of scope for
 this document. [CONF, DHCPF, DHCPL]



4.4  Security

 Current existing mechanisms used for IPv4 to provide security need
 to be supported for IPv6 within the enterprise.  IPv6 should create
 no new security concerns for IPv4.  The entire security
 infrastructure currently used in the enterprise needs to be
 analyzed against IPv6 deployment effect and determine what is
 supported in IPv6.  Users should review other security IPv6 network
 infrastructure work in the IETF and within the industry on going at
 this time.  Users will have to work with their platform and
 software providers to determine what IPv6 security network
 infrastructure components are supported. The security filters and
 firewall requirements for IPv6 need to be determined by the
 enterprise. The policy choice of users for security is out of scope
 for this document.



4.5  Applications

 Existing applications will need to be ported or provide proxies to
 support both IPv4 and IPv6 [APPS].






draft-ietf-v6ops-ent-scenarios-04.txt  Expires January 2005[Page 13]


Internet Draft   IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios         July 2004


4.6  Network Management

 The addition of IPv6 network infrastructure components will need to
 be managed by the enterprise network operations center.  Users will
 need to work with their network management platform providers to
 determine what for IPv6 is supported during their planning for IPv6
 adoption, and what tools are available in the market to monitor the
 network.  Network management will not need to support both IPv4 and
 IPv6 and view nodes as dual stacks.



4.7  Address Planning

 The address space within the enterprise will need to be defined and
 coordinated with the routing topology of the enterprise network.
 It is also important to identify the pool of IPv4 address space
 available to the enterprise to assist with IPv6 transition methods.



4.8 Multicast

 Enterprises utilizing IPv4 Multicast services will need to consider
 how these services may be implemented operationally in an IPv6-
 enabled environment.



4.9 Multihoming

 At this time, current IPv6 allocation policies are mandating the
 allocation of IPv6 address space from the upstream provider. If an
 enterprise is multihomed, the enterprise will have to determine how
 they wish to support multihoming.  This also is an area of study
 within the IETF and work in progress.




5.  Security Considerations

 This document lists scenarios for the deployment of IPv6 in
 enterprise networks, and there are no security considerations
 associated with making such a list.

 There will be security considerations for the deployment of IPv6 in
 each of these scenarios, but they will be addressed in the document
 that includes the analysis of each scenario.
