                 Internet Draft              Generic RO Model                 July 2004 
                  
                  
                     
                 1. Introduction 
                     
                    NEMO Basic Support Protocol [15] would suppose to support the 
                    transparent mobility to mobile network nodes (MNNs) in mobile 
                    networks by using MR-HA bi-directional tunnel. However, inherently 
                    due to the use of the bi-directional tunnel, there are some types 
                    of route optimization problem [14] that need our attention.  
                     
                    RO problems have a common property that there is an optimized path, 
                    but it cannot be used due to support the transparent mobility to 
                    the IP terminals. While preserving the goals of Mobile IP [1] and 
                    NEMO Basic [15], it is impossible to realize RO without introducing 
                    the tunnel-based virtual path over IP routing through some 
                    extensions or new functionalities of routing facilities. This is 
                    the reason why the existing proposed solutions for RO at least use 
                    tunnel-based packet redirection or re-routing mechanism in the 
                    extended routing facilities such as Correspondent Router (CR). 
                     
                    As a requirement about RO, we argue that RO in NEMO should be 
                    provided by a unified solution which can solve most of RO problems 
                    by applying the same principle to the routing facilities such as HA, 
                    MR, CR. If each different RO solution is used to solve each RO 
                    problem, it will produce the protocol redundancy and complexity in 
                    the routing facilities. 
                     
                    In this memo, we introduce the generic RO model that can be used as 
                    a framework to evaluate the existing RO models. Then, we analyze 
                    typical RO problems by virtue of the generic RO model. And, we 
                    discuss on the feasibility of achieving a unified RO in NEMO, and 
                    enumerate the issues that should be cleared for the purpose of that. 
                     
                     
                 2. Generic Route Optimization Model 
                     
                    Route Optimization in NEMO means that one routing entity uses an IP 
                    tunnel to redirect the original packets to the other routing entity 
                    that is most closely located from the destination. To enable such a 
                    route optimization, two routing entities must recognize each other, 
                    in other words, anyone among them should feel the need of RO tunnel 
                    and initiate the signaling procedure to make an IP tunnel between 
                    them. We can define such an IP tunnel as `RO Tunnel (ROT)` in NEMO 
                    context because it is established for the purpose of route 
                    optimization in NEMO. This is like the basic principle of Mobile IP. 
                    In Mobile IP, MN detects its movement and initiates BU to HA. Such 
                    an analogy can be extended to RO problem in NEMO. In this point of 
                    view, we can extract some of statements characterizing how to 
                    achieve RO tunnel. For example, which routing facilities can 
                    initiate RO tunnel? What information does trigger such a RO tunnel?

                    How can the trigger information be delivered to the initiator of RO 
                    tunnel? And so on. The answer to those of questions depends on the 
                    problem spaces [14] and the proposed solutions [4][5][19][20] in 
                    each problem space. 
                     
                    The attributes of RO tunnel can concretely well express the RO 
                    context including the purpose of RO, the operation of RO, and the 
                    effectiveness of RO.

                                Fig.1 Generic RO Tunnel (ROT) Model 
                     
                    Fig.1 shows the generalized ROT model. ROT can be made of at least 
                    two TEs. In here, TE is a router or host which is allowed to 
                    initiate or terminate the RO tunnel in the view of route 
                    optimization. According to the type of ROT, ROT can include zero or 
                    more TS for switching an incoming tunnel to an outgoing tunnel at 
                    that point, zero or more TR for relaying the tunneled packets to 
                    next intermediate point. As of TR, The difference is that it 
                    operates a routing mechanism, such as Source Routing using RH0 
                    header [10], based on the packet header information without the 
                    knowledge of the end-to-end tunneling, while TS processes the 
                    tunnel switching based on a given tunnel mapping information that 
                    consistently maintained in that point by interacting with other 
                    tunnel endpoints. 
                     
                    From the general ROT model, we can drive the following attributes 
                    which can be exploited to characterize a specific RO model. 
                     
                    RO Initiator (ROI) 
                        
                       We need to identify which TE among two TEs can be the initiator 
                       in making a RO tunnel. This parameter depends on the applied RO 
                       scheme. In one RO scheme, MR is only the initiator, on the other 
                       hand, HA and CR can be the initiator in the other RO scheme. 
                     
                    RO Responder (ROR)

                 Internet Draft              Generic RO Model                 July 2004 
                  
                  
                       We need to identify which routing facilities can be the 
                       responder in making a RO tunnel. This parameter also depends on 
                       the applied RO scheme. 
                     
                    RO Trigger Source (ROTS) 
                     
                       The RO initiator (ROI) is recognized for the need of RO from 
                       this information. For example, an explicit RO bit in the packet 
                       header can be used to force the receiver to start the RO. 
                     
                    RO Responder Information (RORI) 
                     
                       This information is used for the RO initiator (ROI) to identify 
                       the RO responder (ROR). It would include the address information 
                       of the moving entity such as MR, or the address information of 
                       the correspondent nodes. 
                     
                    RO Discovery Mechanism (RODM) 
                     
                       This mechanism describes that how RORI can be delivered to the 
                       RO initiator (ROI). In other words, ROI can get RORI by using 
                       this discovery mechanism. For example, if ROI itself try to find 
                       its ROR using IPv6 anycast address, RORI becomes an address of 
                       ROR and we can say that RODM is IPv6 anycasting mechanism. 
                     
                    RO Tunnel Type (ROTT) 
                     
                       ROTT can be classified as the followings: Simple ROT (SiROT), 
                       Switched ROT (SwROT), Releyed ROT (ReROT). SiROT consists of 
                       only two TEs. SwROT consists of one or more TS between two TEs. 
                       ReROT consists of one or more TR between two TEs. For example, 
                       we can say that RRH [4] uses ReROT as RO Tunnel Type, HMIPv6 
                       uses SwROT. 
                        
                     
                    More attributes to be defined. 
                     
                     
                 3. The Analysis of RO Problems in NEMO 
                     
                    In this section, we analyze typical RO problems in NEMO using the

                    Fig.2 shows the simple RO in the infrastructure. This RO model was 
                    used in ORC [19]. According to the generic ROT model, the following 
                    formulation is possible. 
                     
                    TE: Mobile Router (MR), Optimized Route Cache (ORC) Router 
                    ROI: MR

                    ROTT: SiROT 
                     
                    Above attributes compactly describes that this RO implements ROT 
                    between MR and ORC Router, and MR initiates the signaling procedure 
                    for ROT to ORC Router after getting the global IPv6 address of ORC 
                    Router through IPv6 anycast addressing. This RO model also includes 
                    some RO approaches, such as C-Side Router or Correspondent Router 
                    (CR), mentioned in RO-Taxonomy [14]. To include those of RO 
                    approaches, we can loosely redefine above attributes as follows: 
                     
                    TE: Mobile Router (MR), Optimized Route Cache (ORC) Router, C-Side

                    Fig.3 shows extended RO in the infrastructure. This RO model 
                    includes one TS entity and two TEs. Distributed Anchor Routers 
                    described in RO-Taxonomy [14] can be expressed as this model like 
                    below. 
                     
                    TE: Mobile Router (MR), C-Side Anchor Router

                    In this case, most of attributes in the ROT model are not 
                    determined, so it is required to deeply understand this RO problem 
                    and derive its viable solution.

                    NTO can be modeled like Fig.4 by using the ROT model. For example, 
                    the attributes of RRH [4] model are as follows:

                 4. Toward to a unified route optimization in NEMO 
                     
                    There are some efforts for Route Optimization (RO). For RO in the 
                    routing infrastructure, some approaches such as VIP [17], ORC [19] 
                    require a special router or the extension of the existing router 
                    which can handle the packet redirection to gain RO effect. The RO 
                    schemes belong to this category can be applied to both Mobile IP 
                    and NEMO in IP routing infrastructure. On the other hand, There are 
                    other kinds of the NEMO-specific RO problem. [14] well defines RO 
                    problem spaces of NEMO and briefly analyzes the proposed interim 
                    solutions. Typically, one of NEMO-specific RO problem is a nested 
                    tunneling problem that can be formed due to the network mobility. 
                    Most of proposed solutions are for solving that problem. As of now, 
                    it's not easy to say how RO problems in NEMO can be best solved in 
                    the reasonable manner. However, the sure thing is that current 
                    proposed solutions can be applied only to one problem space of RO. 
                    That is an uncomfortable and unnatural facet in supporting coherent 
                    network mobility. We need a simple and effective, unified route 
                    optimization scheme for network mobility. 
                     
                    With the help of the ROT model, we can evaluate whether or not 
                    there is the feasibility of achieving a unified route optimization 
                    in NEMO, and enumerate the issues that should be cleared for the 
                    purpose of that. As a unified RO model, let us illustrate one 
                    example as Fig.5. In here, TR can be zero. That is only difference 
                    in comparing with Fig.4. However, this trivial difference in the 
                    model implies that this model can support SiROT based RO in the 
                    infrastructure as well as ReROT based NTO. PCH [20] approach 
                    belongs to this model.
