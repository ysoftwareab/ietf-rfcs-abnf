               draft-chen-pce-sr-mpls-sid-verification-03

Abstract

   This document updates [RFC8664] to clarify usage of "SID
   verification" bit signalled in Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP), and this document proposes to define a new flag for
   indicating the headend is explicitly requested to verify SID(s) by
   the PCE.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] describes the "SID
   verification" bit usage.  SID verification is performed when the
   headend is explicitly requested to verify SID(s) by the controller
   via the signaling protocol used.  Implementations MAY provide a local
   configuration option to enable verification on a global or per policy
   or per candidate path basis.

   [RFC8664] specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute
   and initiate Traffic-Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) to request a path subject to certain
   constraints and optimization criteria in SR networks.

   This document updates [RFC8664] to clarify usage of "SID
   verification" bit signalled in Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP), and this document proposes to define a new flag for
   indicating the headend is explicitly requested to verify SID(s) by
   the PCE.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   cloud transport network: It is usually a national or province
   backbone network to achieve interconnection between multiple regional
   clouds/core clouds deployed in the country/province.

3.  SID verification flag(V-Flag)

3.1.  Extended V-Flag in SR-ERO Subobject

   Section 4.3.1 in Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) Extensions for Segment Routing [RFC8664] describes a new ERO
   subobject referred to as the "SR-ERO subobject" to carry a SID and/or
   NAI information.  A new flag is proposed in this doucument in the SR-
   ERO Subobject for indicating the pcc is explicitly requested to
   verify SID(s) by the PCE.

   The format of the SR-ERO subobject as defined in [RFC8664] is:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |L|   Type=TBD  |     Length    |  NT   |     Flags   |V|F|S|C|M|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                         SID (optional)                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       //                   NAI (variable, optional)                  //
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   V: When the V-Flag is set then PCC MUST consider the "SID
   verification" as described in Section 5.1 in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   The other fields in the SR-ERO subobject is the same as that of the
   SR-ERO subobject as defined in [RFC8664].

3.2.  Extended V-Flag in SR-RRO Subobject

   The format of the SR-RRO subobject is the same as that of the SR-ERO
   subobject, but without the L-Flag, per [RFC8664].

   The V flag has no meaning in the SR-RRO and is ignored on receipt at
   the PCE.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  SR-ERO Subobject

   This document defines a new bit value in the sub-registry "SR-ERO
   Flag Field" in the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   registry.
