1.  Introduction

   One of the major shortcomings of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR)
   [RFC3626] is the lack of a granular link cost metric between OLSR
   routers.  Operational experience with OLSR networks gathered since
   its publication has revealed that wireless networks links can have
   highly variable and heterogeneous properties.  This makes a hopcount
   metric insufficient for effective OLSR routing.

   Based on this experience, OLSRv2 [RFC7181] integrates the concept of
   link metrics directly into the core specification of the routing
   protocol.  The OLSRv2 routing metric is an external process, it can
   be any kind of dimensionless additive cost function which reports to
   the OLSRv2 protocol.

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   Since 2004 the OLSR.org [OLSR.org] implementation of OLSR has
   included an Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) metric [MOBICOM04] as
   a proprietary extension.  While this metric is not perfect, it proved
   to be sufficient for a long time for Community Mesh Networks (see
   Appendix B).  But the increasing maximum data rate of IEEE 802.11
   made the ETX metric less efficient than in the past, which is one
   reason to move to a different metric.

   This document describes a Directional Airtime routing metric for
   OLSRv2, a successor of the OLSR.org ETX-derived routing metric for
   OLSR.  It takes both the loss rate and the link speed into account to
   provide a more accurate picture of the links within the network.

   This specification allows OLSRv2 deployments with a metric defined by
   the IETF MANET working group.  It enables easier interoperability
   tests between implementations and targets to deliver a useful
   baseline to compare with, for experiments with this metric as well as
   other metrics.  Appendix A contains a few possible steps to improve
   the Directional Airtime Metric.  Coming experiments should also allow
   to judge if the DAT metric can be useful for other IETF protocol,
   both inside and out of the MANET working group.  This could lead
   either to moving this draft to Standard Track or to replace it with
   an improved document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology introduced in [RFC5444], [RFC7181] and [RFC6130],
   including the terms "packet", "message" and "TLV" are to be
   interpreted as described therein.

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology and
   notational conventions:

   DAT  - Directional Airtime (Metric), the link metric specified in
      this document, which is a directional variant of ETT.  It does not
      take reverse path loss into account.

   QUEUE  - a first in, first out queue of integers.

   QUEUE[TAIL]  - the most recent element in the queue.

   add(QUEUE, value)  - adds a new element to the TAIL of the queue.

   remove(QUEUE)  - removes the HEAD element of the queue

   sum(QUEUE)  - an operation which returns the sum of all elements in a
      QUEUE.

   diff_seqno(new, old)  - an operation which returns the positive
      distance between two elements of the circular sequence number
      space defined in section 5.1 of [RFC5444].  Its value is either
      (new - old) if this result is positive, or else its value is (new
      - old + 65536).

   MAX(a, b)  - the maximum of a and b.

   MIN(a, b)  - the minimum of a and b.

   UNDEFINED  - a value not in the normal value range of a variable.

   airtime  - the time a transmitted packet blocks the link layer, e.g.,
      a wireless link.

   ETX  - Expected Transmission Count, a link metric proportional to the
      number of transmissions to successfully send an IP packet over a
      link.

   ETT  - Estimated Travel Time, a link metric proportional to the
      amount of airtime needed to successfully transmit an IP packet
      over a link, not considering layer-2 overhead created by preamble,
      backoff time and queuing.

3.  Applicability Statement

   The Directional Airtime Metric was designed and tested (see
   [COMNET15]) in wireless IEEE 802.11 OLSRv2 [RFC7181] networks.  These
   networks employ link layer retransmission to increase the delivery
   probability.  A dynamic rate selection algorithm selects the unicast
   data rate independently for each neighbor.

   As specified in OLSRv2, the metric calculates only the incoming link
   cost.  It does neither calculate the outgoing metric, nor does it
   decide the link status (heard, symmetric, lost).

   The metric works both for nodes which can send/receive [RFC5444]
   packet sequence numbers and those which do not have this capability.
   In the absence of such sequence numbers the metric calculates the
   packet loss based on [RFC6130] HELLO message timeouts.

   The metric must learn about the unicast data rate towards each one-
   hop neighbor from an external process, either by configuration or by
   an external measurement process.  This measurement could be done via
   gathering cross-layer data from the operating system, via an external

   daemon like DLEP [DLEP], or via indirect layer-3 measurements like
   packet-pair (see [MOBICOM04]).

   The metric uses [RFC5444] multicast control traffic to determine the
   link packet loss.  The administrator should take care that link layer
   multicast transmission do not have a higher reception probability
   than the slowest unicast transmission without retransmission.  For
   example, with 802.11g, it might be necessary to increase the data-
   rate of the multicast transmissions, e.g. set the multicast data-rate
   to 6 MBit/s.

   The metric can only handle a certain range of packet loss and unicast
   data-rate.  The maximum packet loss that can be encoded into the
   metric is a loss of 7 of 8 packets (87.5%), without link layer
   retransmissions.  The unicast data-rate that can be encoded by this
   metric can be between 1 kBit/s and 2 GBit/s.  This metric has been
   designed for data-rates of 1 MBit/s and hundreds of MBit/s.

4.  Directional Airtime Metric Rationale

   The Directional Airtime Metric has been inspired by the publications
   on the ETX [MOBICOM03] and ETT [MOBICOM04] metric, but differs from
   both of these in several ways.

   Instead of measuring the combined loss probability of a bidirectional
   transmission of a packet over a link in both directions, the
   Directional Airtime Metric measures the incoming loss rate and
   integrates the incoming linkspeed into the metric cost.  There are
   multiple reasons for this decision:

   o  OLSRv2 [RFC7181] defines the link metric as directional costs
      between routers.

   o  Not all link layer implementations use acknowledgement mechanisms.
      Most link layer implementations who do use them use less airtime
      and a more robust modulation for the acknowledgement than the data
      transmission, which makes it more likely for the data transmission
      to be disrupted compared to the acknowledgement.

   o  Incoming packet loss and linkspeed can be measured locally, while
      symmetric link loss would need an additional signaling TLV in the
      [RFC6130] HELLO and would delay metric calculation by up to one
      HELLO interval.

   The Directional Airtime Metric does not integrate the packet size
   into the link cost.  Doing so is not feasible in most link-state
   routing protocol implementations.  The routing decision of most
   operation systems don't take packet size into account.  Multiplying

   all link costs of a topology with the size of a data-plane packet
   would never change the Dijkstra result anyways.

   The queue based packet loss estimator specified in this document has
   been tested extensively in the OLSR.org ETX implementation, see
   Appendix B.  The output is the average of the packet loss over a
   configured time period.

   The metric normally measures the loss of a link by tracking the
   incoming [RFC5444] packet sequence numbers.  Without these packet
   sequence numbers, the metric does calculate the loss of the link
   based of received and lost [RFC5444] HELLO messages.  It uses the
   incoming HELLO interval time (or if not present, the validity time)
   to decide when a HELLO is lost.

   When a neighbor router resets, its packet sequence number might jump
   to a random value.  The metric tries to detect jumps in the packet
   sequence number and removes them from the data set, because the
   already gathered link loss data should still be valid (see
   Section 9.3.  The link loss data is only removed from memory when a
   Link times out completely and its Link Set tuple is removed from the
   database.

5.  Metric Functioning & Overview

   The Directional Airtime Metric is calculated for each link set entry,
   as defined in [RFC6130] section 7.1.

   The metric processes two kinds of data into the metric value, namely
   packet loss rate and link-speed.  The link-speed is taken from an
   external process not defined in this document.  The current packet
   loss rate is defined in this document by keeping track of packet
   reception and packet loss events.  It could also be calculated by an
   external process with a compatible output.

   Multiple incoming packet loss/reception events must be combined into
   a loss rate to get a smooth metric.  Experiments with exponential
   weighted moving average (EWMA) lead to a highly fluctuating or a slow
   converging metric (or both).  To get a smoother and more controllable
   metric result, this metric uses two fixed length queues to measure
   and average the incoming packet events, one queue for received
   packets and one for the estimated number of packets sent by the other
   side of the link.

   Because the rate of incoming packets is not uniform over time, the
   queue contains a number of counters, each representing a fixed time
   interval.  Incoming packet loss and packet reception event are

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   accumulated in the current queue element until a timer adds a new
   empty counter to both queues and remove the oldest counter from both.

   In addition to the packet loss stored in the queue, this metric uses
   a timer to detect a total link-loss.  For every [RFC5444] HELLO
   interval in which the metric received no packet from a neighbor, it
   scales the number of received packets in the queue based on the total
   time interval the queue represents compared to the total time of the
   lost HELLO intervals.

   The average packet loss ratio is calculated as the sum of the 'total
   packets' counters divided by the sum of the 'packets received'
   counters.  This value is then divided through the current link-speed
   and then scaled into the range of metrics allowed for OLSRv2.

   The metric value is then used as L_in_metric of the Link Set (as
   defined in section 8.1. of [RFC7181]).

   While this document does not add new RFC5444 elements to the RFC6130
   HELLO or RFC7181 TC messages, it works best when both the
   INTERVAL_TIME message TLV is present in the HELLO messages and when
   each RFC5444 packet contains an interface specific sequence number.
   It also adds a number of new data entries to be stored for each
   RFC6130 Link.

6.  Protocol Constants

   This specification defines the following constants, which define the
   range of metric values that can be encoded by the DAT metric (see
   Table 1).  They cannot be changed without making the metric outputs
   incomparable and should only be changed for a MANET with very slow or
   very fast link layer.  See Appendix E for example metric values.

   DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS  - Fraction of the loss rate used in this routing
      metric.  Loss rate will be between 0/DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS and
      (DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS-1)/DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS.

   DAT_MINIMUM_BITRATE  - Minimal bit-rate in Bit/s used by this routing
      metric.

7.  Protocol Parameters

   This specification defines the following parameters for this routing
   metric.  These parameters are:

   DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH  - Queue length for averaging packet loss.  All
      received and lost packets within the queue length are used to
      calculate the cost of the link.

   DAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL  - interval in seconds between two metric
      recalculations as described in Section 10.2.  This value SHOULD be
      smaller than a typical HELLO interval.  The interval can be a
      fraction of a second.

   DAT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR  - multiplier relative to the HELLO_INTERVAL
      (see [RFC6130] Section 5.3.1) after which the DAT metric considers
      a HELLO as lost.

   DAT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION  - threshold in number of missing packets
      (based on received packet sequence numbers) at which point the
      router considers the neighbor has restarted.  This parameter is
      only used for packet sequence number based loss estimation.  This
      number MUST be larger than DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS.

7.1.  Recommended Values

   The proposed values of the protocol parameters are for Community Mesh
   Networks, which mostly use routers that are not mobile.  Using this
   metric for mobile networks might require shorter DAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL
   and/or DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH.

   DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH  := 64

   DAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL  := 1

   DAT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR  := 1.2

   DAT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION  := 256

8.  Data Structures

   This specification extends the Link Set of the Interface Information
   Base, as defined in [RFC6130] section 7.1, by the adding the
   following elements to each link tuple:

   L_DAT_received  - a QUEUE with DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH integer elements.
      Each entry contains the number of successfully received packets
      within an interval of DAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   L_DAT_total  - a QUEUE with DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH integer elements.  Each
      entry contains the estimated number of packets transmitted by the
      neighbor, based on the received packet sequence numbers within an
      interval of DAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   L_DAT_packet_time  - the time when the next RFC5444 packet should
      have arrived.

   L_DAT_hello_interval  - the interval between two hello messages of
      the links neighbor as signaled by the INTERVAL_TIME TLV [RFC5497]
      of NHDP messages [RFC6130].

   L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals  - the estimated number of HELLO
      intervals from this neighbor the metric has not received a single
      packet.

   L_DAT_rx_bitrate  - the current bitrate of incoming unicast traffic
      for this neighbor.

   L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno  - the last received packet sequence number
      received from this link.

   Methods to obtain the value of L_DAT_rx_bitrate are out of the scope
   of this specification.  Such methods may include static configuration
   via a configuration file or dynamic measurement through mechanisms
   described in a separate specification (e.g.  [DLEP]).  Any Link tuple
   with L_status = HEARD or L_status = SYMMETRIC MUST have a specified
   value of L_DAT_rx_bitrate if it is to be used by this routing metric.

   The incoming bitrate value should be stabilized by a hysteresis
   filter to improve the stability of this metric.  See Appendix C for
   an example.

   This specification updates the L_in_metric field of the Link Set of
   the Interface Information Base, as defined in section 8.1. of
   [RFC7181])

8.1.  Initial Values

   When generating a new tuple in the Link Set, as defined in [RFC6130]
   section 12.5 bullet 3, the values of the elements specified in
   Section 8 are set as follows:

   o  L_DAT_received := 0, ..., 0.  The queue always has
      DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH elements.

   o  L_DAT_total := 0, ..., 0.  The queue always has DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH
      elements.

   o  L_DAT_packet_time := EXPIRED (no earlier RFC5444 packet received).

   o  L_DAT_hello_interval := UNDEFINED (no earlier NHDP HELLO
      received).

   o  L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals := 0 (no HELLO interval without
      packets).

   o  L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno := UNDEFINED (no earlier RFC5444 packet with
      sequence number received).

9.  Packets and Messages

   This section describes the necessary changes of [RFC7181]
   implementations with DAT metric for the processing and modification
   of incoming and outgoing [RFC5444] data.

9.1.  Definitions

   For the purpose of this section, note the following definitions:

   o  "pkt_seqno" is defined as the [RFC5444] packet sequence number of
      the received packet.

   o  "interval_time" is the time encoded in the INTERVAL_TIME message
      TLV of a received [RFC6130] HELLO message.

   o  "validity_time" is the time encoded in the VALIDITY_TIME message
      TLV of a received [RFC6130] HELLO message.

9.2.  Requirements for using DAT metric in OLSRv2 implementations

   An implementation of OLSRv2 using the metric specified by this
   document SHOULD include the following parts into its [RFC5444]
   output:




Rogge & Baccelli          Expires June 17, 2016                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   o  an INTERVAL_TIME message TLV in each HELLO message, as defined in
      [RFC6130] section 4.3.2.

   o  an interface specific packet sequence number as defined in
      [RFC5444] section 5.1 which is incremented by 1 for each outgoing
      [RFC5444] packet on the interface.

   An implementation of OLSRv2 using the metric specified by this
   document that inserts packet sequence numbers in some, but not all
   outgoing [RFC5444] packets will make this metric ignore all packets
   without the sequence number.  Putting the INTERVAL_TIME TLV into
   some, but not all Hello messages will make the timeout based loss
   detection slower.  This will only matter in the absence of packet
   sequence numbers.

9.3.  Link Loss Data Gathering

   For each incoming [RFC5444] packet, additional processing SHOULD be
   carried out after the packet messages have been processed as
   specified in [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] as specified in this section.

   [RFC5444] packets without packet sequence number MUST NOT be
   processed in the way described in this section.

   The router updates the Link Set Tuple corresponding to the originator
   of the packet:

   1.  If L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno = UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_DAT_received[TAIL] := 1.

       2.  L_DAT_total[TAIL] := 1.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_DAT_received[TAIL] := L_DAT_received[TAIL] + 1.

       2.  diff := diff_seqno(pkt_seqno, L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno).

       3.  If diff > DAT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION, then:

           1.  diff := 1.

       4.  L_DAT_total[TAIL] := L_DAT_total[TAIL] + diff.

   3.  L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno := pkt_seqno.

   4.  If L_DAT_hello_interval != UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_DAT_packet_time := current time + (L_DAT_hello_interval *
           DAT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR).

   5.  L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals := 0.

9.4.  HELLO Message Processing

   For each incoming HELLO Message, after it has been processed as
   defined in [RFC6130] section 12, the Link Set Tuple corresponding to
   the incoming HELLO message MUST be updated.

   1.  If the HELLO message contains an INTERVAL_TIME message TLV, then:

       1.  L_DAT_hello_interval := interval_time.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_DAT_hello_interval := validity_time.

   3.  If L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno = UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_DAT_received[TAIL] := L_DAT_received[TAIL] + 1.

       2.  L_DAT_total[TAIL] := L_DAT_total[TAIL] + 1.

       3.  L_DAT_packet_time := current time + (L_DAT_hello_interval *
           DAT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR).

10.  Timer Event Handling

   In addition to changes in the [RFC5444] processing/generation code,
   the DAT metric also uses two timer events.

10.1.  Packet Timeout Processing

   When L_DAT_packet_time has timed out, the following step MUST be
   done:

   1.  If L_DAT_last_pkt_seqno = UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_DAT_total[TAIL] := L_DAT_total[TAIL] + 1.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals := L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals +
           1.

   3.  L_DAT_packet_time := L_DAT_packet_time + L_DAT_hello_interval.

10.2.  Metric Update

   Once every DAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL, all L_in_metric values in all Link
   Set entries MUST be recalculated:

   1.  sum_received := sum(L_DAT_received).

   2.  sum_total := sum(L_DAT_total).

   3.  If L_DAT_hello_interval != UNDEFINED and
       L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals > 0, then:

       1.  lost_time_proportion := L_DAT_hello_interval *
           L_DAT_lost_packet_intervals / DAT_MEMORY_LENGTH.

       2.  sum_received := sum_received * MAX ( 0, 1 -
           lost_time_proportion);

   4.  If sum_received < 1, then:

       1.  L_in_metric := MAXIMUM_METRIC, as defined in [RFC7181]
           section 5.6.1.

   5.  Otherwise:

       1.  loss := MIN(sum_total / sum_received, DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS).

       2.  bitrate := MAX(L_DAT_rx_bitrate, DAT_MINIMUM_BITRATE).

       3.  L_in_metric := (2^24 / DAT_MAXIMUM_LOSS) * loss / (bitrate /
           DAT_MINIMUM_BITRATE).

   6.  remove(L_DAT_total)

   7.  add(L_DAT_total, 0)

   8.  remove(L_DAT_received)

   9.  add(L_DAT_received, 0)

   The calculated L_in_metric value should be stabilized by a hysteresis
   function.  See Appendix D for an example.

11.  Security Considerations

   Artificial manipulation of metrics values can drastically alter
   network performance.  In particular, advertising a higher L_in_metric




Rogge & Baccelli          Expires June 17, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   value may decrease the amount of incoming traffic, while advertising
   lower L_in_metric may increase the amount of incoming traffic.

   For example, by thus artificially attracting mesh routes and then
   dropping the incoming traffic, an attacker may achieve a Denial of
   Service (DoS) against other mesh nodes.  Similarly, an attacker may
   achieve Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks or traffic analysis by
   concentrating traffic being router over a node the attacker controls
   (and end-to-end encryption is not used or somehow broken).
   Protection mechanisms against such MITM or DoS attacks are
   nevertheless out of scope of this document.

   Security threats also include potential attacks on the integrity of
   the control traffic passively monitored by DAT to measure link
   quality.  For example, an attacker might inject packets pretending to
   be somebody else, and using incorrect sequence numbers.  This attack
   can be prevented by the true originator of the RFC5444 packets by
   adding a [RFC7182] ICV Packet TLV and TIMESTAMP Packet TLV to each
   packet.  This allows the receiver to drop all incoming packets which
   have a forged packet source, both packets generated by the attacker
   or replayed packets.  However, the security mechanism described in
   [RFC7183] does not protect the sequence number used by the DAT metric
   because it does only sign the RFC5444 messages, not the RFC5444
   packet header (which contains the RFC5444 packet sequence number).

Appendix A.  Future work

   As the DAT metric proved to work reasonably well for non- or slow-
   moving ad hoc networks [COMNET15], it should be considered as a solid
   first step on a way to better MANET metrics.  There are multiple
   parts of the DAT metric that need to be reviewed again in the context
   of real world deployments and can be subject to later improvements.

   The easiest part of the DAT metric to change and test would be the
   timings parameters.  A 1 minute interval for packet loss statistics
   might be a good compromise for some MANETs, but could easily be too
   large or to small for others.  More data is needed to verify or
   improve the current parameter selection.

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   The DAT metric considers only the multicast RFC5444 packet loss for
   estimating the link loss, but it would be good to integrate unicast
   data loss into the loss estimation.  This information could be
   provided directly from the link layer.  This could increase the
   accuracy of the loss rate estimation in scenarios, where the
   assumptions regarding the ratio of multicast vs. unicast loss do not
   hold.

   The packet loss averaging algorithm could also be improved.  While
   the DAT metric provides a stable sliding time interval to average the
   incoming packet loss and not giving the recent input too much
   influence, first experiments suggest that the algorithm tends to be
   less agile in detecting major changes of link quality.  This makes it
   less suited for mobile networks.  A more agile algorithm is needed
   for detecting major changes while filtering out random fluctuations
   regarding frame loss.  However, the current "queue of counters"
   algorithm suggested for DAT outperforms the binary queue algorithm
   and the exponential aging algorithms used for the ETX metric in the
   OLSR [RFC3626] codebase of Olsr.org.

Appendix B.  OLSR.org metric history

   The Funkfeuer [FUNKFEUER] and Freifunk networks [FREIFUNK] are OLSR-
   based [RFC3626] or B.A.T.M.A.N.  [BATMAN] based wireless community
   networks with hundreds of routers in permanent operation.  The Vienna
   Funkfeuer network in Austria, for instance, consists of 400 routers
   covering the whole city of Vienna and beyond, spanning roughly 40km
   in diameter.  It has been in operation since 2003 and supplies its
   users with Internet access.  A particularity of the Vienna Funkfeuer
   network is that it manages to provide Internet access through a city
   wide, large scale Wi-Fi MANET, with just a single Internet uplink.

   Operational experience of the OLSR project [OLSR.org] with these
   networks have revealed that the use of hop-count as routing metric
   leads to unsatisfactory network performance.  Experiments with the
   ETX metric [MOBICOM03] were therefore undertaken in parallel in the
   Berlin Freifunk network as well as in the Vienna Funkfeuer network in
   2004, and found satisfactory, i.e., sufficiently easy to implement
   and providing sufficiently good performance.  This metric has now
   been in operational use in these networks for several years.

   The ETX metric of a link is the estimated number of transmissions
   required to successfully send a packet (each packet equal to or
   smaller than MTU) over that link, until a link layer acknowledgement
   is received.  The ETX metric is additive, i.e., the ETX metric of a
   path is the sum of the ETX metrics for each link on this path.





Rogge & Baccelli          Expires June 17, 2016                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   While the ETX metric delivers a reasonable performance, it doesn't
   handle well networks with heterogeneous links that have different
   bitrates.  When using ETX metric, since every wireless link is
   characterized only by its packet loss ratio, long-ranged links with
   low bitrate (with low loss ratios) are preferred over short-ranged
   links with high bitrate (with higher but reasonable loss ratios).
   Such conditions, when they occur, can degrade the performance of a
   network considerably, by not taking advantage of higher capacity
   links.

   Because of this the OLSR.org project has implemented the Directional
   Airtime Metric for OLSRv2, which has been inspired by the Estimated
   Travel Time (ETT) metric [MOBICOM04].  This metric uses an
   unidirectional packet loss, but also takes the bitrate into account
   to create a more accurate description of the relative costs or
   capabilities of OLSRv2 links.

Appendix C.  Linkspeed stabilization

   The DAT metric specifies how to generate a reasonably stable packet
   loss rate value based on incoming packet reception/loss events, but
   the source of the linkspeed used in this document is considered an
   external process.

   In the presence of a layer-2 technology with variable linkspeed it is
   likely that the raw linkspeed will be fluctuating too fast to be
   useful for the DAT metric.

   The amount of stabilization necessary for the linkspeed depends on
   the implementation of the mac-layer, especially the rate control
   algorithm.

   Experiments with the Linux 802.11 wifi stack have shown that a simple
   Median filter over a series of raw linkspeed measurements can smooth
   the calculated value without introducing intermediate linkspeed
   values one would obtain by using averaging or an exponential weighted
   moving average.

Appendix D.  Packet loss hysteresis

   While the DAT metric uses a sliding window to compute a reasonably
   stable frame loss, the implementation might choose to integrate an
   additional hysteresis to prevent undesirable oscillations between two
   values (i.e. metric flapping).

   In Section Section 10.2 DAT calculates a fractional loss rate.  The
   fraction of 'loss := sum_total / sum_received' may result in minor
   fluctuations in the advertised L_in_metric due to minimal changes in



Rogge & Baccelli          Expires June 17, 2016                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft    Directional airtime metric for OLSRv2    December 2015


   sum_total or sum_received, which can cause undesirable protocol
   churn.

   A hysteresis function applied to the fraction could reduce the amount
   of changes in the loss rate and help to further stabilize the metric
   output.

Appendix E.  Example DAT values

   The DAT metric value can be expressed in terms of link speed (bit/s)
   or used airtime (s).  When using the default protocol constants (see
   Section 6), DAT encodes link speeds between 119 bit/s and 2 Gbit/s.

   Table Table 2 contains a few examples for metric values and their
   meaning as a link speed:

                 +---------------------------+-----------+
                 |           Metric          |   bit/s   |
                 +---------------------------+-----------+
                 |     MINIMUM_METRIC (1)    |  2 Gbit/s |
                 |                           |           |
                 | MAXIMUM_METRIC (16776960) | 119 bit/s |
                 |                           |           |
                 |            2000           |  1 Mbit/s |
                 +---------------------------+-----------+

                      Table 2: DAT link cost examples

   A path metric value could also be expressed as a link speed, but this
   would be less intuitive.  An easier way to transform a path metric
   value into a textual representation is to divide it by the hopcount
   of the path and express the path cost as average link speed together
   with the hopcount (see Table 3).

                    +---------+------+---------------+
                    |  Metric | hops | average bit/s |
                    +---------+------+---------------+
                    |    4    |  2   |    1 Gbit/s   |
                    |         |      |               |
                    | 4000000 |  6   |    3 kbit/s   |
                    +---------+------+---------------+
