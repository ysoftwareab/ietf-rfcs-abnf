1.  Introduction

   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and earlier support renegotiation, a mechanism for
   changing parameters and keys partway through a connection.  This was
   sometimes used to implement reactive client authentication in
   HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230], where the server decides whether to request a
   client certificate based on the HTTP request.

   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] multiplexes multiple HTTP requests over a single
   connection, which is incompatible with the mechanism above.  Clients
   cannot correlate the certificate request with the HTTP request which
   triggered it.  Thus, section 9.2.1 of [RFC7540] forbids
   renegotiation.

   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] updates TLS 1.2 to remove renegotiation in favor of
   separate post-handshake authentication and key update mechanisms.
   The former shares the same problems with multiplexed protocols, but
   the prohibition in HTTP/2 only applies to TLS 1.2 renegotiation.

Internet-Draft          Using TLS 1.3 with HTTP/2         September 2019


   This document updates HTTP/2 to similarly forbid TLS 1.3 post-
   handshake authentication.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Post-Handshake Authentication in HTTP/2

   HTTP/2 servers MUST NOT send post-handshake TLS 1.3
   CertificateRequest messages.  HTTP/2 clients MUST treat TLS 1.3 post-
   handshake authentication as a connection error (see section 5.4.1 of
   [RFC7540]) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   [RFC7540] permitted renegotiation before the HTTP/2 connection
   preface to provide confidentiality of the client certificate.  TLS
   1.3 encrypts the client certificate in the initial handshake, so this
   is no longer necessary.  HTTP/2 servers MUST NOT send post-handshake
   TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest messages before the connection preface.

   The above applies even if the client offered the
   "post_handshake_auth" TLS extension.  This extension is advertised
   independently of the selected ALPN protocol [RFC7301], so it is not
   sufficient to resolve the conflict with HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 clients that
   also offer other ALPN protocols, notably HTTP/1.1, in a TLS
   ClientHello MAY include the "post_handshake_auth" extension to
   support those other protocols.  This does not indicate support in
   HTTP/2.

4.  Other Post-Handshake TLS Messages in HTTP/2

   [RFC8446] defines two other messages that are exchanged after the
   handshake is complete, KeyUpdate and NewSessionTicket.

   KeyUpdate messages only affect TLS itself and do not require any
   interaction with the application protocol.  HTTP/2 implementations
   MUST support key updates when TLS 1.3 is negotiated.

   NewSessionTicket messages are also permitted.  Though these interact
   with HTTP when early data is enabled, these interactions are defined
   in [RFC8470] and allowed for in the design of HTTP/2.

   Unless the use of a new type of TLS message depends on an interaction
   with the application layer protocol, that TLS message can be sent
   after the handshake completes.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document resolves a compatibility concern between HTTP/2 and TLS
   1.3 when supporting post-handshake authentication with HTTP/1.1.
   This lowers the barrier for deploying TLS 1.3, a major security
   improvement over TLS 1.2.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
