1.  Introduction and Motivations

  This document addresses the fast handover for MIPv6 (FMIPv6). One of 
  the main issues on FMIPv6 is to reduce the time required for 
  configuration of the router in the new access IP network, which is 
  related to a general processing delay for the RS/RA messages, as 
  described in [NDP]. 

  Several approaches have been proposed for fast router discovery so 
  far. However, most of those mechanisms are assumed to be some extra 
  functions on the access routers (ARs) or access points (APs). 

  This document describes a new entity "Fast Handover Agent (FHA)", 
  which can be used for fast router discovery and configuration in 
  FMIPv6. The FHA is deployed to provide the fast RA for Mobile Nodes 
  entering a new IP network. It is expected that the FHAs are usually 
  established between mobile nodes and ARs, such as AP (for 802.11) or 
  Base Stations (for 3GPPs), for the purpose of fast processing of RS/RA 
  messages.

  It is noted that the FHA does not require any modification of existing 
  FMIPv6 procedures and systems. Accordingly, the network operators 
  might deploy the FHAs by their own policies and associated 
  environments. 

  
2. Fast Handover Agent (FHA)

  For fast router discovery and fast handover, an FHA provides the 
  following functions:
  
      o It must be able to receive and process the RS messages from 
        mobile node. When a mobile node joins a new link by sending RS
        messages over "all router multicast address", the FHA receives 
        the RS messages on behalf of the AR located in the network, and
        will respond with the corresponding RA message immediately
        to the mobile node.

      o	It must be able to obtain the subnet-specific information such 
        as prefix, router lifetime, address lifetime, etc) from the 
        upper AR.
  	
      o	It should be able to recognize L2 triggers defined in [OPHO].
        (See section 3)
  	
  	
3. How to use the FHA for fast router discovery

  This section discribes the operations of FHA-based router discovery 
  over 802.11 networks.

  In 802.11, if the FHA is attached to the nearby AP, then it provides 
  the fast handover for mobile nodes over in its own link.
  
  The FHA should be stayed in the same link as access point and router.
  In other words, the FHA must receive the RS message sent by mobile
  nodes over "all router multicast address."
  
  Figure 1 illustrates the possible deplolyment of the FHA over 802.11,
  where many APs are connected to a AR. The network operator can make 
  use of FHA for each different AP, or can compose one FHA at its oveall
  acess network. In either case, those APs will be connected to a AR.
  
  
         [AR]                   [AR]                      [AR]
           |                      |                         |
           |                      |---[FHA]                 |
           |                     / \                       / \
           |---[FHA]            /   \             [FHA]---/   \---[FHA]
         [AP]                [AP]   [AP]                [AP] [AP]
  
  
                      < Figure 1 : FHA topologies >
  
  
  	AP : Access Point
  	AR : Access Router
  
  
  
  As described in [OPHO], when a mobile node is approaching AP, it 
  determines that a new AP is available because it detects a beacon from
  the new AP. The mobile node sends management frame called 
  "Reassociation.request" because the bit error rate on the link with 
  the old AP has become too high.

  For the fast composition of a Care-of Address, when the FHA receives
  the Reassociation.request, it should send "Reassociation.reply" and 
  the RA message simultaneously to the mobile node.
  

  	[MN]					[AP]		[AR]
  	
  		<---------------------------beacon
  		Reassociation.request------------>
  		<--------------Reassociation.reply
  					 Link Up trigger---------->
  					    
  	Link Up trigger
  		RS message---------------------------------------->
  		<----------------------------------------RA message
  		
  	establishing new care-of address
  	
  	         
  	        < Figure 2 : Original L2 trigger procedure >

4. Further Discussion

  The other exsiting proposals for fast router discovery are assumed
  to be some extra functions on access router or access point. In the
  proposed scheme, the FHA don't need any extra functions on existing
  systems such as mobile node, access point and access router.

  In 3GPP, the FHA may be attached to the Base Stations for fast 
  handover. For examples, in the 3GPP GPRS/UMTS cases, the FHA can be 
  attached to RNC (Radio Network Controller) or SGSN(Serving GPRS 
  Supporting Node). Similarly, in the cdma2000 case, the FHA can be 
  attached to BSC(Base Station Controller) which performs a PCF(Packet
  Control Function). At this situation, the specific procedures for 
  sending of unsolicited RA message may be different from those for 
  the WLAN cases, according to the call flow or authentication policy
  used by each 3G system. The detailed issues are for further discussion.
 

5. Security considerations

  All information contained in FHA should be delegated from the upper 
  router or similar equipment. If the malicious information are sent to
  FHA, it may update these informatons into its data. 
  After all, all mobile nodes can't get correct information.

  As RS/RA message is described in [NDP], a host can check validity
  of message. If RS/RA message includes an IP Authentication Header, 
  the message authenticates correctly. In addtion, this solution is 
  going to be considered in SEND working group for secure messages.
