Abstract

   This document describes using Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs)
   as a self-asserting and thereby trustable Identifier for use as the
   UAS Remote ID.  HHITs include explicit hierarchy to provide
   registration discovery for 3rd-party ID assertion.  Further, HHITs
   can also be used elsewhere in the UTM architecture to facilitate UAS
   communications.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of Hierarchical HITs (HHITs)
   [hierarchical-hit] as self-asserting and thereby a trustable
   Identifier for use as the UAS Remote ID.  HHITs include explicit
   hierarchy to provide registration discovery for 3rd-party ID
   assertion.

   The Drip Requirements [drip-requirements] describe a UAS ID as a
   "unique (ID-4), non-spoofable (ID-5), and identify a registry where
   the ID is listed (ID-2)"; all within a 20 character Identifier (ID-
   1).

   HITs are statistically unique through the cryptograhic hash feature
   of second-preimage resistance.  The addition of the Hierarchy and
   HHIT Registries [hhit-registries] provide complete, global HHIT
   uniqueness.  This is in contrast to general IDs (e.g. a UUID or
   device serial number) as the subject in an X.509 certificate.  All
   CAs within a PKI would have to check each other for duplicate
   (possibly fraudulent) IDs to approach this assurance of uniqueness.

   Hierarchical HITs are valid, though non-routable, IPv6 addresses.  As
   such, they fit in many ways within various IETF technologies.

3.  Hierarchical HITs as Remote ID

   Hierarchical HITs are a refinement on the Host Identity Tag (HIT) of
   HIPv2 [RFC7401].  HHITs require a new ORCHID mechanism as described
   in [new-orchid].  HHITs for UAS ID also use the new EdDSA/SHAKE128
   HIT suite defined in [new-hip-crypto] (requirements GEN-2).  This
   hierarchy, cryptographically embedded within the HHIT, provides the
   information for finding the UA's HHIT registry (ID-3).

   The current ASTM [F3411-19] supports three types of UAS IDs, namely
   the [CTA2063A] serial number, CAA registration ID and UTM-provided
   UUID session ID.  For HHITs to be used effectively as UAS IDs,
   F3411-19 SHOULD add HHIT as the fourth UAS ID type.

3.1.  Hierarchical HIT Registry

   HHITs are registered to Hierarchical HIT Domain Authorities (HDAs) as
   described in [hhit-registries].  This registration process ensures
   UAS ID global uniqueness (ID-4).  It also provides the mechanism to
   create UAS Public/Private data associated with the HHIT UAS ID (GEN-4
   and GEN-5).

   The 2 levels of hierarchy within the HHIT allows for CAAs to have
   their own Registered Assigning Authority (RAA) for their National Air
   Space (NAS).  Within the RAA, the CAAs can delegate HDAs as needed.
   There may be other RAAs allowed to operate within a given NAS; this
   is a policy decision by the CAA.

3.2.  Remote ID Authentication using HHITs

   The EdDSA25519 Host Identity (HI) underlying the HHIT is used for the
   Message Wrapper, Sec 4.1 [drip-auth] (requirements GEN-2).  It and
   the HDA's HI/HHIT are used for the Offline Claim, sec 4.3 [drip-auth]
   (requirements GEN-3).  These messages also establish that the UA owns
   the HHIT and that no other UA can assert ownership of the HHIT (GEN-
   1).

   The number of HDAs authorized to register UAs within an NAS
   determines the size of the HDA credential cache a device processing
   the Offline Authentication.  This cache contains the HDA's HI/HHIT
   and HDA meta-data; it could be very small.

4.  UAS ID HHIT in DNS

   There are 2 approaches for storing and retrieving the HHIT from DNS.
   These are:

   *  As FQDNs in the .aero TLD.



Moskowitz, et al.        Expires 29 October 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                UAS Remote ID                   April 2020


   *  Reverse DNS lookups as IPv6 addresses per [RFC8005].

   The HHIT can be used to construct an FQDN that points to the USS that
   has the Public/Private information for the UA (GEN-4 and GEN-5).  For
   example the USS for the HHIT could be found via the following.
   Assume that the RAA is 100 and the HDA is 50.  The PTR record is
   constructed as:

       50.100.hhit.uas.areo   IN PTR      foo.uss.areo.

   The individual HHITs are potentially too numerous to actually store
   in DNS.  Rather the USS would provide the HHIT detail response.

   The HHIT reverse lookup can be a standard IPv6 reverse look up, or it
   can leverage off the HHIT structure.  Assume that the RAA is 10 and
   the HDA is 20 and the HHIT is:

       2001:14:28:14:a3ad:1952:ad0:a69e

   An HHIT reverse lookup would be to is:

       2001:14:28:14:a3ad:1952:ad0:a69e.20.10.hhit.arpa.

5.  Other UTM uses of HHITs

   HHITs can be used extensively within the UTM architecture beyond for
   UA ID (and USS in UA ID registration and authentication).  The GCS
   SHOULD have its own HHIT as an ID.  It could use this if it is the
   source of Network Remote ID for securing the transport and for secure
   C2 transport [drip-secure-nrid-c2].

   Observers SHOULD have HHITs to facilitate UAS information retrieval
   (e.g. for authorization to private UAS data).  They could also use
   their HHIT for establishing a HIP connection with the UA Pilot for
   direct communications per authorization.  Further, they can be used
   by FINDER observers, [crowd-sourced-rid].

6.  DRIP Requirements addressed

   This document provides solutions to GEN 1 - 6 and ID 1 - 5.

7.  ASTM Considerations

   ASTM will need to make the following changes to the "UA ID" in the
   Basic Message:

   Type 4:
      This document UA ID of Hierarchical HITs (see Section 3).

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations with Hierarchical HITs, most notably the
   short hash of the HI, are discussed in [hierarchical-hit].  The
   binding of the hierarchy to the hash of the HI is covered in
   [new-orchid].

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) provide a unique
   assurance of uniqueness.  This is two-fold.  The address (in this
   case the UAS ID) is a hash of a public key and a Registry hierarchy
   naming.  Collision resistance (more important that its implied
   second-preimage resistance) makes it statistically challenging to
   attacks.  A registration process as in HHIT Registries
   [hhit-registries] provides a level of assured uniqueness unattainable
   without mirroring this approach.

   The second aspect of assured uniqueness is the digital signing
   process of the HHIT by the HI private key and the further signing of
   the HI public key by the Registry's key.  This completes the
   ownership process.  The observer at this point does not know WHAT
   owns the HHIT, but is assured, other than the risk of theft of the HI
   private key, that this UAS ID is owned by something and is properly
   registered.

9.1.  Hierarchical HIT Trust

   The HHIT UAS RID in the ASTM Basic Message (the actual Remote ID
   message) does not provide any assertions of trust.  The best that
   might be done is 4 bytes truncated from a HI signing of the HHIT (the
   UA ID field is 20 bytes and a HHIT is 16).  It is in the ASTM
   Authentication Messages as defined in [drip-auth] that provide all of
   the actual ownership proofs.  These claims include timestamps to
   defend against replay attacks.  But in themselves, they do not prove
   which UA actually sent the message.  They could have been sent by a
   dog running down the street with a Broadcast Remote ID device
   strapped to its back.

   Proof of UA transmission comes when the Authentication Message
   includes proofs for the Location/Vector Message and the observer can
   see the UA or that information is validated by ground multilateration
   [crowd-sourced-rid].  Only then does an observer gain full trust in
   the HHIT Remote ID.

   HHIT Remote IDs obtained via the Network Remote ID path provides a
   different approach to trust.  Here the UAS SHOULD be securely
   communicating to the USS (see [drip-secure-nrid-c2]), thus asserting
   HHIT RID trust.
