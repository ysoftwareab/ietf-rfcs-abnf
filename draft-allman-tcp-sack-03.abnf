    (2) Set a ``RecoveryPoint'' variable to HighData.  When the TCP
        sender receives a cumulative ACK for this data octet the loss
        recovery phase is terminated.

    (3) The congestion window (cwnd) is reduced to half its current
        value.  The value of the slow start threshold (ssthresh) is set
        to the halved value of cwnd.

    (4) Retransmit the first data segment not covered by HighACK.  Use
        the MarkRetran () function to mark the sequence number range as
        having been retransmitted in the scoreboard.  In order to take
