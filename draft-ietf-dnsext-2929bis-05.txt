INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


1. Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides replicated distributed secure
   hierarchical databases which store "resource records" (RRs) under
   domain names.  DNS data is structured into CLASSes and zones which
   can be independently maintained.  See [RFC1034], [RFC1035],
   [RFC2136], [RFC2181], and [RFC4033] familiarity with which is
   assumed.

   This document provides, either directly or by reference, the general
   IANA parameter assignment considerations applying across DNS query
   and response headers and all RRs.  There may be additional IANA
   considerations that apply to only a particular RRTYPE or
   query/response opcode.  See the specific RFC defining that RRTYPE or
   query/response opcode for such considerations if they have been
   defined, except for AFSDB RR considerations [RFC1183] which are
   included herein. This RFC obsoletes [RFC2929].

   IANA currently maintains a web page of DNS parameters. See
   <http://www.iana.org/numbers.htm>.

   "IETF Standards Action", "IETF Consensus", "Specification Required",
   and "Private Use" are as defined in [RFC2434].



2. DNS Query/Response Headers

   The header for DNS queries and responses contains field/bits in the
   following diagram taken from [RFC2136] and [RFC2929]:

                                              1  1  1  1  1  1
                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
               |                      ID                       |
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
               |QR|   Opcode  |AA|TC|RD|RA| Z|AD|CD|   RCODE   |
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
               |                QDCOUNT/ZOCOUNT                |
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
               |                ANCOUNT/PRCOUNT                |
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
               |                NSCOUNT/UPCOUNT                |
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
               |                    ARCOUNT                    |
               +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The ID field identifies the query and is echoed in the response so
   they can be matched.

INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


   The QR bit indicates whether the header is for a query or a response.

   The AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, and CD bits are each theoretically meaningful
   only in queries or only in responses, depending on the bit.  However,
   some DNS implementations copy the query header as the initial value
   of the response header without clearing bits.  Thus any attempt to
   use a "query" bit with a different meaning in a response or to define
   a query meaning for a "response" bit is dangerous given existing
   implementation.  Such meanings may only be assigned by an IETF
   Standards Action.

   The unsigned integer fields query count (QDCOUNT), answer count
   (ANCOUNT), authority count (NSCOUNT), and additional information
   count (ARCOUNT) express the number of records in each section for all
   opcodes except Update [RFC2136].  These fields have the same
   structure and data type for Update but are instead the counts for the
   zone (ZOCOUNT), prerequisite (PRCOUNT), update (UPCOUNT), and
   additional information (ARCOUNT) sections.



2.1 One Spare Bit?

   There have been ancient DNS implementations for which the Z bit being
   on in a query meant that only a response from the primary server for
   a zone is acceptable.  It is believed that current DNS
   implementations ignore this bit.

   Assigning a meaning to the Z bit requires an IETF Standards Action.



2.2 Opcode Assignment

   Currently DNS OpCodes are assigned as follows:

          OpCode Name                      Reference

           0     Query                     [RFC1035]
           1     IQuery  (Inverse Query, Obsolete) [RFC3425]
           2     Status                    [RFC1035]
           3     available for assignment
           4     Notify                    [RFC1996]
           5     Update                    [RFC2136]
          6-15   available for assignment

   New OpCode assignments require an IETF Standards Action as modified
   by [RFC4020].

INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


2.3 RCODE Assignment

   It would appear from the DNS header above that only four bits of
   RCODE, or response/error code are available.  However, RCODEs can
   appear not only at the top level of a DNS response but also inside
   OPT RRs [RFC2671], TSIG RRs [RFC2845], and TKEY RRs [RFC2930].  The
   OPT RR provides an eight bit extension resulting in a 12 bit RCODE
   field and the TSIG and TKEY RRs have a 16 bit RCODE field.

   Error codes appearing in the DNS header and in these three RR types
   all refer to the same error code space with the single exception of
   error code 16 which has a different meaning in the OPT RR from its
   meaning in other contexts.  See table below.

        RCODE   Name    Description                        Reference
        Decimal
          Hexadecimal

        65,535
          0xFFFF            Reserved, can only be allocated by an IETF
                            Standards Action.

INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


   Since it is important that RCODEs be understood for interoperability,
   assignment of new RCODE listed above as "available for assignment"
   requires an IETF Consensus.



3. DNS Resource Records

   All RRs have the same top level format shown in the figure below
   taken from [RFC1035].

                                       1  1  1  1  1  1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5

       /                      NAME                     /
       /                                               /
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                      TYPE                     |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                     CLASS                     |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                      TTL                      |
       |                                               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                   RDLENGTH                    |

       /                     RDATA                     /

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   NAME is an owner name, i.e., the name of the node to which this
   resource record pertains.  NAMEs are specific to a CLASS as described
   in section 3.2.  NAMEs consist of an ordered sequence of one or more
   labels each of which has a label type [RFC1035], [RFC2671].

   TYPE is a two octet unsigned integer containing one of the RRTYPE
   codes.  See section 3.1.

   CLASS is a two octet unsigned integer containing one of the RR CLASS
   codes.  See section 3.2.

   TTL is a four octet (32 bit) unsigned integer that specifies, for
   data TYPEs, the number of seconds that the resource record may be
   cached before the source of the information should again be
   consulted.  Zero is interpreted to mean that the RR can only be used
   for the transaction in progress.

   RDLENGTH is an unsigned 16 bit integer that specifies the length in

INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


   octets of the RDATA field.

   RDATA is a variable length string of octets that constitutes the
   resource. The format of this information varies according to the TYPE
   and in some cases the CLASS of the resource record.



3.1 RRTYPE IANA Considerations

   There are three subcategories of RRTYPE numbers: data TYPEs, QTYPEs,
   and Meta-TYPEs.

   Data TYPEs are the means of storing data.  QTYPES can only be used in
   queries.  Meta-TYPEs designate transient data associated with a
   particular DNS message and in some cases can also be used in queries.
   Thus far, data TYPEs have been assigned from 1 upwards plus the block
   from 100 through 103 and from 32,768 upward, while Q and Meta-TYPEs
   have been assigned from 255 downwards except for the OPT Meta-RR
   which is assigned TYPE 41.  There have been DNS implementations which
   made caching decisions based on the top bit of the bottom byte of the
   RRTYPE.

   There are currently three Meta-TYPEs assigned: OPT [RFC2671], TSIG
   [RFC2845], and TKEY [RFC2930]. There are currently five QTYPEs
   assigned: * (ALL), MAILA, MAILB, AXFR, and IXFR.

   RRTYPEs have mnemonics which must be completely disjoint from the
   mnemonics used for CLASSes and which must match the following regular
   expression:

         [A-Z][A-Z0-9-]*

   Considerations for the allocation of new RRTYPEs are as follows:

     Decimal
   Hexadecimal

     0
   0x0000 - RRTYPE zero is used as a special indicator for the SIG RR
          [RFC2931], [RFC4034] and in other circumstances and must never
          be allocated for ordinary use.

     1 - 127
   0x0001 - 0x007F - remaining RRTYPEs in this range are assigned for
          data TYPEs by the DNS RRTYPE Allocation Policy as specified in
          section 3.1.1.

INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


     128 - 255
   0x0080 - 0x00FF - remaining RRTYPEs in this rage are assigned for Q
          and Meta TYPEs by the DNS RRTYPE Allocation Policy as
          specified in section 3.1.1.

     256 - 61,439
   0x0100 - 0xEFFF - assigned for data RRTYPEs by the DNS RRTYPE
          Allocation Policy as specified in section 3.1.1.

     61,440 - 65,279
   0xF000 - 0xFEFF - reserved for future use. IETF Consensus required to
          define use.

     65,280 - 65,534
   0xFF00 - 0xFFFE - Private Use.

     65,535
   0xFFFF - Reserved, can only be assigned by an IETF Standards Action.



3.1.1 DNS RRTYPE Allocation Policy

   Parameter values specified in Section 3.1 above as assigned based on
   DNS RRTYPE Allocation Policy are allocated by Expert Review if they
   meet the two requirements listed below. There will be a pool of a
   small number of Experts appointed by the IESG. Each application will
   be ruled on by an Expert selected by IANA. In any case where the
   selected Expert is unavailable or states they have a conflict of
   interest, IANA may selected another Expert from the pool.

   Some guidelines for the Experts are given in Section 3.1.2. RRTYPEs
   that do not meet the requirements below, may nonetheless be allocated
   by IETF Standards Action as modified by [RFC4020].

   1. A complete template as specified in Annex A has been posted for
      three weeks to the namedroppers@ops.ietf.org mailing list before
      the Expert Review decision.
         Note that partially completed or draft templates may be posted
      directly by the applicant for comment and discussion but the
      formal posting to start the three week period is made by IANA.

   2. The RR for which a RRTYPE code is being requested is either (a) a
      data TYPE which can be handled as an Unknown RR as described in
      [RFC3597] or (b) a Meta-Type who processing is optional, i.e.,
      which it is safe to simply discard.
         Note that such RRs may include additional section processing
      provided such processing is optional.

   IANA shall maintain a public archive of approved templates.

INTERNET-DRAFT           DNS IANA Considerations               July 2007


3.1.2 DNS RRTYPE Expert Guidelines

   The selected DNS RRTYPE Expert is required to monitor discussion of
   the proposed RRTYPE which may occur on the namedroppers mailing list
   and may consult with other technical experts as necessary. The Expert
   should normally reject any RRTYPE allocation request which meets one
   or more of the following criterion:

   1. Was documented in a manner that was not sufficiently clear to
      evaluate or implement.

   2. Proposed RRTYPE or RRTYPEs affect DNS processing and do not meet
      the criteria in point 2 in Section 3.1.1 above.

   3. The documentation of the proposed RRTYPE or RRTYPEs is incomplete.
      (Additional documentation can be provided during the public
      comment period or by the Expert.)

   4. Application use as documented makes incorrect assumptions about
      DNS protocol behavior, such as wild cards, CNAME, DNAME etc.

   5. An excessive number of RRTYPE values is being requested when the
      purpose could be met with a smaller number or with Private Use
      values.



3.1.3 Special Note on the OPT RR

   The OPT (OPTion) RR, RRTYPE 41, and its IANA Considerations are
   specified in [RFC2671].  Its primary purpose is to extend the
   effective field size of various DNS fields including RCODE, label
   type, OpCode, flag bits, and RDATA size.  In particular, for
   resolvers and servers that recognize it, it extends the RCODE field
   from 4 to 12 bits.



3.1.4 The AFSDB RR Subtype Field

   The AFSDB RR [RFC1183] is a CLASS insensitive RR that has the same
   RDATA field structure as the MX RR but the 16 bit unsigned integer
   field at the beginning of the RDATA is interpreted as a subtype as
   follows:

     Decimal
   Hexadecimal

     0
   0x0000 -  Reserved, allocation requires IETF Standards Action.

3.2 RR CLASS IANA Considerations

   There are currently two subcategories of DNS CLASSes: normal, data
   containing classes and QCLASSes that are only meaningful in queries
   or updates.

   DNS CLASSes have been little used but constitute another dimension of
   the DNS distributed database.  In particular, there is no necessary
   relationship between the name space or root servers for one data
   CLASS and those for another data CLASS.  The same DNS NAME can have
   completely different meanings in different CLASSes. The label types
   are the same and the null label is usable only as root in every
   CLASS.  As global networking and DNS have evolved, the IN, or
   Internet, CLASS has dominated DNS use.

   As yet there has not be a requirement for "meta-CLASSes". That would
   be a CLASS to designate transient data associated with a particular
   DNS message and which might be usable in queries.  However, it is
   possible that their might be a future requirement for one or more
   "meta-CLASSes".

   CLASSes have mnemonics which must be completely disjoint from the
   mnemonics used for RRTYPEs and which must match the following regular
   expression:

         [A-Z][A-Z0-9-]*

   The current CLASS assignments and considerations for future
   assignments are as follows:

3.3 Label Considerations

   DNS NAMEs are sequences of labels [RFC1035].



3.3.1 Label Types

   At the present time, there are two categories of label types, data
   labels and compression labels.  Compression labels are pointers to
   data labels elsewhere within an RR or DNS message and are intended to
   shorten the wire encoding of NAMEs.

   The two existing data label types are sometimes referred to as Text
   and Binary.  Text labels can, in fact, include any octet value
   including zero value octets but many current uses involve only [US-
   ASCII].  For retrieval, Text labels are defined to treat ASCII upper
   and lower case letter codes as matching [RFC4343].  Binary labels are
   bit sequences [RFC2673]. The Binary label type is Experimental
   [RFC3363].

   IANA considerations for label types are given in [RFC2671].



3.3.2 Label Contents and Use

   The last label in each NAME is "ROOT" which is the zero length label.
   By definition, the null or ROOT label can not be used for any other
   NAME purpose.

   NAMEs are local to a CLASS.  The Hesiod [Dyer1987] and Chaos
   [Moon1981] CLASSes are for essentially local use.  The IN or Internet
   CLASS is thus the only DNS CLASS in global use on the Internet at
   this time.

   A somewhat out-of-date description of name allocation in the IN Class
   is given in [RFC1591].  Some information on reserved top level domain
   names is in BCP 32 [RFC2606].



4. Security Considerations

   This document addresses IANA considerations in the allocation of
   general DNS parameters, not security.  See [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035] for secure DNS considerations.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document consists entirely of DNS IANA Considerations and
   includes the following changes from its predecessor [RFC2929].  It
   affects the registry currently at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters and its subregistries.

   1. In the Domain Name System "Resource record (RR) TYPES and QTYPEs"
      registry, it changes most "IETF Consensus" and all "Specification
      Required" allocation policies for RRTYPEs to be "DNS TYPE
      Allocation Policy" and changes the policy for RRTYPE 0xFFFF to be
      "IETF Standards Action".  It also specifies the "DNS TYPE
      Allocation Policy" which is based on Expert Review with additional
      provisions and restrictions, including the sending of a completed
      copy of the template in Annex A to <iana@iana.org>, in most cases,
      and requires "IETF Standards Action as modified by [RFC4020]" in
      other cases.  IANA shall establish a process for accepting such
      templates, posting them to the namedroppers@ops.ietf.org mailing
      list, selecting one of such Experts as have been appointed to
      review such template form applications, and archive and make
      available all approved RRTYPE allocation templates.  See Section
      3.1 and Annex A for more details.

   2. For Opcodes (see Section 2.2), it changes "IETF Standards Action"
      allocation requirements to add "as modified by [RFC4020]".

   3. It changes the allocation status of RCODE 0xFFFF to be IETF
      Standards Action required. See Section 2.3.

   4. It adds an IANA allocation policy for the AFSDB RR Subtype field
      which requires the creation of a new registry. See Section 3.1.4.

   5. It splits Specification Required CLASSes into data CLASSes and
      query or meta CLASSes. See Section 3.2.

Annex A: RRTYPE Allocation Template


                 DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER ALLOCATION TEMPLATE

   This template is to be submitted to IANA for processing by emailing
   the template to <TDB>@iana.org.


   A.    Submission Date:


   B.    Contact Information for submitter:
               Name:
               Email Address:
               International telephone number:
               Other contact handles:


   C.    Motivation for the new RRTYPE application?
         Please keep this part at a high level to inform the Expert and
         reviewers about uses of the RRTYPE. Remember most reviewers
         will be DNS experts that may have limited knowledge of your
         application space.


   D.    Description of the new RRTYPE, including any special processing
         for it by applications or DNS resolvers as well as servers.
         This description can be provided in-line in the template, as an
         attachment or with a publicly available URL:


   E.    What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
         need and why are they unsatisfactory?


   F.    What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?
         Note: this can be left blank and the mnemonic decided after the
         template is accepted.


   G.    Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
         Registry or require the creation of a new IANA Registry and if
         so what is that registry or registries?
         If a new registry is needed, specify allocation policy for it
         and initial contents.

   H.    Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
         servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being
         processed as an unknown RRTYPE?
