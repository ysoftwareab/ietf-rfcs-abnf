                PCEP Extension for L2 Flow Specification
                    draft-li-pce-pcep-l2-flowspec-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
   of selecting paths through a traffic engineering network.  These
   paths may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may
   be unsolicited requests issued by the PCE to network elements.  Both
   approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the
   details of the computed path.

   Traffic flows may be categorized and described using "Flow
   Specifications".  RFC 8955 defines the Flow Specification and
   describes how Flow Specification Components are used to describe
   traffic flows.  RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be
   distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated
   with routes.

   RFC XXXX specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support
   dissemination of Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE to indicate
   what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.

   The extensions defined in this document extends the support for
   Ethernet Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN)
   traffic filtering rules either by themselves or in conjunction with
   L3 flowspecs.

   RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX in the Abstract with the RFC
   number assigned to draft-ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec when it is published.

Internet-Draft              PCEP-L2-FlowSpec                October 2021


      The text in the document was earlier part of version 12 of draft-
      ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec which was approved by the IESG and was in
      the RFC Editor queue for a long time waiting for draft-ietf-idr-
      flowspec-l2vpn to be ready.  The pending specification for
      Flowspec V2 and implementation based on it will take time, it was
      decided to strip the L2 flowspec from the draft-ietf-pce-pcep-
      flowspec and move it an independent document (this one!).

   [RFC4655] defines the Path Computation Element (PCE), a functional
   component capable of computing paths for use in traffic engineering
   networks.  PCE was originally conceived for use in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering (TE) networks to
   derive the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  However, the scope
   of PCE was quickly extended to make it applicable to Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS)-controlled networks, and more recent work has brought other
   traffic engineering technologies and planning applications into scope
   (for example, Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8664]).

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP defines the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, enabling
   computation of path for MPLS-TE LSPs.

   Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable control of TE-LSPs by a PCE that retains state about the LSPs
   provisioned in the network (a stateful PCE).  [RFC8281] describes the
   setup, maintenance, and teardown of LSPs initiated by a stateful PCE
   without the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing
   for a dynamic network that is centrally controlled.  [RFC8283]
   introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller and
   describes how PCE can be viewed as a component that performs
   computation to place 'flows' within the network and decide how these
   flows are routed.

   The description of traffic flows by the combination of multiple Flow
   Specification Components and their dissemination as traffic flow
   specifications (Flow Specifications) is described for BGP in
   [RFC8955].  In BGP, a Flow Specification is comprised of traffic
   filtering rules and is associated with actions to perform on the
   packets that match the Flow Specification.  The BGP routers that
   receive a Flow Specification can classify received packets according
   to the traffic filtering rules and can direct packets based on the
   associated actions.  [I-D.hares-idr-flowspec-v2] specify the version
   2 of the BGP flow specification protocol that resolves some of issues
   with version 1.

   When a PCE is used to initiate tunnels (such as TE-LSPs or SR paths)
   using PCEP, it is important that the head end of the tunnels



Dhody, et al.            Expires April 17, 2022                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              PCEP-L2-FlowSpec                October 2021


   understands what traffic to place on each tunnel.  The data flows
   intended for a tunnel can be described using Flow Specification
   Components.  When PCEP is in use for tunnel initiation it makes sense
   for that same protocol to be used to distribute the Flow
   Specification Components that describe what data is to flow on those
   tunnels.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
   support dissemination of Flow Specification Components.  It includes
   the creation, update, and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP,
   and can be applied to tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels
   where control is delegated to the PCE by the PCC.  Furthermore, a PCC
   requesting a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request
   to indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this
   into the path computation.

   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn] defines a BGP flowspec extension to
   disseminate Ethernet Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 2 Virtual Private Network
   (L2VPN) traffic filtering rules either by themselves or in
   conjunction with L3 flowspecs.  This document extends the same
   support for PCEP by defining a new L2 Flow Filter TLV to be carried
   within the FLOWSPEC object.  The context and the procedures for the
   use of Flow Specifications is as per [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   The following term from [RFC8955] is used frequently throughout this
   document:

      A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching
      criteria that can be applied to IP traffic.  A given IP packet is
      said to match the defined Flow Specification if it matches all the
      specified criteria.

   Its usage in PCEP is further clarified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec].

   This document uses the terms "stateful PCE" and "active PCE" as
   advocated in [RFC7399].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  L2 Flow Specifications

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec], to carry Flow Specifications in
   PCEP messages, a PCEP object called the PCEP FLOWSPEC object is
   defined.  To describe a traffic flow, a PCEP TLV called the Flow
   Filter TLV is aldo defined.  This document extends the support for L2
   flow specifications by creating a new PCEP TLV called L2 Flow Filter
   TLV and update the processing rules.

   The PCEP FLOWSPEC object carries a FlowSpec filter rule encoded in a
   TLV.  To describe a traffic flow based on both L3 and L2 fields a new
   L2 Flow Filter TLV is introduced by this document.  The PCEP FLOWSPEC
   object could carries one of the following combinations of TLVs:

   o  no TLV

   o  one Flow Filter TLV

   o  one L2 Flow Filter TLV

   o  both a Flow Filter TLV and an L2 Flow Filter TLV

   At most one L2 Flow Filter TLV MAY be include in the the PCEP
   FLOWSPEC object.  The TLV is OPTIONAL when the R (remove) bit is set
   in the object.  At least one Flow Filter TLV or one L2 Flow Filter
   TLV MUST be present when the R bit is clear.  If both TLVs are
   missing when the R bit is clear, the PCEP peer MUST respond with a
   PCErr message with error-type TBD1 (FlowSpec Error) and error-value 2
   (Malformed FlowSpec).  A Flow Filter TLV and a L2 Flow Filter TLV MAY
   both be present when filtering is based on both L3 and L2 fields.

   The TLV follow the format of all PCEP TLVs as defined in [RFC5440].
   The Type field values come from the codepoint space for PCEP TLVs and
   has the value TBD2.  The value field of L2 Flow Filter TLV contain
   one or more sub-TLVs (Section 3.1, and they represent the complete
   definition of a Flow Specification for traffic to be placed on the
   tunnel.  The set of Flow Specification TLVs and L2 Flow Filter TLVs
   in a single instance of a Flow Filter TLV are combined to indicate
   the specific Flow Specification.  Note that the PCEP FLOWSPEC object
   can include just one Flow Filter TLV, just one L2 Flow Filter TLV, or
   one of each TLV.

   The rest of the procedures are same as [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec].

3.1.  L2 Flow Specification TLVs

   The L2 Flow Filter TLV carries one or more L2 Flow Specification TLV.
   The L2 Flow Specification TLV follows the format of all PCEP TLVs as
   defined in [RFC5440].  However, the Type values are selected from a
   separate IANA registry (see Section 4.2) rather than from the common
   PCEP TLV registry.

   Type values are chosen so that there can be commonality with L2 Flow
   Specifications defined for use with BGP
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn].  This is possible because the BGP Flow
   Spec encoding uses a single octet to encode the type where as PCEP
   uses two octets.  Thus the space of values for the Type field is
   partitioned as shown in Figure 1.


      Range          |
      ---------------+-------------------------------------------------
      0 .. 255       | Per BGP registry defined by
                     | [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn].
                     | Not to be allocated in this registry.
                     |
      256 ..   65535 | New PCEP Flow Specifications allocated according
                     | to the registry defined in this document.


              Figure 1: L2 Flow Specification TLV Type Ranges

   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn] is the reference for the registry "L2
   Flow Spec Component Types" and defines the allocations it contains.

   The content of the Value field in each TLV is specific to the type
   and describes the parameters of the Flow Specification.  The
   definition of the format of many of these Value fields is inherited
   from BGP specifications.  Specifically, the inheritance is from
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn], but may also be inherited from future
   BGP specifications.

   When multiple L2 Flow Specification TLVs are present in a single L2
   Flow Filter TLV they are combined to produce a more detailed
   specification of a flow.  Similarly, when both Flow Filter TLV and L2
   Flow Filter TLV are present, they are combined to produce a more
   detailed specification of a flow.

   An implementation that receives a PCEP message carrying a L2 Flow
   Specification TLV with a type value that it does not recognize or
   does not support MUST respond with a PCErr message with error-type

   TBD1 (FlowSpec Error), error-value 1 (Unsupported FlowSpec) and MUST
   NOT install the Flow Specification.

   All L2 Flow Specification TLVs with Types in the range 0 to 255 have
   their Values interpreted as defined for use in BGP (for example, in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn]) and are set using the BGP encoding,
   but without the type octet (the relevant information is in the Type
   field of the TLV).  The Value field is padded with trailing zeros to
   achieve 4-byte alignment.

   This document defines no new types.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   registry.  This document requests IANA actions to allocate code
   points for the protocol elements defined in this document.

4.1.  PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   IANA maintains a subregistry called "PCEP TLV Type Indicators".  IANA
   is requested to make an assignment from this subregistry as follows:


   Value   | Meaning                      | Reference
   --------+------------------------------+-------------
    TBD2   | L2 FLOW FILTER TLV           | [This.I-D]


4.2.  L2 Flow Specification TLV Type Indicators

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry called the "PCEP L2
   Flow Specification TLV Type Indicators" registry.

   Allocations from this registry are to be made according to the
   following assignment policies [RFC8126]:

                   |
    65532 .. 65535 | Experimental


5.  Implementation Status

   [NOTE TO RFC EDITOR : This whole section and the reference to RFC
   7942 is to be removed before publication as an RFC]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   At the time of posting the -00 version of this document, there are no
   known implementations of this mechanism.  It is believed that two
   vendors are considering prototype implementations, but these plans
   are too vague to make any further assertions.

6.  Security Considerations

   We may assume that a system that utilizes a remote PCE is subject to
   a number of vulnerabilities that could allow spurious LSPs or SR
   paths to be established or that could result in existing paths being



Dhody, et al.            Expires April 17, 2022                 [Page 8]

   modified or torn down.  Such systems, therefore, apply security
   considerations as described in [RFC5440], Section 2.5 of [RFC6952],
   [RFC8253], and [RFC8955].

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec], the description of Flow
   Specifications associated with paths set up or controlled by a PCE
   add a further detail that could be attacked without tearing down LSPs
   or SR paths, but causing traffic to be misrouted within the network.
   Therefore, the use of the security mechanisms for PCEP referenced
   above is important.  It further list the security considerations with
   respect to flow specifications which are applicable to L2 flowspec as
   well.
