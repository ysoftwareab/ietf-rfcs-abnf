     Location Source Parameter for the SIP Geolocation Header Field
                   draft-ietf-sipcore-locparam-03.txt

Abstract

   There are some circumstances where a Geolocation header field may
   contain more than one location value.  Knowing the identity of the
   node adding the location value allows the recipient more freedom in
   selecting the value to look at first rather than relying solely on
   the order of the location values.  This document defines the
   location-source parameter so that the entity adding the location
   value to Geolocation header field can identify itself using its
   hostname.

Internet-Draft             Location Parameter             September 2019


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Geolocation specification [RFC6442] describes the
   "Geolocation" SIP header field which is used to indicate that the SIP
   message is conveying location information.  [RFC6442] specifies that
   SIP intermediaries should not add location values to a SIP request
   that already contains location value.  [RFC6442] also states that if
   a SIP intermediary adds location it is fully responsible for
   addressing the concerns of any 424 (Bad Location Information) SIP
   response it receives.  However, some communications architectures,
   such as 3GPP [TS23-167] and ETSI [M493], prefer to use information
   provided by edge-proxies or acquired through the use of core-network
   nodes, before using information provided solely by user equipment
   (UE).  These solutions don't preclude the use of UE provided location
   but require a means of being able to distinguish the identity of the
   node adding the location value to the SIP message from that provided
   by the UE.

   [RFC6442] stipulates that the order of location values in the
   Geolocation header field is the same as the order in which they were
   added to the header field.  Whilst this order provides guidance to
   the recipient as to which values were added to the message earlier in
   the communication chain, it does not provide any indication of which
   node actually added the location value.  Knowing the identity of the
   entity that added the location to the message allows the recipient to
   choose which location to consider first rather than relying solely on
   the order of the location values in the Geolocation header field.

   This document extends the Geolocation header field, by allowing an
   entity adding the location value to identity itself using a hostname.
   This is done by defining a new geoloc-param header field parameter,
   location-source."How the entity adding the location value to the
   header field obtains the location information is out of scope of this
   document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Rationale

   The primary intent of the location-source parameter in this
   specification is for use in emergency calling.  There are various
   architectures defined for providing emergency calling using SIP-based



Winterbottom, et al.     Expires March 19, 2020                 [Page 3]

   messaging.  Each has it own characteristics with corresponding pros
   and cons.  All of them allow the UE to provide location information,
   however, many also attach other sources of location information to
   support veracity checks, provide backup information, or to be used as
   the primary location.

   This document makes no attempt to comment on these various
   architectures or the rationale for them wishing to include multiple
   location values.  It does recognize that these architectures exist
   and that there is a need to identify the entity adding the location
   information.

   The location-source parameter adds the location source generating the
   location value to increase the trustworthiness of the location
   information.

   The location-source parameter is applicable within a single private
   administrative domain or between different administrative domains
   where there is a trust relationship between the domains.  Thus it is
   intended to use this parameter only in trust domains where Spec(T) as
   described in [RFC3325] exists.

   The location-source parameter is not included in a SIP message sent
   to another network if there is no trust relationship.  The The
   location-source parameter is not applicable if the administrative
   domain manages emergency calls in a way that does not require any
   generation of the location.

   The functional architecture described within ETSI [M493] is an
   example of architecture where this parameter makes sense to be used.

4.  Mechanism

   The mechanism employed adds a parameter to the location value defined
   in [RFC6442] that identifies the hostname of the entity adding the
   location value to the Geolocation header field.  The Augmented BNF
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] for this parameter is shown in Figure 1.


          location-source = "loc-src" EQUAL hostname
          hostname = <defined in RFC3261>

   Only a fully qualified host name is valid.  The syntax does not
   support IP addresses, and if an entity conforming to this
   specification receives a Geolocation header field with a location-
   source parameter containing an IP address then the parameter MUST be
   removed.

   A SIP intermediarity conformant to this specification adding a
   location value to a Geolocation header field SHOULD also add a
   location-source header field parameter so that it is clearly
   identified as the node adding the location.  A UA MUST NOT insert a
   location-source header field parameter.  If a SIP intermediarity
   receives a message from an untrusted source with the location-source
   parameter set then it MUST remove the location-source parameter
   before passing the message into a trusted network.

5.  Example

   The following example shows a SIP INVITE message containing a
   Geolocation header field with two location values.  The first
   location value points to a PIDF-LO in the SIP body using a content-
   indirection (cid:) URI per [RFC4483] and this is provided by the UE.
   The second location value is an https URI the provided by a SIP
   intermediarity which identifies itself using the location-source
   parameter.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document doesn't change any of the privacy considerations
   described in [RFC6442].  While the addition of the location-source
   parameter does provide an indicator of the entity that added the

   location in the signaling path this provides little more exposure
   than a proxy identity being added to the record-route header field.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces the ability of a SIP intermediarity to
   insert a host name indicating that they added the specific location
   value to the Geolocation header field.  The intent is for this field
   to be used by the location recipient in the event that the SIP
   message contains multiple location values.  As a consequence this
   parameter should only be used by the location recipient in a trusted
   network.

   As already stated in [RFC6442] securing the location hop- by-hop,
   using TLS, protects the message from eavesdropping and modification
   in transit, but exposes the information to all SIP intermediaries on
   the path as well as the endpoint.  The location-source parameter is
   applicable within a single private administrative domain or between
   different administrative domains where there is a trust relationship
   between the domains.  If such trust domain is not given it is
   strongly recommended to delete the location information.

   The use of this parameter is not restricted to a specific
   architecture but using multiples locations and loc-src may end in
   compatibility issues.  [RFC6442] already addresses the issue of
   multiples locations.  To avoid problems of wrong interpretation of
   loc-src the value may be removed when passed to an other domain.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of location-source parameter for Geolocation header
      field

   This document calls for IANA to register a new SIP header parameter
   as per the guidelines in [RFC3261], which will be added to header
   sub-registry under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

   Header Field:  Geolocation

   Parameter Name:  loc-src
