Abstract

   This document defines the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute for the
   Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN), which allows a client to
   explicitly request the address type the TURN server will allocate
   (e.g., an IPv4-only node may request the TURN server to allocate an
   IPv6 address).  Additionally, this document also defines a new error
   response code with the value 440 (Address Family not Supported).

Internet-Draft   TURN Extension for IPv4/IPv6 transition    January 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [I-D.ietf-behave-turn]
   is a protocol that allows for an element behind a NAT or firewall to
   receive incoming data over TCP or UDP connections.  It is most useful
   for elements behind symmetric NATs or firewalls that wish to be on
   the receiving end of a connection to a single peer.

   This document defines the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute, which is
   an extension to TURN that allows a client to explicitly request the
   address type the TURN server will allocate (e.g., an IPv4-only node
   may request the TURN server to allocate an IPv6 address).

   This document also defines and registers a new error response code
   with the value 440 (Address Family not Supported).


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview of Operation

   When a user wishes a TURN server to allocate an address of a specific
   type, it sends an Allocate Request to the TURN server with a
   REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute.  TURN can run over UDP and TCP, as
   it allows for a client to request address/port pairs for receiving
   both UDP and TCP.

   Assuming the request is authenticated and has not been tampered with,
   the TURN server allocates a transport address of the type indicated
   in the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute.  This address is called the
   allocated transport address.

   The TURN server returns the allocated address in the response to the
   Allocate Request.  This response contains a RELAY-ADDRESS attribute
   indicating the mapped IP address and port that the server assigned to
   the client.

   For simplicity reasons, TURN servers are designed to allocate a
   single address per allocation request.  Therefore, Allocate Requests
   cannot carry more than one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute.
   Consequently, a client that wishes to allocate more than one address
   at a TURN server (e.g., an IPv4 and an IPv6 address) needs to perform
   several allocation requests (one allocation request per address).

4.  Client Behavior

   Client behavior for Allocate requests depends on whether the request
   is an initial one, for the purposes of obtaining a new relayed
   transport address, or a subsequent one, used for refreshing an
   existing allocation.

   The client behavior specified here affects the transport processing
   defined in Section 6.1 of TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn].

4.1.  Initial Allocate Request

   A client that wishes to obtain a transport address of a specific
   address type includes a REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute in the
   Allocate Request that sends to the TURN server.  Clients MUST NOT
   include more than one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute in an Allocate
   Request.  The mechanisms to formulate an Allocate Request are
   described in Section 6.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-behave-turn].

   The REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute is used by clients to request
   the allocation of a specific address type from a server.  The
   following is the format of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute.
   Note that TURN attributes are TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoded, with a
   16 bit type, a 16 bit length, and a variable-length value.



      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type                  |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Family    |            Reserved                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


           Figure 1: Format of REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE Attribute

   Type: the type of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute is 0x0017.  As
   specified in [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis], attributes with values
   between 0x0000 and 0x7FFF are comprehension-required, which means
   that the client or server cannot successfully process the message
   unless it understands the attribute.

   Length: this 16-bit field contains the length of the attribute in
   bytes.  The length of this attribute is 4 bytes.

   Family: there are two values defined for this field and specified in



Camarillo & Novo         Expires August 3, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   TURN Extension for IPv4/IPv6 transition    January 2008


   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis]: 0x01 for IPv4 addresses and 0x02 for
   IPv6 addresses.

   Reserved: at this point, the 24 bits in the reserved field SHOULD be
   set to zero by the client and MUST be ignored by the server.

   The REQUEST-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute MAY only be present in Allocate
   Requests.

4.2.  Refresh Request

   To perform a binding refresh, the client generates a Refresh Request
   as described in Section 6.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-behave-turn].  The client
   includes the same REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute as it included in
   its initial Allocate Request.

   If the Allocate Response contains the same transport address as
   previously obtained, the binding has been refreshed.  If, however,
   the response was an Allocate Error Response with an ERROR-CODE
   between 500 to 599, the client MAY resend the refresh request.  Any
   other Allocate Error Response codes imply that the transaction has
   failed.


5.  Server Behavior

   The server behavior specified here affects the transport processing
   defined in Section 6.2 of TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn].

5.1.  Allocate Response

   Assuming the request is authenticated and has not been tampered with,
   the TURN server processes the request.  Following the rules in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis], if the server does not understand the
   REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute, it generates an Allocate Error
   Response, which includes an ERROR-CODE attribute with response code
   420 (Unknown Attribute).  This response will contain an UNKNOWN-
   ATTRIBUTE attribute listing the unknown REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE
   attribute.

   This document defines the following new error response code:

   440 (Address Family not Supported):  The server did not support the
      address family requested by the client.  The client SHOULD not
      retry.

   If the server does not support the address family requested by the
   client, it MUST generate an Allocate Error Response, and it MUST

Internet-Draft   TURN Extension for IPv4/IPv6 transition    January 2008


   include an ERROR-CODE attribute with the response code defined in
   this draft, 440 (Address Family not Supported).

   If the server can successfully process the request, it allocates a
   transport address to the TURN client, called the allocated transport
   address, and returns it in the response to the Allocate Request.

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-behave-turn], the Allocate Response
   contains the same transaction ID contained in the Allocate Request
   and the RELAY-ADDRESS attribute that sets it to the allocated
   transport address.

   The RELAY-ADDRESS attribute indicates the mapped IP address and port.
   It is encoded in the same way as the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis].

   If the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute is absent, the server MUST
   allocate a IPv4 transport address to the TURN client.


6.  Security Considerations

   The attribute and error response code defined in this document do not
   have any special security considerations beyond those for other
   attributes and Error response codes.  All the security considerations
   applicable to STUN [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] and TURN are
   applicable to this document as well.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register the following values under the STUN
   Attributes registry and under the STUN Response Code Registry.

7.1.  New STUN Attribute Registry

   0x0017: REQUESTED-ADDRESS-TYPE

7.2.  New STUN Response Code Registry

   440 Address Family not Supported
