1.0 Introduction

        The InfiniBand specification[1] can be found at
        www.infinibandta.org. The document 'IP over InfiniBand:
        Overview, issues and requirements' [2] provides a short
        overview of InfiniBand architecture and issues with respect to
        specifying IP over InfiniBand.

        This document restricts itself with IPv4 and ARP over
        InfiniBand. A subsequent document will define IPv6
        encapsulation and address resolution over InfiniBand.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in RFC 2119.

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001



2.0 InfiniBand Data link

        InfiniBand(IB) provides multiple methods of packet exchange
        between two endpoints. These are :

                Reliable Connected (RC)
                Reliable Datagram  (RD)
                Unreliable Connected (UC)
                Unreliable Datagram (UD)
                Raw Datagram : Raw IPv6 (R6)
                             : Raw Ethertype (RE)

        IPv4 and ARP can be specified over any, multiple or all of
        these methods. A case can be made for support on any of the
        methods depending on the desired parameters. The IB
        specification requires Unreliable Datagram mode to be
        supported by all the IB nodes. The host channel adapters
        (HCAs) are additionally required to support Reliable connected
        and Unreliable connected modes but not target channel adapters
        (TCAs).

        Additionally, for the sake of simplicity and ease of
        implementation and integration with existing stacks, it is
        desirable that the fabric support multicasting. This is
        possible only in Unreliable datagram (UD) and IB's Raw
        datagram modes.

        Given the above conditions this document specifies a method to
        encapsulate IPv4 and ARP over UD mode of InfiniBand. It is a
        MUST for an IPv4 over InfiniBand implementation to support
        IPv4 and ARP over Unreliable Datagram mode of InfiniBand. The
        Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) MUST NOT be supported over
        any mode other than Unreliabe Datagram. An implementation MAY
        additionally support IPv4 over any of the other modes.

2.1 UD packet format

        The UD packet may be transmitted in two ways:

        1) Local (within an IB subnet) packets

       +--------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+
       |Local   |Base     |Datagram |Packet |Invariant| Variant |
       |Routing |Transport|Extended |Payload| CRC     |  CRC    |
       |Header  |Header   |Transport|       |         |         |
       |        |         |Header   |       |         |         |
       +--------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        2) Global (between IB subnets) packets

       +--------+-------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+
       |Local   |Global |Base     |Datagram |Packet |Invariant| Variant |
       |Routing |Routing|Transport|Extended |Payload| CRC     |  CRC    |
       |Header  |Header |Header   |Transport|       |         |         |
       |        |       |         |Header   |       |         |         |
       +--------+-------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+


2.1.1 Local Routing header

        This header is always used. When communicating across IB
        subnets the destination lid is the LID of an IB router port.
        Otherwise it is the LID of the port to which the packet is
        addressed.



         0                   1                   2                   3

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



        Of the header elements the sending node's IPv4 stack must know
        the Service Level, Destination LID and the source LID. In
        addition packet length cannot specify a payload of more than
        the path MTU between the source and the destination ports.


        The other values are either well known standard values or are
        determined from other known values. For example, the VL is
        determined from the SL.

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001



2.1.2 Global Routing header

        This header is used when the packet must traverse IB subnet
        boundaries. It is also used for all multicast packets. The GRH
        looks like the IPv6 header. The GID looks like an IPv6
        address.

         0                   1                   2                   3

        |                   Source GID                                  |
        |                                                               |
        |                                                               |
        |                                                               |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |                   Destination GID                             |
        |                                                               |
        |                                                               |
        |                                                               |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Note that from the point of view of the IPv4 layer the GID is
        another form of link-layer address albeit incomplete since the
        LID is always needed for any communication.

        The version is always set to 6. The Traffic Class, Flow label
        etc. are likely to be determined in response to a policy or
        default values may be used. The next header field is always
        the BTH (Base transport header).

        Among the GRH fields only the destination GID needs to be
        determined.

2.1.3 Base Transport Header

         0                   1                   2                   3

        |  Reserved     |        Destination Queue Pair(QP)             |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |A|  Reserved   |        Packet Sequence Number                 |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Of these the P_Key and the destination QP must be determined
        as part of the IPv4 address resolution process. The rest of
        the fields are either not used by UD mode or are filled in the
        the channel adapter based on local conditions/values. The
        P_Key index in the P_Key table is attached to the QP used for
        transmission of packets. In case the P_Key table on the port
        is more than one entry deep the software needs to decide the
        P_Key to use. Note: The P_Key table can be written to only by
        the SM [1].

        When multicasting the destination QP is always set to
        0xFFFFFF.

2.1.4 Datagram Extended Transport Header

         0                   1                   2                   3
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |                       Queue Key (Q_Key)                       |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | Reserved      |       Source Queue Pair                       |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        This header includes the sender's queue pair number and the
        Q_Key used in the communication.

2.1.5 IPv4 over UD requirements

        Based on the above headers it is clear that the IPv4
        implementation must know the following information before it
        can send a packet to a peer:

        1. LID
        2. GID
                A GID is required only when crossing an IB subnet. A



Kashyap                                                         [Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


                GID is also required, albeit the multicast group's
                GID, when sending multicast packets.
        3. Service Level
        4. Path MTU between the communicating port
        5. Partition Key
        6. Queue Pair Number
        7. Q_Key


3.0 IPv4 Address resolution

        Address resolution in its most basic form requires a mapping
        from the IPv4 address to the link layer address. This is
        generally the port identifier. However, a packet in IB
        requires additional auxiliary information as noted above.

        Of the information noted in the previous section the peer
        knows its own LID, GID, Partition Key, Queue Pair and the
        Q_Key. It can therefore return these values in the ARP reply.

        The service level and path MTU can be determined after knowing
        both the endpoint's port identifiers by querying the SA. Thus
        to get all the information that can comprise a link address in
        InfiniBand UD fabrics the subnet manager/subnet administrator
        needs to be consulted.

        Such a setup however introduces unwanted complexity and
        possibly delay. Additionally it may impact the scalability of
        the IPv4 subnets in IB subnets.

        The solution proposed in this draft does away with consulting
        the SM/SA for the missing information. This is achieved by
        utilizing the subnet wide parameters that are configured for
        the IB multicast GID corresponding to IPv4 broadcast[5].

3.1 ARP and IPv4 subnet span over IB subnets

        Spanning IPv4 subnets across IB subnets is not straightforward
        when implementing multicasting [5].

        A link address in the case of IPv4 subnets spanning IB subnets
        requires two components. These are the GID and the LID. In the
        case of the target being on the remote IB subnet the sender
        cannot determine the right LID in a simple way. The sender
        doesn't know the receiver's location and hence the IB router
        to use. Therefore it cannot specify the right LID.

        The target is better placed in that the target will know the



Kashyap                                                         [Page 7]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        sender's location. It must then, based on IB routing setup
        (which is not defined by IBTA yet), determine the LID it needs
        to use. It must therefore send a reply with the first hop IB
        router's LID and its own GID. Only on receiving the reply
        would the original sender be in a position to know the LID it
        must use to communicate with the target. The situation can get
        even more complex due to IB routing changes since they would
        effect the LIDs in the cached ARP entries.

        The target ARP code must, of course, use the received LID if
        the GID prefix is the same as its own. Only in the case where
        the prefixes are different must it determine the first hop IB
        router's LID.

        The process is complex and unnecessary. The additional
        complexity introduced by IPv4 subnets spanning IB subnets
        gains very little if anything.

        IPv4 subnets therefore MUST be fully contained within an IB
        subnet.

3.2 InfiniBand ARP

        This document proposes to utilize the address resolution
        protocol as defined in RFC826 [6].

        The ARP request packet is broadcast to the IPv4 subnet. This
        packet includes the target IPv4 address and the sender's link
        layer address. The response is unicast to the sender with the
        target's link layer address.

3.2.1 InfiniBand ARP header

        The standard ARP packet header is of the form (as per RFC 826)

                16 bits: hardware type
                16 bits: protocol
                 8 bits: length of hardware address
                 8 bits: length of protocol address
                16 bits: ARP operation

        The hardware type will take the value corresponding to
        InfiniBand. A request to IANA will be made for this
        allocation.

        The rest of the fields will be used consistent with RFC 826.

        The remaining fields in the packets hold the sender/target



Kashyap                                                         [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        hardware and protocol addresses.

        [ sender hardware address ]
        [ sender protocol address ]
        [ target hardware address ]
        [ target protocol address ]


3.2.2 Hardware address format

        16 bits :  LID
         8 bit  :  Capability flags (UC|RC|RE|R6|QPN)
        24 bits :  QPN
        32 bits :  Q_Key
        64 bits :  GUID

        Note that this is the packet on the wire. It does not imply
        the data structure used by the end hosts in its ARP cache.

3.2.2.1 LID

        This is the LID associated with the port to which the IPv4
        address is attached by way of the logical interface.

3.2.2.2 Capability flag

        Only the first 5 bits are defined. The rest are for future
        use. The first 4 bits denote the InfiniBand modes over which
        IPv4 is supported.

        UC - unreliable connected
        RC - reliable connected
        RE - raw ethertype
        R6 - raw IPv6

        The support of IPv4 over UD is mandatory and therefore it need
        not be indicated in these bits. The rest are all optional. The
        implementation details of the other formats are beyond the
        scope of this document. The flags provide a way for the IPv4
        over IB implementations to indicate the possibilities among
        themselves. The use of these capabilities is then a choice
        between the communicating endpoints.

        QPN flag:

        QPN flag indicates that the endpoint supports applications
        that are tied to specific QPs. Since there may be a large
        number of QPs available at the endpoints (QP number is 24



Kashyap                                                         [Page 9]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        bits) an endpoint can choose to map various services (protocol
        and port pairs) to specific QPNs. This flag indicates the use
        of such demultiplexing.

        The flag will be set by hosts that want to advertise such a
        use. The endpoints that don't support QPN demultiplexing don't
        use this flag.

        The receiver is free to ignore this flag and continue to use
        the default QPN (described below) and not determine the
        service related QPN.

        By the same token, a host that implements QPN based
        demultiplexing MUST accept packets that are received on the
        default QPN even if it is demultiplexing the corresponding
        service by use of QPNs.

        The method of service resolution to the corresponding QPN is
        not defined in this document. The ARP packet MUST include only
        one QPN, the default QPN and none other.

3.2.2.3  QPN and Q_Key

        This is the default QPN to be used to send IPv4 packets. The
        sender lists the QPN it expects the packets to be sent to and
        the target replies with its QPN.

        The Q_Key is the corresponding Q_Key the endpoints intend to
        use.

3.2.2.4 GUID

        The GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is the EUI-64 identifier
        associated with the CA port [1]. GUID identifies an interface
        uniquely. In contrast the LID may change after a reboot. Thus
        the GUID value might be used when setting up static ARP
        entries. Note that to actually send a packet the LID must
        always be determined. Thus static ARP entries really don't
        exist in IB subnets.

        The GID formed from the GUID is always available to the
        receiver. The IB specification requires the 40 bytes of the
        GRH to be placed in the first 40 bytes of the receiver's
        buffer. Thus it is possible for the receiver to always get the
        GUID of the sender if a GRH is included. The GRH has to be
        used when sending an IB multicast packet [1]. Therefore there
        is really no need to include the GUID in the ARP packet.
        However the GUID is included to allow for proxy ARP.

INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


3.3 InfiniBand ARP process

        The source broadcasts the ARP_REQUEST packet to the IPv4 subnet.
        The IPv4 broadcast to IB multicast group mapping is defined in
        kashyap-draft-ipoib-ipv4-multicast-01.txt [5].

        The broadcast packet itself is a UD packet and hence requires
        the parameters listed in section 2.1.5.

        As defined in [5], the IPv4 subnet is setup with the IPv4
        broadcast address mapped to an IB multicast group. This
        address is registered with the IB subnets SM/SA. Along with
        this are registered the characteristics such as the:

                LID
                P_Key
                Q_Key
                Service Level
                MTU
                Traffic Class
                Hop Limit
                Flow ID

        Note that since these are applicable to the IPv4 broadcast
        address, the fabric administrator must ensure that these
        parameters are honoured across the IPv4 subnet. If this were not
        done the broadcast cannot be sent to all the IPv4 hosts. The
        interfaces that do not honour these parameters will not be
        able to join the IPv4 broadcast address.

        Thus the service level must be supported across the multicast
        group. The MTU must be common across the subnet etc. All these
        values are returned to the node joining the group.

        Therefore the act of joining the IPv4 broadcast address
        resolves many of the parameters needed to send/receive packets
        in the IPv4 subnet.

        Every IPv4 interface MUST join the IB multicast group
        corresponding to IPv4 subnet broadcast address. This first
        step is a necessary step towards address resolution and
        general IPv4 and ARP support on InfiniBand subnets.

        These values act as the best case as well as the default case
        values. It is RECOMMENDED that the implementations use the
        parameters returned by the joining of the IPv4 broadcast group
        in all communication. Implementations are free to utilize IB
        specific messages and methods to determine alternate values if



Kashyap                                                        [Page 11]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        they so desire.

        Thus the InfiniBand ARP broadcast packet utilizes the
        parameters received as a result of joining the IB broadcast
        group. The rest of the process is therefore identical to
        standard implementation of ARP over Ethernet as described in
        RFC826.

        All multicast packets in IB use the QP number 0xFFFFFF thus it
        doesn't have to be determined for sending the ARP broadcast.

        During the ARP response/request the QPN and Q_Key being used
        by the two endpoints are exchanged along with the LID and the
        GID. The rest of the values, as stated above, are determined
        at the time the broadcast group was joined.

4.0 IPv4 and ARP encapsulation in UD packets

        +-------+------+---------+---------+-------+---------+-------+
        |Local  |      |Base     |Datagram |       |Invariant|Variant|
        |Routing| GRH  |Transport|Extended |Payload| CRC     | CRC   |
        |Header |Header|Header   |Transport|       |         |       |
        |       |      |         |Header   |       |         |       |
        +-------+------+---------+---------+-------+---------+-------+


        The InfiniBand specification requires the use of GRH when
        multicasting. A unicast packet need not include the GRH. It is
        RECOMMENED that a GRH be included in the interest of symmetry.
        It is RECOMMENDED that for unicast packets the destination GID
        be formed from the GUID in the ARP cache and the local IB
        subnet prefix. The GID at GID index 0 MUST be used as the
        source GID.

        Note that the additional 40 bytes of the GRH do not reduce the
        MTU value since the IB multicast group's MTU already accounts
        for it. The MTU applies to the payload carried in the IB frame
        and doesn't include the headers (GRH/LRH etc.) optional or
        otherwise.

4.1 Protocol demultiplexing

        The IB frame does not indicate the payload type. The queue
        pairs (QP) at the endpoints are tied to specific 'users' who
        know the data they are likely to receive. The IB specification
        assumes such a setup.

        In this scenario if a common QP is used to receive multiple



Kashyap                                                        [Page 12]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        protocols, intentionally or otherwise, there are two options:

        a) Introduce a protocol identifier header into the payload.

                This mode would translate to introducing a 4 byte
                field in the packet before the IPv4 header. This field
                would carry the assigned value to indicate IPv4.

                This option, however has a flaw. Since it is being
                protected from a random protocol or data reception the
                random data has an equal chance of looking like the
                new header as with the IPv4 header.

        b) Determine the packet based on IPv6 header requirements

                The packet received can be checked for IPv4 signatures
                such as the value 6 in the first nibble. The likely
                conflict is with IPv6/ARP packets on the unicast
                connections. These can be distinguished by looking at
                the first nibble. Any intermediate IB switches/IB
                routers might as well look at the first nibble (and
                fields) directly rather than a header in the payload.
                They wouldn't know that the packet carries a special
                header without peeking anyway.

        Based on the above no additional header is defined in the
        paylaod. An implementation may disambiguate its packets based
        on the signature of the protocols it supports.

        [ Opinions of the WG members are solicited on this. The
        author's preference is for not specifying an additional
        header. A payload identifier in the IB headers would have been
        nice.]

5.0 MTU

        The MTU associated with the IB multicast group corresponding
        to the limited broadcast address MUST be set as the MTU of the
        subnet. Every interface on being setup joins the broadcast
        group and gets the MTU value.

        This is the MTU value that is reflected to the IP layer as the
        interface MTU.

6.0 Service Level

        The IB specification requires the use of a service level (SL)
        in every packet. This value may be derived based on any QoS or



Kashyap                                                        [Page 13]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        other parameters. The only requirement is that it must be a
        valid SL between the two endpoints. The valid SLs between two
        ports are recorded in the SM/SA [1].

        To determine the list the two endpoints must be known. This
        implies that after the ARP process is complete the SM/SA need
        to be consulted. Even then the host must use some external
        parameters to determine the correct SL to use between the
        endpoints.

        It is RECOMMENED that the SL returned on joining the IB
        broadcast group is chosen as the default SL for all
        communication in the IP subnet.

7.0 P_Key

        The partition key is a necessity in all IB communication. This
        document RECOMMENDS using the P_Key associated with the IPv4
        broadcast group (IB multicast GID FF12::255.255.255.255) for
        all IPv4 subnet related communication.

8.0 Additional Features

        This document has presented a simple, efficient, interoperable
        method of address resolution and ARP and IPv4 encapsulation in
        InfiniBand packets. The basic desire of the author is to
        present a method that easily enmeshes with existing
        implementations. Another strong desire is to ensure
        interoperability between implementations by requiring easily
        setup default values without inhibiting those implementations
        that need some additional features.

        There may be situations where implementations may desire more
        'optimal' performance or features. Such implementations are
        dependent on the fabric administrator ensuring that the SM/SA
        and the fabric components are correctly setup for the desired
        features.

        These cases could be:

        1. use of other methods than UD for IPv4 packets

                Example: One could utilize Unreliable connected mode
                to get a higher MTU for TCP connectivity. The
                fragmentation and reassembling of packets is delegated
                to the hardware.

                The ARP proposal in this document allows for an



Kashyap                                                        [Page 14]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


                indication of such a capability. It is up to the
                implementations to then utilize InfiniBand specific
                ways (use of Connection manager etc.) to setup the
                necessary communication. The IPv4 encapsulation can
                stay the same except that the relevant IB headers will
                be used.

                The only requirement is that the Address Resolution
                protocol MUST be implemented over UD mode of
                InfiniBand. This allows for a common mode of
                determining the link address and link capabilities
                across the IPv4 subnet.

        2. Use of alternate SL

                Some implementations might want to determine alternate
                SL values from the SM/SA. This is a valid option but
                is unrelated to the IPv4 implementation. This document
                recommends that the SL utilized in the IPv4 subnet
                broadcast address i.e. the corresponding IB multicast
                group, which by definition is valid for the whole of
                IPv4 subnet, will be used by default.

                Alternate choices depend on the implementation
                consulting the SM/SA and the fabric administrator
                ensuring that such choices are valid and available.
                Such a choice could also depend on the quality of
                service policy mappings from IPv4 to InfiniBand
                implemented on the host.

                An implementation MUST provide configuration prameters
                to define the method of determining the SL. The
                default value MUST imply that the SL associated with
                IPv4 broadcast group (IB multicast group
                FF12::255.255.255.255) is the best case SL to be used
                in for all communication.

        3. Use of alternate TClass, FlowLabel

                The logic governing these parameters is the same as in
                the previous case for SL. Additionally these may be
                determined by a policy that is intertwined with IPv4
                routing or IB routing or both. The discussion of such
                issues is not relevant to this document. However, it
                is RECOMMENDED that broadcast group provide the
                default values.

        4. Use of QPN demultiplexing



Kashyap                                                        [Page 15]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


                The QPN demultiplexing has been described in some
                detail in section 3.2.2.2. Thus the implementations
                that desire the more 'optimal' behaviour can do so in
                an interoperable way. The method of determining the
                service bindings to QPs is beyond the scope of this
                document.

9.0 IANA Considerations

        To support ARP over InfiniBand the Address Resolution
        Parameter 'Number Hardware Type (hrd)' is required. A request
        to IANA will be made in this regard.

10.0 Security Considerations

        This document specifies IPv4 packet transmission over a
        broadcast network. Any network of this kind is vulnerable to a
        sender claiming another's identity and forge traffic or
        eavesdrop. It is the responsibility of the higher layers or
        applications to implement suitable counter-measures if this is
        a problem.

13.0 APPENDIX A: Introduction to InfiniBand




Kashyap                                                        [Page 16]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        For a more complete overview the reader is referred to chapter
        3 of the InfiniBand specification.

        InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) defines a System Area Network
        (SAN) for connecting multiple independent processor platforms,
        I/O platforms and I/O devices. The IBA SAN is a communications
        and management infrastructure supporting both I/O and
        inter-processor communications for one or more computer
        systems.

        An IBA SAN consists of processor nodes and I/O units connected
        through an IBA fabric made up of cascaded switches and IB
        routers (connecting IB subnets). I/O units can range in
        complexity from single ASIC IBA attached devices such as a LAN
        adapter to a large memory rich RAID subsystem.

        IBA network is subdivided into subnets interconnected by IB
        routers. These are IB routers and IB subnets and not IP
        routers or IP subnets.

        Each IB node or switch may attach to a single or multiple
        switches or directly with each other. Each node interfaces
        with the link by way of channel adapters (CAs). The
        architecture supports multiple CAs per unit with each CA
        providing one or mode ports that connect to the fabric. Each
        CA appears as a node to the fabric.

        The ports are the endpoints to which the data is sent.
        However, each of the ports may include multiple QPs (queue
        pairs) that may be directly addressed from a remote peer. From
        the point of view of data transfer the QP number (QPN) is part
        of the address.

        IBA supports both connection oriented and datagram service
        between the ports. The peers are identified by QPN and the
        port identifier. In raw datagram mode the QPN is not used.

        A port may be identified by a local ID (LID) and optionally a
        Global ID (GID).

        The GID is 128 bits long and is formed by the concatenation of
        a 64 bit subnet prefix and a 64 bit EUI-64 compliant portion
        (GUID). The LID is a 16 bit value that is assigned when the
        port becomes active. Note that the GUID is the only persistent
        identifier of a port. However, it cannot be used as an address
        in a packet. If the prefix is modified then the GID may
        change. The subnet manager may attempt to keep the LID values
        constant across shutdowns but that is not a requirement.



Kashyap                                                        [Page 17]





INTERNET-DRAFT        IPv4 and ARP over InfiniBand        July 19, 2001


        The assignment of the GID and the LID is done by the subnet
        manager. Every IB subnet has at least one subnet manager
        component that controls the fabric. It assigns the LIDs and
        GIDs, it programs the switches so that they route packets
        between destinations. The subnet manager and a related
        component, the subnet administrator (SA) are the central
        repository of all information that is required to setup and
        bring up the fabric.

        IB routers are components that route packets between IB
        subnets based on the GIDs. Thus within and IB subnet a packet
        may or may not include a GID but when going across an IB
        subnet the GID must be included. A LID is always needed in a
        packet since the destination within a subnet is determined by
        it.

        A CA and a switch may have multiple ports. Each CA port is
        assigned its own LID or a range of LIDs. The ports of a switch
        are not addressable by LIDs/GIDs or in other words, are
        transparent to other end nodes. Each port has its own set of
        buffers. The buffering is channeled through virtual lanes (VL)
        where each VL has its own flow control. There may be upto 16
        VLs.

        VLs provide a mechanism for creating multiple virtual links
        within a single physical link. All ports however must support
        VL15 which is reserved exclusively for subnet management
        datagrams and hence doesn't concern the IPoIB discussions. The
        actual VL that a port uses is configured by the SM and is
        based on the Service Level (SL) specified in every packet.
        There are 16 possible SLs.


        In addition to the features described above viz. Queue Pairs
        (QPs), Service Levels (SLs) and addressing (GID/LID), IBA also
        defines the following:

        P_Keys or partition keys: Every packet, but for the raw
        datagrams, carries the partition key (P_key). These values are
        used for isolation in the fabric. A switch (this is an
        optional feature) may be programmed by the SM to drop packets
        not having a certain key. The same is the case with the
        receiving CA.


        Q_Keys: These are used to enforce access rights for reliable
        and unreliable IB datagram services. Raw datagram services
        don't require this value. At communication establishment the

        endpoints exchange the Q_Keys and must always use the relevant
        Q_Keys when communicating with one another.

        Mutlicast support: A switch may support multicasting ie.
        replication of packets across multiple output ports. This is
        an optional feature at the switches. A multicast group is
        identified by a GID. The GID format is as defined in RFC 2373
        on IPv6 addressing. Thus from an IPv6 over IB's point of view
        the data link multicast address looks like the network
        address. An IB node must explicitly join a multicast group by
        a request to the SM to receive packets. A node may send
        packets to any multicast group. In both cases the multicast
        LID to be used in the packets is received from the SM.

        There are 6 transport types specified by the IB architecture.
        These are :

        1. Unreliable Datagram (unacknowledged - connectionless)
                The UD service is connectionless and unacknowledged.
                It allows the QP to communicate with any unreliable
                datagram QP on any node.

                The switches and hence each link can support only a
                certain MTU. The MTU ranges are 256 bytes, 512 bytes,
                1024 bytes, 2048 bytes, 4096 bytes. A UD packet cannot
                be larger than the smallest link MTU between the two
                peers.

        2. Reliable Datagram    (acknowledged - multiplexed)
                The RD service is multiplexed over connections between
                nodes called End to end contexts (EEC) which allows
                each RD QP to communicate with any RD QP on any node
                with an established EEC. Multiple QPs can use the same
                EEC and a single QP can use multiple EECs (one for
                each remote node per reliable datagram domain).

        3. Reliable Connected (acknowledged - connection oriented)
                The RC service associates a local QP with one and only
                one remote QP. The message sizes maybe as large as
                2^31 bytes in length. The CA implementation takes care
                of segmentation and assembly.

        4. Unreliable Connected (unacknowledged - connection oriented)
                The UC service associates one local QP with one and
                only one remote QP. There is no acknowledgment and
                hence no resend of lost or corrupted packets. Such
                packets are therefore simply dropped. It is similar to
                RC otherwise.

        5. Raw Ethertype (unacknowledged - connectionless)
                The Ethertype raw datagram packet contains a generic
                transport header that is not interpreted by the CA but
                it specifies the protocol type. The values for
                ethertype are the same as defined in RFC1700 for
                ethertype.

        6. Raw IPv6 ( unacknowledged - connectionless)
                Using IPv6 raw datagram service, the IBA CA can
                support standard prtocol layers atop IPv6 (such as
                TCP/UDP). Thus native IPv6 packets can be bridged into
                the IBA SAN and delivered directly to a port and to
                its IPv6 raw datagram QP.

        The first 4 are referred to as IB transports. The latter two
        are classified as Raw datagrams. There is no indication of the
        QP number in the raw datagram packets. The raw datagram
        packets are limited by the link MTU in size.
