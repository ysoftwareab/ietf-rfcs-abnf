Internet-Draft            The lid: URI scheme              February 2000


1. Introduction

   Content delivered by a one-way broadcast is not necessarily
   available on-demand, as it is when delivered by HTTP or FTP. For
   such content, it is necessary to have a unique identifier  for each
   resource. To support cross-references within the content (for use in
   hyperlinks or to embed one piece of content in another), these local
   names must be location-independent.

   The "lid:" URI scheme enables content creators to assign unique
   identifiers to each resource relative to a given namespace. Thus the
   author can establish a new namespace for a set of content and then
   use simple, human-readable names for all resources within that
   space. The "lid:" scheme can be used to uniquely identify any
   content that is available locally (from a cache, for example) and is
   used in the Advanced Television Enhancement Forum specification[2]
   to identify resources that are broadcast in conjunction with
   television programming.

   In addition, the "lid:" URI scheme may be useful in any system to
   reference content that may only be available in a local cache. The
   use of the "lid:" may be preferable to using "file:" or "cid:" URIs
   in these cases.

2. Description

   lid: URIs fully comply with the syntax called out in RFC2396[1].
   This document will not review the entire syntax.  Rather, it will
   just highlight the specifics.  Numbers in {}s refer to RFC 2396
   section numbers.

   lid: URIs are simultaneously URIs and URNs {1.2}.  The term "URI"
   will continue to be used to refer to the collection.  They are
   technically URLs as well, but only in a trivial way.

   lid: URIs are hierachical and the relative forms are fully supported
   {1.4}.  The "." and ".." path components are given their accustomed
   meanings.

   The standard character set restrictions and operations (e.g.
   quoting) are used {2.}.

   This document does not specify a maximum length of an lid: URI.
   Content authors should consult the set of instantiation documents
   covering their target systems to determine any limitations on length.

   The standard form {3.} of the "lid:" URI is as follows:


   lid://<authority><path>?<query>


   The <authority> part is a registration-based naming authority.  The
   registration is the Domain Name System {3.2}.  Note that the
   <authority> part is not expected to ever be resolved via DNS
   servers. Further, the <authority> part must be a name: a numeric
   identifier (such as IPv4 address) is not permissible {3.2.2}.

   The <path> names a specific resource within the name space, and must
   follow the generic relative URI syntax. As with all URI schemes that
   support the generic relative URI syntax, this path component can be
   used alone as a relative URI, where the namespace is implied by a
   base URI specified for the content through other means.

   The server-based portions {3.2.1}, including "<userinfo>@" and
   ":<port>", are permitted but their meaning is not defined here.

   Path component interpretation is as specified in {3.3}.  Path
   components, as well as complete lid: URIs, are compared in a
   case-independent fashion.

   Query components are permitted; interpretation is as specified in
   {3.4}.

   Fragment identifiers are permitted; interpretation is as specified
   in {4.1}.

   Relative URI references are permitted within an application.
   However, all URIs will be converted to fully-qualified form before
   being passed to the environment for lookup {5.}.

   In general, Base URIs as described in {5.1} operate as specified.
   Specific instantiations of this scheme may specify alternate Base
   URI semantics.

   Each instantiation of this scheme will specify how default Base URIs
   are obtained. {5.1.4}

3. Security Considerations

   The local identifier URI scheme is subject to the same security
   implications as in general URI[1] schemes, so the usual precautions
   apply.  This means that some local identifier URIs may refer to
   resources that are not available (because they have not been
   received, for example), or to resources that have been received, but
   were intentionally misidentified.  Appropriate security mechanisms
   should be used in the delivery of content identified by local
   identifier URIs.

Appendix A. Syntax of Local Identifier URIs

   The collected BNF for "lid:" URIs is encoded as specified in RFC
   2396[1].  The specific BNF for "lid:" URIs is as follows:


   lidURI        = "lid://" authority [ "/" [ path_segments ] ]
                   [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] hostname [ ":" port ]

   userinfo      = *( unreserved | escaped |
                      ";" | ":" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | "," )

   hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
   domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
   toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
   port          = *digit

   path_segments = segment *( "/" segment )
   segment       = *pchar *( ";" param )
   param         = *pchar
   pchar         = unreserved | escaped |
                   ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

   query         = *uric
   fragment      = *uric

   uric          = reserved | unreserved | escaped
   reserved      = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                   "$" | ","
   unreserved    = alphanum | mark
   mark          = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" |
                   "(" | ")"

   escaped       = "%" hex hex
   hex           = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" |
                           "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"

   alphanum      = alpha | digit
   alpha         = lowalpha | upalpha

   lowalpha = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |
              "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" |
              "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
   upalpha  = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" |
              "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" |
              "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"
   digit    = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
