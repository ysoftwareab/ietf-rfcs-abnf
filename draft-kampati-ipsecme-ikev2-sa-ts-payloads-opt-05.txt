            IKEv2 Optional SA&TS Payloads in Child Exchange
           draft-kampati-ipsecme-ikev2-sa-ts-payloads-opt-05

Abstract

   This document describes a method for reducing the size of the
   Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) exchanges at time of rekeying
   IKE SAs and Child SAs by removing or making optional of SA & TS
   payloads.  Reducing size of IKEv2 exchanges is desirable for low
   power consumption battery powered devices.  It also helps to avoid IP
   fragmentation of IKEv2 messages.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) specified in
   [RFC7296] is used in the IP Security (IPSec) architecture for the
   purposes of Security Association (SA) parameters negotiation and
   authenticated key exchange.  The protocol uses UDP as the transport
   for its messages, which size varies from less than one hundred bytes
   to several kilobytes.

   According to [RFC7296], the secret keys used by IKE/IPSec SAs should
   be used only for a limited amount of time and to protect a limited
   amount of data.  When the lifetime of an SA expires or is about to
   expire, the peers can rekey the SA to reestablish a new SA to take
   the place of the old one.

   For security gateways/ePDG in 4G networks and cRAN/Cloud in 5G
   networks, they will support more than 100,000 IKE/IPSEC tunnels.  So
   on an average, for every second there may be hundreds or thousands of
   IKE SAs and Child SAs that are rekeying.  This takes huge amount of
   bandwidth, packet fragmentation and more processing resources.  For
   these devices, these problems can be solved by introducing the
   solution described in this document.

   This is also useful in Internet of Things (IoT) devices which
   utilizing lower power consumption technology.  For these devices,
   reducing the length of IKE/Child SA rekeying messages can save the
   bandwidth consumption.  At the same time, it can also save the
   computing processes by less payload are included.

   Most devices don't prefer to change cryptographic suites frequently.
   By taking this advantage the SA and TS payloads can be made optional
   at the time of rekeying IKE SAs and Child SAs.  In such situation,
   only a new SPI value is needed to create the new IKE SA and Child SA.
   So a new Notify payload which contains the needed SPI value can be
   sent instead of the SA and TS payloads.

   In case of rekeying IKE SAs, the SA payloads can be optimized if
   there is no change of cryptographic suites.  In case of rekeying
   Child SAs, the SA and TS payloads can be optimized if there is no
   change of cryptographic suites and ACL configuration.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Details

   This section provides protocol details and contains the normative
   parts.

   Before using this new optimization, the IPSec implementation who
   supports it has to know that the peer also supports it.  Without the
   support on both sides, the optimized rekeying messages sent by one
   peer may be unrecognizable for the other peer.  To prevent this
   failure from happening, the first step is to negotiate the support of
   this optimization between the two peers.  There are two specific
   rekeying SAs cases: rekeying IKE SAs and rekeying Child SAs.  After
   the negotiation, the initiator can optimize the rekeying message
   payloads in both cases.  In other words, once the negotiation of
   support for optimizing payloads at rekeying IKE SAs and Child SAs is
   complete, both IKE SAs and Child SAs rekeying are supported by the
   two sides.  The responder can react based on the received rekeying
   message.

Internet-Draft     IKEv2 Optional Child SA&TS Payloads         July 2021


3.1.  Negotiation of Support for Optimizing Payloads at Rekeying IKE SAs
      and Child SAs

   The initiator indicates its support for optimizing payloads at
   rekeying IKE SAs and Child SAs by including a Notify payload of type
   MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED in the IKE_AUTH request message.  By
   observing the MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED notification in the received
   message, the responder can deduce the initiator's support of this
   extension.  If the responder also supports this extension, it
   includes the MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED notification in the
   corresponding response message.  After receiving the response
   message, the initiator can also know the support of this extension of
   the responder side.

   The IKE_AUTH message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                         Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
       [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
       N(MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED)} -->
                                 <-- HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                         SAr2, TSi, TSr,
                                         N(MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED)}

   If the responder doesn't support this extension, it MUST ignore the
   MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED notification sent by the initiator and MUST
   NOT respond error to the initiator.  With no MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED
   notification in the response message, the initiator can deduce that
   the responder doesn't support this extension.  In this case, the IKE
   SAs and Child SAs rekeyings happen as the usual way without the
   optimizations defined in this document.

   The IKE_AUTH message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                         Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
       [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
       N(MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED)} -->
                                 <-- HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                         SAr2, TSi, TSr}

3.2.  Payload Optimization at Rekeying IKE SAs

   The payload optimization at rekeying IKE SAs MUST NOT be used unless
   both peers have indicated their support of this extension by using
   the negotiation method described in Section 3.1.

Internet-Draft     IKEv2 Optional Child SA&TS Payloads         July 2021


   At the time of rekeying an IKE SA, when the initiator determines
   there is no change on its cryptographic suites since this IKE SA was
   created or last rekeyed, it MUST send the REKEY_OPTIMIZED
   notification payload instead of the SA payloads in the rekeying
   request message.  In this REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification, it contains
   the initiator's new Security Parameter Index (SPI) used for creating
   the new IKE SA.

   After receiving the initiator's rekeying request message with the
   REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification and no SA payloads, the responder knows
   that the initiator wants to optimize the rekeying payload.  Then when
   it determines that there is also no change in its cryptographic
   suites, the responder MUST send the rekeying respond message to the
   initiator with the REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload instead of
   the SA payloads.  In this REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification, it contains
   the responder's new SPI used for creating the new IKE SA.

   According to the initiator's new SPI and the responder's new SPI, the
   initiator and the responder can rekey the IKE SA on both sides.

   The CREATE_CHILD_SA message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                         Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {N(REKEY_OPTIMIZED),
       Ni, KEi} -->
                                 <-- HDR, SK {N(REKEY_OPTIMIZED),
                                         Nr, KEr}

   The initiator sends a REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload, a Nonce
   payload and a Diffie-Hellman value in the KEi payload.  A new
   initiator SPI is supplied in the SPI field of the REKEY_OPTIMIZED
   notification payload.  These messages also follow the original
   Perfect Forwarding Secrecy (PFS) with the signature and encryption
   algorithms used as last message.

   The responder replies (using the same Message ID to respond) with a
   REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload, a Nonce payload and a Diffie-
   Hellman value in the KEr payload.  A new responder SPI is supplied in
   the SPI field of the REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload.

   This REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification MUST be included in a
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange message when there is no SA payloads
   included.  When the REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload is included,
   the SA payload MUST NOT be included.

3.3.  Payload Optimization at Rekeying Child SAs

   The payload optimization at rekeying Child SAs MUST NOT be used
   unless both peers have indicated their support of this extension by
   using the negotiation method described in Section 3.1.

   At the time of rekeying a Child SA, when the initiator determines
   there is no change in its cryptographic suites and ACL configuration
   since this Child SA was created or last rekeyed, it MUST send the
   REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload instead of the SA and TS
   payloads in the rekeying request message.  In this REKEY_OPTIMIZED
   notification, it contains the initiator's new Security Parameter
   Index (SPI) used for creating the new Child SA.

   After receiving the initiator's rekeying request message with the
   REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification and no SA and TS payloads, the responder
   knows that the initiator wants to optimize the rekeying payload.
   Then when it determines that there is also no change in its
   cryptographic suites and ACL configuration, the responder MUST send
   the rekeying respond message to the initiator with the
   REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification payload instead of the SA and TS
   payloads.  In this REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification, it contains the
   responder's new SPI used for creating the new Child SA.

   According to the old SPIs included in the REKEY_SA payloads and the
   new SPIs included in the REKEY_OPTIMIZED payloads, the initiator and
   the responder can rekey the Child SA on both sides.

   The CREATE_CHILD_SA message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                         Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {N(REKEY_SA), N(REKEY_OPTIMIZED),
       Ni, [KEi,]} -->
                                 <-- HDR, SK {N(REKEY_OPTIMIZED),
                                         Nr, [KEr,]}

   This REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification MUST be included in a
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange message when there is no SA and TS payloads
   included at the time of rekeying Child SAs.  When the REKEY_OPTIMIZED
   notification payload is included, the SA and TS payloads MUST NOT be
   included.

Internet-Draft     IKEv2 Optional Child SA&TS Payloads         July 2021


4.1.  MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED Notification

   The MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED notification is used by the initiator and
   responder to inform their ability of optimizing payloads at the time
   of rekeying IKE SAs and Child SAs to the peers.  It is formatted as
   follows:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Next Payload  |C|  RESERVED   |         Payload Length        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Protocol ID(=0)| SPI Size (=0) |      Notify Message Type      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 0.

   o  SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 0, meaning no SPI is present.

   o  Notify Message Type (2 octets) - MUST be <Need to get value from
      IANA>, the value assigned for the MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED
      notification.

   This notification contains no data.

4.2.  REKEY_OPTIMIZED Notification

   The REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification is used to replace the SA payloads
   at the time of rekeying IKE SAs when there is no change of
   cryptographic suites in initiator and responder, and to replace the
   SA payloads and TS payloads at the time of rekeying Child SAs when
   there is no change of cryptographic suites and ACL configuration in
   initiator and responder.  It is formatted as follows:

    0                 1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Next Payload  |C|  RESERVED   |         Payload Length        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Protocol ID    | SPI Size (=8) |      Notify Message Type      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                Security Parameter Index (SPI)                 |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 1.

   o  SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 8 when used at the time of rekeying
      IKE SAs and be 4 when used at the time of rekeying Child SAs.

   o  Notify Message Type (2 octets) - MUST be <Need to get value from
      IANA>, the value assigned for the REKEY_OPTIMIZED notification.

   o  SPI (4 octets or 8 octets) - Security Parameter Index.  The
      initiator sends initiator SPI.  The responder sends responder SPI.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new Notify Message Types in the "IKEv2
   Notify Message Types - Status Types" registry.  IANA is requested to
   assign codepoints in this registry.

   NOTIFY messages: status types            Value
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   MINIMAL_REKEY_SUPPORTED                  TBD
   REKEY_OPTIMIZED                          TBD

6.  Security Considerations

   When using the payload optimization defined in this document, the
   rekeying of IKE SAs and Child SAs are using the same cryptographic
   suites.  If changes to the configurations are wanted, such as
   supporting a new cryptographic algorithm, the rekeying won't apply
   these changes.  The initiator or responder should start a new IKE SA
   or Child SA to apply the new changes.
