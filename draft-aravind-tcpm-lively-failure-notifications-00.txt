1  Introduction

   Whenever any link fails resulting in the loss of TCP connections, it
   takes longer time periods to detect it. In Datacenters, the failures
   include all the network links throughout the datacenters and also the
   connections between the TORs (Top of the Rack Switches) and Servers.
   The propagation of failure information currently takes longer periods
   thereby leading to wastage of kernel resources for invalid/failed TCP
   sessions.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Solution

   1. The Network devices connected to the Servers can snoop the TCP SYN
   packets and can get the info of list of TCP connections established
   at the server.

   2. Then, the Network Devices can monitor those destination subnets
   (IP address subnets) on which the TCP connections are made.

   3. In case of network failures (if any of those subnets become
   unreachable), the routing protocols would determine those scenarios

   and update the Device's IP table.

   4. A Defined Timer could be used to track the failed subnets. As soon
   as the Network device detects the monitored subnet going down, a
   timer could be started and on the timer expiry, it can send a TCP RST
   message to the Servers connected to it so that they can tear down the
   corresponding sessions. If the connectivity to subnet comes up again
   within defined time-period, the operation of sending TCP-RST could be
   aborted. Further, the use of timer assists to avoid false alarms
   created during link flaps in case of directly connected subnets.

   The proposed approach is pro-active, i.e., TCP RST Messages are sent
   without waiting for any packet corresponding to the failed session to
   be received.


3  Useful Scenarios

   With the increased usage of persistent connections with HTTP/1.1 [RFC
   7230, RFC 7231, RFC 7232, RFC 7233, RFC 7234, RFC 7235] and SIP [RFC
   5923], it is possible for a number of established connections to be
   present at any given point of time. This leads to possibility of
   overloading Server with a number of open connections and may even
   lead to failure to open new connections. Hence, this proposal helps
   to close the connections quickly for which network connectivities are
   lost and thereby reduce the load on Server and assist in increasing
   the scalability.


4  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security concerns or any
   other specifications referenced in this document.


5  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions required.
