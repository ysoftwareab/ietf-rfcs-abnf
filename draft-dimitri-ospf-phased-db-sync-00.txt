    Abstract 

       Opaque Link-State Advertisements (LSA) extend the topological 
       link state of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). The information 
       contained in Opaque LSA may be used directly by OSPF or 
       indirectly by some application wishing to distribute information 
       throughout the OSPF domain. However the Link-State Database 
       (LSDB) synchronization process is kept unified, i.e., there is  
       no messaging or processing allowing to order the exchanges in 
       the link state database synchronization process. We call this 
       ordering, phasing of logically segmented LSDB into Opaque and 
       non-Opaque. The motivation is to prevent delaying reaching Full 
       state whereas synchronizing over the entire LSDB would delay 
       full adjacency establishment.

    1. Introduction 

       Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) link-state routing protocol 
       supports a class of Link-State Advertisements (LSA) called Opaque 
       LSAs that provide a generalized mechanism to allow extensibility 
       of OSPF [RFC2328]. The information field contained in Opaque LSAs 
       is often indirectly used by some application wishing to 
       distribute information throughout the OSPF domain. Standard OSPF 
       Link-State Database (LSDB) flooding mechanisms are used to 
       distribute Opaque LSAs to all or some limited portion of the OSPF 
       topology [RFC2370]. Nevertheless, OSPF mandates full 
       synchronization of the LSDB before a routing adjacency is 
       declared in state Full (when LSDB synchronization is completed, 
       the neighbor is in state Full and the two routers are fully 
       adjacent).  

       The reliable and effective LSDB synchronization but also link-
       state flooding mechanism provided by OSPF has thus been re-used 
       by many distributed network applications that rely on OSPF to 
       exchange non IP routing information. By non-IP routing 
       information, we mean any information that is not directly or 
       indirectly related to the forwarding of IP datagrams. Another 
       case that often leads to a delayed synchronization process is 
       when the number of entries is not bound by the number of links. 
       This observation also leads us to think that AS-external LSAs in 
       particular are good candidate for the approach proposed here and 
       the mechanism can thus be seen as a complement to [RFC1765].  

       The proposed mechanism phases the LSDB synchronization process by 
       first exchanging IP routing LSAs (Router, Network, Summary, AS-
       external, and Not-so-stubby area LSAs) and then, the Opaque LSAs 
       as defined in [RFC2370]. The purpose is to prevent delaying the 
       establishment of fully adjacent routers - at this point the 
       adjacency is listed in LSAs - even if the "Opaque part" of the 
       LSDB is not synchronized. We note here that in most cases the 
       application itself makes use of the IP adjacencies for 
       application specific message exchanges and thus the applications 
       would not be slow down by this process. In this sense, the 
       present document reverts back to [RFC2328] the LSDB 
       synchronization process as extended by [RFC2370] (that covers 
       LSDB including both non-Opaque and Opaque LSAs). Phasing is 
       achieved by logically segmenting the LSDB synchronization 
       process: add "on top of" the LSDB synchronization process

       described in [RFC2328], a synchronization process dedicated to 
       Opaque LSAs. This phasing prevents delaying establishment of full 
       adjacency between two routers (Full state) resulting from the 
       time needed to synchronize Opaque LSAs. This condition occurs in 
       particular when the number of Opaque LSAs >> non-Opaque LSAs. The 
       fundamental aspect of the proposed approach consists thus of 
       considering the state Full as the invariant state for reaching 
       full adjacency.    

       The purpose of the proposed Opaque LSDB Synchronization process 
       is to devise a less drastic alternative to the current approach 
       developed at OSPF WG that mandates complete separation of OSPF 
       instances when Opaque LSA are decoupled from IP Routing [OSPF-
       TP]. The latter does not actually solve the so-called "Opaque 
       overload" problem because it separates IP-related from non-IP 
       related routing information instead of Opaque from non-Opaque 
       LSAs. The proposed approach here is to avoid duplicating OSPF 
       instances while keeping Opaque LSA messaging and processing as 
       part of a single OSPF instance.

    3. Link-State Database (LSDB) Synchronization  

    3.1. LSDB Synchronization: General Description 

       In link-state routing, it is very important for all routers' 
       Link-State Databases (LSDB) to stay synchronized. OSPF simplifies 
       this by requiring only adjacent routers to remain synchronized. 
       The synchronization process begins as soon as the routers attempt 
       to bring up the routing adjacency.  

       Each router describes its database by sending a sequence of 
       Database Description (DD) packets to its neighbor. Each Database 
       Description packet describes a set of LSAs belonging to the 
       router's database. When the neighbor sees an LSA that is more 
       recent than its own database copy, it makes a note that this 
       newer LSA should be requested. This sending and receiving of 
       Database Description packets is called the "Database Exchange 
     
     
    D.Papadimitriou       Expires November 23, 2010            [Page 4] 
    

    Internet-Draft  Phased OSPF Database Synchronization   May 23, 2010 
        

       Process". During this process, the two routers form a 
       master/slave relationship. Each Database Description packet has a 
       sequence number. Database Description packets sent by the master 
       (polls) are acknowledged by the slave through echoing of the 
       sequence number. Both polls and their responses contain summaries 
       of link state data. The master is the only one allowed to 
       retransmit Database Description packets. It does so only at fixed 
       intervals, the length of which is the configured per-interface 
       constant RxmtInterval. 

    3.2. Application of LSDB Synchronization to Opaque LSA 

       Per [RFC2370]: an opaque-capable router learns of its neighbor's 
       opaque capability at the beginning of the "Database Exchange 
       Process" (see Section 10.6 of [RFC2328], receiving Database 
       Description packets from a neighbor in state ExStart). A neighbor 
       is opaque-capable if and only if it sets the O-bit in the Options 
       field of its Database Description packets; the O-bit is not set 
       in packets other than Database Description packets. Then, in the 
       next step of the Database Exchange process, Opaque LSAs are 
       included in the Database summary list that is sent to the 
       neighbor if and only if the neighbor is opaque capable. When 
       flooding Opaque LSAs to adjacent neighbors, an opaque-capable 
       router looks at the neighbor's opaque capability. Opaque LSAs are 
       only flooded to opaque-capable neighbors, i.e., Opaque LSAs are 
       only placed on the link-state retransmission lists of opaque-
       capable neighbors. In case non-opaque-capable neighbor 
       inadvertently receives Opaque LSAs, the non-opaque- capable 
       router will then simply discard the LSA receiving LSAs having 
       unknown LS types).  

       Hence, [RFC2370] does not modify the state machine as defined in 
       Section 10.3 of [RFC2328] except for the action associated with 
       State: ExStart, Event: NegotiationDone which is where the 
       Database summary list is built in order to incorporate the Opaque 
       LSA in OSPF (see Figure 1). 
 
    4. Phased Link-State Database (LSDB) Synchronization  

       Compared to the [RFC2370] processing, the Phase Link-State 
       Database (LSDB) synchronization modifies the LSDB exchange 
       process as follows: Opaque LSAs are included in the LSDB summary 
       list that is sent to the neighbor, if and only if  

       i) The neighbor is Opaque capable (see Section 4 and Appendix A 
       of [RFC2370])

       State, the router can perform all subsequent operations per [RFC 
       2328] including, the computation of the shortest-path tree for an 
       area, and the computation of the AS external routes, as described 
       in Section 16 of [RFC2328]. Events NegotiationDone, ExchangeDone 
       and LoadingDone are used as defined per [RFC2328].

    4.2. Transition from LSDB to Opaque LSDB Synchronization 

         In case Full state is not reached due to e.g. corruption or 
         Fletcher checksum error, the exchange process restarts (go back 
         to ExStart).  

         In case Full state is reached, the process continues as follows 
         (note that the master remains the master as negotiated during 
         the ExStart step): 

             - Start_O (Event): LSDB contain Opaque_LSA's AND capability            
             as described in Section 4.3 successfully negotiated. This 
             ensures backward compatibility with [RFC2370]. 

             - NExchange_O (State): the router lists the contents of its 
             Opaque area LSDB in the neighbor Database summary list. The 
             Opaque area LSDB consists of Type 9 and Type 10 Opaque LSAs 
             along with Type 11 Opaque LSAs contained in the global 
             structure. The router sends the Database Description (DD) 
             packets for these Opaque LSAs to the neighbor. Each DD 
             Packet has a DD sequence number, and is explicitly 
             acknowledged. Only one DD Packet is allowed outstanding at 
             any one time. In this state, LS Request Packets may also be 
             sent asking for the neighbor's more recent Opaque LSAs.   

             - NExchangeDone_O (Event): both routers have successfully 
             transmitted a full sequence of DD packets. Each router now 
             knows what parts of its Opaque LSDB are out of date.  

             - Loading_O (State): LS Request packets are sent to the 
             neighbor asking for the more recent Opaque LSAs that have 
             been discovered (but not yet received) in the NExchange_O 
             state. 

             - LoadingDone_O (Event): LS Updates have been received for 
             all out-of-date portions of the Opaque LSDB. This is 
             indicated by the Link state request list becoming empty 
             after the Database Exchange process has completed. 

             - Full_O (State): neighboring nodes have completed Opaque 
             LSA exchange.  

    4.3. Capability Negotiation 

       Negotiating Phased LSDB synchronization can be performed by 
       inserting a Phased LSDB Flag in:

       i) Option field of Hello Packets and DD Packets 

       ii) Data block of Link Local Signaling (LLS) and DD Packets 

    4.3.1. Option field in Hello Packets 

       The Options field (8-bits) enables OSPF routers to support (or 
       not support) optional capabilities, and to communicate their 
       capability level to other OSPF routers. Through this mechanism 
       routers of differing capabilities can be mixed within an OSPF 
       routing domain. When used in Hello packets, the Options field 
       allows a router to accept a neighbor at the condition of 
       adaptation to neighbors's capability (due to the initial 
       mismatch): if either of the neighbors does not support or does 
       not recognize the capability the synchronization is not phased. 
       In this case, routers encountering the unrecognized Option bits 
       in received Hello Packets ignore the capability and process the 
       packet normally.    

       Then, by exchanging this capability in Database Description (DD) 
       packets a router can sequence its exchange of LSAs (starting by 
       non-Opaque LSAs and then Opaque LSAs): if both neighbors are 
       capable of phased synchronization, they may still decide to use 
       or not. 

       This alternative is perfectly valid but requires usage of one bit 
       of the Option field that is a very sparse resource. 

    4.3.2. Link Local Signaling (LLS) 

       To Link-local signaling (LLS), OSPF routers add a special data 
       block to the end of OSPF packets (or right after the 
       authentication data block when cryptographic authentication is 
       used). The LLS block is attached to OSPF Hello packets. The 
       drawback of this alternative is that the delivery of LLS data in 
       Hello packets is not guaranteed.  

       To circumvent this problem, the solution consists in piggy 
       bagging the Phased DB Flag in the Database Description packets.    

    5. Backward Compatibility 

       The proposed synchronization process is backward compatible since 
       the mechanism extends the current process if and only if the 
       mechanism is locally (see Section 4.2) and remotely supported 
       (see Section 4.3). If either of these conditions is not met LSDB 
       synchronization falls back to the linear process currently

       specific per [RFC2370]. Note also that the proposed mechanism 
       does not modify the LSDB process as specified in [RFC2328]. 
       However, it does not prevent that routers may be required to 
       support both methods. This could be the case typically for ABR's.
