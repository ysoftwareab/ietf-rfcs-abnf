Authorizing Mobile IPv6 Binding Update with Cryptographically Generated

Abstract

   The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
   sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair
   of unidirectional IPsec security associations between these two
   nodes.  The standard mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
   sent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent Nodes relies on the
   use of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent Node
   verifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Address
   and its Care-of Address.  The mechanism also requires the
   correspondent node to send keying material to both of these
   addresses.

   RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a Mobile
   Node that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address (RFC
   3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent
   its Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses have also been used to counter similar security
   issues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (RFC 3971.)

   This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use a
   similar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent to
   its Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use of
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.

1.  Introduction

   The standard RFC 3775 [RFC3775] mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6
   Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the
   use of a pair of unidirectional IPsec security associations between
   these two nodes [RFC4877].  The standard mechanism to secure Mobile
   IPv6 Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to one of its
   Correspondent Nodes relies on the use of a return routability test
   that involves the Correspondent Node verifying reachability of the
   Mobile Node at both its Home Address and its Care-of Address.  The
   mechanism also requires the correspondent node to send keying
   material to both of these addresses.

   RFC 4866 [RFC4866] specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a
   Mobile Node that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address
   [RFC3972] as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
   sent its Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses have also been used to counter similar security
   issues in the context of SHIM6 [RFC5533] and Secure Neighbor
   Discovery [RFC3971].

   This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use a
   similar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent to
   its Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use of
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.

5.  Usage Scenario

   The mechanism described herein is useful in situations where there is
   a desire not to depend on IPsec for protection of the Mobile IPv6
   signaling between the Mobile Node and the Home Agent.

6.  Mobile Node Operation

   A Mobile Node sends a Binding Update message to its Home Agent when
   any of the following applies:

   o  It is needs to establish a new binding because it is away from the
      home link and first attaches to a foreign link.

   o  It attaches to a different foreign link and needs to update the
      binding with its new care-of address.

   o  It needs to refresh a binding because it is about to expire.

   o  It needs to acquire a new permanent home keygen token for the
      binding, either because it does not have one yet, or because the
      current permanent home keygen token is going to become unusable
      due to the sequence number being about to roll over since the
      token was acquired.

   o  It needs to deregister an existing binding.

   In any of these cases, the Mobile Node sends a Binding Update message
   to the home agent.  The Binding Update message is authenticated by
   one of the following two authentication methods:

   o  If the Mobile Node does not have a usable permanent home keygen
      token in its Binding Update List entry for the home agent, the
      mobile node MUST authenticate the Binding Update message based on
      the CGA property of its home address.  The Binding Update message
      MUST omit the Binding Authorization Data option and MUST include
      the following options:

      *  a CGA Parameters option for the Cryptographically Generated
         Home Address of the Mobile Node as per [RFC4866].

      *  a Timestamp option as per [RFC5213].

      *  a Signature option as per [RFC4866].

   o  If the Mobile Node has a usable permanent home keygen token in its
      Binding Update List entry for the home agent, the mobile node MUST
      authenticate the Binding Update message by a proof of its
      knowledge of the permanent home keygen token.  The Binding Update
      message MUST omit the CGA Parameters, Timestamp, and Signature
      options and MUST include the following option:

      *  a Binding Authorization Data option whose authenticator for the
         Binding Update message is calculated based on the permanent

         home keygen token alone.  The care-of keygen token is set to
         zero while calculating the authenticator.

7.  Home Agent Operation

   A Home Agent MUST accept a Binding Update message from a Mobile Node
   and maintain accordingly the corresponding Binding Cache Entry if the
   Binding Update message can be authenticated as follows:

   o  If the Binding Update message does not contain a Binding
      Authorization Data option, the Mobile Node does not have a usable
      permanent home keygen token in its Binding Update List entry for
      the home agent, and the Home AGent MUST authenticate the Binding
      Update message based on the CGA property of the Mobile Node home
      address.  The Binding Update message MUST include the following
      options:

      *  a CGA Parameters option for the Cryptographically Generated
         Home Address of the Mobile Node as per [RFC4866].

      *  a valid Timestamp option as per [RFC5213].  That is, if there
         is no existing Binding Cache Entry, the time offset between the
         Timestamp and local Home Agent clock is recorded in the Binding
         Cache Entry.  If there exists a Binding Cache Entry, the
         Timestamp MUST not differ from the local Home Agent clock for
         more than 1.5 times the time offset recorded in the Binding
         Cache Entry.

      *  a valid Signature option as per [RFC4866].

   o  If the Binding Update message contains a Binding Authorization
      Data option, the Mobile Node has a usable permanent home keygen
      token in its Binding Update List entry for the home agent, and the
      Home Agend MUST authenticate the Binding Update message by proof
      of the Mobile Node's knowledge of the permanent home keygen token
      by verifying that the authenticator in the Binding Authorization
      Data option is calculated based on the permanent home keygen token
      with the care-of keygen token set to zero.

   If the Binding Update message has been authenticated based on the CGA
   property of the Mobile Node home address, the Home Agent MUST include
   a new permanent Home Keygen Token in the Binding Acknowledgment.

8.  IPv4 Support

   This mechanism can be used when the Mobile Node is attached to an
   IPv4-only foreign link by leveraging on [I-D.ebalard-mext-m6t].  IPv4
   applications can be supported via assigning an IPv4 Home Address as
   described in [RFC5555].
