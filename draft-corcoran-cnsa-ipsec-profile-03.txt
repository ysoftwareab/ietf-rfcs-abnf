  Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite Cryptography for
                   Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
                  draft-corcoran-cnsa-ipsec-profile-03

Abstract

   The United States Government has published the NSA Commercial
   National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic
   algorithm policy for national security applications.  This document
   specifies the conventions for using the United States National
   Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms in Internet Protocol
   Security.  It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and
   operation of all components of US National Security Systems that
   employ IPSec.  US National Security Systems are described in NIST
   Special Publication 800-59.  It is also appropriate for all other US
   Government systems that process high-value information.  It is made
   publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and
   any other system deployments.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies conventions for using the United States
   National Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms [CNSA] in Internet
   Protocol Security (IPSec).  It defines CNSA-based user interface
   suites ("UI suites") describing sets of security configurations for
   Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) and IP Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) protocol use.  It applies to the capabilities,
   configuration, and operation of all components of US National
   Security Systems that employ IPSec.  US National Security Systems are
   described in NIST Special Publication 800-59 [SP80059].  It is also
   appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-
   value information.  It is made publicly available for use by
   developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   AES refers to the Advanced Encryption Standard.  ECDSA and ECDH refer
   to the use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
   and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), respectively.  DH refers to
   Diffie-Hellman key establishment.  RSA refers to RSA signature.

3.  The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite

   The National Security Agency (NSA) profiles commercial cryptographic
   algorithms and protocols as part of its mission to support secure,
   interoperable communications for US Government National Security
   Systems.  To this end, it publishes guidance both to assist with the
   US Government transition to new algorithms, and to provide vendors -
   and the Internet community in general - with information concerning
   their proper use and configuration.

   Recently, cryptographic transition plans have become overshadowed by
   the prospect of the development of a cryptographically-relevant
   quantum computer.  NSA has established the Commercial National
   Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite to provide vendors and IT users near-
   term flexibility in meeting their IA interoperability requirements.
   The purpose behind this flexibility is to avoid vendors and customers
   making two major transitions in a relatively short timeframe, as we
   anticipate a need to shift to quantum-resistant cryptography in the
   near future.

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


   NSA is authoring a set of RFCs, including this one, to provide
   updated guidance concerning the use of certain commonly available
   commercial algorithms in IETF protocols.  These RFCs can be used in
   conjunction with other RFCs and cryptographic guidance (e.g., NIST
   Special Publications) to properly protect Internet traffic and data-
   at-rest for US Government National Security Systems.

4.  CNSA Compliant IPSec Overview

   CNSA compliant implementations for IPsec MUST use IKEv2 [RFC7296].

   Implementing a CNSA compliant IPSec system requires cryptographic
   algorithm selection for both the IKEv2 and ESP protocols.  The
   following CNSA requirements apply to IPSec:

      Encryption:
         AES [FIPS197] (with key size 256 bits)

      Digital Signature:
         ECDSA [FIPS186] (using the NIST P-384 elliptic curve)
         RSA [FIPS186] (with a modulus of 3072 bits or larger)

      Key Establishment:
         ECDH [SP80056A] (using the NIST P-384 elliptic curve)
         DH [RFC3526] (with a prime modulus of 3072 or larger)

   To facilitate selection of appropriate combinations of compliant
   algorithms, this document provides CNSA compliant user interface
   suites (UI Suites) [RFC4308] to implement IPSec on NSS.

   The approved CNSA hash function for all purposes is SHA-384, as
   defined in [FIPS180].  However, SHA-512 is recommended for PRF
   instead of SHA-384 due to availability.  See Section 8 below.

   For CNSA Suite applications, public key certificates MUST be
   compliant with the CNSA Suite Certificate and CRL Profile specified
   in [RFC8603].

   Under certain conditions, such as applications having long-lived data
   protection requirements, systems that do not comply with the
   requirements of this document are acceptable; see Section 12.

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


5.  IPSec User Interface Suites

   User Interface (UI) suites are named suites that cover some typical
   security policy options for IPsec.  [RFC4308] Use of UI suites does
   not change the IPsec protocol in any way.  The following UI suites
   provide cryptographic algorithm choices for ESP [RFC4303] and for
   Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) [RFC7296].  The selection of a UI Suite
   will depend on the key exchange algorithm.  The suite names indicate
   the Advanced Encryption Standard [FIPS197] mode, AES key length
   specified for encryption, and the key exchange algorithm.

   Although RSA is also a CNSA approved key establishment algorithm, in
   IPSec with IKEv2 only DH or ECDH are implemented for key exchange.
   [RFC7296] RSA in IPSec is used only for digital signatures.  See
   Section 6.

   ESP requires negotiation of both a confidentiality algorithm and an
   integrity algorithm.  However, authenticated encryption (AEAD)
   algorithms do not require a separate integrity algorithm to be
   negotiated.  [RFC5116] In particular, since AES-GCM is an AEAD
   algorithm, ESP implementing AES-GCM MUST indicate the integrity
   algorithm NONE.  [RFC7296]

   To be CNSA compliant, IPsec implementations that use the following UI
   suites MUST use the suite names listed below.  IPsec implementations
   SHOULD NOT use names different than those listed here for the suites
   that are described, and MUST NOT use the names listed here for suites
   that do not match these values.  These requirements are necessary for
   interoperability.

   Transform names are as listed in the IANA registry for Internet Key
   Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Parameters.  Definitions of the transforms
   are contained in the references specified in that registry.

   Other UI suites may be acceptable for CNSA compliance.  See Section 8
   for details.

5.1.  Suite CNSA-GCM-256-ECDH-384

      ESP SA:
         Encryption: ENCR_AES_GCM_16
         Integrity: NONE
      IKEv2 SA:
         Encryption: ENCR_AES_GCM_16
         PRF: PRF_HMAC_SHA2_512
         Integrity: NONE
         Diffie-Hellman group: 384-bit random ECP group

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


5.2.  Suite CNSA-GCM-256-DH-3072

      ESP SA:
         Encryption: ENCR_AES_GCM_16
         Integrity: NONE
      IKEv2 SA:
         Encryption: ENCR_AES_GCM_16
         PRF: PRF_HMAC_SHA2_512
         Integrity: NONE
         Diffie-Hellman group: 3072-bit MODP Group

5.3.  Suite CNSA-GCM-256-DH-4096

      ESP SA:
         Encryption: ENCR_AES_GCM_16
         Integrity: NONE
      IKEv2 SA:
         Encryption: ENCR_AES_GCM_16
         PRF: PRF_HMAC_SHA2_512
         Integrity: NONE
         Diffie-Hellman group: 4096-bit MODP Group

6.  IKEv2 Authentication

   Authentication of the IKEv2 Security Association (SA) requires
   computation of a digital signature.  To be CNSA compliant, digital
   signatures MUST be generated with either ECDSA-384 as defined in
   [RFC4754] or RSA with 3072-bit or greater modulus and SHA-384 as
   defined in [RFC8017].

   Initiators and responders MUST be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures
   and MUST be able to verify RSA with 3072-bit or 4096-bit modulus and
   SHA-384 signatures.

   For CNSA compliant systems, authentication methods other than
   ECDSA-384 or RSA MUST NOT be accepted for IKEv2 authentication.  A
   3072-bit modulus or larger MUST be used for RSA.  If the relying
   party receives a message signed with any authentication method other
   than ECDSA-384 or RSA signature it MUST return an
   AUTHENTICATION_FAILED notification and stop processing the message.
   If the relying party receives a message signed with RSA using less
   than a 3072-bit modulus, it MUST return an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
   notification and stop processing the message.

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


7.  Certificates

   To be CNSA compliant, the initiator and responder MUST use X.509
   certificates that comply with [RFC8603].  The identity authentication
   method MUST use an end-entity certificate provided by the
   authenticating party and MUST NOT use the Identification Payload for
   policy lookup.

8.  IKEv2 Security Associations (SA)

   Section 5 specifies three UI suites for ESP and IKEv2 Security
   Associations.  All three use AES-GCM for encryption but differ in the
   key exchange algorithm.  Galois Counter Mode (GCM) combines counter
   (CTR) mode with a secure, parallelizable, and efficient
   authentication mechanism.  [RFC4106] Since AES-GCM is an AEAD
   algorithm, ESP implements AES-GCM with no additional integrity
   algorithm.  [RFC7296]

   An initiator SHOULD offer one or more of the following suites:

      CNSA-GCM-256-ECDH-384,
      CNSA-GCM-256-DH-3072,
      CNSA-GCM-256-DH-4096.

   A responder SHOULD support at least one of the three named suites.

   Nonce construction for AES-GCM using a misuse-resistant technique
   [RFC8452] conforms with the requirements of this document and MAY be
   used if a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) validated
   implementation is available.

   The named UI suites use SHA-512 for PRF since SHA-384 is not listed
   among required PRF or integrity algorithms in [RFC8247], the security
   level is comparable, and the difference in performance is negligible.
   However, SHA-384 is the official CNSA algorithm for computing a
   condensed representation of information.  Therefore, SHA-384
   implementations for PRF or integrity MAY be used.  Any algorithm
   other than SHA-384 or SHA-512 MAY NOT be used for PRF or integrity.

   If none of the suites offered by the initiator consist solely of CNSA
   algorithms or the named UI Suites, the responder MUST return a Notify
   payload with the error NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN when operating in CNSA
   compliant mode.

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


9.  The Key Exchange Payload in the IKE_SA_INIT Exchange

   The key exchange payload is used to exchange Diffie-Hellman public
   numbers as part of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  The CNSA compliant
   initiator and responder MUST each generate an ephemeral key pair to
   be used in the key exchange.

   If the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange is selected
   for the SA, the initiator and responder both MUST generate an
   elliptic curve (EC) key pair using the P-384 elliptic curve.  The
   ephemeral public keys MUST be stored in the key exchange payload as
   in [RFC7296].

   If the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange is selected for the SA, the
   initiator and responder both MUST generate a key pair using the
   appropriately sized MODP group as described in [RFC3526].  The size
   of the MODP group will be determined by the selection of either a
   3072-bit or greater modulus for the SA.

10.  Generating Key Material for the IKE SA

   The ECDH shared secret established during the key exchange consists
   of the x value of the ECDH common value [RFC5903].  Because the P-384
   elliptic curve is used, the x value is 384 bits.

   IKEv2 [RFC7296] allows for the reuse of Diffie-Hellman exponentials
   (i.e. private keys).  However, there are security concerns related to
   this practice.  Section 5.6.3.3 of [SP80056A] states that an
   ephemeral private key MUST be used in exactly one key establishment
   transaction and MUST be destroyed (zeroized) as soon as possible.
   Section 5.8 of [SP80056A] states that a Diffie-Hellman shared secret
   must be destroyed (zeroized) immediately after its use.  CNSA
   compliant IPSec systems MUST follow the mandates in [SP80056A].

11.  Additional Requirements

   The IPSec protocol AH MUST NOT be used in CNSA compliant
   implementations.

   ESP does not explicitly include a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
   [RFC8221] However, a Diffie-Hellman group MAY be negotiated for the
   Child SA allowing peers to employ Diffie-Hellman in the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.  [RFC7296] If a transform of type 4 is
   specified for an SA for ESP, the value of the transform MUST match
   that of the transform used by the IKEv2 SA.

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


   Per [RFC7296], if a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange includes a KEi payload,
   at least one of the SA offers MUST include the Diffie-Hellman group
   of the KEi.  For CNSA compliant IPSec compliant implementations, the
   Diffie-Hellman group of the KEi MUST use the same group used in the
   IKE_INIT_SA.

   For IKEv2, rekeying of the CREATE_CHILD_SA MUST be supported by both
   parties.  The initiator of this exchange MAY include a new Diffie-
   Hellman key; if it is included, it MUST use the same group used in
   the IKE_INIT_SA.  If the initiator of the exchange includes a Diffie-
   Hellman key, the responder MUST include a Diffie-Hellman key, and it
   MUST use the same group.

   For CNSA compliant systems, the IKEv2 authentication method MUST use
   an end-entity certificate provided by the authenticating party.
   Identification Payloads (Idi and IDr) in the IKE_AUTH exchanges MUST
   not be used for the IKEv2 authentication method , but may be used for
   policy lookup.

   The administrative user interface (UI) for a system that conforms to
   this profile MUST allow the operator to specify a single suite.  If
   only one suite is specified in the administrative UI, the IKEv2
   implementation MUST only offer algorithms for that one suite.

   The administrative UI MAY allow the operator to specify more than one
   suite; if it allows this, it MUST allow the operator to specify a
   preferred order for the suites that are to be offered or accepted.
   If more than one suite is specified in the administrative UI, the
   IKEv2 implementation MUST only offer algorithms of those suites.

12.  Guidance for Applications With Long Data-Protection Requirements

   The CNSA mandate is to continue to use current algorithms with
   increased security parameters, then transition to approved post-
   quantum resilient algorithms when they are identified.  However, some
   applications have data-in-transit-protection requirements that are
   long enough that post-quantum resilient protection must be provided
   now.  Lacking approved asymmetric post-quantum resilient
   confidentiality algorithms, that means approved symmetric techniques
   must be used as described in this section until approved post-quantum
   resilient asymmetric algorithms are identified.

Internet-Draft          CNSA Suite IPSec Profile           December 2021


   For new applications, confidentiality and integrity requirements from
   the sections above MUST be followed, with the addition of a PSK mixed
   in as defined in [RFC8784].  Installations currently using IKEv1 with
   PSK MUST use AES in cipher block chaining mode (AES-CBC) in
   conjunction with a CNSA compliant integrity algorithm, and transition
   to IKEv2 with PSK [RFC8784] as soon as implementations become
   available.

   For all applications to which this section applies, PSK
   authentication MUST be performed using HMAC-SHA-384 [RFC4868].

   Specific guidance for systems not compliant with the requirements of
   this document, including non-GCM modes and PSK randomness, will be
   defined in solution specific requirements appropriate to the
   application.  Details of those requirements will depend on the
   program under which the commercial NSS solution is developed (e.g.
   Commercial Solutions for Classified Capability Package).

13.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits all of the security considerations of the
   IPsec and IKEv2 documents, including [RFC7296], [RFC4303], [RFC4754],
   and [RFC8221].

   The security of a system that uses cryptography depends on both the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of
   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on
   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system
   to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the
   security of the overall system.

   When selecting a mode for the AES encryption, be aware that nonce
   reuse can result in a loss of confidentiality.  [RFC5116] Nonce reuse
   is catastrophic for GCM since it also results in a loss of integrity.

14.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to amend the registry titled "Cryptographic Suites for
   IKEv1, IKEv2, and IPsec" located at https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   crypto-suites as described in this section.  The registry consists of
   a text string and an RFC number that lists the associated transforms.
   The UI suites defined in this document are listed, with this document
   as the RFC reference.
