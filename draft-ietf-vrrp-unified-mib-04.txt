Abstract

   This specification defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for
   use with SNMP-based network management.  In particular, it defines
   objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that
   employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for both IPv4 and IPv6
   as defined in RFC 3768 and RFC xxxx ( RFC-editor, this is currently
   draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-07.txt).  This memo obsoletes RFC 2787.

1. Introduction

   VRRP protocols as defined in RFC 3768 [5] and RFC xxxx (RFC-editor,
   this is currently draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-07.txt) [6] are
   inherently IP version specific.  Though both the protocols are
   similar, they are not identical and can coexist on a network element.
   RFC2787 [7] defines managed objects that are specific to VRRP
   protocol for IPv4 networks as defined in RFC 3768 [5].  This document
   defines IP version independent managed objects for configuring and
   monitoring VRRP protocols.

   VRRP over IPv4 (VRRPv2) and VRRP over IPv6 (VRRPv3) protocols are
   similar in operation to an extent and hence the MIB defined has
   common groups that should be implemented by devices running either of
   the VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  This specification also
   defines MIB groups that are specific to a particular VRRP protocol
   and should only be implemented in devices supporting the specified
   version of VRRP protocol.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD, "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3. Relationship to RFC 2338

   RFC2787 [7] defines managed objects for VRRP over IPv4 and has been
   deprecated by this memo.

4. Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB)

   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more physical
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in
   the VRRP MIB.

5. Multi-Stack Implementations

   This MIB is designed to support Multi-Stack implementations that run
   VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IP version, VRID and ifIndex are
   used to uniquely identify rows in a multi stack implementation.

6. VRRP MIB Structure

   The VRRP MIB contains three groups:
      - vrrpOperations Group: Objects related to VRRP router's
        configuration and control.
Tata                                                            [Page 2]

Internet-Draft              VRRP unified MIB              November 2005

      - vrrpStatistics Group: Objects containing information useful in
        monitoring the operation of VRRP routers.
      - vrrpNotifications Group: Consists of objects and definitions
        for use in SNMP notifications sent by VRRP routers.

   Tables in the MIB include the following:
   (1)  The vrrpOperationsTable, which contains objects that define the
        operational characteristics of a VRRP router.  Rows in this
        table correspond to instances of virtual routers.
   (2)  The vrrpRouterStatisticsTable which contains the operating
        statistics for a VRRP router.
   (3)  The vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable, contains the addresses of the
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.

7. VRRP MIB Table Design

   The tables in the VRRP MIB are structured with the assumption that a
   VRRP network management application would likely be designed to
   display information or provide configuration about a VRRP router
   over a IP version "per-virtual-router basis".  Thus, the tables
   defined in the MIB consist of conceptual rows which are indexed in a
   manner to present a view of individual virtual routers with a minimal
   number of SNMP operations.

8. VRRP Multistack Scenario

   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in
   this MIB are instantiated.


   KEY:
   ----

   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the
   actual MIB objects as follows:

   if      = IfIndex
   AddrType= vrrpOperationsInetAddrType
   VrId    = vrrpOperationsVrId
   State   = vrrpOperationsState
   Prior   = vrrpOpeartionsPriority
   IpAddr  = vrrpOperationsMasterIpAddr

   The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP
   routers VR1 & VR2, configured with two virtual routers.  Addresses in
   '()' indicate the address of the default gateway for a given host, H1
   to H4 are IPv4 hosts and H5 to H8 are IPv6 hosts.  In the diagram,
   "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB.

   NOTES:

   1)  For "State": M = Master;   B = Backup.
   2)  In the vrrpOperationsTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that
       the respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address
       is native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner").

10. Security Consideration

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   A number of objects in the vrrpOperationsTable possess the read-
   create attribute. Manipulation of these objects is capable of
   affecting the operation of a virtual router.

   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to:

   o The vrrpOperationsRowState object which could be used to disable
   a virtual router.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

11. IANA Considerations
   This draft dose not require any IANA number assignment except for
   assigning an RFC number after IESG approval.
