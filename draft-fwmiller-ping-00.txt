Abstract

   The SIP protocol has the potential for long periods of time to elapse
   when no signaling traffic is sent between a UAC and a UAS.  There are
   situations when it is advantageous to have some signaling traffic
   flow periodically between these endpoints.  A PING method is proposed
   that can be used for this purpose.

1.  Introduction

   Two SIP entities pass signaling traffic between them as required to
   support SIP based services.  There can be long periods of time either
   when session is established or when no session exists when no traffic
   is flowing between the endpoints.  There are situations where some
   periodic signaling traffic should be sent.  For example, if one of
   the endpoints is behind a Network Address Translation (NAT),
   signaling traffic may be needed to keep the NAT port bindings alive.
   The PING method is intended only to alert an endpoint that a
   signaling path is valid.

2.  PING Method

   The PING method is used to validate a signaling path.  The PING
   method is not used to change the state of SIP calls, nor does it
   change the state of sessions initiated by SIP.  Rather, it provides
   an indication to both ends of a session that signaling messages can
   still flow between them.

   A PING request may be sent at any time.  It is likely that an
   implementation will want to send a PING periodically to serve as a
   heartbeat.  A UAC MUST NOT have more than one outstanding PING
   transaction in existence at any time with a specific UAS.

   The only interval specified in this standard is that subsequent PING
   requests MUST be sent with at least a minimum of 500 milliseconds
   between them.

   The signaling path for the PING method is the signaling path
   established as the result of a call setup.  This can be either direct
   signaling between the calling and called User Agents or a signaling
   path involving SIP proxy servers that were involved in the call setup
   and added themselves to the Record-Route header on the initial INVITE
   message.

2.1.  Header Field Support for PING Method

   The PING request does not carry any information other than the intent
   to check for signaling path validity.  As such, only a few headers
   are used in both the PING request and its associated 200 OK response.

                     Header             Where    PING
                     ------             -----    ----

   If a Content-Length field is included in the PING request, it MUST be
   set to zero (0).

   The intent is to provide as simple a message as possible to allow for
   implementations (particularly for servers) to optimize PING message
   processing.

2.2.  Response to the PING Method

   When a UAC wants to check the validity of a session, it formats a
   PING request and send it to the UAS.  The request is sent using the
   same rules by which a BYE non-INVITE transaction would be sent.

                            UAC        UAS
                             |          |
                             |   PING   |
                             |--------->|
                             |          |
                             |  200 OK  |
                             |<---------|
                             |          |

   There are only two defined responses to a PING messages.  By defined,
   we mean that these are the only responses that a UAC that sends the
   PING request should recognize as correctly validating the signaling
   path.

   The first valid response is a 200 OK response.  A UAS that supports
   reception of the PING method MUST respond immediately with a 200 OK
   message when it receives a PING request.

   If a UAS that does not support the PING method receives a PING
   request, it will generate a 405 Method Not Allowed response per [1].
   This response is the second defined response.  If a UAC receives a
   405 from a UAS, it should interpret that response as if it were a 200
   OK that was received from an UAS that supports the PING method.
   Allowing this response to be received allows PING to be used with
   older implementations that do not support the PING method.

2.3.  Message Body Inclusion

   A PING request MUST NOT contain a message body.

2.4.  User Agent Behavior

   Unless otherwise stated, the protocol rules for the PING request
   governing the usage of tags, Route, and Record-Route, retransmission
   and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message formatting follow
   those in [1] as defined for the BYE request.

   A PING request MAY NOT be canceled.

2.5.  Behavior of SIP Proxy and Redirect Servers

Internet-Draft                    ping                     February 2006


2.5.1.  Proxy Server

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the PING request at a
   proxy are identical to those for a BYE request as specified in [1].

2.5.2.  Forking Proxy Server

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the PING request at a
   proxy are identical to those for a BYE request as specified in [1].

2.5.3.  Redirection Server

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the PING request at a
   proxy are identical to those for a BYE request as specified in [1].

3.  Security Considerations

   The only security consideration is that of a Denial of Service (DoS).
   A "PING Storm" DoS attack can be launched at a UAS if PING requests
   are sent at closer intervals than 500 milliseconds.  Even 500
   milliseconds can be considered tight.  It is RECOMMENDED that PING
   request intervals be at least several seconds if possible.
