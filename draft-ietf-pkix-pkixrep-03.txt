   Abstract

   This document defines a PKI repository locator service. The service
   makes use of DNS SRV records defined in accordance with RFC 2782. The
   service enables certificate using systems to locate PKI repositories

   based on a domain name, identify the protocols that can be used to 
   access the repository, and obtain addresses for the servers that host 
   the repository service. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1  Overview 

   Operational protocols have been specified for retrieval of PKI data,
   including public-key certificates and revocation information, from 
   PKI repositories in a number of RFCs including RFC 2559, RFC 2560     
   and RFC 2585. These RFCs assume that a certificate using system has
   the knowledge information necessary to identify, locate and connect 
   to the PKI repository with a specific protocol. Although there are 
   some tools available in protocol-specific environments for this 
   purpose, such as knowledge references in directory systems, these 
   are restricted to use with a single protocol and do not share a 
   common means of publication. This draft provides a solution to 
   this problem through the use of SRV RRs in DNS. This solution is
   expected to be particularly useful in environments where only a 
   domain name is available. In other situations (e.g. where a 
   certificate is available that contains the required information), 
   such a DNS lookup is not needed.

   RFC 2782 defines a DNS RR for specifying the location of services
   (SRV). This Internet-draft defines SRV records for a PKI 
   repository locator service to enable PKI clients to obtain the  
   necessary information to connect to a domain's PKI repository, 
   including information about each protocol that is supported by 
   that domain for access to its repository. This Internet-draft 
   includes the defininition of a  SRV RR format for this service 
   and an example of its potential use in an email environment. 
   
2  SRV RR definition

   The format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33, is:

   _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target

   For the PKI repository locator service, this draft uses the symbolic
   name "PKIXREP". Note that when used in an SRV RR, this name MUST
   be prepended with a "_" character.

   The protocols that can be included in PKIXREP SRV RRs are:
   LDAP 
   HTTP
   OCSP
   
   Note that when these protocol names appear in SRV records, they 
   MUST be prepended by a "_" character. 

   Other protocols could be added in future. 

   Boeyen & Hallam-Baker            Expires Aug 2005       [Page 2]

   System administrators SHOULD create at least one PKIXREP SRV RR for 
   each protocol that can be used to access their service. If the 
   service is operated on a number of hosts, additional records can 
   be created, as described in RFC 2782.

2.1 SRV RR example

   This example uses fictional domain "example.com" as an aid in 
   understanding the use of SRV records by a certificate using system.

   Let an email client that needs a certificate for a recipient be 
   Alice and assume that Alice's client system supports LDAP for 
   certificate retrieval. Let the message recipient be Bob and let
   Bob's email address be bob@example.com. Assume that example.test 
   maintains a "border directory" PKI repository and that Bob's     
   certificate is available from that directory "border.example.com" 
   via LDAP.  
   
   Alice's client system retrieves, via DNS, the SRV record for 
   _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com. 

        - the QNAME of the DNS query is _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com
        - the QCLASS of the DNS query is IN
        - the QTYPE of the DNS query is SRV

   The result SHOULD include the host address for example.com's 
   border directory system.
   
   Note that if example.com operated their service on a number of 
   hosts, more than one SRV RR would be returned. In this case, 
   RFC 2782 defines the procedure to be followed in determining which 
   of these should be accessed first.

3  Security considerations

   Security issues regarding PKI repositories themselves are outside 
   the scope of this specification. For LDAP repositories, for example, 
   specific security considerations are addressed in RFC 2559.

   Security issues with respect to the use of SRV records in general
   are addressed in RFC 2782 and these issues apply to the use of SRV
   records in the context of the PKIXREP service defined here. 

4  IANA Considerations

   This document reserves the use of "_PKIXREP" Service label.
   Since this relates to a service which may pass messages over a number
   of different message transports, they must be associated with a 
   specific transport.

   In order to ensure that the association between "_PKIXREP" and 
   their respective underlying services is deterministic, this document 
   requests that IANA create a registry: The PKIX SRV Protocol Label. 
   For this registry, an entry shall consist of a label name and a
 
   Boeyen & Hallam-Baker            Expires Aug 2005       [Page 3]

   pointer to a specification describing how the protocol named in the 
   label uses SRV. Specifications should conform to the requirements 
   listed in RFC 2434 for "specification required".
