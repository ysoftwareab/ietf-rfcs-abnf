               Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul Network
                   draft-li-mpls-seamless-mpls-mbh-00

Abstract

   Seamless MPLS architecture is proposed to integrate access and
   aggregation/core networks into a single MPLS domain.  Through the
   separation of the service and transport plane Seamless MPLS can
   provide end to end service independent transport.  But when the
   mobile backhaul network is integrated as the access/aggregation
   network with the core network based on Seamless MPLS architecture, it
   will proposes new challenges other than the existing solutions for
   Seamless MPLS.  This document introduces the framework of Seamless
   MPLS to integrate the mobile backhaul network and the core network.
   The possible challenges of Seamless MPLS for mobile backhaul networks
   are identified and new requirements are defined accordingly.

1.  Introduction

   Seamless MPLS [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] describes an architecture
   which can be used to extend MPLS networks to integrate access and
   core/aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain.  It provides a
   highly flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to
   integrate 100.000 of nodes.  One of the key elements of Seamless MPLS
   is the separation of the service and transport plane.  Through it
   Seamless MPLS can provide end to end service independent transport.
   Therefore it removes the need for service specific configurations in
   network transport nodes.

   The main purpose of Seamless MPLS is to deal with the integration of
   access networks and core/aggregation networks.  The typical access
   devices taken into account are DSLAM(Digital Subscriber Link Access
   Multiplexer), etc.  Now the mobile backhaul service has been deployed
   widely, the requirement of the integration of mobile backhaul
   networks and core networks has been proposed based on Seamless MPLS
   architecture.  Though some approaches of the existing Seamless MPLS
   architecture can be reused for the integration, there has to be some
   new issues to be dealt with when integrate these networks based on
   MPLS technologies.

   This document introduces the framework of Seamless MPLS to integrate
   the mobile backhaul network and the aggregation/core network.  The
   possible challenges of Seamless MPLS for mobile backhaul networks are
   identified and new requirements are defined accordingly.  The
   proposed requirements make it possible to work out the complete
   solution for a flexible deployment of an end to end mobile backhaul
   service delivery.

   Currently, this document focuses on end to end unicast service
   deployment.  Multicast is out of scope of the document.

3.  Overview of Mobile Backhaul Network

   The typical mobile backhaul network is shown in the Figure 1.  It
   usually adopts ring topology to save fiber resource and it is always
   divided into the aggregate network and the access network.  In the
   mobile backhaul network, Cell Site Gateways(CSGs) connect the eNodeBs
   and RNC Site Gateways(RSGs) connect the RNCs.  The mobile traffic is
   transported from CSGs to RSGs.

                  Figure 1 Mobile Backhaul Network

   Generally RNCs and eNodeBs connects the local mobile backhaul
   network.  In order to utilize the distributed resource, eNodeBs and
   RNCs may be located in different networks.  That is, the mobile
   service must span multiple networks including the mobile backhaul
   networks and the core network.  In order to facilitate service
   provision, Seamless MPLS architecture can be introduced to implement
   the integration of the mobile backhaul networks and the core network.

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] defines the possible requirements and
   solutions for the integration of the access network and the
   aggregation/core network into a single MPLS domain.  In the mobile
   backhaul network, being different from the typical access
   devices(DSLAM, MSAN), CSGs and RSGs of the mobile backhaul network
   needs to support rich MPLS features such as path design, protection
   switch, OAM, etc., to provide SDH-like service.  Morevover, devices
   in existing mobile backhaul networks vary in capacity.  So there will
   be different application scenarios and new challenges when Seamless
   MPLS architecture is applied for the mobile backhaul network.

   Note: In order to ease the description, in the following section we
   will use the PE to represent the CSG in the Seamless MPLS

   architecture.  In this document the PE and the CSG have the same
   meaning.

4.  Scenarios

   Existing mobile backhaul networks have different topology and network
   architectures composed by devices with variable capability . Seamless
   MPLS should be able to adapt to different scenarios to support the
   integration of mobile backhaul networks.

4.1.  Scenarios for Network Architecture

   Mobile backhaul networks are usually built using hierarchical network
   structure with access network, aggregation network and core network.
   These networks are always separated by AS or IGP area.  Along with
   the progress of network integration, the integration network can be
   summarized as following scenarios.

   Network Architecture 1: Network separated by ASes

   In current networks it is common that the core network and the mobile
   backhaul network have different AS numbers.  The core network usually
   uses a public AS number for internet connection.  And the mobile
   backhaul network including the access network and the aggregation
   network usually uses a private AS number just for local services.  So
   the integrated end-to-end service means to cross different ASes.

   Scenario 1: ASes connected by different ASBRs

   This is the most common scenario.  In this scenario there are
   redundant ASBRs in each AS to connect with the other AS back to back.

   The transport layer of Seamless MPLS for this scenario is the same as
   the Option C Inter-AS VPN scenario defined by [RFC4364].  In this
   scenario, Seamless MPLS uses label distribution enabled IBGP and EBGP
   to establish the end-to-end BGP LSP to support services (using IPv4
   as the example).

   o  IBGP distributes the PE's /32 route to ASBRs in source AS (P
      devices need not know the PE's /32 route).

   o  EBGP redistributes labeled IPv4 routes from source AS to
      neighboring AS.

   o  IBGP can distribute the PE's /32 route from ASBRs to ingress PEs
      in targeted AS.

   Scenario 2: ASes connected by integrated ASBRs

   In this scenario there are still redundant ASBRs in each AS.  But
   these ASBRs integrates together to reduce a pair of devices.  This
   scenario can effectively reduce the number of devices and costs.
   Other devices in each AS such as PEs and Ps need not be impacted.

      |--------------------|-------------------|
      |                    |                   |

                        +-----+
               Figure 3 Integrated ASBRs

   In this scenario, Seamless MPLS uses label distribution enabled IBGP
   to establish the end-to-end BGP LSP to support services (that is, it
   removes the requirement of EBGP sessions) (using IPv4 as the
   example):

   o  IBGP distributes the PE's /32 route to ASBRs in source AS (P
      devices need not know the PE's /32 route).

   o  The integrated ASBR should support two different ASes and
      redistribute the labeled IPv4 routes from one AS to neighboring
      AS.

   o  IBGP can distributes the PE's /32 route from the integrated ASBRs
      to ingress PEs in targeted AS.

   Network Architecture 2: Different network integrated in one AS but
   separated by different IGP areas

   This scenario is far different from most of current mobile backhaul
   networks.  In this scenario, the Core network is deployed in a same
   AS with the access/aggregation network.  And the core network,
   aggregation network and access network are just separated by IGP
   areas for the reason of scalability.

                        +----+
     Figure 4 Integrated network in one AS

   In this scenario, Seamless MPLS uses labeled IBGP to establish the
   end-to-end BGP LSP to support services.

4.2.  Scenarios for Different Edge of Labeled BGP

   Devices in existing mobile backhaul networks vary in capacity.
   Labeled BGP capability may not be able to be supported by all
   devices, especially the lower level nodes in access network.
   Seamless MPLS based on labeled BGP technology should adapt to
   different situations.  Based on the location of the edge of labeled
   BGP, there will be three possible scenarios.

   Scenario 1: Cell Site/User PE devices as the edge of labeled BGP

Internet-Draft  Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul Network      July 2014


   The transport layer in this scenario should be totally end-to-end BGP
   LSP.  The scenario requires the ingress PE(access devices) to
   encapsulate a three-label stack on the packet.  This requirement
   maybe difficult to be satisfied by all kinds of access devices,
   especially access devices with very low capacity.

   network and BGP LSP in aggregation/core network to support end-to-end
   services.

5.  Problem Statements and Requirements

5.1.  Overview

   Seamless MPLS in [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] describes an
   architecture by deploying existing protocols like BGP, LDP and ISIS
   to provides a highly flexible and a scalable architecture and the
   possibility to integrate 100.000 of nodes.  But more requirements for
   provision of the mobile service and the specialty of the mobile
   backhaul network proposes new challenges when Seamless MPLS is
   applied:

   1.  Challenges from Ring Network

   The mobile backhaul network always adopts the ring network
   deployment.  When CSGs access the ring topology and LDP is adopted as
   the transport plane, there will be multiple hops from CSGs to ASGs/
   RSGs which has effect on LDP DoD.  Moreover the route loop may always
   happens which will affect the network coverage of the possible IP
   FRR/LDP FRR solutions such as LFA [RFC6571] for high reliability.

   2.  Challenges from MPLS TE

   In the mobile backhaul network, in order to provide SDH-like service,
   MPLS TE or MPLS TP technologies are always introduced instead of MPLS
   LDP for transport of mobile service.  When integrate the core network



Zhenbin Li, et al.       Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft  Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul Network      July 2014


   and the mobile backhaul network, in the transport plane, the
   interworking between LDP/BGP LSP and RSVP-TE is inevitable.  It will
   have much effect on the end-to-end transport, OAM, protection and
   scalability.

   3.  Challenges from L3VPN

   FMC( Fixed Mobile Convergence ) is being taken into account for the
   mobile backhaul network.  In order to achieve higher scalability,
   L3VPN is provisioned to bear the mobile backhaul service besides
   L2VPN PW.  It needs simplification of flexible policy control and
   providing complete OAM solutions in different layers.

5.2.  Scalability

5.2.1.  Problem Statements

   There will be huge configuration when MPLS TE is adopted to transport
   mobile service.  As the mobile backhaul service develops and the
   network scale expands, more and more LTE eNodeBs and associated Cell
   Site Gateways(CSGs) are added in the networks to connect the RNCs and
   associated RNC site gateways(RSGs).  This proposes the requirement of
   a great deal of MPLS TE tunnels which connect CSGs and RSGs.  In
   order to satisfy different requirements of the mobile service, it
   will propose the configuration issues for MPLS TE:

   1.  Tunnel/LSP Configuration

   Since rich set of traffic engineering attributes have to be specified
   for MPLS TE tunnel and LSP, it has to configure these attributes at
   the ingress node for each MPLS TE tunnel/LSP to satisfy the
   requirements such as bandwidth guarantee, fast protection switch,
   OAM, etc.

   2.  Path Constraints Configuration

   In order to satisfy the requirement of path design for MPLS TE LSP,
   it has to introduce additional configuration which will deteriorate
   the configuration work for MPLS TE.

   1) Return Path Issue of BFD for MPLS LSPs

   In order for high reliability BFD for MPLS LSPs ([RFC5884]) can be
   used to detect the possible failure fast which can trigger traffic
   switch between the primary LSP and the backup LSP of a specific MPLS
   TE tunnel.  When BFD for MPLS LSPs is deployed, the return path of
   BFD traffic may take an IP path which is different from the forward
   path.  The failure that happens in the return path may cause wrong



Zhenbin Li, et al.       Expires January 4, 2015               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul Network      July 2014


   traffic switch.  In order to solve the return path issue of BFD for
   MPLS LSPs, it has to be guaranteed that the forward path and the
   return path must be co-routed.  For MPLS TE LSPs the explicit path
   has to be configured for the forward LSP and the return LSP.

   2) Completely disjointed primary and backup LSP

   MPLS TE Hot-standby feature is always introduced to implement traffic
   protection.  That is, primary LSP and backup LSP are setup at the
   same time for one MPLS TE tunnel.  In order to achieve higher
   reliability, it is requires that the primary and backup LSP should
   not share any nodes and links.  Thus when failure happens in the
   primary path, the backup LSP can always take over the traffic.  So it
   has to introduce the additional path constraints configuration to
   satisfy the requirements.

   3) Avoid passing through different access rings

   When the mobile traffic is transported from the CSG to the RSG, it is
   expected that the path would not pass through multiple access rings.
   Since the bandwidth of the access ring is always designed to satisfy
   its own bandwidth requirement, if mobile traffic from other access
   ring pass through, the access ring is prone to be overloaded which
   will cause traffic loss owing to traffic congestion.  It is complex
   to satisfy the requirement using cost, link color or explicit path
   configurations.

   In order to cope with above issues, the complex traffic engineering
   attributes configuration and path constraints configuration has to be
   introduced for MPLS TE tunnel/LSP.  Calculated using the typical MPLS
   TE tunnel configuration, there will be hundreds of thousands of
   command lines need to be configured for MPLS TE.  Comparing with LDP,
   the provision work for MPLS TE is time-consuming and error-prone
   which has much negative effect on the scalability.

5.2.2.  Requirements

   When Seamless MPLS is applied to the mobile backhaul network, in
   order to solve the configuration issue of MPLS TE to improve
   scalability, following requirements are proposed:

   REQ 01: It SHOULD avoid traffic engineering attributes configuration
   for each MPLS TE tunnel/LSP.  Auto tunnel mechanism SHOULD be
   introduced for provision of MPLS TE tunnel.

   REQ 02: It SHOULD simplify the path constraints configuration to cope
   with the return path issue of BFD for MPLS LSPs.

   REQ 03: It SHOULD simplify the path constraints configuration to
   implement completely disjointed primary and backup LSP.

   REQ 04: It SHOULD simplify the path constraints configuration to
   avoid traffic passing through different access rings.

5.3.  End-to-End Transport

   To reduce the requirement on lower level network devices( access
   nodes/ ASG nodes, etc.) and keep these devices as simple as possible,
   the MPLS stitching technology should be deployed at the edge of
   labeled BGP nodes.  Thus the access nodes just need to support basic
   MPLS function with IGP or even just static routes.  The position of
   the stitching point has been discussed in section 4.2.  This section
   will introduces new challenges and requirements for MPLS TE and LDP
   to implement stitching solution for the end-to-end transport.

5.3.1.  Problem Statement

   1.  Proxy Egress MPLS TE LSP

   In the typical Seamless MPLS architecture, LDP DoD are adopted to
   setup the segment LSP which is stitched with BGP LSP.  When MPLS TE
   is adopted to deploy in the mobile backhaul network, it is necessary
   to stitch the MPLS TE LSP set up in the mobile backhaul network and
   BGP LSP in the core network at the stitching point.  Since the actual
   destination of the MPLS TE LSP may be not located in the local mobile
   backhaul network, it has to set up the proxy egress MPLS TE LSP from
   the CSG to the stitching point.

   2.  Multi-hop LDP DoD

   In the typical Seamless MPLS architecture, the static route can be
   configured for set up LDP DoD LSP.  In addition, LDP Extension for
   Inter-Area Label Switched Paths[RFC5283] can be introduced to reduce
   the numbers of routes.  If LDP DoD is adopted for Seamless MPLS in
   the mobile haul network, since there are multiple hops from the CSG
   to ASG or RSG, it cannot configure the default route for setup of LDP
   DoD LSP.  If static routes are used, it will be troublesome to
   configure static routes to a specific destination on all nodes in the
   mobile backhaul network.

5.3.2.  Requirements

   REQ 11: It SHOULD set up MPLS TE proxy egress LSP to stitch with BGP
   LSP to implement end-to-end transport.

Internet-Draft  Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul Network      July 2014


   REQ 12: It SHOULD simplify the route configuration to setup multi-hop
   LDP DoD LSP.

5.4.  Hierarchical Service Bearing

5.4.1.  Problem Statements

   Though Seamless MPLS can provide end to end service independent
   transport and removes the need for service specific configurations in
   network transport nodes, owing to the limited capability of access
   nodes it may be necessary to introduce hierarchical MPLS-based
   service bearing solutions.

          Figure 8 Architecture of Service Layer Stitching

   As shown in the above figure, the access nodes (PEs) may be not able
   to update to support end to end transport, it can utilize the simple
   hierarchical MPLS-based service bearing solutions such as Hierarchy
   of VPN (HoVPN) to stitch two segmented VPNs at the ASG or ASBR to
   establish a VPN service across different domains.  The segmented VPN
   can simply steer the traffic from the access nodes to the ASG or ASBR
   with higher capability for complex process.  This can also simplify
   the process of access devices (CSGs) and reduce the capability
   requirement on lower level network devices.  Seamless MPLS is not to
   stop hierarchical service bearing which may need service specific
   configurations in network transport nodes.  On the contrary, it is to
   provide more flexibility for MPLS-based service bearing.  Depending

Internet-Draft  Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul Network      July 2014


   on the characteristic of the mobile service, different hierarchical
   service bearing solutions based on L2VPN or L3VPN should be adopted.

5.4.2.  Requirements

   In order to reduce the requirement on lower level network devices,
   hierarchical MPLS-based service bearing solutions can be introduced
   for mobile service.  Following requirements are proposed:

   REQ 31: Hierarchical L3VPN solutions MAY be introduced to bear
   L3-based mobile service.

   REQ 32: Hierarchical L2VPN solutions MAY be introduced to bear
   L2-based mobile service.

5.5.  Reliability

5.5.1.  Problem Statements

   The ring topology is always adopted in the mobile backhaul network.
   The route loop will be bound to happen in the ring network when LFA
   solution is applied.  This means that the backup route does not exist
   in specific nodes of the ring network according to LFA.  Regarding
   Remote LFA FRR [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa], though it can improve the
   network coverage comparing with LFA, it still faces the route loop
   challenges for the back path.  In addition, when R-LFA is adopted,
   there has to set up LDP remote sessions which will propose the
   scalability issue for fast protection.  If LDP is used and
   convergence in 50 ms must be guaranteed for the mobile backhaul
   service, the new FRR solution must be proposed to cover the whole
   network.

5.5.2.  Requirements

   REQ 41: Scalable IP/LDP FRR solutions SHOULD be provided for the
   purpose of 100% network coverage when LDP is used for transport of
   mobile service.

5.6.  Policy Control

5.6.1.  Problem Statements

   BGP as a route protocol for inter-AS now is used for Seamless MPLS to
   establish end-to-end hierarchical LSP or deploy VPN services.  BGP
   route policy based on IP-Prefix or communities are usually used to
   control the path.  The design and configuration is complex and error-
   prone.  In fact, BGP in Seamless MPLS is used to propagate labeled
   BGP routes across different domains to implement network convergence.

   This means several contiguous BGP networks are under the uniform
   administration.  It is not like the traditional BGP networks which
   may be under the administration of different service providers.  In
   this case, consideration on the security of the network can be
   reduced.  On the contrary, when advertise routes in the Seamless MPLS
   domain, it is desirable for BGP to carry more information to help
   select routing more intelligently.  It can reduce the cost proposed
   by complex policy control design and be able to adapt to network
   change easily.

5.6.2.  Requirements

   REQ 51: BGP SHOULD be able to carry more information to facilitate
   the route policy control.

5.7.  OAM

5.7.1.  Problem Statements

   Mobile Backhaul is a sensitive network on latency timer, packet loss
   rate, performance and so on.  Therefore, unified OAM mechanism is
   necessary to ensure the end-to-end network management including fault
   management and performance monitoring.

   1.  Layering OAM Framework for L3VPN Service

   When VPN is used to bear mobile service, multiple layers come into
   play for implementing the VPN service.  This layering extends to the
   set of OAM protocols that are involved in the ongoing maintenance and
   diagnostics of VPN networks.  The figure below depicts the OAM
   layering, and shows which devices have visibility into what OAM
   layer(s).

   OAM mechanisms is relatively complete and mature for L2VPN services.
   However, L3VPN are introduced in the mobile backhaul network for
   better scalability.  The multiple layers for an L3VPN service are as
   follows:

   - The Service Layer runs end to end between the sites that are being
   interconnected by the L3VPN solution.  It is always IP network.

   - The Network Layer extends in between the L3VPN PE nodes and is
   mostly transparent to the core nodes (except where Flow Entropy comes
   into play).  It leverages MPLS for service (i.e.  VRF) multiplexing.

   - The Transport Layer is dictated by the networking technology of the
   PSN.  It may be either based on MPLS LSPs or IP.

   - The Link Layer is dependent upon the physical technology used.
   Ethernet is a popular choice for this layer, but other alternatives
   are deployed (e.g.  POS, DWDM etc...).

   The existing OAM mechanisms for IP and L3VPN is not sufficient to
   satisfy the OAM requirement of the mobile service, especially for
   performance monitoring.

   2.  Flat End-to-End OAM Mechanism

   Seamless MPLS provides an architecture to support end-to-end services
   across multi-separated IP/MPLS domains.  Existing path detection
   technologies (e.g.  IP/LSP Ping and Trace) can only trace the path in
   different layers or different network segments.  So it is ineffective
   to get the end-to-end path for maintenance of the network.  On the
   other hand, existing technologies do not encapsulate the same 5-tuple
   {source IP address, destination IP address, source port number,
   destination port number, IP protocol number} as the real traffic.
   This means the path maybe be different between the OAM packets and
   the real flow's packets when there are more than one outgoing paths
   and the forwarding decision is determined by hash based on 5-tuple
   information in the IP packet.  According to these new requirements,
   the new solution should be introduced to maintain the end-to-end path
   more conveniently.

5.7.2.  Requirements

   REQ 61: Performance monitoring mechanism SHOULD be provided for the
   IP flow.

   REQ 62: Performance monitoring mechanism SHOULD be provided for the
   VPN flow between a pair of L3VPN members.

   REQ 63: The end-to-end path trace mechanism SHOULD be provided for
   the IP flow to collect the whole path information in multiple layers.
