Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the Netconf Access Control
   Model (NACM) to support notification authorization per event stream.

1. Introduction

   RFC5277 (NETCONF Event Notifications) defines the event stream. An
   event stream is defined as a set of event notifications matching some
   forwarding criteria. At some point after the NETCONF server receives
   the internal event from a stream, it is converted to an appropriate
   XML encoding by the server, and a <notification> element is ready to
   send to all NETCONF sessions subscribed to that stream. In some case,
   same event type of notification may be part of multiple event
   streams.

   RFC6536 (Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Access Control
   Model) defines the NACM rule for notification, however it only allows
   user to define notification-name. No stream name can be defined in
   the NACM rule.

   As NACM rule can not limit user to only subscriber certain stream, So
   there is no obvious solution if one user is only allowed to see some
   events from certain stream, like system-monitor stream and security-
   monitor stream. So this document is to extend NACM protocol to
   support such use case.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined used within this document:

   o

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6536] and are not redefined
   here:

   o NACM

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o Netconf

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   o  presence container

2. Yang Model Extension

2.1. The extended Yang Model data node

   A new leaf, termed as "stream-name", is specificied which stream will
   be checked during NACM notification rule authorization.

   The type of "stream-name" is an Union, it can be "matchall-string-
   type", or string. Type "matchall-string-type" is defined in RFC6536

    leaf stream-name {
     type union {
       type matchall-string-type;
       type string;
     }
    description
    "This leaf matches if it has the value '*' or if its
    value equals the requested stream name.";
   }

2.2. Outgoing <notification> Authorization

   For each rule-list entry found, process all rules, in order, until a
   rule that matches the requested access operation is found. A rule
   matches if all the following criteria are met:

   * The rule's "module-name" leaf is "*" or equals the name of the YANG
   module where the notification is defined.

   * The rule's "access-operations" leaf has the "read" bit set or has
   the special value "*".

   * The rule does not have a "rule-type" defined or the "ruletype" is
   "notification" and all the following criteria are met:

       * the "notification-name" is "*" or equals the name of the
    notification.
       * the "stream-name" is "*" or equals the name of the stream.

2.3. Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
   (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
   means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
   marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
   shown.

3. Security Considerations

   The data model defined does not create any security implications.



4. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
