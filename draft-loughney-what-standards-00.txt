 Status of this Memo 
     
    This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with 
    all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [1].  
     
    Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering 
    Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that      
    other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
    Drafts. 
     
    Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six 
    months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other 
    documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts 
    as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in 
    progress."

 Abstract 
     
    The current problem working group has identified problems with they 
    way in which the IETF manages the document series.  This document 
    discusses some of the problems caused by the current state of 
    affairs and lays out some steps to correct the problems.

 1. Introduction 
     
    The IETF has produced a large (and useful) body of work. In many 
    ways, the IETF has been a victim of its own (or at least of IP's) 
    success.  It is reasonable to expect that as standards see 
    deployment and uses not envisioned by the original authors, bugs 
    will be found or clarification will be needed. 
     
    Additionally, as the standards with the IETF produces see wider 
    deployment by parties outside of the IETF, the system of 
    documentation and updating within the IETF may cause some amount of 
    confusion. 
     
    There may be different expectations of what IETF standards may 
    mean.  Vendors often implement protocols based upon drafts; 
    proposed standards often are sufficient.  Other Standards 
    Development Organizations may require Draft Standard status, at a 
    minimum, for referencing in their documentations.  Government 
    Agencies, however, may take the standards levels literally and 
    assume only Full Standards can be considered as true standards. 
     
    Finally, the RFC numbering scheme does not lend itself for easily 
    tracking development on a specific protocol or protocol area. There 
    are no inter-relation between RFC numbers, so often one must rely 
    on the RFC Editor's search engine to find all relevant standards on 
    a specific protocol.  See Appendix A for a pathological example. 
     
 1.1 The Problem(s) 
     
    The following problems are excerpted from Section 2.4 of the IETF 
    Problem statement [PROB]. 
     
           o   Relatively few specifications are now progressed beyond 
               Proposed Standard (PS) to Draft Standard (DS) level, and 
               even fewer to Full Standard (FS). 
            
           o  There is no formal bug reporting or tracking system in 
               place for IETF specifications. 
            
           o  The periodic review of protocols at PS and DS levels 
               specified in [1] are not being carried out, allowing 
               protocols to persist in these lower maturity levels for 
               extended periods of time, whereas the process would 
               normally expect them to progress or be relegated to 
               Historic status. 
            
           o  No individual or body is given the task of 'maintaining' 
               a specification after the original WG has closed down.

               Specifications are generally only updated when a need 
               for a new version is perceived.  No attempt is normally 
               made to correct bugs in the specification (whether they 
               affect operation or not) and the specification is not 
               updated to reflect parts of the specification that have 
               fallen into disuse or were, in fact, never implemented.  
               This is in part because the current procedures would 
               require a standard to revert to the PS maturity level 
               even when specification maintenance is carried out which 
               can be demonstrated to have no or minimal effect on an 
               existing protocol at DS or FS level. 
     
    This document does not take a stand on the issue of the relevance 
    of the current standards track, but to note that in any given 
    moment, a standard may be on-going work to progress the document. 
  
 2. Further Analysis of Identified Problems 
     
    This section looks in greater detail the affects of the problems 
    listed in section 1.  Many of these issues are interlinked or 
    compound each other. 
     
 2.1 Few Specifications Progress Beyond Proposed Standard  
     
    The IETF, as of late, does not have a good track record of moving 
    protocols beyond Proposed Standard.  In fact, the goal of most 
    Working Groups is to produce a set of RFCs and then shut down.  
    Working groups that do this are considered to have succeeded.  
    There are only a handful of long-lived working groups, such as 
    IPv6, whose charters include progressing standards beyond Proposed 
    Standards.  
     
 2.2 There is no Formal Bug Reporting or Tracking System  
     
    Bugs in a specification can be found at any point. There have been 
    bugs found in even in Full Standards.  How do we ensure the 
    correctness in our own standards? 
     
 2.3 Periodic Reviews of Protocols are not Being Carried Out 
     
    Many protocols suffer from benign neglect.  The working group 
    charged with developing the protocol has gone dormant or shut down.  
    The principal authors of the specification may no longer be 
    involved in the IETF.  Further development of the protocol may even 
    be officially discouraged.   
     
    Other SDOs may consider extensions or modification to the 
    protocols. This causes problems for parties interested in the 
    technology, as it becomes unclear as to exactly what specifies a

                       Standards, What Standards?          October 2003 
  
  
    particular protocol.  Additionally, it makes it hard to track 
    errors or update in a specification or protocol. 
     
 2.4 There is no Maintenance Team Responsible for a Protocol 
     
    Specifications are generally only updated when a need for a new 
    version is perceived.  No attempt is normally made to correct bugs 
    in the specification (whether they affect operation or not) and the 
    specification is not updated to reflect parts of the specification 
    that have fallen into disuse or were, in fact, never implemented.  
    This is in part because the current procedures would require a 
    standard to revert to the PS maturity level even when specification 
    maintenance is carried out which can be demonstrated to have no or 
    minimal effect on an existing protocol at DS or FS level. 
     
 3. Additional Potential Problems 
     
    TBA 
     
 4. Potential Solutions 
     
    It has been suggested that some standards could be given a label, 
    for example the Foo MIB. Note that three versions of the Foo MIB 
    have been made RFCs 4120, 4560 and 7890. RFC 4560 was a flawed 
    attempt to do what 7890 did, which reached wide deployment before 
    the flaw was discovered. 
     
    The standard listing for "Ethernet MIB" could say:

     Draft-foo-bis N      N        Y     N        N       N 
     
       The IETF recommends deployment of RFC 4120. 
       The IETF recommends implementation of RFC 7890. 
       The IETF recommends experimentation with  
          draft-foo-bis. 
     
       The IETF recommends against implementing RFC 4560. 
     
       Important errata known for RFC 4120, 4560 and 7890 are: 
       <insert errata here>

    One could imagine a team or a stuckee in charge of gathering 
    experience with the documents. As implementation reports and 
    deployment experience gathers, the  "scorecard" - but NOT the RFCs 
    - would be updated. Other documents, rather than referring to a 
    specific RFC, would, when possible, refer to the label given 
     
 4.1 Question to the Community  
     
    The question is, how would the IETF document this.  Would this 
    become, in essence, something like an Applicability Statement, 
    which would be published as an RFC?  Would this be a new class of 
    document, which would get an additional tag, something along the 
    lines of what is done with STDs?  Or would this just be information 
    listed on a separate web page, as supplemental information? 
     
 5. Simple Example 
     
    SCTP has been chosen because it is a relatively new protocol but 
    also because the author is familiar with it.

    The IETF recommends implementing RFC 2960 with the updated checksum 
    coverage documented in RFC 3309.  draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpimpguide 
    contains updated information found during conformance tests.

 Appendix A - A Pathological Example 
     
    TCP has been a wildly successful protocol by any measure.  One of 
    the benefits of TCP has been that it has enabled interoperable 
    services running on-top of it, irrespective of the layers below it. 
    This success has come at a price. 
     
    The following is a table, based upon searching from the RFC 
    Editors' page on the text 'tcp' in the RFC title, with some 
    editing. 
     
    Additionally, there have been discussions on the e2e mailing list 
    about what constitutes TCP 
    (http://www.postel.org/pipermail/end2end-interest/).
