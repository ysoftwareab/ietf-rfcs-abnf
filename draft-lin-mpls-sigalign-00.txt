1. Introduction  
    
   This draft attempts to map the generic parameters to those currently 
   in CR-LDP, RSVP-TE, and the OIF UNI 1.0 specification, outlining the 
   differences among the various proposed protocol parameters. This 
   draft proposes that this list of parameters be aligned among the 
   various protocols.  
    
2. Parameters for UNI Signaling 
    
   The following section provides a list of possible parameters that 
   may be used in the UNI signaling protocol. These parameters provide 
   the basis for connection operations. UNI signaling requests may be 
   initiated by (a) A-end user, (b) a third-party signaling agent, or 
   (c) by the Z-end NNI agent.  
    
   Convention used in the following Tables: 
    
   Italic text are those that (loosely) map one protocol's parameter to 
   the generic parameter (e.g., source port ID maps into the service 
   name)

   FEC TLV: Additional information is required in order to establish 
   the requirements for the FEC TLV. Within the ASON network, this 
   parameter may not be appropriate.  
    
   Destination port, channel, subchannel: To obtain this information, 
   it is necessary that the requesting end have full knowledge of the 
   port connectivity with all its potential connections. If this were 
   not true, then destination specific information may not be specified 
   by the UNI, instead only the particular Z-end name may be known to 
   the A-end user. The service provider, during the course of setting 
   up the user connection, determines the _best_ port, channel, 
   subchannel to use to connect with the Z-end (via the service 
   provider-to-user UNI request or as determined by the local resource 
   management between the Z-end service provider and the Z-end user). 
   Full knowledge of the destination information may be possible if the 
   A-end and Z-end are within the same user domain; however, this is 
   one of many possibilities, and thus it may not be appropriate to 
   specify protocol targeted for this one application.  
    
   Framing, bandwidth, transparency: These parameters provide 
   information regarding the specific services being requested, and 
   assumes a specific partitioning of the service category. Because the 
   ASON network would provide a deterministic set of services, there is 
   no reason for this particular partitioning. A simplified list of 
   service types (as embedded within the service name or the 
   generalized label request TLV) should be sufficient. For example, in 
   RSVP, a generalized payload ID may be used to provide a list of all 
   available services (e.g., STS-1, STS-3c, SONET line overhead 
   transparent service at OC-48, etc.).  
    
   Lightpath priority: This parameter provides priority of services and 
   preemptibility information of the connections. Because this is an 
   added feature, service provider input is needed to determine the 
   usefulness of this parameter as well as to consider the implications 
   of the complexities introduced into the network.  
    
   Propagation delay: Information regarding ASON connection delay is 
   provided to determine the propagation delay of a connection. 
   However, given that the ASON network is circuit-based, and delay 
   information is primarily due to light propagation, the variability

   of the delay value for (potential) routes are small (e.g., a 
   connection from San Francisco to New York may traverse different 
   alternate routes, but the difference in propagation delay between 
   these routes are likely small _ a 1200 km route introduces a 
   propagation delay of approximately 6 ms; thus one path may exhibit 
   25 ms delay while an alternate path may exhibit 30 ms delay). This 
   information may also be embedded within a contract ID, where users 
   of the ASON network may specify extremal scenarios (e.g., whether to 
   allow satellite links within their connection instead of specific 
   delay values).  
    
   Drop-side protection, protection mode, diversity: These information 
   are expected to allow a user to influence the availability of a 
   particular requested connection. However, the user should not have 
   visibility to the service provider network, nor should the user have 
   information regarding the type of protection/restoration being used 
   within the service provider network. Specifying these detailed 
   architecture/topology information in constraining the service 
   provider route determination may not be appropriate. Instead 
   information regarding the availability requirements of a requested 
   connection may be more appropriate. This availability information is 
   primarily provided as a differentiated class of service as embedded 
   within the contract ID (e.g., bronze for best effort, silver for 
   meshed restoration, platinum for 1+1 protection). For example, the 
   service provider connection from A-end user to Z-end user traverses 
   different subnetworks X, Y and Z, where subnetwork X is based on a 
   ring topology, subnetwork Y is based on a mesh topology, and 
   subnetwork Z is point-to-point. In this scenario, what may be 
   specified in terms of the protection mode or diversity may not be 
   appropriate.  
    
   Additionally, consider two service providers M and N serving the 
   same market with high earthquake rates. Service provider M provides 
   duplicate nodes at each central office and encase its fibers in 
   concrete conduits (possibly!), while service provider N provides 
   only single node at each central office and lays aerial fiber. The 
   reliability of these two networks will be drastically different. 
   Therefore, what is important to a user should not be whether they 
   have diversity or certain protection mode, but whether they can get 
   certain level of reliability for those connections (availability 
   metrics).  
    
   Avoid name list, include name list: These information are lists of 
   specific user-service provider agreed names that the user may use in 
   constraining the service provider route determination. The lists do 
   not provide topology or resource information.  
    
   Service TLV, Source ID TLV, Generalized Label Request TLV: The 
   required service characteristics information is spread among these 
   various TLVs. for example, service TLV contains delay, diversity and 
   bandwidth, source ID TLV contains port/channel/subchannel ID, label

   request TLV contains link protection, encoding, lightpath payload. 
   How do these relate to the characteristics of the service?  
    
   Suggested Label TLV, Label Set TLV: How are these parameters used in 
   the UNI message? Is this the same information as the lightpath ID? 
   If it is used to bound the value of the lightpath ID, then it 
   implies the user has knowledge of the service provider name space 
   used for lightpath ID, and thus in order to make suggested labels, 
   must also have knowledge of the semantics of the name space. Is this 
   correct? Are service providers willing to share this information 
   with the user? Shouldn't the lightpath ID assignment be delegated to 
   the service provider who is setting up the connection? Is there a 
   good reason for the user to control (determine) the lightpath ID?

   Lightpath ID: Lightpath ID includes the Ipv4 address of the optical 
   network element. Why is it not the address (or more generally the 
   name) of the user network element? What is the reason to include the 
   address of the service provider network element?  
    
   As a response to the create request, information regarding the 
   source and destination port, channel, subchannel and generalized 
   label TLV are not required. To uniquely identify this message as a 
   response to a request, the same message ID is used. Thus the 
   connection ID (lightpath ID) identifies the results of the request. 
   The source/destination addresses and the label TLV are provided to 
   the service provider in order to help determine the specific route 
   and the characteristics of that route. Once determined, these 
   information are no longer relevant.  
    
   The user group ID is not needed in the response message. This 
   information is used only during the policy verification and route 
   determination within the service provider domain, and is not 
   required as part of the response signaling.  
    
   The contract ID is not needed in the response message. This 
   information is used only during the policy verification and route 
   determination within the service provider domain, and is not 
   required as part of the response signaling.

   Prior to determining the _best_ set of parameters for modification, 
   OIF needs to first determine the type of information that may be 
   desired to be modified, the default set of information that may be 
   desired as a response. It should be noted that, depending on what 
   modify means, any, all or none of the characteristics of a 
   connection may be subjected to be modified. If none, then a modify 
   may not be needed, and a create-delete combination command may be 
   defined to effect the required actions.

3. Proposal 
    
   Given the various parameter sets of the different proposed UNI 
   signaling protocols (RSVP-TE, CR-LDP, OIF UNI 1.0), this 
   contribution proposes that OIF align these parameter lists across 
   all the signaling protocols that may be considered as an option for 
   the UNI 1.0 specification.
