1.  Introduction

   There are several situations where it is required for OSPF routers in
   one area to find correlations between routable IP addresses and
   capabilities of OSPF routers in another area.  One example is the
   Entropy Label Capability (ELC) advertisement [I-D.xu-ospf-mpls-elc]
   across the OSPF domain.  In this example, assume the ELC TLV
   originated by a router in one area is propagated to another area.
   Those routers in the latter area need to find routable IP addresses
   of the router originating that ELC TLV before inserting the Entropy
   Label (EL) for packets going to the Label Switch Path (LSP) tunnel
   towards one of the above routable IP addresses.  Another example is
   the S-BFD discriminator distribution
   [I-D.bhatia-ospf-sbfd-discriminator] across the OSPF domain.  In this
   example, assume the S-BFD Discriminator TLV originated by a router in
   one area is propagated to another area.  Those routers in the latter
   area need to find routable IP addresses of the router originating
   that S-BFD Discriminator TLV so as to set up S-BDF sessions with that
   originating router.

   However, in the OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA as defined in
   [RFC4970], which is used by OSPF routers to announce their
   capabilities, there is no such field for containing routable IP
   addresses of the originating router.  Therefore, this document
   propose two new TLVs within the body of OSPF RI LSA, called Routable
   IPv4 Address TLV and Routable IPv6 Address TLV, which are used to
   carry routable IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively.  Here the term
   OSPF means both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4970].

3.  Routable IPv4 Address TLV

   A new TLV within the body of the OSPF RI Opaque LSA, called Routable
   IPv4 Address TLV is defined to carry one or more routable IPv4
   addresses of the router originating the RI LSA.  The Type of this TLV
   is TBD, the Length is variable (multiple of 4), and the Value field
   contains one or more routable IPv4 addresses of the router
   originating the RI LSA.  This TLV is applicable to OSPFv2 and for
   IPv4 Address Families (AFs) of OSPFv3 [RFC5838].  The scope of the
   advertisement MUST be domain-wide as mapping between the originator
   and advertised address is required only when crossing the area
   boundaries.

4.  Routable IPv6 Address TLV

   A new TLV within the body of the OSPFv3 RI Opaque LSA, called
   Routable IPv6 Address TLV is defined to carry one or more routable
   IPv6 global addresses of the router originating the RI LSA.  The Type
   of this TLV is TBD, the Length is variable (multiple of 16), and the
   Value field contains one or more routable IPv6 global addresses of
   the router originating the RI LSA.  This TLV is only applicable to
   OSPFv3.  The scope of the advertisement MUST be domain-wide as
   mapping between the originator and advertised address is required
   only when crossing the area boundaries.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks Karsten Thomann, Anton Smirnov, Joel Jaeggli, Joel M.
   Halpern, Wes George, Les Ginsberg, Abhay Roy, Mach Chen, Peter Psenak
   and Acee Lindem for their support and valuable comments on this
   draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a request to IANA to allocate two TLV type
   codes for the new TLVs proposed in Section 3 and Section 4 of this
   document from OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs Registry defined by
   [RFC4970].

7.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a mechanism for advertising routable IP
   address information through OSPF Router Information Opaque LSA and
   does not introduce any new security issues other than what is
   specified by [RFC4970].
