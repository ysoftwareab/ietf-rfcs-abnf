Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects managing
   SNMP agents that use the Agent Extensibility (AgentX) Protocol.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

   -  the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   -  the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects
      for the Internet suite of protocols.

   -  the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
      accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

2.  Introduction

   The SNMP Agent Extensibility Protocol (AgentX) is a protocol used to
   distribute the implementation of an SNMP agent amongst a single
   "master agent" and multiple "subagents". See [5] for details about
   the AgentX protocol.

   The goals of the AgentX MIB are:

   -  List the set of subagents that currently have logical sessions
      open with the master agent.

   -  Identify each subagent's type, vendor, transport address, AgentX
      protocol version, and other characteristics.

   -  Identify the set of MIB objects each subagent implements, the
      context in which the objects are registered, and the priority of
      the registration.  Provide statistics about the protocol operation
      such as the number of packets to and from each subagent.

Internet Draft                 AgentX MIB               13 November 1997


   -  Determine protocol operational parameters such as the timeout
      interval for responses from a subagent and the priority at which a
      subagent registers a particular MIB region.

   -  Allow (but do not require) managers to be able to modify AgentX
      protocol operational parameters and to explicitly close subagent
      sessions with the master agent.

3.  Overview

   This MIB is organized into four groups.  The agentxGeneral group
   provides information describing the master agent's Agentx support,
   including the protocol version supported and the supported transport
   mechanisms.  The agentxConnection group provides information
   describing the current set of connections capable of carrying Agentx
   sessions.  The agentxSession group provides information describing
   the current set of AgentX sessions.  The agentxRegistration group
   provides information describing the current set of registrations.

   Three tables form the heart of this mib.  These are the connection,
   session, and registration tables.

   Entries in the registration table exist in a many-to-one relationship
   with entries in the session table.  This relationship is represented
   through the agentxRegSessionIndex object in a registration entry.  To
   determine which session is responsible for a given registration
   entry, a manager can retrieve the value of agentxRegSessionIndex for
   that entry, and then use that value to retrieve the corresponding row
   of the session table.  To determine which registration(s), if any, a
   given subagent session is responsible for, a manager can scan the
   registration table for entries in which agentxRegSessionIndex matches
   the value of the agentxSessionIndex of the session in question.

   Entries in the session table exist in a many-to-one relationship with
   entries in the connection table.  This relationship is represented
   through the agentxSessionConnIndex object in a session entry.  To
   determine which connection is carrying a given session, a manager can
   retrieve the value of agentxSessionConnIndex for that entry, and then
   use that value to retrieve the corresponding row of the connection
   table.  To determine which session(s), if any, a given connection is
   carrying, a manager can scan the connection table for entries in
   which agentxSessionConnIndex matches the value of the agentxConnIndex
   of the connection in question.

7.  Security Considerations
   In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP
   security is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view
   information about a system, or to change some parameter at the
   system, is a tool, not a threat.

   None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, user
   data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.  If access to
   these objects is not limited by an appropriate access control policy,
   these objects can provide an attacker with information about a
   system's configuration and the services that that system is
   providing.  Some enterprises view their network and system
   configurations themselves, as well as information about usage and
   performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to
   restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.

   This MIB contains two read-write objects: agentxDefaultTimeout and
   agentxSAAdminStatus.  Setting agentxDefaultTimeout to an
   inappropriately small value can prevent new subagent sessions from
   being usable.  Setting agentxSAAdminStatus to an inappropriate value
   can effectively prevent access to management information, or provide
   access to inappropriate information.  Since changes to either of
   these objects can adversely impact the manageability of a system,
   write access to these objects should be subject to an appropriate
   access control policy.  Such a policy may be realized in an
   implementation by limiting support for these objects to read-only
