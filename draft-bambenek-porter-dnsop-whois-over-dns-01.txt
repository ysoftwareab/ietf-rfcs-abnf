                Domain Contact Information (WHOIS) over DNS
             draft-bambenek-porter-dnsop-whois-over-dns-01.txt


Abstract

   Domain contact information over DNS provides a vehicle for
   exchanging contact information in a programmatic and reliable
   manner. DNS has a ubiquitous presence within the internet
   infrastructure and will act as a reliable publication method for
   contact information exchange. This RFC provides an agreed upon
   structure, voluntarily, to publish points of contact for domains.

   This document outlines the methodology for utilizing DNS TXT records
   for voluntary publication of various forms of contact. The intended
   purpose is to provide a faster means of reliable contact for
   professionals, cyber-defense of domains.

1. Introduction

   In lieu of recent events and legislation that has impacted the
   global availability of the current WHOIS protocol and underlying
   model, a new method for distributing contact information for domains
   is necessary. This method must rely on the consent of the domain
   owners and be optional in order to comply with emerging privacy law.
   As an additional requirement, the existing protocol does not allow
   for internationalization and that should be corrected with whatever
   successor system is designed.

   The availability of this information has proved an invaluable
   resource for security and anti-abuse professionals in preventing
   spam, detecting malicious infrastructure, and preemptive detection
   of election manipulation operations. Maintaining some system to both
   distribute this information (should it be voluntarily published) in
   a manner that allows for automated retrieval and analysis is key.

1.1. Rationale for Using DNS

   All resources communicating on the Internet already use DNS to
   distribute information. In many cases, these domains are already
   using text records for SPF, DKIM, CAA, and other types to distribute
   information about their infrastructure and identity to validate
   communication and prevent abuse.

   One of the benefits of the WHOIS system outlined in RFC 3912
   [RFC3912] is that records are stored and distributed by a different
   entity who performs some measure of validation, at least for the e-
   mail address. This means that if a domain owner were compromised,
   someone else has contact information to get in touch with the true
   own to organize remediation. Using WHOIS Over DNS at least separates
   the distribution of this information from a webserver and makes it
   less likely a hostile actor could manipulate the contact information
   as well in the event of a compromise.

   It is less ideal that full administrative separation in a different
   organization, but DNS and webservers are typically separate so
   compromise of both simultaneously would be rare (albeit not
   impossible).

   Additionally, internationalization is already well-established in
   DNS using punycode as outlined in RFC 3492 [RFC3492].

   DNS TXT records as specified in RFC 1463 [RFC1463] are already in
   wide use and is where WHOIS over DNS information SHOULD be stored.
   These TXT records SHALL be tied to "_whois" subdomain TXT record.
   This roughly follows the convention already used by DMARC records as
   specified in RFC 7489 [RFC7489] so implementation should be easy and
   DNS providers should already be able to support the addition of
   these new records.

1.2. Rationale to Publish or Not Public WHOIS over DNS Information

   There are a wide variety of reasons to publish or not publish valid
   contact information that is available for anyone in the world to
   use. Those concerned about privacy or who are otherwise at-risk
   based on their online activities may wish to hide this information.
   Others may wish to publish it so reputational engines treat their e-
   mail and other communication as more valid.

   Each use case is unique and a "one size fits all" approach cannot
   work on a global Internet. This document was written so that
   publishing or not publishing is optional, whether individual or
   "role-based" information is used is a choice, and that this
   information is preserved for use by automated systems.

   All commercial DNS providers and DNS servers SHALL support these
   record types.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

   In this document, exampledomain.com will be used to describe the DNS
   TXT records used. It is not intended to point to anything currently
   or planned to be in use.

3. Administrative Contact Information

   Administrative contact information MAY be published as a DNS TXT
   record that is prefaced with the letter "a". The administrative

Internet-Draft              WHOIS over DNS                    June 2019


   contact SHOULD be the person or persons who are representatives of
   the domain and charged with making business and non-technical
   decisions. This person or persons may be on other contact records.

3.1. Administrative Contact Name

   The administrative contact name MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL
   be stored using the name "aname". This contact name may refer to an
   individual or a role name (i.e. "Business Administrator"). Punycode
   can be used to support internationalization of that name. An example
   record of this type would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "aname=John Bambenek"

3.2. Administrative Contact Phone Number

   The administrative contact phone number MAY be created, but if it
   is, SHALL be stored using the name "aphone". This phone number MAY
   be a direct dial to an individual or to a monitored phone by a group
   of individuals. It SHOULD however, be a line that would be monitored
   by a live person. The phone number MUST be stored in accordance with
   the ITU standard for international numbers [E.164]. An example of
   the record is would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "aphone=+13127254225"

3.3. Administrative Contact E-mail Address

   The administrative contact e-mail address MAY be created, but if it
   is, SHALL be stored using the name "aemail". This e-mail may be a
   role-based e-mail address or an individual e-mail account. In either
   case, it MUST be monitored for messages. An example of this record
   would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT
      "aemail=bambenek@illinois.edu"

3.4. Administrative Contact Address

   The administrative contact address MAY be created, but if it is,
   SHALL be stored using the name "aaddress". This MUST be stored using
   the valid convention of mail services for the country where the
   address resides in and include the country at the end. This address
   MUST exist and MUST correctly represent an address where the
   administrative contact can receive mail. An example of this record
   would be:

   Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, US"

4. Technical Contact Information

   Technical contact information MAY be published as a DNS TXT record
   that is prefaced with the letter "t". The technical contact SHOULD
   be the person or persons who are representatives of the technical
   aspects of Internet-facing services provided by the domain (i.e. web
   server administrator, e-mail administrator). This person or persons
   may be on other contact records.

4.1. Technical Contact Name

   The technical contact name MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL be
   stored using the name "tname". This contact name may refer to an
   individual or a role name (i.e. "Website Administrator"). Punycode
   can be used to support internationalization of that name. An example
   record of this type would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "tname=John Bambenek"

4.2. Technical Contact Phone Number

   The administrative contact phone number MAY be created, but if it
   is, SHALL be stored using the name "tphone". This phone number MAY
   be a direct dial to an individual or to a monitored phone by a group
   of individuals. It SHOULD however, be a line that would be monitored
   by a live person. The phone number MUST be stored in accordance with
   the ITU standard for international numbers [E.164]. An example of
   the record is would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "tphone=+13127254225"

4.3. Technical Contact E-mail Address

   The administrative contact e-mail address MAY be created, but if it
   is, SHALL be stored using the name "temail". This e-mail may be a
   role-based e-mail address or an individual e-mail account. In either
   case, it MUST be monitored for messages. An example of this record
   would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT
      "temail=bambenek@illinois.edu"

   The administrative contact address MAY be created, but if it is,
   SHALL be stored using the name "taddress". This MUST be stored using
   the valid convention of mail services for the country where the
   address resides in and include the country at the end. This address
   MUST exist and MUST correctly represent an address where the
   technical contact can receive mail. An example of this record would
   be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "taddress=201 N. Goodwin
   Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, US"

5. Network Contact Information

   Network contact information MAY be published as a DNS TXT record
   that is prefaced with the letter "n". The network contact should be
   the person or persons who are representatives of the domain and
   charged with making networking decisions on behalf of the domain.
   This person or persons may be on other contact records.

5.1. Network Contact Name

   The network contact name MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL be
   stored using the name "nname". This contact name may refer to an
   individual or a role name (i.e. "Network Administrator"). Punycode

   record of this type would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "nname=John Bambenek"

5.2. Network Contact Phone Number

   The administrative contact phone number MAY be created, but if it
   is, SHALL be stored using the name "nphone". This phone number MAY
   be a direct dial to an individual or to a monitored phone by a group
   of individuals responsible for networking. It SHOULD however, be a
   line that would be monitored by a live person. The phone number MUST
   be stored in accordance with the ITU standard for international
   numbers [E.164]. An example of the record is would be:

   based e-mail address or an individual e-mail account. In either
   case, it MUST be monitored for messages. An example of this record
   would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT
      "nemail=bambenek@illinois.edu"

5.4. Network Contact Address

   The administrative contact address MAY be created, but if it is,
   SHALL be stored using the name "naddress". This MUST be stored using
   the valid convention of mail services for the country where the
   address resides in and include the country at the end. This address
   MUST exist and MUST correctly represent an address where the network
   contact can receive mail. An example of this record would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "naddress=201 N. Goodwin
   Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, US"

6. Security / Abuse Contact Information

   Security or abuse contact information MAY be published as a DNS TXT
   record that is prefaced with the letter "s". The security or abuse
   contact SHOULD be the person or persons who are representatives of
   the domain and should receive reports on security or abuse concerns
   from resources under the domain or being targeted to resources
   served by the domain. This person or persons may be on other contact
   records.

6.1. Security / Abuse Contact Name

   The security or abuse contact name MAY be created, but if it is,
   SHALL be stored using the name "sname". This contact name may refer
   to an individual or a role name (i.e. "Business Administrator").
   Punycode can be used to support internationalization of that name.
   An example record of this type would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "sname=John Bambenek"

6.2. Security / Abuse Contact Phone Number

   The security or abuse contact phone number MAY be created, but if it
   is, SHALL be stored using the name "sphone". This phone number MAY
   be a direct dial to an individual or to a monitored phone by a group
   of individuals responsible for security and/or abuse reports for the
   domain. It SHOULD however, be a line that would be monitored by a
   live person. The phone number MUST be stored in accordance with the

   ITU standard for international numbers [E.164]. An example of the
   record is would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "sphone=+13127254225"

6.3. Security / Abuse Contact E-mail Address

   The security or abuse contact e-mail address MAY be created, but if
   it is, SHALL be stored using the name "semail". This e-mail may be a
   role-based e-mail address or an individual e-mail account. In either
   case, it MUST be monitored for messages. An example of this record
   would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT
      "semail=bambenek@illinois.edu"

6.4. Security / Abuse Contact Address

   The security or abuse contact address MAY be created, but if it is,
   SHALL be stored using the name "saddress". This MUST be stored using
   the valid convention of mail services for the country where the
   address resides in and include the country at the end. This address
   MUST exist and MUST correctly represent an address where the
   administrative contact can receive mail. An example of this record
   would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "saddress=201 N. Goodwin
   Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, US"

7. All-in-One Option

   In order to create a simple option for those cases where the contact
   would be the same for all four types of WHOIS contacts, an "all"
   record MAY be used to take the place of the four individual
   categories to simplify DNS administration for the domain owner.

7.1. "All" Contact Name

   The "all" contact name MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL be stored
   using the name "allname". This contact name may refer to an
   individual or a role name (i.e. "Domain Owner"). Punycode can be
   used to support internationalization of that name. An example record
   of this type would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "allname=John Bambenek"

Internet-Draft              WHOIS over DNS                    June 2019


7.2. "All" Contact Phone Number

   The "all" contact phone number MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL
   be stored using the name "allphone". This phone number MAY be a
   direct dial to an individual or to a monitored phone by a group of
   individuals. It SHOULD however, be a line that would be monitored by
   a live person. The phone number MUST be stored in accordance with
   the ITU standard for international numbers [E.164]. An example of
   the record is would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "allphone=+13127254225"

7.3. "All" Contact E-mail Address

   The "all" contact e-mail address MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL
   be stored using the name "allemail". This e-mail may be a role-based
   e-mail address or an individual e-mail account. In either case, it
   MUST be monitored for messages. An example of this record would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT
      "allemail=bambenek@illinois.edu"

7.4. "All" Contact Address

   The "all" contact address MAY be created, but if it is, SHALL be
   stored using the name "alladdress". This MUST be stored using the
   valid convention of mail services for the country where the address
   resides in and include the country at the end. This address MUST
   exist and MUST correctly represent an address where the contact can
   receive mail. An example of this record would be:

   _whois.exampledomain.com.  14400 IN TXT   "alladdress=201 N. Goodwin
   Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, US"

8. Security Considerations

   As with any publication of potentially personally identifiable
   information, this could lead to individuals receiving unwanted
   communication of various sorts. This standard does not require
   specific individuals to be identified, per se, as all the contact
   types can be role-based accounts.

   The purpose of this document is to establish a standard by which
   "someone" can be contacted in the case of a need to contact a domain
   owner and to help establish reputation for those looking to connect
   with a given domain and have transactions with services on that
   domain.

Internet-Draft              WHOIS over DNS                    June 2019


   The publication of this information is immensely useful to the
   security and anti-abuse industry for a wide variety of reasons and
   this information can and should be used for reputational scoring of
   domains to filter out potentially abusive infrastructure.

   The publication of this data in DNS is optional, but third-parties
   are free to use the lack of this information as a negative indicator
   when considering interconnectivity (such as the delivery of e-mail).

   If the domain registration itself were seized by a hostile third-
   party, this system would not be able to authoritatively identify the
   "victim"-owner. Passive DNS, however, will help in an overwhelming
   majority of these cases.

   The limitation of this approach is that there is no true validation
   of any of the fields that will be published in these records. Under
   the current system in the general case, an e-mail address is
   validated before a domain is published. In this case, individuals
   can use unsuspecting third-parties' contact information. Those
   incidents, when discovered, are all but certainties that the
   underlying domain is abusive (except in the case of plausible typos)
   and provide further negative reputational data that can be used.

   A third-party system could be used to provide for such validation
   but that is outside the scope of this document. Additionally,
   invalid entries, fake addresses, non-working email addresses or
   malformed content MAY be used to negatively score a domain for
   security reputation purposes.

   DNSSEC MUST be fully deployed on any domain using these conventions
   to help ensure reliability of this information.

9. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations as this will use the existing DNS
   TXT (type 16) RR.
