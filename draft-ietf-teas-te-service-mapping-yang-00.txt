           Traffic Engineering and Service Mapping Yang Model


                draft-ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang-00

Abstract

   This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service
   models (e.g., the L3VPM Service Model) to Traffic Engineering (TE)
   models (e.g., the TE Tunnel or the Abstraction and Control of
   Traffic Engineered Networks Virtual Network model). This model is
   referred to as TE Service Mapping Model and is applicable
   generically to the operator's need for seamless control and
   management of their VPN services with TE tunnel support.

   The model is principally used to allow monitoring and diagnostics of
   the management systems to show how the service requests are mapped
   onto underlying network resource and TE models.

1. Introduction

   Data models are a representation of objects that can be configured
   or monitored within a system. Within the IETF, YANG [RFC6020] is the
   language of choice for documenting data models, and YANG models have
   been produced to allow configuration or modeling of a variety of
   network devices, protocol instances, and network services. YANG data
   models have been classified in [RFC8199] and [RFC8309].

   Framework for Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
   (ACTN) [RFC8453] introduces an architecture to support virtual
   network services and connectivity services. [ACTN-VN-YANG] defines a
   YANG model and describes how customers or end-to-end orchestrators
   can request and/or instantiate a generic virtual network service.
   [ACTN-Applicability] describes the way IETF YANG models of different
   classifications can be applied to the ACTN interfaces. In
   particular, it describes how customer service models can be mapped
   into the CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI) of the ACTN architecture.

   The models presented in this document are also applicable in generic
   context [RFC8309] as part of Customer Service Model used between
   Service Orchestrator and Customer.

   [RFC8299] provides a L3VPN service delivery YANG model for PE-based
   VPNs. The scope of that draft is limited to a set of domains under
   control of the same network operator to deliver services requiring
   TE tunnels.

   [L2SM] provides a L2VPN service delivery YANG model for PE-based
   VPNs. The scope of that draft is limited to a set of domains under
   control of the same network operator to deliver services requiring
   TE tunnels.

   [L1CSM] provides a L1 connectivity service delivery YANG model for
   PE-based VPNs. The scope of that draft is limited to a set of
   domains under control of the same network operator to deliver
   services requiring TE tunnels.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping              March 2019


   While the IP/MPLS Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) is
   responsible for provisioning the VPN service on the Provider Edge
   (PE) nodes, the Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) can
   coordinate how to map the VPN services onto Traffic Engineering (TE)
   tunnels. This is consistent with the two of the core functions of
   the MDSC specified in [RFC8453]:

     . Customer mapping/translation function: This function is to map
        customer requests/commands into network provisioning requests
        that can be sent to the PNC according to the business policies
        that have been provisioned statically or dynamically.
        Specifically, it provides mapping and translation of a
        customer's service request into a set of parameters that are
        specific to a network type and technology such that the network
        configuration process is made possible.

     . Virtual service coordination function: This function translates
        customer service-related information into virtual network
        service operations in order to seamlessly operate virtual
        networks while meeting a customer's service requirements. In
        the context of ACTN, service/virtual service coordination
        includes a number of service orchestration functions such as
        multi-destination load balancing, guarantees of service
        quality, bandwidth and throughput. It also includes
        notifications for service fault and performance degradation and
        so forth.

   Section 2 describes a set of TE & service related parameters that
   this document addresses as new and advanced parameters that are not
   included in generic service models. Section 3 discusses YANG
   modeling approach.

2. TE & Service Related Parameters

   While L1/2/3 service models [L1CSM, L2SM, L3SM] are intended to
   provide service-specific parameters for VPN service instances, there
   are a number of TE & Service related parameters that are not
   included in the generic service models.

   Additional service parameters and policies that are not included in
   the aforementioned service models are addressed in the YANG models
   defined in this document.

2.1. VN/Tunnel Selection Requirements

   In some cases, the service requirements may need addition TE tunnels
   to be established. This may occur when there are no suitable
   existing TE tunnels that can support the service requirements, or
   when the operator would like to dynamically create and bind tunnels
   to the VPN such that they are not shared by other VPNs, for example,
   for network slicing. The establishment of TE tunnels is subject to
   the network operator's policies.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping              March 2019


   To summarize, there are three modes of VN/Tunnel selection
   operations to be supported as follows. Additional modes may be
   defined in the future.

        o New VN/Tunnel Binding - A customer could request a VPN
          service based on VN/Tunnels that are not shared with other
          existing or future services. This might be to meet VPN
          isolation requirements. Further, the YANG model described in
          Section 5 of this document can be used to describe the
          mapping between the VPN service and the ACTN VN. The VN (and
          TE tunnels) could be bound to the VPN and not used for any
          other VPN.

          Under this mode, the following sub-categories can be
          supported:

          1. Hard Isolation with deterministic characteristics: A
             customer could request a VPN service using a set of TE
             Tunnels with deterministic characteristics requirements
             (e.g., no latency variation) and where that set of TE
             Tunnels must not be shared with other VPN services and
             must not compete for bandwidth or other network resources
             with other TE Tunnels.

          2. Hard Isolation: This is similar to the above case but
             without the deterministic characteristics requirements.

          3. Soft Isolation: The customer requests a VPN service using
             a set of TE tunnels which can be shared with other VPN
             services.

        o VN/Tunnel Sharing - A customer could request a VPN service
          where new tunnels (or a VN) do not need to be created for
          each VPN and can be shared across multiple VPNs. Further, the
          mapping YANG model described in Section 5 of this document
          can be used to describe the mapping between the VPN service
          and the tunnels in use. No modification of the properties of
          a tunnel (or VN) is allowed in this mode: an existing tunnel
          can only be selected.

        o VN/Tunnel Modify - This mode allows the modification of the
          properties of the existing VN/tunnel (e.g., bandwidth).

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping              March 2019


2.2. Availability Requirement

   Availability is another service requirement or intent that may
   influence the selection or provisioning of TE tunnels or a VN to
   support the requested service. Availability is a probabilistic
   measure of the length of time that a VPN/VN instance functions
   without a network failure.

   The availability level will need to be translated into network
   specific policies such as the protection/reroute policy associated
   with a VN or Tunnel. The means by which this is achieved is not in
   the scope of this draft.

3. YANG Modeling Approach

   This section provides how the TE & Service mapping parameters are
   supported using augmentation of the existing service models (i.e.,
   [L1CSM], [L2SM], and [L3SM]). Figure 1 shows the scope of the
   Augmented LxSM Model.

                           +----------------------------+ reference +----------+



                      Figure 1. Augmented LxSM Model

   The Augmented LxSM model (where x=1,2,3) augments the basic LxSM
   model while importing the common TE & Service related parameters
   (defined in Section 2) grouping information from TE & Service
   Mapping Types. The TE & Service Mapping Types (ietf-te-service-
   mapping-types) module is the repository of all common groupings
   imported by each augmented LxSM model. Any future service models
   would import this grouping file.

   The role of the augmented LxSm service model is to expose the
   mapping relationship between service models and TE models so that
   VN/VPN service instantiations provided by the underlying TE networks

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping              March 2019


   can be viewed outside of the MDSC, for example by an operator who is
   diagnosing the behavior of the network. It also allows for the
   customers to access operational state information about how their
   services are instantiated with the underlying VN, TE topology or TE
   tunnels provided that the MDSC operator is willing to share that
   information. This mapping will facilitate a seamless service
   management operation with underlay-TE network visibility.

   As seen in Figure 1, the augmented LxSM service model records a
   mapping between the customer service models and the ACTN VN YANG
   model. Thus, when the MDSC receives a service request it creates a
   VN that meets the customer's service objectives with various
   constraints via TE-topology model [TE-topo], and this relationship
   is recorded by the Augmented LxSM Model. The model also supports a
   mapping between a service model and TE-topology or a TE-tunnel.

3.1. Forward Compatibility

   The YANG module defined in this document supports three existing
   service models via augmenting while sharing the common TE & Service
   Mapping Types.

   It is possible that new service models will be defined at some
   future time and that it will be desirable to map them to underlying
   TE constructs in the same way as the three existing models are
   augmented.

   Figure 2: L3VPN Architecture from the IP+Optical Network Perspective

   There are three main entities in the ACTN architecture and shown in
   Figure 2.

  . CNC: The Customer Network Controller is responsible for generating
     service requests. In the context of an L3VPN, the CNC uses the
     Augmented L3SM to express the service request and communicate it
     to the network operator.

  . MDSC: This entity is responsible for coordinating a L3VPN service
     request (expressed via the Augmented L3SM) with the IP/MPLS PNC
     and the Transport PNC. For TE services, one of the key
     responsibilities of the MDSC is to coordinate with both the IP PNC
     and the Transport PNC for the mapping of the Augmented L3VPN
     Service Model to the ACTN VN model. In the VN/TE-tunnel binding
     case, the MDSC will need to coordinate with the Transport PNC to
     dynamically create the TE-tunnels in the transport network as
     needed. These tunnels are added as links in the IP/MPLS Layer
     topology. The MDSC coordinates with IP/MPLS PNC to create the TE-
     tunnels in the IP/MPLS layer, as part of the ACTN VN creation.
  . PNC: The Provisioning Network Controller is responsible for
     configuring and operating the network devices. Figure 2 shows two
     distinct PNCs.
       o IP/MPLS PNC (PNC1): This entity is responsible for device
          configuration to create PE-PE L3VPN tunnels for the VPN
          customer and for the configuration of the L3VPN VRF on the PE
          nodes. Each network element would select a tunnel based on
          the configuration.
       o Transport PNC (PNC2): This entity is responsible for device
          configuration for TE tunnels in the transport networks.

   There are four main interfaces shown in Figure 2.

   . CMI: The CNC-MDSC Interface is used to communicate service
     requests from the customer to the operator. The requests may be
     expressed as Augmented VPN service requests (L2SM, L3SM), as
     connectivity requests (L1CSM), or as virtual network requests
     (ACTN VN).
   . MPI: The MDSC-PNC Interface is used by the MDSC to orchestrate
     networks under the control of PNCs. The requests on this interface
     may use TE tunnel models, TE topology models, VPN network
     configuration models or layer one connectivity models.
   . SBI: The Southbound Interface is used by the PNC to control
     network devices and is out of scope for this document.
   . The TE Service Mapping Model as described in this document can be
     used to see the mapping between service models and VN models and
     TE Tunnel/Topology models. That mapping may occur in the CNC if a
     service request is mapped to a VN request. Or it may occur in the
     MDSC where a service request is mapped to a TE tunnel, TE
     topology, or VPN network configuration model. The TE Service
     Mapping Model may be read from the CNC or MDSC to understand how
     the mapping has been made and to see the purpose for which network
     resources are used.

Internet-Draft             TE & Service Mapping              March 2019


   As shown in Figure 2, the MDSC may be used recursively. For example,
   the CNC might map a L3SM request to a VN request that it sends to a
   recursive MDSC.

   The high-level control flows for one example are as follows:

   1. A customer asks for an L3VPN between CE1 and CE2 using the
     Augmented L3SM model.

   2. The MDSC considers the service request and local policy to
     determine if it needs to create a new VN or any TE Topology, and
     if that is the case, ACTN VN YANG [ACTN-VN-YANG] is used to
     configure a new VN based on this VPN and map the VPN service to
     the ACTN VN. In case an existing tunnel is to be used, each device
     will select which tunnel to use and populate this mapping
     information.

   3. The MDSC interacts with both the IP/MPLS PNC and the Transport PNC
     to create a PE-PE tunnel in the IP network mapped to a TE tunnel
     in the transport network by providing the inter-layer access
     points and tunnel requirements. The specific service information
     is passed to the IP/MPLS PNC for the actual VPN configuration and
     activation.

        a. The Transport PNC creates the corresponding TE tunnel
          matching with the access point and egress point.
        b. The IP/MPLS PNC maps the VPN ID with the corresponding TE
          tunnel ID to bind these two IDs.

   4. The IP/MPLS PNC creates/updates a VRF instance for this VPN
     customer. This is not in the scope of this document.

4.1. Service Mapping

   Augmented L3SM and L2SM can be used to request VPN service creation
   including the creation of sites and corresponding site network
   access connection between CE and PE. A VPN-ID is used to identify
   each VPN service ordered by the customer. The ACTN VN can be used
   further to establish PE-to-PE connectivity between VPN sites
   belonging to the same VPN service. A VN-ID is used to identify each
   virtual network established between VPN sites.

   Once the ACTN VN has been established over the TE network (maybe a
   new VN, maybe modification of an existing VN, or maybe the use of an
   unmodified existing VN), the mapping between the VPN service and the
   ACTN VN service can be created.

4.2. Site Mapping

   The elements in Augmented L3SM and L2SM define site location
   parameters and constraints such as distance and access diversity
   that can influence the placement of network attachment points (i.e,
   virtual network access points (VNAP)). To achieve this, a central
   directory can be set up to establish the mapping between location
   parameters and constraints and network attachment point location.
   Suppose multiple attachment points are matched, the management
   system can use constraints or other local policy to select the best
   candidate network attachment points.

   After a network attachment point is selected, the mapping between
   VPN site and VNAP can be established as shown in Table 1.

5. Applicability of TE-Service Mapping in Generic context


   As discussed in the Introduction Section, the models presented in
   this document are also applicable generically outside of the ACTN
   architecture. [RFC8309] defines Customer Service Model between
   Customer and Service Orchestrator and Service Delivery Model between
   Service Orchestrator and Network Orchestrator(s). TE-Service mapping
   models defined in this document can be regarded primarily as
   Customer Service Model and secondarily as Service Deliver Model.

8. Security

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241].  The NETCONF access
   control model [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true") These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
