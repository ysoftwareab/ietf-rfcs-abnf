                DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Source Address Option
                draft-fsc-softwire-dhcp4o6-saddr-opt-01

Abstract

   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] describes a mechanism for dynamically
   configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms, the
   operator must obtain information about the IPv4 address and Port Set
   ID allocated to the DHCP 4o6 client, as well as the /128 IPv6 prefix
   that the client will use as the source of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This
   memo defines a DHCPv6 container option and two DHCPv6 sub-options
   used to communicate the source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP
   4o6 client and server.  It is designed to work in conjunction with
   the IPv4 address allocation process.

1.  Introduction

   Deterministic IPv4-over-IPv6 transition technologies are prescriptive
   in the location of the tunnel endpoint within the home network.  The
   tunnel endpoint should usually be configured on either the home
   gateway device, or sourced from a specific IPv6 tunnel prefix
   allocated to the home network (and in some cases, both).
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] describes a DHCPv6 based mechanism for
   provisioning such deterministic softwires.

   This document describes a mechanism for informing the service
   provider of the binding between the dynamically allocated IPv4
   address and Port Set ID (learnt through DHCPv4 over DHCPv6) and the
   IPv6 address that the Softwire Initiator will use for accessing IPv4-
   over-IPv6 services.  It is used with DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341]
   message flows to communicate the binding over the IPv6-only network.
   The service provider can then use this binding information to
   provision other functional elements in their network accordingly,
   e.g. using the client's binding information to synchronise the
   binding table in the border router.

Internet-Draft            DHCP 4o6 SADDR option           September 2014


   The mechanism allows much more flexibility in the location of the
   IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel endpoint, as the IPv6 address is dynamically
   signalled back to the service provider.  The DHCP 4o6 client and
   tunnel client could be run on end devices attached to any routable
   IPv6 prefix allocated to an end-user, located anywhere within an
   arbitrary home network topology.

   This memo describes extensions to [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] to
   enable the provisioning and tunnel management of softwire initiators
   configured through DHCPv4 over DHCPv6.

   Current mechanisms suitable for extending to incorporate DHCPv4 over
   DHCPv6 with dynamic IPv4 address leasing include
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] and [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Solution Overview

   The solution in this document extends the Softwire46 container
   approach described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] by defining a new
   container type: OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6.  The container is used to
   carry the sub-options necessary for softwire configuration.  A client
   can indicate its support for dynamic softwire configuration by
   including the OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 option code within the Option
   Request Option.

   Two new DHCPv6 sub-options are also defined in this memo:
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT and OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR.  They are
   intended to be used alongside the normal DHCPv4 IPv4 address
   allocation message flow in the context of DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   [RFC7341].

   The communication of parameters between the client and server is two-
   way: OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT can be (optionally) used by the DHCP
   4o6 server to optionally indicate to the client a preferred IPv6
   prefix for binding the received IPv4 configuration and sourcing
   tunnel traffic.  This may be necessary if there are multiple IPv6
   prefixes in use in the customer network, or if the specific IPv4-
   over-IPv6 transition mechanism requires the use of a particular
   prefix for any reason.  When the client has selected the IPv6 address
   to bind the IPv4 configuration to, it passes the address back to the
   DHCP 4o6 server through OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR.

   A softwire client also requires an address (or addresses) for the
   Border Router (softwire tunnel concentrator).  This is used as the
   destination address for the client's IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulated
   traffic.  Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] describes the
   OPTION_S46_BR option.  This option SHOULD be included as an
   encapsulated option within OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6.

   This mechanism MUST be used with DHCPv4 over DHCPv6.  The DHCP client
   MUST request the 4o6 Server Address option first to get DHCPv4 over
   DHCPv6 enabled, as in [RFC7341].  Then the OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6
   MAY be included in DHCPv4-query and DHCPv4-response messages.  If the
   IPv6 source address of the client changes (such as IPv6 lease
   expiration, etc.), the client follows the Section 9 of [RFC7341] to
   reenable the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 function.

   If OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 is used, the option (as well as any
   suboption(s) it contains) MUST be transported in the DHCPv4-query and
   DHCPv4-response messages [RFC7341].

4.  IPv6/IPv4 Binding Message Flow

   The following diagram shows the client/server message flow and how
   the OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 container and its sub-options are used.
   In each step, the relevant DHCPv4 message is given above the arrow
   and the relevant options below the arrow.  The DHCPv4 messages are
   encapsulated in DHCPv4-query or DHCPv4-response message, and those
   options are included in the 'options' field of the DHCPv4-query or
   DHCPv4-response message.

                      IPv6/IPv4 Binding Message Flow

   The DHCP 4o6 Server and Client MAY implement the
   OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 option and its sub-options.  A client that
   intends to dynamically configure softwires SHOULD include the option
   code for OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 in the DHCPv6 ORO alongside the
   DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER message.  This container option MUST be present,
   along with relevant sub-options, in all subsequent DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   transactions for the lifetime of the IPv4 address lease.
   OPTION_S46_BR SHOULD also be included in the container.

   When a DHCP 4o6 Server replies with a DHCPOFFER message, it SHOULD
   include an OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 option containing OPTION_S46_BR.
   It MAY also include OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT.  The
   OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR_HINT is used by the server to indicate a
   preferred prefix that the client should use to bind IPv4
   configuration to.  If this sub-option is received, the client MUST
   perform a longest prefix match between cipv6-prefix-hint and all
   configured prefixes on the device.  If a match is found, then the
   selected prefix MUST then be used to bind the received IPv4
   configuration to.  If the client doesn't receive the sub-option, or

   the matching fails, the client can select any valid /128 IPv6 prefix
   to use.

   OPTION_DHCP4O6_SADDR is used by the client to inform the DHCP 4o6
   Server which IPv6 prefix the IPv4 configuration has been bound to.
   The client MUST put the selected IPv6 address into this sub-option
   and include OPTION_S46_CONT_DHCP4O6 in the DHCPv4-response message
   when it sends the DHCPREQUEST message.
