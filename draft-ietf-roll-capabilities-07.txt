Internet-Draft              RPL Capabilities              September 2020


1.  Introduction

   RPL [RFC6550] specifies a proactive distance-vector based routing
   scheme.  The protocol creates a DAG-like structure which operates
   with a given "Mode of Operation" (MOP) determining the minimal and
   mandatory set of primitives to be supported by all the participating
   nodes.

   This document adds a notion of capabilities, through which a node in
   the network could inform its peers about its additional capabilities.
   This document highlights the differences between capabilities and
   Mode of Operation and explains the necessity for the former.

1.1.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   MOP: Mode of Operation.  Identifies the MOP of the RPL Instance as
   administratively provisioned at and distributed by the DODAG root.

   MOPex: Extended MOP: As defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-mopex].

   Capabilities: Additional features or capabilities that are supported
   by the node.

   Cap: Abbreviated term used for Capability.

   Caps: Abbreviated term used for Capabilities.

   DAO: DODAG Advertisement Object.  A RPL (pronounced ripple) message
   used to advertise the target information in order to establish
   routing adjacencies.

   DIO: DODAG Information Object.  A RPL message initiated by the root
   and is used to advertise the network configuration information.

   Current parent: Parent 6LR node before switching to the new path.

   NPDAO: No-Path DAO.  A DAO message that contains a Transit
   Information Option with lifetime equal to 0.

   Upstream path/direction: Path or direction from the node to the Root
   in a DAG.

   Downstream path/direction: Path or direction to the node from the
   Root in a DAG.

Internet-Draft              RPL Capabilities              September 2020


   This document uses terminology described in [RFC6550].  For the sake
   of readability all the known relevant terms are repeated in this
   section.

1.2.  What are Capabilities?

   Currently RPL specification does not have a mechanism whereby a node
   can signal the set of features that are available on its end.  Such a
   mechanism could help the root to advertise its capabilities and in
   response also determine some advanced information about the
   capabilities of the joining nodes.  This document defines
   Capabilities which could be supported by the nodes and handshaked as
   part of RPL signaling.  Capabilities are embedded as a RPL Control
   Message Option as defined in Section 6.7 of [RFC6550].

2.  Requirements for this document

   Following are the requirements considered for this documents:

   REQ1:  Optional capabilities handshake.  Capabilities are features,
          possibly optional, which could be handshaked between the nodes
          and the root within an RPL Instance.

   REQ2:  Capabilities handshake could be optionally added with existing
          MOPs.  Capabilities, being optional in nature, could be put to
          use with existing MOPs.  Capabilities and MOP-extension are
          mutually independent i.e. a DIO can have a capabilities
          option, MOP-extension option or both in the same message.

   REQ3:  Capabilities could be explicitly queried.

2.1.  How are Capabilities different from existing RPL primitives?

   The Mode of Operation (MOP) field in RPL mandates the operational
   requirement for the nodes joining as routers.  MOP and DIO
   Configuration Option is strictly controlled by the Root node in RPL.
   Intermediate 6LRs cannot modify these fields.  Also, the MOP never
   changes for the lifetime of the RPL Instance.  Changes in DIO
   Configuration Option are possible but are rare.  Capabilities, on the
   other hand, might change more dynamically.

   RPL DIO message also carries routing metrics and constraints as
   specified in [RFC6551].  Metrics and constraints are used in addition
   to an objective function to determine a node's rank calculation.  A
   router may use capabilities carried in DIO message as additional
   metrics/constraints.  However, capabilities have a larger scope and
   may be carried in messages other than DIO and can flow in either
   direction (upstream and downstream).

3.  Capabilities

   Handling of Capabilities MUST be supported if the network uses MOPex
   [I-D.ietf-roll-mopex].

   Note that capabilities and MOPex are mutually exclusive and it is
   possible for an implementation to support either or both of the
   options.

3.1.  Capability Control Message Option

                       Figure 1: Capabilities Option

   Multiple capabilities can be sent in the same message.  The length
   field allows the message parser to skip the capability TLV parsing.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                        Figure 2: Capabilities TLV

   Every capability is identified by its type and it may have an
   optional Capability Info.  Note that a given capability may or may
   not be disseminated with additional information depending on the
   scope of the capability indicated by the I bit.

   Len: 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length in octets of the
   TLV, not including the CapType, Length and Flags fields.

   J = Join only as leaf if capability not understood.

   I = Ignore the message if this capability is not understood.

   C = Flag indicating that the capability MUST be copied in the
   downstream message.

3.2.  Capabilities Handshake

   The root node can advertise the set of capabilities it supports in
   the DIO message.  A node can take advantage of the knowledge that the
   root supports a particular capability.  Similarly a node can
   advertise its capabilities in the DAO message using the capability
   control message option defined in this document.  Capabilities
   advertised by non-root nodes are strictly a subset of the
   capabilities advertised by the root.

   In storing MOP, the DAO message from the 6LR can contain multiple
   target options because of the DAO-Aggregation.  The targets of the
   capabilities option are indicated by one or more Target options that
   precede the Capabilities Option.  This handling is similar to the
   Transit Information Option as supported in Section 6.7.8. of
   [RFC6550].

4.  Querying Capabilities

   Nodes may be interested in knowing the capabilities of another node
   before taking an action.  For example, consider
   [I-D.ietf-roll-dao-projection], in which the Root may want to know
   the capabilities of the nodes along a network segment before it
   initiates a projected DAO to install the routes along that segment.

   Caps can be carried in existing RPL Control messages as Control
   Options, however Caps can also be queried explicitly.  This section
   provides a way for a node to query the capability set of another
   node.  The capability query and subsequent response messages are
   directly addressed between the two peers.

4.1.  Capability Query (CAPQ)

     0                   1                   2                   3

   CAPQSequence:  One byte, Sequence number sent by the CAPQ sender and
       reflected back by the responder in the CAPS message.

   Flags:  One byte, set to zero by sender, ignored by receiver.

   reserved:  One byte, set to zero by sender, ignored by receiver.

   The CAPQ base object may be followed by one or more options.  The
   Capability Type List Control Option (see Figure 4) is used to carry a
   set of capability types to query about.

   If the sender does not send a Capability Type List Control Option,
   this indicates that the node intends to query the Capability Type
   List supported by the target node.

4.1.1.  Capability Type List Control Option

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 4: Capability Type List Control Option

4.1.2.  Secure CAPQ

   A Secure CAPQ message follows the format in [RFC6550] Figure 7, where
   the base message format is the CAPQ message shown in Figure 3.

4.1.3.  Base rules for CAPQ handling

   A CAPQ message may get dropped or lost in the transit.  The sender of
   CAPQ MAY retry the CAPQ message after some delay.  The delay SHOULD
   NOT be less than 1 second.

4.2.  Capability Set Response (CAPS)

     0                   1                   2                   3

   CAPQSequence:  One byte, Sequence number copied from CAPQSequence
       received in the CAPQ message.

   CAPS message SHOULD contain the capability set Figure 1 queried by
   the CAPQ sender.  If the target node does not support a subset of the
   queried capabilities then the Capability Type List with the
   unsupported cap-types SHOULD be sent back indicating the queried
   capabilities not-supported by the target node.  For an example, check
   Appendix A.3

   If the CAPQ message does not contain any Capability Type List option
   then the receiver MUST respond with the cap types it supports using a
   Capability Type List Option (see Figure 4).

   If the capability set cannot be transmitted in a single message (for
   e.g., because of MTU limitations) then multiple CAPS messages could
   be used.  All the CAPS messages MUST use the same CAPQSequence number
   copied from the corresponding CAPQ message.

4.2.1.  Secure CAPS

   A Secure CAPS message follows the format in [RFC6550] Figure 7, where
   the base message format is the CAPS message shown in Figure 5.

5.  Guidelines for defining new capabilities

   This section provides guidelines/recommendations towards defining new
   capabilities.  Note that the capabilities might be carried as part of
   the multicast messaging such as DIO and hence the set should be used
   sparingly, as much as possible.

5.1.  Handling Capability flags

   A node MUST drop or discard the message with an unknown capability
   with the 'D' flag set.  The message MUST be discarded silently.

   The 'J' (join) flag can be set in context to a capability either by a
   6LR or the root.  The 'J' flag indicates that if the capability is
   not supported by a node then it can join the instance only as a 6LN
   (or do not join as 6LR).

   The 'C' (copy) flag is set by the node indicating that the
   capabilities MUST be copied downstream by the node even if the node
   does not understand the capability.

Internet-Draft              RPL Capabilities              September 2020


5.1.1.  Rules to handle capabilities flag
   On receiving a capability it does not support, the node MUST check
   the 'J' flag of the capability before joining the Instance.  If the
   'J' flag is set then it can only join as a 6LN.
   If the node is operating as 6LR and subsequently it receives a
   capability from its preferred parent which it does not understand
   with 'J' flag set, then the node has to switch itself to 6LN mode.
   During switching, the node needs to inform its downstream peers of
   its changed status by sending a DIO with infinite rank as mentioned
   in RFC6550.  Alternatively, a node may decide to switch to another
   parent with compatible and known capabilities.
   Capabilities are used to indicate a feature that is supported by the
   node.  Capabilities are not meant for configuration management for
   e.g., setting a threshold.

6.  Node Capabilities

6.1.  Capability Indicators

   Capability Indicators indicate the capabilities supported by the node
   in the form of simple flags.  Capabilities that do not need
   additional information to be specified can make use of these flags to
   indicate their support.

6.1.1.  Format of Capability Indicators

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | CapType=0x01  |     Len       |J|I|C|   Flags |T|..Indicators..
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 6: Capability Indicators TLV

   Flags: LRs MUST set it to 0.  I bit will always be set to 0.

   T flag (Bit 1): Indicates whether the node supports 6LoRH [RFC8138].

6.2.  Routing Resource Capability

   Storing Mode of Operation requires each intermediate router in the
   LLN to maintain routing state information in the routing table.  LLN
   routers typically operate with constraints on processing power,
   memory, and energy (battery power).  Memory limits the size of
   routing state an LR and BR can maintain.  When the routing table of
   an LR or BR is full, it will either reject the new DAO messages
   received or will use some replacement policy to remove a routing
   entry and add the new one.  Rejection of DAO messages will lead to an

   increase in DAO message transmission that impacts the energy and
   network convergence time.  Routing state replacement leads to
   downward path downtime.

   One possible way to solve problems due to routing table size
   constraint is to use this information to add neighbors to the DAO
   parent set.  Routing resource capability can be used by LR and BR to
   advertise their current routing table usage details in the network.
   LR or LNs in LLN can use this information in the selection of the DAO
   parent set.  PCE can use this information to select intermediate
   routers for the projected routes.  Routing Resource is an optional
   capability.

   Routing resource capabablity sent in DIO message has link local scope
   and it MUST not be forwarded.  The 'C' bit of this capability MUST be
   set to 0.

8.3.  New Registry for CAPQ Flags

   IANA is requested to create a registry for the Capabilities flags as
   described in Section 4.1 of this document.  This registry should be
   located in TODO.  New Capabilities flags may be allocated only by an
   IETF review.  Currently no flags are defined by this document.  Each
   value is tracked with the following qualities:

   o  Flag

   o  Description

   o  Defining RFC

8.4.  New Registry for Capabilities Flags

   IANA is requested to create a registry for the Capabilities flags as
   described in Section 2.1 of this document.  This registry should be
   located in TODO.  New Capabilities flags may be allocated only by an
   IETF review.  Currently no flags are defined by this document.  Each
   value is tracked with the following qualities:

   o  Flag

   o  Description

   o  Defining RFC

8.5.  New Registry for Capabilities Indicators

   IANA is requested to create a registry for the Capabilities
   Indicators as described in Section 6.1 of this document.  This
   registry should be located in TODO.  New Capabilities indicators may
   be allocated only by an IETF review.  Each value is tracked with the
   following qualities:

   o  Flag

   o  Description

   o  Defining RFC

9.  Security Considerations

   The options defined in this document are carried in the base message
   objects as defined in [RFC6550].  The RPL control message options are
   protected by the same security mechanisms that protect the base
   messages.

   Capabilities flag can reveal that the node has been upgraded or is
   running a old feature set.  This document assumes that the base
   messages that carry these options are protected by RPL security
   mechanisms and thus are not visible to a malicious node.

   [TODO] implications of malicious attack involving setting the
   capability flags.

                     Partial Capability Set handshake

   Assume that Root queries for capabilities {Cap1, Cap2, Cap3, Cap4}
   from the peer node.  However the peer node does not support or does
   not understand capability {cap1, cap4}. In this case the peer node
   will respond back with value of Cap2 and Cap3 (which it understands)
   and set the CapTypeList option with {Cap1, Cap4} type.
