 A unified mobility management protocol framework and DMM gap analysis
                draft-chan-dmm-framework-gap-analysis-00

Abstract

   This draft proposes a unified framework of mobility management in
   terms of abstracted logical functions.  It is shown that mip, pmip,
   and several of their extensions can be expressed in terms of
   different configurations of these logical functions.  Such a unified
   framework provides a convenient view on gap analysis of existing
   protocols, and also on the needed re-configurations of the logical
   functions as well as the needed extensions towards distributed
   mobility management.

1.  Introduction

   While there are research on new protocols for distributed mobility
   management it has also been proposed, e.g., in [Paper-
   Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] and in many other publications, that
   distributed mobility management can be designed using primarily the
   existing mobility management protocols with extensions.  A
   requirement in distributed mobility management is to first use
   existing protocols and their extensions before considering new
   protocol design.

   Mobile IP [RFC6275] , which has primarily been deployed in a
   centralized manner for the hierarchical mobile networks, has numerous
   variants and extensions including PMIP [RFC5213] , hierarchical MIP
   (HMIP) [RFC5380] , Fast MIP (FMIP) [RFC4068] [RFC4988] , Proxy-based
   FMIP (PFMIP) [RFC5949] and more.  These different modifications or
   extensions of MIP have been developed over the years owing to the
   different needs that are found afterwards.

   It is convenient to abstract the functions of existing mobility
   management protocols in terms of logical functions.  Different
   variants of existing mobility management protocols are then different
   design variations of how the logical functions are configured.  The
   result is a convenient framework to perform gap analysis of the
   existing protocols, and to reconfigure these logical functions
   towards various distributed mobility management design.

1.1.  Overview

   Session 3 proposes to decouple the logical functions of a local
   mobility anchor into that of home address allocation, location
   management, and mobility routing.  Such decoupling enables separation
   between the data plane and the control plane, and enables flexibility
   for the implementation to place the logical functions at their most
   appropriate locations.  When using MIP, PMIP, and their extensions,
   the logical functions are a decomposition or classification of the
   functions of these existing mobility protocols.  Yet it provides a
   framework upon which different designs of distributed mobility may be
   constructed.

   Session 4 shows how the different existing protocols can be expressed
   as different design configurations of the generic logical functions.
   In a distributed architecture, the mobility routing function may be
   present in many geographical locations to support dynamic mobility
   management and to route more directly to avoid triangle routing in
   the data plane.  However, the internetwork location management
   function may be kept only at the network where the mobile node is
   running a session using the IP address allocated from that network.

   The individual location management information for a specific mobile
   node may be acquired whenever needed.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in
   this document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6
   base specification [RFC6275] and in the Proxy mobile IPv6
   specification [RFC5213].  These terms include mobile node (MN),
   correspondent node (CN), home agent (HA), local mobility anchor
   (LMA), and mobile access gateway (MAG).

   In addition, this draft introduces the following terms.

   Mobility routing  (MR) is the logical function to intercept packets
      to/from the HoA of a mobile node and to forward the packets, based
      on the internetwork location information, either to the
      destination or to some other network element that knows how to
      forward to the destination.

   Home address allocation  is the logical function to allocate the home
      network prefix or home address to a mobile node.

   Location management  (LM) is the logical function to manage and keep
      track of the internetwork location information of a mobile node,
      which include a mapping of the HoA of the MN to the routing
      address of the MN or another network element that knows how to
      forward packets towards the MN.

      Optionally, one (or more) proxy may exist between LM and MN so
      that the LM function is maintained in the hierarchy LM-proxy-MN.
      Then to the LM, the proxy behaves like the MN; to the MN, the
      proxy behaves like the LM.

   Home network of an application session (or an HoA IP address)  (LM)
      is the network that has allocated the IP address used as the
      session identifier (HoA) by the application being run in an MN.
      Because a MN may run multiple applications each using a different
      HoA, the notion of the home network may be generalized to that of

      an application session rather than that of a MN.



3.  Logical functions of mobility management

   The existing mobility management functions of MIP, PMIP, and HMIP may
   be abstracted into the following logical functions to provide a
   unified framework of existing mobility management and to allow a more
   flexible design to achieve DMM.  These logical functions are as
   follows:

   1.  allocation of home network prefix or HoA to a MN that registers
       with the network;

   2.  mobility routing (MR) function: intercepting packets to/from the
       HoA of the MN and forwarding the packets, based on the
       internetwork location information, either to the destination or
       to some other network element that knows how to forward to the
       destination. and

   3.  internetwork location management (LM) function: managing and
       keeping track of the internetwork location of a MN, which include
       a mapping of the HoA to the mobility anchoring point that the MN
       is anchored to;

       (Optionally, one (or more) proxy may exist between LM and MN so
       that the LM function is maintained in the hierarchy LM-proxy-MN.
       Then to the LM, the proxy behaves like the MN; to the MN, the
       proxy behaves like the LM.)


3.1.  MIP versus PMIP

   MIP and PMIP both employ the same concept of separating session
   identifier and routing address into the HoA and CoA respectively.
   Figure 1 compares (a) MIP and (b) PMIP by showing the destination IP
   address in the network-layer header as a packet traverses from a CN
   to an MN.

   Subsequent packets

   (a) MIP:
   +---+     +---+---+     +---+
   |HoA| --> |HoA|HoA|     |HoA|
   |   |     |   |---|     |---|
   |   |     |   |CoA| ==> |CoA|
   +---+     +---+---+     +---+
    CN         anchor       MN

   (b) PMIP:
   +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+
   |HoA| --> |HoA|HoA|     |HoA|HoA| --> |HoA|
   |   |     |   |---|     |---|   |     |   |
   |   |     |   |C0A| ==> |CoA|   |     |   |
   +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+
    CN         anchor         MAG         MN

   Figure 1.  Network layer in the protocol stack of subsequent packets
   sent from the CN and tunneled to the MAG showing the destination IP
   address as the packet traverses from the CN to the MN.

   The comparison shows that, as far as the data-plane traffic is
   concerned, the route from CN to MN in MIP is similar to the route
   from CN to MAG in PMIP.  The difference is only in replacing the MN
   in MIP with the MAG-MN combination.  Therefore, the architecture
   using MIP can be adapted to the architecture using PMIP by replacing
   the MN with the MAG-MN combination.

   Mobile IP and Proxy mobile IP bundle all these three mobility
   management functions into the home agent or mobility anchor.  When
   all these logical functions are bundled into one single entity known
   as the home agent in Mobile IP and as the local mobility anchor in
   Proxy Mobile IP, having this anchor in only one network results in
   triangle routing as shown in Figure 2.

   Figure 2.  Figure showing the triangle routing problem with a MN and
   a CN in networks which may be close to each other but are far from
   the anchor points (LMA or HA).

   The DMM architecture such as that shown in Figure 6 therefore applies
   equally well to both host-based and network-based mobility
   management.  The difference in the network-based mobility management
   is in inserting a proxy function between the MR and the MN, and this
   function may be located at the access router which then becomes the
   mobile access gateway as that defined in PMIP.

3.2.  Migrating home agents

   A method to solve the triangle routing problem is to duplicate the
   anchor points in many networks (Figure 3) in different geographic
   locations.  In [GHAHA], these anchor points (home agents) announce
   the same IP prefixes using anycast.  The traffic originating from the
   mobile node will then be served by the nearest anchor point, and the
   traffic sent from a correspondent node to the mobile node will be
   intercepted by the anchor point nearest to the correspondent node.
   Therefore both traffic will use the anchor point nearest to where the
   traffic originates, so that triangle routing is avoided.  These
   anchor points may possess identical information about the mobile
   nodes [Paper-Migrating.Home.Agents].  Yet the synchronization of all
   the home agents will then be a challenge [Paper-SMGI].  In addition,
   the amount of signaling traffic needed in synchronizing the home
   agents may become excessive when the number of mobile nodes and the
   number of home agents both increase.

   multiple networks.

   Decoupling the functions of the anchoring point into the logical
   functions allow more flexibility.

3.3.  Separating control and data planes

   As illustrated in Figure 4, having the mobility routing (MR) function
   available in multiple networks will solve the triangle routing
   problem.  It is also evident that the network which has allocated the
   HoA of an MN may also manage the internetwork location information of
   the MN.  Yet pushing this internetwork location management (LM)
   information to all the other networks may be an overkill, especially
   when the mobile node does not always actually communicate with any
   CNs in many other networks.  Keeping the location management function
   at the home network of the HoA will eliminate the need to synchronize
   the location management information in a timely and scalable manner.
   Each network may then maintain the location management information of
   the HoA for which it has allocated the home network prefix.  The
   different such information servers in different networks may work
   together to constitute a distributed database.  That is, the data in
   each server of the distributed database need not be pushed to all the
   other servers but the database system only needs to know which data
   resides in which server.

4.  Gap analysis

4.1.  Existing mobility protocols

   The fifth DMM requirement is on existing mobility protocols.

   REQ5: A DMM solution SHOULD first consider reusing and extending the
   existing mobility protocols before specifying new protocols.

   Abstracting the existing protocol functions into logical functions in
   this draft is a way to see how one can maximize the use of existing
   protocols.  It remains to be seen whether all the DMM requirements
   can be met.  One needs to check the rest of the requirements to check
   for gaps.

4.2.  Compatibility

   The second part of the fourth DMM requirement is on compatibility:

   REQ4: The DMM solution SHOULD be able to work between trusted
   administrative domains when allowed by the security measures deployed
   between these domains.  Furthermore, the DMM solution MUST be able to
   co-exist with existing network deployment and end hosts so that the
   existing deployment can continue to be supported.  For example,
   depending on the environment in which dmm is deployed, the dmm
   solutions may need to be compatible with other existing mobility
   protocols that are deployed in that environment or may need to be
   interoperable with the network or the mobile hosts/routers that do
   not support the dmm enabling protocol.

4.3.  Distributed deployment

   The first DMM requirement is on Distributed deployment IP mobility.

   REQ1:network access and routing solutions provided by DMM MUST enable
   a distributed deployment of mobility management of IP sessions so
   that the traffic can be routed in an optimal manner without
   traversing centrally deployed mobility anchors.

   Multiple MRs are allowed in MIP by simply having an HA for each home
   network.  It is shown in terms of the logical functions as in Figure
   5.

4.4.  Dynamic mobility management

   To see how to avoid traversing centralized deployed mobility anchors,
   let us look at the second requirement on non-optimal routes.

   REQ2: The DMM solutions MUST provide transparency above the IP layer
   when needed.  Such transparency is needed, when the mobile hosts or
   entire mobile networks [RFC3963] change their point of attachment to
   the Internet, for the application flows that cannot cope with a
   change of IP address.  Otherwise the support to maintain a stable

   home IP address or prefix during handover may be declined.

   In order to avoid traveling long routes after the MN has moved to a
   new network, such long routes can be avoided by simply using the new
   network as the home network for new sessions.  The sessions that had
   already started in the previous network would still need to use the
   original network the session had started as the home network.  There
   may then be different IP sessions using different IP prefixes/
   addresses in the same MN.

   The capability to use different IP addresses for different IP
   sessions are therefore needed.

   The assoication with the HoA of a MN is not sufficient to support the
   above use of IP for an application.  This gap can be overcome by
   generalization the concept of HoA to that of an application running
   on the MN rather than the MN as will be discussed in Section 6.1
   below.

   Using the dynamic mobility management scheme has avoid routing back
   to the home network when the application does not have such need.
   There are however application sessions that had originated from a
   prior network and that also requires mobility support.  Longer routes
   than the natural IP route can be encountered.  Route optimization
   schemes already exist, but one needs to deal with multiple HA's when
   using multiple HA's.

4.5.  Route optimization

   One generalization in terms of the unified framework is that the LM
   functions can be considered as a distributed database as will be
   shown in the next section.  There, the MN and the LM has a client-
   server relationship, with optionally a proxy in between and the proxy
   can co-locate with an MR.  A distributed database may have different
   servers to store different data.  Yet, each client needs to be able
   to query the database.

   The existing functions such as BU and BA can be considered as the
   database function to update a record.  Completing the design of
   messages of the database functions will enable the distributed
   database design.

   In the unified scheme complete with database function and mobility
   routing function, numerous route optimizations can be designed as
   described in Section 7.

4.6.  IPv6 deployment

   The third DMM requirement on IPv6 deployment

   REQ3: The DMM solutions SHOULD target IPv6 as primary deployment and
   SHOULD NOT be tailored specifically to support IPv4, in particular in
   situations where private IPv4 addresses and/or NATs are used.

   is not an issue with the MIPv6, PMIPv6 and their extensions.  Using
   the unified scheme here based on abstracting these existing protocol
   functions will meet the DMM requirements.

4.7.  Security

   The first part of the fourth requirement as well as the sixth DMM
   requirement are on security considerations.

   REQ6: The protocol solutions for DMM MUST consider security, for
   example authentication and authorization mechanisms that allow a
   legitimate mobile host/router to access to the DMM service,
   protection of signaling messages of the protocol solutions in terms
   of authentication, data integrity, and data confidentiality, opti-in
   or opt-out data confidentiality to signaling messages depending on
   network environments or user requirements.

   are on security.  It is preferred that these security requirements be
   considered as an integral part of the DMM design.


5.  Multiple MRs and distributed LM database

   The different use case scenarios of distributed mobility management
   are described in [I-D.dmm-scenario] as well as in [Paper-
   Distributed.Mobility.Review].  The architecture described in this
   draft is mainly on separating the data plane and the control plane.

   Fig. 6 shows an architecture of DMM.  The figure shows, as an
   example, three networks.  Each network has its own IP prefix
   allocation function which is not explicitly shown in the figure.  In
   the data plane, the mobility routing function is distributed to
   multiple locations at the MRs so that routing can be optimized.  In
   the control plane, the MRs may signal with each other, and the LM
   function is a distributed database, with multiple servers, of the
   mapping of HoA to CoA.

   Figure 6.  A distributed architecture of mobility management.

   To perform mobility routing, the MRs need the location information
   which is maintained at the LMs.  The MRs are therefore the clients of
   the LM servers and may also send location updates to the LM as the
   MNs perform handover.  The location information may either be pulled
   from the LM servers by the MR or pushed to the MR by the LM servers.
   In addition, the MR may also cache a limited amount of location
   information.

   This figure shows three MRs (MR1, MR2, and MR3) in three networks.
   MN11 has moved from the first network supported by MR1 and LM1 to the
   third network supported by MR3 and LM3.  It may use an HoA (HoA11)
   allocated to it when it was in the first network for those
   application sessions that had already started when MN11 was attached
   there and that require session continuity after handover to the third
   network.  When MN11 was in the first network, no location management
   is needed so that LM1 will not keep an entry of HoA11.  After MN11
   has performed handover to the third network, the database server LM1
   keeps a mapping of HoA11 to MR3.  That is, it points to the third
   network and it is the third network that will keep track of how to

   reach MN11.  Such an hierarchical of mapping can avoid frequent
   update signaling to LM1 as MN11 performs intra-network handover
   within the third network.  In other words, the concept of
   hierarchical mobile IP [RFC5380] is applied here but only in location
   management and not in routing in the data plane.


6.  Dynamic mobility management

   The above distributed architecture, which has an MR and an HoA
   allocation function in each network, enables dynamic mobility
   management.

   When new applications are started after moving to a new network, the
   device can simply use a new IP address allocated by the new network.
   Dynamic mobility management, i.e., invoking mobility management only
   when needed, has been proposed in [Paper-
   Distributed.Dynamic.Mobility].

   [I-D.seite-dmm-dma] describes the dynamic mobility management using
   PMIP.  There the MR, LM, and the HoA allocation functions are co-
   located at the access router in a flattened network.

   [Paper-Net.based.DMM], or equivalently the draft [I-D.seite-dmm-dma],
   also describes dynamic mobility management in which the MR and the
   HoA allocation function are both co-located at the access router
   whereas the LM information in each of these access routers are linked
   together under the hierarchy of a centralized LM server.

   [I-D.ma-dmm-armip] again describes dynamic mobility management in
   which the MR and the HoA allocation function are both co-located at
   the access router.

   The distributed mobility architecture compared with a centralized
   approach is more convenient to achieve dynamic mobility management.
   In Fig. 6 above, the LM function and the IP address allocation
   function may communicate with each other or may co-locate.  The
   device MN11 may simply be using a dynamic IP address which is leased
   from the network with a finite lifetime of say 24 hours.  As MN11
   leaves the first network and attaches to the third network, it may or
   may not have ongoing sessions requiring session continuity.  If it
   does not, there is no need for LM1 to keep the binding.  If it does,
   it may use the existing MIP signaling mechanism so that the LM1 will
   keep the binding HoA11:MR3.  When all the ongoing sessions requiring
   session continuity have terminated, it is possible for MN11 to
   deregister with LM1.  Yet one may not assume the device will always
   perform the de-registration.  Alternatively the lease of the dynamic
   IP address HoA11 will expire upon which LM1 will remove the binding.

Internet-Draft              DMM-Architecture                   July 2012


   In the event that the ongoing session outlives the lease of the
   HoA11, MN11 will need to renew the lease with the IP address
   allocation function in the first network.

6.1.  Home network of an application session

   Because a MN may run multiple applications each using a different IP
   address, there can be multiple HoAs belong to different networks.
   Therefore the notion of home network may be generalized to that of an
   application session or the IP address used by that session as an HoA.
   Then the home network of an application session is simply the network
   that has allocated the IP address used as the session identifier
   (HoA) by the application run in an MN.


7.  Route optimization mechanisms

   The distributed architecture has already enabled dynamic mobility
   management, as is described in [I-D.seite-dmm-dma], even when the
   routes are not optimized.  Route optimization mechanism can be
   achieved in addition to dynamic mobility.

   With the above architecture, there are a number of ways to enable
   reachability of an MN by packets sent from a CN using the mobility
   routing function.

   The target to avoid unnecessarily long route is the direct route
   instead of a triangular route.  In general, when a packet is sent
   from a CN in one network to a MN in another network, the direct route
   consists of the following 3 routing segments (RS):

   RS1.CN-MR(CN):  the route segment from the CN to the nearest MR;

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN):  the route segment from the MR serving (and
      therefore being closest to) the CN to the MR serving the MN; and

   RS3.MR(MN)-MN:  the route segment from the MR serving the MN to the
      MN.

   One may therefore examine the route optimization mechanism in terms
   of these 3 routing segments.  In the first segment RS1:CN-MR(CN), the
   alternatives are:

   RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast:  Use anycast to route the packet to the
      nearest MR function.  Here, each MR includes all the HoAs in its
      route announcement as if each of them is the destination for the
      HoA.  Such route announcements will affect the routing table such
      that the packet destined to an HoA will be routed to the nearest

Internet-Draft              DMM-Architecture                   July 2012


      MR.  The use of anycast to reach the nearest HA has been used in
      [Paper-Migrating.Home.Agents] but with a different distributed
      architecture of duplicating many HAs.  It is again proposed in
      [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP].

   RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar:  Co-locate the MR function at a convenient
      location to which the packet will always pass.  Such locations may
      be the gateway router or the access router.  This approach will be
      described later.
      It is noted here that in PMIP design in a hierchical network,
      generally, the MAG is at the access router but LMA can be in the
      gateway router of a network.  Whether a distributed mobility
      design enhances the MAG or the LMA may involve quite different
      mechanisms.  Yet when looking at the logical function, it is
      basically the same MR function whether this function co-locates
      with the access router or the gateway router.  This draft
      therefore put both approaches together.  There is however a
      difference that the access router needs to perform proxying
      function when using PMIP.  Yet the logical MR functions are the
      same.
      It is again noted that in flattened network, the access router and
      the gatway router may merge together.  With they are merged, the
      needed function is again the same logical MR function.

   In the second segment RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN), the alternatives are:

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:  The MR query the LM database and use the
      result to tunnel the packet to the MR serving the MN.  In order
      words, the MR pulls the needed internetwork location information
      from the LM server.  There will be a delay owing to the time taken
      to send this query and to receive the reply.  Optionally, before
      receiving the reply, the first packet or the first few packets may
      be forwarded using mip or pmip.  Then the first packet may incur a
      triangle route rather than to wait for the query reply.  After
      receiving the reply, the packet will be tunneled to the MR(MN).
      The result may be cached for forwarding subsequent packets.

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:  The MR routes the first packet to the home
      network using the existing MIP or PMIP mechanism.  It will then be
      intercepted by the MR of the MN which, with the help of LM, knows
      whether the MN has moved to a different network and use the
      mapping in LM to tunnel the packet to the MR of the MN.  Then the
      MR of the MN will inform MR of the CN to tunnel the packet
      directly to the MR of the MN in future.  In order words, after
      MR(CN) has forwarded the first packet to MR(MN), the MR(MN) is
      triggered to push the location information to MR(CN).  The MR of
      the CN may keep this information in its cache memory for
      forwarding subsequent packets.

   In the final segment RS3.MR(MN)-MN, the MR may keep track of the
   location of MN and route to it using its intra-network mobility
   management mechanism.

   Different designs using the above architecture can be made by taking
   different combinations of the different designs in the different
   route segments.  For example, the overall design of DMM may be:

   1.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:

   2.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:

       An example is [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] which is
       explained for network-based mobile IP but is also applicable to
       host-based mobile IP.

   3.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:

       An example is in [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach] or
       [I-D.liu-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach] in which the MR function is
       co-located at the MAG which is usually at the access router.
       Here, when CN is also a MN using PMIP, the packet sent from it
       naturally goes to the access router which takes the logical
       function of MR so that it will query the LM, which resides in the
       LMA.  It then uses the query result to tunnel the packet to the
       MR(MN), which resides in the AR/MAG of the destination MN.  The
       signaling flow and other details are described in the referenced
       draft.

       Another example is in [I-D.jikim-dmm-pmip].  In the signal driven
       approach, the MR is co-located the access router, which is
       considered as an extension of MAG.  The MR, i.e., the extended
       MAG, serving the CN queries the LM and cache the result so that
       it can tunnel packets to the MR serving the destination MN.

       [I-D.dmm-nat-phl] also colocates the MR at the gateways.  The
       gateway which serves the network of transmitting node and where
       the MR is colocated is called the Ingress router, whereas that at
       the network of the MN at the receiving side is called egress
       router.  Instead of tunneling between these 2 gateways, header
       rewrite using NAT is used to forward the packet through the
       internetwork route segment.

   4.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:

       Another example will be described in the next Section.
