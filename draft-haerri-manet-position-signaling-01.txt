Internet-Draft          MANET Position Signaling               July 2008


1.  Introduction

   The generalized packet/message format [PacketBB] specifies a
   signaling format which MANET routing protocols can employ for
   exchanging protocol information.  This format presents the ability to
   express and associate attributes to packets, messages or addresses,
   by way of a general TLV (type-length-value) mechanism.

   The MANET MetricTLV document [MetricTLV] specifies a general metric
   TLV structure compatible with the generalized packet/message format
   and which can be used by MANET protocols that need to use and
   exchange metrics associated with a link or a node.

   Position information is a particular metric that is associated with a
   node and that may be beneficial for MANET protocols as described in
   [GeoProblemStatement].  Position information is usually not a unique
   metric but is associated with other metrics such as speed, azimuth or
   sampling time.  Although the MANET Metric document [MetricTLV] is
   able to specify the individual structure of each of them, due to
   their correlations and the possible different transmission formats
   that are still under discussion, we propose to describe a common
   structure for the exchange of position and mobility information in a
   separate document.

   This document specifies a Mobility structure, which MAY be used by
   any MANET routing protocol that needs to exchange geolocalization
   information using the MANET Metric format and the generalized MANET
   packet/message format.  If it is used as a message TLV, it allows a
   receiving node to obtain the position, the azimuth or the velocity of
   a sending node in a configurable way.  If it is used as an address
   block TLV, it allows a receiving node to obtain the position, the
   azimuth or the velocity of nodes different from the sending node.

2.  Terminology

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

      Additionally, this document uses the terminology from [PacketBB]
      and [MetricTLV], and introduces the following terminology

   GPS -  Global Positioning System.  A geolocalization system
      developped and operated by the US Department of Defense that is
      able to provide accurate worldwide coordinates of devices equiped
      with GPS receivers.  A similar European system is currently under
      developpement under the name of Galileo.  The GPS system does not
      work without a clear access to at least 3 satellites, thus is
      inoperable for indoor positioning.

   GPS-free Positioning -  A set of techniques that has been developped
      in order to provide a mean of localization in situation when a
      clear access to satellites is not possible.  Most of the methods
      uses multilateration techniques and requires either a formal
      training, or an anchor node that knows its accurate position.

   Time -  The universal GPS time expressed in seconds.

   Longitude -  The longitude describes the location of a place on Earth
      east or west of a north-south line called the Prime Meridian
      located in Greenwich, UK.  Longitude is given as an angular
      measurement ranging from 0 degree at the Prime Meridian to +180
      degree eastward and -180 degree westward.

   Latitude -  The latitude gives the location of a place on Earth north
      or south of the equator.  Latitude is an angular measurement
      ranging from 0 degree at the Equator to 90 degree at the poles.

   Elevation -  The elevation is the altitude of an object from a known
      level or datum.  Common datums are mean sea level and the surface
      of the WGS-84 geoid used by GPS.

   Azimuth -  Azimuth is the horizontal component of a direction,
      measured around the horizon, from the north toward the east in the
      northern hemisphere, and from the south toward the west in the
      southern hemisphere.

   Mobility -  mobility information related to a specific address, which
      MAY consist of a longitude, latitude or elevation, a velocity, an
      azimuth, and the time this mobility information has been sampled.

3.  Applicability Statement

   The mobility structure described in this document is applicable in
   conjuction with [MetricTLV] whenever the transmission of the
   position, the velocity or the azimuth of a node or of a set of nodes
   is required by a MANET protocol using the generalized MANET packet/
   message format [PacketBB].

4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification does not describe a protocol, nor does it mandate
   specific node or protocol behavior.  Rather, it describes mechanisms
   for encoding position information using an extension to the TLV
   mechanism of [MetricTLV] and [PacketBB].

   Protocols using the structure specified in this documents MUST
   transmit position information of the local node using a message TLV,
   while general position information of other nodes MUST be encoded
   using an address TLV block.

5.  Representing Position

   This document specifies an extension to the metric TLV structure to
   transmit position information consisting of the 3-tuple longitude,
   latitue and elevation, optionally added with the speed and azimuth of
   a mobile node.

   This document assumes the availability of a GPS (Global Positioning
   System) for the sampling of these informations, but is not limited to
   it as long as any other system is able to provide a similar position
   information format.

   This document proposes to transmit mobility information according to
   the following two structure formats:

   o  A standard format able to support the data format provided by GPS
      devices.

   o  A reduced format that encodes the minimum required mobility data
      in multiples of a byte in order to limit the size of a TLV
      containing mobility information and thus reducing the transmission
      overhead.

   Due to the specificity of position information, all possible values
   MUST be representable.  An exponential representation is therefore
   not possible.  Accordingly, the exprep field specified in [MetricTLV]
   MUST be cleared.

Internet-Draft          MANET Position Signaling               July 2008


6.  Representing Time

   In order to reconstruct the current position or have an estimation of
   the freshness of the position information, this document also
   specifies the transmission of the position sampling time.  As no
   synchronization is assumed in this document, the time shared by all
   nodes using this document MUST be the GPS time.

   GPS (Global Positioning System) time is the atomic time scale
   implemented by the atomic clocks in the GPS ground control stations
   and the GPS satellites themselves.  GPS time is expressed as a number
   of seconds since the beginning of the GPS epoch on Sunday January 6th
   1980 at 0:00 UTC.

   Due to the specificity of the sampling time of position information,
   all possible values MUST be representable.  A time representation
   similar to [TimeTLV] is therefore not possible, and neither is any
   exponential representation.  Accordingly, the exprep field specified
   in [MetricTLV] MUST be cleared.

   The GPS time is usually represented by an 64 bit field.  In order to
   reduce the size of this field, a new reference point common to any
   node in the network may be used instead of the GPS epoch.  Yet, the
   specification of methods to reduce the size of the GPS sampling time
   it is out of scope of this document.  However, this document
   specifies an optional reduced size field of 16 bits for the
   transmission of such reduced information.

7.  Metric TLV containing Position Information

   This specification defines an extended structure for one message
   block TLV structure or one address block TLV structure for the
   inclusion of position information.  When using the structure
   described in this document, both TLV structures MUST have the
   thastypeext bit set to 1 in the tlv-semantics field as defined in
   [PacketBB].

7.1.  Message TLV

   A position metric message TLV SHOULD be used for signaling position
   information associated with the local node.  If a metric message TLV
   is to be included in a message, the originator-address MUST be
   included in the msg-header-info as defined in [PacketBB].

   The <tlv-type-ext> of the metric message TLV is further defined in
   this document :

      The 'exprep' bit of the <m-metric-semantic> as defined in
      [MetricTLV] MUST be cleared, as an exponential representation MUST
      NOT be used for Mobility information.

      The <value-type> field as specified in [MetricTLV] contains a 7
      bit field containing the value type of the metric being coveyed.
      This document proposes the following layout to specify the
      presence of position information:


                 +--------------+------------------------+
                 |   M-value    | Value Representation   |
                 +--------------+------------------------+
                 |      TBD     |     Mobility Metric    |
                 +--------------+------------------------+


                                   Figure 1

7.2.  Address Block TLV

   A position metric address block TLV SHOULD be used for signaling a
   node metric associated with any other node than the local node.

   The <tlv-type-ext> of the metric address block TLV is further defined
   in this document:

Internet-Draft          MANET Position Signaling               July 2008


      The 'exprep' bit of the <m-metric-semantic> as defined in
      [MetricTLV] MUST be cleared, as an exponential representation MUST
      NOT be used for Mobility information.

      The 'outbound' and 'inbound' bits of the <m-metric-semantic> as
      defined in [MetricTLV] MUST be cleared according to the following
      layout:


              +----------+----------+----------------------+
              | Inbound  | Outbound | Value Representation |
              +----------+------+--------------------------+
              |      0   |      0   |    Node Metric       |
              +----------+----------+----------------------+


                                   Figure 2

      The <value-type> field as specified in [MetricTLV] contains a 5
      bit field containing the value type of the metric being coveyed.
      This document proposes the following layout to specify the
      presence of position information:


                +--------------+------------------------+
                |   M-value    | Value Representation   |
                +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                |      TBD     |     Mobility Metric    |
                +--------------+------------------------+


                                   Figure 3

7.3.  Position Information Semantic

   The <value> field of a Metric TLV when the <m-value-type> specifies a
   Mobility metric is encoded according to the following layout


              <value> = {<value-semantic><mobility>}*


   where:

      <value-semantic> is an 8 bit field which describes the stucture of
      the <mobility> tag.

      bit 0 (position bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the position of the local node or of the address in the
         respective address block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1')
         contains position information.

      bit 1 (velocity bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the velocity of the local node or of the address in the
         respective address block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1')
         contains the velocity.

      bit 2 (azimuth bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does not
         contain the azimuth of the local node or of the address in the
         respective address block.  TLVs with this bit set ('1')
         contains the azimuth.

      bit 3 (reduced format bit):  TLV with this bit cleared ('0') does
         not contain position information of the address in the
         respective address block or of the local node using the reduced
         format.  TLVs with this bit set ('1') contains position
         information encoded using a reduced format.

      bits 4-7 are RESERVED  They MUST be cleared ('0')to be in
         conformance with this version of the specification.

      <mobility> is a field containing the mobility parameters.  The
      length of this field may be obtained from the <value-semantic>
      field.  The <mobility> field is specified by:


                 <mobility> = {<pos><azi>?<velo>?<time>}


         where, when the 'reduced format' bit is set:

         <pos> is a 48 bit field containing the coordinates of a node
         following the general layout:


                <pos> = <Longitude><Latitude><Elevation>


         <velo> is an 8 bit field containing the node's velocity in m/s.

         <azi> is an 8 bit field containing the node's azimuth in
         degree.

         <time> is an 16 bit field containing the GPS time in seconds
         when these mobility parameters have been sampled.

         or when the 'reduced format' bit is cleared:

         <pos> is a 96 bit field containing the coordinates of a node
         following the general layout


                     <pos> = <Longitude><Latitude><Elevation>


         <velo> is an 16 bit field containing the node's velocity in
         m/s.

         <azi> is an 16 bit field containing the node's azimuth in
         degree.

         <time> is an 64 bit field containing the GPS time in seconds
         when these mobility parameters have been sampled.

7.3.1.  Constraints

   o  If the bit <azi> is set ('1'), the bit <velo> MUST also be set
      ('1').

   o  The position extension only applies either to message TLVs or to
      address block TLVs consisting of a single and unique address.

   of the Mobility TLVs in this document, and the bit-layout Mobility
   TLVs actually exchanged between nodes.
