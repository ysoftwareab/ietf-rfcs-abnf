Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for a root node to discover the
   leaf nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function
   can then be used for multiplexing/aggregating various applications
   relying on mLDP as the P2MP/MP2MP LSP setup.  Examples of such
   applications are P2MP PW [I-D.draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS
   multicast [I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN multicast
   [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast].

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery          July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes a mechanism for a root node to discover the leaf
   nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function can
   then be used for multiplexing/aggregating various applications
   relying on mLDP as the P2MP/MP2MP LSP setup.  Examples of such
   applications are P2MP PW [I-D.draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS
   multicast [I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN multicast
   [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast].

   In order to impact the mLDP scalability as little as possible, this
   draft provides a discovery mechanism based on a signaling session
   between each leaf and root node.  Each leaf node will report the leaf
   node information to root node through this signaling session.  There
   will be two signaling protocols to be used for leaf node discovery,
   targeted LDP [RFC5036] or BGP auto-discovery using BGP Multiprotocol
   Extensions [RFC4760].  This document will introduce both signaling
   protocols for mLDP leaf discovery, and it depends on the application
   to choose the signaling protocol to use.


2.  Motivation and problem statement

2.1.  mLDP Problem

   [I-D.draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] describes the mechanism for setting up
   mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  One limitation for mLDP is that none of
   the members belonging to a P2MP/MP2MP LSP topology knows all the
   other members of the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  This means that the root node
   cannot get the whole P2MP/MP2MP LSP membership information.  For
   example, with static mLDP based P2MP LSP, a leaf node is configured
   to join one P2MP LSP, but the root node does not know which of the
   leaf nodes are member of this P2MP LSP.  This problem may cause some
   limitation for multiplexing/aggregation applications using mLDP LSPs.

2.2.  Application using MP-BGP

   [I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] describes the mechanism of setting
   up multicast tree in VPLS.  When setting up a inclusive P-Multicast
   tunnel, BGP A-D is used to do the VPLS membership auto-discovery.
   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP will be set up when receiving auto-
   discovery routes through BGP A-D.  The root node will only know the
   mLDP LSP leaf node information which is triggered by the specific BGP
   A-D mechanism.  Let!_s assume that an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP_a
   already exist, (this LSP may have been set up by other mean, e.g,
   static configuration) on the root node, and that LSP_a has the same
   leaf nodes as the P2MP LSP that VPLS multicast BGP A-D tries to set
   up.  The root node does not know the original mLDP based LSP_a leaf

   node information, and will set up mLDP based LSP_b triggered by BGP
   A-D with same root and leaf nodes.

   This causes mLDP based LSP resources waste in the network as it may
   not be necessary to setup two mLDP LSPs with the same root and leaves
   in the same network.  Then multicast VPLS can only aggregate to mLDP
   P2MP/MP2MP LSP which is triggered by its own BGP A-D mechanism.

   There is a similar problem for [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast]
   and L3VPN multicast that can only use mLDP P2MP/MP2MP LSPs to do
   aggregation which are triggered by their own BGP A-D mechanism on
   condition that all PEs advertise BGP A-D.  Because for L3VPN
   multicast, the PE should not originate an Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route
   in one case described in [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] section
   9.1.1.

2.3.  Application using T-LDP

   [I-D.draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw] describes the P2MP PW setup and
   signaling mechanism.  P2MP PW needs P2MP LSP to do multiplexing/
   demultiplexing [I-D.draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements], then root
   node should determine whether this P2MP PW can multiplex to one of
   the already existing P2MP LSP.  If mLDP is used to setup P2MP LSP,
   the root node is required to know leaf node information of mLDP based
   P2MP LSP, then it can determine if there is some leaf overlap between
   P2MP PW and P2MP LSP.  According to the draft, the mLDP based P2MP
   LSP will be triggered by label mapping message on leaf node, hence
   root node will get the mLDP based P2MP LSP leaf nodes information
   through LDP label mapping message.  However, root node of mLDP based
   P2MP LSP does not know any of the leaf node information if the P2MP
   LSP is setup by other application, e.g, static configuration.  Then
   P2MP PW can only multiplex to mLDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP which is triggered
   by LDP label mapping message.

   According to the above analysis, the mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP setup
   by various applications may not be shared for multiplexing/
   aggregation with each other.  The introduction of a leaf discovery
   mechanism for mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP will assist various
   applications to share one P2MP/MP2MP LSP for multiplexing/
   aggregation, especially for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP setup by static
   configuration.


3.  Terminology

   mLDP: Multicast LDP.

   T-LDP: Target LDP.

   P2MP LSP: An LSP that has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress
   LSRs.

   MP2MP LSP: An LSP that connects a set of nodes, such that traffic
   sent by any node in the LSP is delivered to all others.

   Bud LSR: An LSR that is an egress but also has one or more directly
   connected downstream LSRs.

   Ingress LSR: Source of the P2MP LSP, also referred to as root node.

   Egress LSR: One of potentially many destinations of an LSP, also
   referred to as leaf node in the case of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs.

   Transit LSR: An LSR that has one or more directly connected
   downstream LSRs.

   Leaf node: A Leaf node can be either an Egress or Bud LSR when
   referred in the context of a P2MP LSP.  In the context of a MP2MP
   LSP, an LSR is both Ingress and Egress for the same MP2MP LSP and can
   also be a Bud LSR.

   P2MP FEC: The P2MP FEC Element consists of the address of the root of
   the P2MP LSP and an opaque value.

   MP2MP FEC: MP2MP FEC consists of MP2MP downstream FEC and upstream
   FEC Element.

   MP FEC: Includes both P2MP FEC and MP2MP FEC.


4.  Leaf discovery mechanism

   It would be beneficial if the mLDP leaf discovery mechanism can reuse
   the same signaling session as the application.  Based on this point,
   this document defines two leaf discovery mechanisms, one is based on
   T-LDP, the other is based on MP-BGP.  Which mechanism will be used
   really depends on the application that mLDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP serves.
   Generally, the application with LDP as the main signaling mechanism,
   e.g, P2MP PW, may use leaf discovery mechanism based on T-LDP, while
   application with MP-BGP as main signaling mechanism, e.g, VPLS
   Multicast[I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN
   Multicast[I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] may use leaf discovery
   mechanism based on MP-BGP.

4.1.  Leaf discovery mechanism based on T-LDP

   This section will introduce the discovery mechanism based on T-LDP
   session.  Each leaf node will report the leaf node information to
   root through this T-LDP session.  It is required that there is a
   T-LDP session existed between each leaf node and root node. mLDP leaf
   discovery function will share the same mLDP P2MP capability described
   in section 2.1 of draft [I-D.draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp].

4.1.1.  Leaf node identifier encoding

   A leaf node identifier TLV will uniquely identify a leaf node in the
   MPLS network.  A new TLV should be defined to attach with P2MP/MP2MP
   FEC Element to identify the leaf node, see the figure below.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   Type: this type of opaque value is to be assigned by IANA.

   Length: The length of address value, determined by the address type.

   Address Family: two octet quantity containing a value from ADDRESS
   FAMILY NUMBERS in [RFC 3232] that encodes the address family.

   Address Length: Length of the Leaf Node Address in octets.

   Leaf Node Address: A host address encoded according to the Address
   Family field.

   The leaf node identifier MUST be sent in LDP notification together
   with P2MP/MP2MP FEC Element.

4.1.2.  Leaf operation status TLV encoding

   There will be two operations for leaf node, add and delete.  It is
   necessary to define a new "leaf node identifier" operation status TLV
   for LDP notification messages.  The operation status TLV is defined

   from the LDP MP Status Value Element, see the figure below.


       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 2

   Type: this type of LDP MP status value element is to be assigned by
   IANA.

   Length: 1 octet for the value.

   Value: 0x01 (to be assigned by IANA): means add operation of "leaf
   node identifier";

   0x02 (to be assigned by IANA): means delete operation of "leaf node
   identifier";

   When the notification message contains the "leaf node identifier"
   operation status TLV, the Leaf Node Identifier TLV and LDP MP FEC TLV
   MUST also be included in the message.  When the node receives the
   notification with "leaf node identifier" operation status TLV, but
   without Leaf Node Identifier TLV or LDP MP FEC TLV, an LDP
   notification with "missing message parameters" status (code 0x16)
   should be generated.

4.1.3.  LDP notification messages

   The Leaf Node Identifier TLV and Leaf operation status TLV SHOULD
   appear in a LDP notification message.  The general format of the
   Notification Message with a Leaf Node Identifier TLV and Leaf
   operation status TLV is:

   The Status TLV status code is used to indicate that LDP MP status
   TLV.  Depending on the actual contents of the LDP MP status TLV, an
   LDP P2MP or MP2MP FEC TLV SHOULD be present to provide the identifier
   of P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

4.1.4.  Node operation

   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP leaf discovery mechanism can be
   operated as follows.

   For every leaf node, there will be a T-LDP session to be setup
   between root and leaf node.  This T-LDP session can be setup
   automatically or manually, which depends on specific implementation.
   The leaf node can automatically initiate T-LDP session with root
   node.  When root node receives target-hello, it can actively send
   target-hello to leaf node, so as to setup T-LDP session
   automatically.

   When the leaf node is triggered to join one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label mapping message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends LDP notification message with MP FEC attached with "leaf
   node identifiers" and operation status TLV "add" to its root node.
   When the root node receives the LDP notification message with MP FEC
   attached with "leaf node identifiers" and operation status TLV "add",
   it will store the leaf node information associated with the specified
   P2MP/MP2MP LSP locally.

   When the leaf node is triggered to leave one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label withdraw message to

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery          July 2010


   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends LDP notification message with MP FEC attached with "leaf
   node identifiers" and operation status TLV "delete" to its root node.
   When the root node receives the LDP notification message with MP FEC
   attached with "leaf node identifiers" and operation status TLV
   "delete", it will delete the leaf node information associated with
   the specified P2MP/MP2MP LSP locally.

   If the LSR receives the label mapping/withdraw message with "leaf
   node identifiers", it will ignore this opaque value or send an LDP
   notification message to the downstream node with "Unknown TLV" status
   (code 0x06).

4.2.  Leaf discovery mechanism based on MP-BGP

   This section will introduce the discovery mechanism based on MP-
   BGP[RFC4760].  Each leaf node will report the leaf node information
   to root through this BGP session.

4.2.1.  mLDP leaf NLRI

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI, called mLDP leaf NLRI.
   Following is the format of the mLDP leaf NLRI:


                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |   mLDP MP FEC Element Length (1 octet)    |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |      mLDP MP FEC Element (Variable)       |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |    Leaf Node Address Length (1 octet)     |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |        Leaf Node Address (Variable)       |
                   +-------------------------------------------+

                                 Figure 4

   mLDP MP FEC Element may either contain P2MP FEC or MP2MP FEC element.
   Leaf Node Address field contains the leaf node IP address, and the
   value of length is 32 if it is IPv4 address, or 128 if it is IPv6
   address.  The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is
   a mLDP MP FEC Element attached with Leaf Node Address.  The mLDP leaf
   NLRI is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages using the MP_REACH_NLRI and
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760].  The [AFI, SAFI] value pair
   used to identify this NLRI is (AFI=26(AFI for MPLS Multicast,
   pending, IANA allocation), SAFI=8(SAFI for mLDP leaf discovery,
   pending IANA allocation)).

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange mLDP leaf NLRI, they must
   use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both are
   capable of properly processing such NLRI.  This is done as specified
   in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol BGP) with an
   AFI of 26 and an SAFI of mLDP leaf discovery.

   The Next Hop field of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute shall be interpreted as
   an IPv4 address, whenever the length of the NextHop address is 4
   octets, and as a IPv6 address, whenever the length of the NextHop
   address is 16 octets.

4.2.2.  Node operation

   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP leaf discovery mechanism can be
   operated as follows.

   When the leaf node is triggered to join one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label mapping message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends BGP UPDATE messages with MP_REACH_NLRI to its root node.
   The mLDP leaf NLRI will set Leaf Node Address to leaf node IP
   address, and next hop field to leaf node identifier.  When the root
   node receives BGP UPDATE messages with MP_REACH_NLRI, it will store
   the leaf node information associated with the specified P2MP/MP2MP
   LSP locally.

   When the leaf node is triggered to leave one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label withdraw message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends BGP UPDATE messages with MP_UNREACH_NLRI to its root node.
   The mLDP leaf NLRI will set Leaf Node Address to leaf node IP
   address, and next hop field to leaf node identifier.  When the root
   node receives BGP UPDATE messages with MP_UNREACH_NLRI, it will
   delete the leaf node information associated with the specified P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP locally.

   To constrain distribution of the mLDP leaf NLRI to the AS of the
   advertising PE the BGP Update message originated by the advertising
   PE SHOULD carry the NO_EXPORT Community [RFC1997].


5.  Scalability

   For the application that uses T-LDP to do leaf discovery, all the
   leaf nodes have to setup T-LDP session to root node.  There may be
   too many T-LDP sessions that have to be setup on the root node in the
   network, which will cause some scalability problem.  This problem is
   caused by the application and out of scope of this draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the multicast LDP
   specification, as described in [I-D. draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp], and
   MP-BGP, as described in [RFC4760].


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  LDP

   This document creates a new name space (the LDP MP Opaque Value
   Element type) that is to be managed by IANA, and the allocation of
   the value for leaf operation status "add/delete".

   This document requires allocation of one opaque value type: 1.  Leaf
   node identifier type "C requested value 0x03

   This document requires allocation of one LDP MP status TLV type: 1.
   Leaf operation status TLV "C requested value 0x01

7.2.  MP-BGP

   This document requires allocation of a new BGP AFI and SAFI.

   A new AFI is allocated for MPLS Multicast function, the requested
   value has been pre-allocated as 26.

   A new BGP SAFI for "Network Layer Reachability Information used for
   mLDP leaf discovery" from the IANA "Subsequence Address Family
   Identifiers (SAFI)" registry.  The requested value has been pre-
   allocated as 8.
