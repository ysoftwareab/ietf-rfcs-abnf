   Allowing Synchronisation Source (SSRC) and Timestamp Rewriting in
                Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferencing (PERC)
                       draft-grozev-perc-ssrc-00

Abstract

   Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferenceing allows middle boxes (MDs) to
   overwrite a certain set of fields in RTP packets, as long as they
   preserve their original values in the Original Header Block (OHB).
   This draft discusses the option of extending the OHB so that it would
   also include the RTP timestamp and Synchornization Source identifier
   (SSRC) within the set of fields an SSRC can modify.

1.  Introduction

   In multi-endpoint RTP conferences, packet forwarding middleboxes
   (e.g.  Selecting Forwarding Units (SFUs)) adapt to variable bandwidth
   conditions by selectively dropping a subset of the packets when
   forwarding traffic to some or all recipients.  These dropped packets
   may correspond to certain participants, but more importantly
   simulcast layers.

   A common model for implementing simulcast consists in having senders
   send multiple resolutions to the middlebox, each with its own SSRC,
   as well as distinct sequence number and timestamp spaces.
   Middleboxes on the other hand, often choose to only make receivers
   aware of a single SSRC, timestamp and sequence number space, as shown
   on the figure below.


    +------+                     +-----+                     +--------+
    |      |--SSRC1 Timestamp1-->|     |                     |        |
    |Sender|--SSRC2 Timestamp2-->| SFU |--SSRC4 Timestamp4-->|Receiver|
    |      |--SSRC3 Timestamp3-->|     |                     |        |
    +------+                     +-----+                     +--------+


                      Figure 1: Trickle State Updates

   The advantage of this model consists in the fact that receivers
   require no custom logic to support it as all they ever see is a
   single incoming video stream.

Internet-Draft                SSRC rewrite                    March 2017


   In its current state the PERC double specification does not allow for
   SSRC and timestamps to be overwritten, which makes it impossible for
   SFUs to continue operating in this manner.  This document therefore
   defines an extended OHB format and explains the specifics of
   implementing SSRC and timestamp rewriting within a PERC environment.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Extended Original Header Block (OHB) Format

   The OHB header extension is defined in the "double" draft
   [I-D.ietf-perc-double].  The current version defines a structure
   which can contain atmost the original RTP Payload Type (PT) and SEQ
   fields, and this restricts the MD to only modifying thesetwo fields,
   while, as explained before, for the simulcast usecase the MD may also
   need to modify the SSRC and the timestamp.

   This specification extends the OBH structure so that it can contain
   the additional fields needed for the WebRTC 1.0 simulcast use case.
   It still uses the 4-bit length field of the header extension header
   [RFC5285] to encode the structure of the remainingbytes.
   Specifically, it encodes which of these four fields will be present
   in the following bytes: Payload Type (PT, 1 byte, including an extra
   R-bit), Sequence Number (SEQ, 2 bytes), SSRC(4 bytes), Timestamp (TS,
   4 bytes).

   If the length field has a value of 0, 1 or 2 (indicating that there
   are respectively 1, 2 or 3 more bytes), then the format is exactly
   the same as in the current draft.  This means that an endpoint which
   implements the extended format can workwith the current format
   without modification.

   The following table lists the fields which are encoded (and the order
   in which they are included) for the different values of the length
   field and the R-bit.  The R-bit is the most significant bit (MSB) of
   the PT field, and is present if and only if the PT field is present.
   If the extension includes the PT field, it consists of an R-bit (MSB)
   and 7 bits for the original RTP Payload Type.  The R-bit is used to
   encode which fields are included, when there is ambiguity.

                           Figure 2: OHB Fields

   The fields encoded in the OHB header extension, for different values
   of the length field and the R-bit.

4.  Alternative format

   In the context of SVC an MD might need to modify the M bit of RTP
   packets (for example when the higher layers of a frame are dropped,
   and the frame terminates "early").

   The original format from the "double" draft [I-D.ietf-perc-double],
   as well as the format described above don't allow for the M bit to be
   modified.

   One more bit of information which may be desired to be transported
   from a PERC sender to an MD is whether a packet contains actual
   payload, or consists only of padding (i.e. discardable data).

   These two bits can be transported with the following alternative
   format for the OHB header extension:


          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |   ID  |  len  |P|S|s|T|M|p|0 0|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

      P specifies the presence of a Payload Type byte.

      S specifies the presence of a Sequence Number field (2 bytes).

      s specifies the presence of a SSRC field (4 bytes).

      T specifies the presence of a Timestamp field (4 bytes).

      M contains the original value of the M bit.

      p is a padding-only bit, which indicates that the packet contains
      only padding and can be discarded.

5.  Security Considerations

6.  Acknowledgements

   Sergio Garcia Murillo raised the need for MDs to overwrite the M-bit
   and suggested the alternative extra-byte encoding described in
   Section 4.
