Internet-Draft               SIPS Guidelines                  April 2006


1.  Introduction

   The use of the SIPS URI scheme and of TLS is somewhat underspecified
   in SIP [3] and has been the source of confusion for implementors.
   The usage of SIPS in various fields such as "Request-URI", "To",
   "From", "Contact" in different methods (e.g., REGISTER and INVITE),
   and how it relates to the chosen transport has been particularly
   confusing.  This draft complements another draft that discusses the
   use of TLS in SIP [9].

   This document provides clarifications and guidelines concerning the
   use of the SIPS URI scheme and TLS.

   Section 7 [11] also summarizes key points regarding SIPS and TLS,
   scattered through RFC 3261.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Upgrading and dowgrading between SIP and SIPS

   RFC 3261 allows for "upgrading" any SIP URI to a SIPS URI if it is
   desired to communicate securily.  It is quite possible that a request
   will be rejected with response code 416 (either because TLS is not
   supported, or because the policy is to never support secure
   transport).  When 416 is received, the request could be re-attempted
   with a SIP URI, but the user should be informed.

   Upgrading a SIP to a SIPS URI AOR is very useful when registering.
   It allows for a UAC to register both SIP and SIPS contacts in a
   single registration (with multiple contacts) against a single SIP AOR
   (registrations only allows for single AOR, but multiple contacts).
   The registrar, upon seeing both a SIP and SIPS contact (potentially
   prioritized with a proper q-value), and a single SIP AOR MUST infer
   that the user is reachabe with a SIPS AOR consisting of the same AOR
   as the SIP URI, but with the scheme changed from "sip" to "sips".

   OPEN ISSUE: Should we make the previous statement about infering a
      SIPS AOR from a SIP AOR a MUST or a SHOULD for the registrar?  The
      problem with making it a SHOULD is that some registrars might then
      expect 2 registrations, one for the SIP AOR, another one for the
      SIPS AOR.  This is quite wasteful.  Furthermore, it would be an
      issue for SIP device manufacturers: if they want their device to



Audet                    Expires October 6, 2006                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIPS Guidelines                  April 2006


      be reachable with both a SIP and a SIPS URI, and the type of
      registrar is not known, the device will have to perform 2
      registration.  This is quite troublesome because it is very
      inexpensive for the device to do so, but very expensive for the
      registrar, even if it is a "good" registrar that follows the
      SHOULD.
   However, when registering a Contact, a UAC MUST explicitely register
   both the SIP and SIPS contacts if it expects to be contacted using
   either SIP or SIPS.  Similarly, a registrar SHOULD NOT "upgrade" SIP
   contacts to SIPS contacts because it may create situations where a
   contact is not reachable anymore by other users.

   RFC 3261 however does not allow for "downgrading" from SIPS to SIP.
   That being said, it is possible that redirect server or UAS send a
   3XX response to a request to a SIPS URI with a Contact containing a
   SIP URI.  Section 8.1.3.4/RFC 3261 recommends that if the UAC decide
   to recurse to the SIP URI, it SHOULD inform the user.

   OPEN ISSUE: When a proxy is handling the 3XX, it can obviously not
      indicate anything to the user that it is recursing from SIPS to
      SIP.  It is not clear what the proxy should do: should it forward
      the 3XX to the user?  Should it just ignore the 3XX?


4.  Registration

   When an AOR is assigned, it must be determined what policy will be
   used for reachability.

      AOR is to be reachable only with secure transport
      AOR is to be reachable preferably with secure transport
      AOR is to be reachable only without secure transport
   This section provides examples on how the various SIP and SIPS URIs
   used in different headers should be used for providing these
   policies.

   The UAC registers, including Contact values in the REGISTER for each
   transport it supports, using a q-value to prioritize the transports.
   The Registrar responds to the REGISTER with a 200 OK listing all the
   successfully registered contacts.  Note that the Registrar may decide
   to accept one or many of the listed contacts.  Sometimes, it makes
   more sense for the Registrar to only accept one Contact: for example,
   the registrar may decide to only use the most secure transport when
   supported.  Another reason for only using one transport is when SIP
   is used with outbound connections (i.e., client initiated) [8].

   In the examples in this section, it is assumed that TLS is the only
   mechanism used for securing SIP.  RFC 3261 provides a lot of "escape

   clauses" which are meant to be used when the last hop is secured with
   other means than TLS (e.g., IPsec in some network environments).
   Those escape clauses have been confusing implementors who are using
   TLS as the main means of security SIP.

4.1.  AOR is to be reachable only with secure transport

   If an AOR is to be reachable only with secure transport, the AOR MUST
   be a SIPS AOR, and so MUST the contacts and the Request-URI.  The Via
   header MUST indicate TLS.  TLS transport MUST be used to perform the
   registration.

          REGISTER sips:registrar.example.com;transport=tcp SIP/2.0
          Via: SIP/2.0/TLS bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds
          Max-Forwards: 70
          To: Bob <sips:bob@example.com>
          From: Bob <sips:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
          CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
          Contact: <sips:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp
          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

   The registrar responds with a 200 OK as follows:

          SIP 2.0 200 OK
          Via: SIP/2.0/TLS bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds;
               received=192.0.2.4
          To: Bob <sips:bob@example.com>;tag=2493K59K9
          From: Bob <sips:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
          CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
          Contact: <sips:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp
          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

   The registrar MUST respond to the REGISTER using the same TLS
   connection.

4.2.  AOR is to be reachable preferably with secure transport

   In many practical network deployment, a best-effort policy is
   desireable, i.e., one wants to use a secure transport when possible,
   but still allow for a non-secure transport when it is not possible.

   In that situation, the UAC MUST use a SIP URI as an AOR, and not a
   SIPS URI.  The UAC MUST provide both a SIP URI contact and a SIPS URI
   contact, appropriately prioritized with a q-value.

Internet-Draft               SIPS Guidelines                  April 2006


   The transport used for performing the registration itself MUST be
   TLS.  The REGISTER message will be as follows:

          REGISTER sips:registrar.example.com;transport=tcp SIP/2.0
          Via: SIP/2.0/TLS bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds
          Max-Forwards: 70
          To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>
          From: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
          CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
          Contact: <sips:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp;q=0.7,
                   <sip:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp;q=0.5,
                   <sip:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=udp;q=0.1
          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

   OPEN ISSUE: See open issue in section 3 [12].

   In this example, the registrar responds with a 200 OK as follows, and
   only adds the sips Contact, in order to force the use of TLS on that
   link.

          SIP 2.0 200 OK
          Via: SIP/2.0/TLS bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds;
               received=192.0.2.4
          To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=2493K59K9
          From: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
          CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
          Contact: <sips:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp
          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

4.3.  AOR is to be reachable only without secure transport

   In some cases, disabling secure transport completely may be
   desireable (although it is strongly discourage).  This may apply when
   the equipment does not support TLS, or when there are other security
   mechanisms in place (like IPsec).

   In that situation, the AOR MUST be a SIP URI.  The contacts MUST also
   be SIP URI.  However, the transport used for performing the
   registration itself may be either TLS or not.

   If TLS is used for registration, the REGISTER message will be as
   follows:

          REGISTER sips:registrar.example.com;transport=tcp SIP/2.0
          Via: SIP/2.0/TLS bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds
          Max-Forwards: 70
          To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>
          From: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
          CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
          Contact: <sip:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp;q=0.5,
                   <sip:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=udp;q=0.1
          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

   The registrar MUST respond to the REGISTER using the same TLS
   connection.  The registrar responds with a 200 OK as follows, picking
   TCP as the only valid transport for the contact:

          SIP 2.0 200 OK
          Via: SIP/2.0/TLS bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds;
               received=192.0.2.4
          To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=2493K59K9
          From: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09
          CSeq: 1826 REGISTER
          Contact: <sip:bob@bobspc.example.com>;transport=tcp
          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

   If TLS is not used for registration, the REGISTER message will be as
   follows:

          REGISTER sip:registrar.example.com;transport=tcp SIP/2.0
          Via: SIP/2.0/TCP bobspc.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds
          Max-Forwards: 70
          To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>
          From: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=456248
          Call-ID: 843817637684230@998sdasdh09

          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0

   In his example, the registrar responds with a 200 OK and picks TCP as
   the only valid transport for the contact:

          Expires: 7200
          Content-Length: 0


5.  SIPS within a dialog

   There MUST be only one Contact in any request resulting in the
   establishment of a dialog (e.g., INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, REFER).  If the
   Request-URI or top Route header field contains a SIPS URI, the
   Contact header filed MUST be a SIPS URI as well.

   In the response, the Contact field MUST also be a SIPS URI if the
   Request-URI contained a SIPS URI or if the topmost Record-Route
   header contained a SIPS URI or if the Contact header contained one
   and there was no Record-Route header.

   OPEN ISSUE: RFC 3261 is not very clear what a UAS is to do if it
      doesn't support SIPS and TLS, in which case the previous paragraph
      obviously can not apply.  Shoud we state that the UAS MUST reject
      the request with response code 416?  In that case, should we say
      that the UAC MUST NOT re-attempt the request with a SIP URI by
      automatically replacing the SIPS scheme with a SIP scheme?
   When a target refresh occurs within a dialog (e.g., re-INVITE,
   UPDATE), the UAC SHOULD include a Contact header with a SIPS URI if
   the original request creating the dialog was sent over TLS, and the
   Request-URI contained a SIPS URI.

   OPEN ISSUE: Handling of annomalies are not very well defined in RFC
      3261.  For example, what if the request contains a SIPS contact
      but the response contains a SIP contact?  What if a UAS receives a
      SIP Contact replacing a SIPS contact in a target refresh?


6.  Usage of tls and TLS parameters

   RFC 3261 makes it clear that the use of the "transport=tls" URI
   transport parameter in SIPS or SIP URIs has been deprecated.
   However, it has not been eliminated from the ABNF in section 25 of
   RFC 3261.

Internet-Draft               SIPS Guidelines                  April 2006


   For Via headers however, the following transport "UDP", "TCP", "TLS",
   "SCTP", and "TLS-SCTP" (see RFC 4168 [7]) are supported.


7.  REFER and sips

   REFER [5] introduces its own set of issues with sips:

   OPEN ISSUE: What if a UA with not support for TLS receives a SIPS URI
      in a Refer-to header in a REFER request?  Does it reject the
      REFER, or accept REFER and send back a 416 in a NOTIFY?
   OPEN ISSUE How should the UAC sending a REFER react if it receives a
      416 in response to the REFER?
   OPEN ISSUE What if a UA with TLS support receives a SIP URI in a
      Refer-to header?  Is it allowed to "upgrade" to a SIPS URI?  It is
      probably a bad idea in most scenarios, unless it already knows
      that the other ends supports TLS (and has a SIPS URI).


8.  GRUU, Replaces, Join and Target-Dialog

   GRUU [10] specifies that when a GRUU is obtained through
   registration, if the To header field in the REGISTER request contains
   a SIP URI, the SIP version of the GRUU is returned.  If the To header
   filed in the REGISTER request contains a SIPS URI, the SIPS version
   of the GRUU is returned.

   OPEN ISSUE How should the UAC react if the returned GRUU is SIP but
      the To was SIPS?
   OPEN ISSUE How should the UAC react if the returned GRUU is SIPS but
      the To was SIP?
   TBD: Need to look at Replaces, Joing and Target-Dialog.  For example,
   what if this header field is received in a request to a SIPS URI but
   the dialog to which it relates has a SIP local target, or vice-versa?
   This is a placeholder for more investigation.


9.  Third-party call control

   TBD: this is a placeholder for [4]-related issues.


10.  Background

   The use of the SIPS URI scheme in SIP is scattered throughout the
   following sections of RFC 3261 [3].

      8.1.1.8 describes the use of the Contact header field.  Of
      particular importance are the following statements:

         The Contact header field MUST be present and contain exactly
         one SIP or SIPS URI in any request that can result in the
         establishment of a dialog.
         If the Request-URI or top Route header field value contains a
         SIPS URI, the Contact header field MUST contain a SIPS URI as
         well.
      8.1.3.4 describes processing of 3XX responses.  Of particular
      importance is the following statement:

         If the original request had a SIPS URI in the Request-URI, the
         client MAY choose to recurse to a non-SIPS URI, but SHOULD
         inform the user of the redirection to an insecure URI.
      8.1.3.5 and 8.2.2.1 implies that if a SIPS is not supported by
      UAS, it can reject it with a 416, and the UAC SHOULD retry the
      request with a SIP URI.  However, although not discussed in RFC
      3261, the user should be informed.
      10.2.1 describes address binding of SIPS AOR during registration:

         If the address-of-record in the To header field of a REGISTER
         request is a SIPS URI, then any Contact header field values in
         the request SHOULD also be SIPS URIs.  Clients should only
         register non-SIPS URIs under a SIPS address-of-record when the
         security of the resource represented by the contact address is
         guaranteed by other means.  This may be applicable to URIs that
         invoke protocols other than SIP, or SIP devices secured by
         protocols other than TLS.
      12.1.1 describes the UAS behavior when creating a dialog with a
      SIPS Request-URI or a top Record-Route header:

         If the request that initiated the dialog contained a SIPS URI
         in the Request-URI or in the top Record-Route header field
         value, if there was any, or the Contact header field if there
         was no Record-Route header field, the Contact header field in
         the response MUST be a SIPS URI.
      12.1.2 describes the UAC behavior when creating a dialog with a
      SIPS Request-URI or a top Recored-Route header.  Of particular
      importance are the following statements:

         If the request has a Request-URI or a topmost Route header
         field value with a SIPS URI, the Contact header field MUST
         contain a SIPS URI.
         If the request was sent over TLS, and the Request-URI contained
         a SIPS URI, the "secure" flag is set to TRUE.
      12.2.1.1 expands on what this secure flag means when doing any
      target refresh requests within that dialog:

Internet-Draft               SIPS Guidelines                  April 2006



         A UAC SHOULD include a Contact header field in any target
         refresh requests within a dialog, and unless there is a need to
         change it, the URI SHOULD be the same as used in previous
         requests within the dialog.  If the "secure" flag is true, that
         URI MUST be a SIPS URI.
      16.6 bullet 4 describes Record Route processing for SIPS URIs by
      proxies:

         If the Request-URI contains a SIPS URI, or the topmost Route
         header field value [...] contains a SIPS URI, the URI placed
         into the Record-Route header field MUST be a SIPS URI.
         Furthermore, if the request was not received over TLS, the
         proxy MUST insert a Record-Route header field.  In a similar
         fashion, a proxy that receives a request over TLS, but
         generates a request without a SIPS URI in the Request-URI or
         topmost Route header field value [...], MUST insert a Record-
         Route header field that is not a SIPS URI.
      16.7 describes proxy response forwarding:

         If the proxy received the request over TLS, and sent it outover
         a non-TLS connection, the proxy MUST rewrite the URI in the
         Record-Route header field to be a SIPS URI.  If the proxy
         received the request over a non-TLS connection, and sent it
         outover TLS, the proxy MUST rewrite the URI in the Record-Route
         header field to be a SIP URI.
      19.1 describes the SIP and SIPS URI in general.  Of particular
      importance is the following statement:

         A SIPS URI specifies that the resource be contacted securely.
         This means, in particular, that TLS is to be used between the
         UAC and the domain that owns the URI.  From there, secure
         communications are used to reach the user, where the specific
         security mechanism depends on the policy of the domain.  Any
         resource described by a SIP URI can be "upgraded" to a SIPS URI
         by just changing the scheme, if it is desired to communicate
         with that resource securely.
      19.1.4 describes rules for URI comparisons.  Of particular
      importance is the following statement:

         A SIP and SIPS URI are never equivalent.
      20.42 describes indicating TLS transport in Via headers:

         A Via header field value contains the transport protocol used
         to send the message, [...]  Transport protocols defined here
         are "UDP", "TCP", "TLS", and "SCTP".  "TLS" means TLS over TCP.
         When a request is sent to a SIPS URI, the protocol still
         indicates "SIP", and the transport protocol is TLS.

      26.2.1 describes Transport Layer Security [2].  Of particular
      importance is the following statement:

         "tls" (signifying TLS over TCP) can be specified as the desired
         transport protocol within a Via header field value or a SIP-
         URI.
      26.2.2 is very important and describes the SIPS URI scheme.  Of
      particular importance is the following statements:

         When used as the Request-URI of a request, the SIPS scheme
         signifies that each hop over which the request is forwarded,
         until the request reaches the SIP entity responsible for the
         domain portion of the Request-URI, must be secured with TLS;
         once it reaches the domain in question it is handled in
         accordance with local security and routing policy, quite
         possibly using TLS for any last hop to a UAS.  When used by the
         originator of a request (as would be the case if they employed
         a SIPS URI as the address-of-record of the target), SIPS
         dictates that the entire request path to the target domain be
         so secured.
         [...]
         Note that in the SIPS URI scheme, transport is independent of
         TLS, and thus "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=tcp" and
         "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=sctp" are both valid
         (although note that UDP is not a valid transport for SIPS).
         The use of "transport=tls" has consequently been deprecated,
         partly because it was specific to a single hop of the request.
         This is a change since RFC 2543.
         Users that distribute a SIPS URI as an address-of-record may
         elect to operate devices that refuse requests over insecure
         transports.
      26.4.4 describes the limitations in what to infer from using SIPS
      URIs.  Of particular importance are the the following important
      statement:

         Actually using TLS on every segment of a request path entails
         that the terminating UAS must be reachable over TLS (perhaps
         registering with a SIPS URI as a contact address).  This is the
         preferred use of SIPS.  Many valid architectures, however, use
         TLS to secure part of the request path, but rely on some other
         mechanism for the final hop to a UAS, for example.  Thus SIPS
         cannot guarantee that TLS usage will be truly end-to-end. [...]
   The reader should also be familiar with RFC 3263 [4] which describes
   the use of DNS with SIPS schemes.

   Finally, because in practical implementations, TLS will often be
   implemented using client-initiated connections, the reader should be
   familar with [8].
