Overview

   The IETF Internet White Pages Requirements (Whip) Working Group
   proposes to establish a set of requirements for a Simple Internet
   White Pages Service without prejudice to existing recommendations or
   implementations. This Document is designed to be used by other WGs in
   the IETF to guide the overall structure of the Internet White Pages
   Service.

1.0 Introduction

   The Internet has explored, several times, the issue of requirements
   for the Internet White Pages Service (IWPS) [KS89, PA94].  The work
   on this document has benefited from being able to review several
   implementations.  Each implementation was developed to explore a
   solution set of requirements.  With each approach we acquired a new
   understanding of the general problem set. The Internet always
   benefits from this type of implementation diversity.  The Internet
   has done a significant amount of work in looking at what is needed by
   the Internet White pages services.  A number of them are based on an
   underlying technology [KH93] like X.500.  Others have define new or
   built on old systems [XXXX]. The most likely future for the IWPS is
   that it will consist of a number of directory like services that will

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   interwork to provide the general IWPS.

   It is not the purpose of this Document to restrict the development of
   the independent implementations of the IWPS. Yet, as these systems
   are built and deployed new issues of interoperability and
   synchronization come to play.  Therefore, if we can agree on some
   common Information Objects and procedures we may be able to minimize
   these problems.

   This Document will focus only on common information and operational
   modeling issues that all IWPS service provider must conform to. To
   insure a consistent User view of this service we need to define a
   common naming structure. This would allow a User to go between
   different implementations of the service and have a consistent way of
   looking for people or other Information Objects in the Internet.  For
   developers of this service we need to have an unambiguous method of
   representing the Information Objects managed by the service. This
   will help facilitate interoperability and synchronization.

   As any group of people begin to work on an issue a set of words or
   terms start to take on meaning only to the group. This helps them to
   communicate common ideas.  Depending where you are when you join the
   effort the terms may be confusing or even new. To facilitate our need
   to communicate common ideas Appendix C attempts to document certain
   words and terms used in this document.  It also, will expand all
   Acronyms used in this document. It may be useful for the reader to
   glance through this appendix before reading this document.

2.0 Scope

   This Document attempts to establish a simple set of information
   objects that should prove extensible and usable by developers of the
   IWPS.  These Information Objects coupled with a basic set of
   requirements will form a basis from which related IETF efforts can
   build an ubiquitous IWPS. It will only deal with issues that are
   common to this service. It will not attempt to be an exhaustive
   specification of the IWPS.  In particular this Document will deal
   with Naming and Schema issues. It will also provide a conceptual
   model for the IWPS.

   To insure a consistent User view of the service, the User Agent (UA)
   will need to be addressed.  This will not be a specification of a UA
   but, will deal with those issues of information content as presented
   to or by the User. This Document will also describe a basic set of
   operations that will need to be supported by the UA.

3.0 Naming

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   The name associated with the IWPS is complicated by opposing naming
   requirements.  One requirement was to allow a user, with incomplete
   naming information to be able to navigate the IWPS until the person
   or Information Object is found.  This name form would map one name to
   one or more Information Objects (i.e.  All Smiths at LLNL, US). We
   also, require a name that would uniquely identify a person or
   Information Object.  This name form would map one name to one and
   only one Information Object.

   It would be ideal if the name we used to navigate through the IWPS
   could be derived from the unique identifying name but, we can not
   meet both goals with the same name.  Therefore, two naming structures
   are needed. It is recommended that the following conceptual names be
   used:

           White Pages Name (WPN)  Maps one name to one or more
                                   IWPS entries.
           White Pages ID (WPI)    Maps one name to one and only one
                                   IWPS entry.

3.1 White Pages Identifier - WPI

   The WPI is designed to directly locate a particular person or
   Information Object in the Internet. A WPI provides a one to one
   mapping between a name and an IWPS Information Object. When a User
   presents a WPI to a User Agent the service will be able, after name
   resolution, to locate the Information Object precisely.  It is
   recommended that the WPI be represented as a URN [SM94]. At the time
   of this writing the final form of URNs has not been specified. When
   that work is finished it will be used to specify the WPI structure.
   In particular it is important that the WPI have the following
   qualities:

           1.  Global uniqueness
           2.  Persistence
           3.  Independence
           4.  Human transcribability

   These and other qualities are proposed characteristics of a URN.

   For illustration purposes it will be assumed that the WPI URN will
   have the following form:

           <URN:IANA/wp.nersc.gov:u7224>

   Where wp.nersc.gov is the DNS registered service provider that
   manages the Information Object u7224.  It is recommended that the DNS
   be used to specify IWPS service providers. The specification of the



Genovese                                                        [Page 3]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   WPI attribute is in Appendix A.

   The IWPS, for any particular organization, will consist of a number
   of different information servers. These multiple servers may use
   different access protocols. The set of servers may also change over
   time.  The use of URN will help to facilitate this changing
   environment. This will be  accomplished by using the URN to URC
   mapping features [M94].  After a URN is resolved to its URC the
   attributes of the URC would be used by the IWPS UA to access a
   particular server. e.g.

           URN -> URC:
                   1.  Version, etc. info
                   2.  URL: finger://nersc.gov
                   3.  URL: whois: //nersc.gov
                   4.  URL: solo: //es.net

   This leaves administrative control of what servers can be used by the
   IWPS UAs with the local manager of the URC.

   It is possible that a person or Information Object may be registered
   with multiple servers. This could lead to having multiple WPIs for
   each Information Object.  It is recommended that the Information
   Object have only one WPI and the multiple servers should be listed as
   URLs in the WPI's URC.  It is left to the UA implementation, with
   possible User interaction, to select which URL to resolve.

   The WPI is designed to be Human Transcribable so, Users could
   exchange them via Email or on business cards.  Because of the
   persistence nature of a WPI it could be used to get the latest
   information about a User even though the information in an Email or
   on a business card has expired.  It is more likely that WPIs will be
   used more in UA to Server or Server to Server requests.

3.2 White Pages Name - WPN

   A WPN consists of the attributes from an Information Object Template.
   The Ancillary Information Attribute, described later, is not part of
   the WPN.  Depending on the number of attributes enumerated in a IWPS
   query, it will provide a one to many mapping between a name and an
   IWPS Information Object. In general the WPN will be used by people
   with incomplete naming information to construct a Purported Name that
   can be submitted to the IWPS to locate an Internet person or
   Information Object. This Purported Name would be used as a guess when
   querying the IWPS. This process of discovery will be iterative in
   nature. It is envisioned that the most common use of a WPN would be
   to do searches of the IWPS space to locate individuals.




Genovese                                                        [Page 4]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   To insure a consistent view of what an Internet person WPN will
   contain, the Information Object Template Internet White Page Person
   is specified in Appendix A. It contains the minimum required set of
   attributes for representing a person in the IWPS. Similar Information
   Object Templates can be defined for organizations, documents,
   services, etc. This document deals only with the Internet person WPN.

   Because the Internet person WPN consists of a number of attributes it
   is possible that you can construct a number of  Purported Names for
   the same person. e.g.

           Huitema, Inria, Fr
           Christian Huitema, Inria, Fr
           Huitema, Rodeo, Inria, Fr
           Huitema, Sophia, Inria, Fr

   The actual order the attributes of the WPN are presented by the user
   to the IWPS UA or used by the UA to generate a query is left to the
   implementation.  The User must realize that the more complete the WPN
   is the better the chance is that useful information can be returned.
   i.e. a query for just "Huitema, Fr" will most likely fail.

4.0 IWPS Schema considerations

   The information description requirements for the IWPS consists of the
   following:

           1. Syntax for definition/representation of Information
              Object Templates.
           2. Registration procedures for Information Object
              Templates, etc.
           3. Database structure or schema.

   Items 1 and 2 will be covered in this Document. Database structure
   because, it will potentially restrict implementations (i.e. X.500
   schema based Vs DNS schema based) will not be defined in this
   document.

4.1 Syntax for definition/representation of Information Objects

   A clear, precise and consistent method must be used when Information
   Object Templates and their attributes are discussed within the
   context of IWPS.  There are two possible methods to do this. i.e.

           1.  BNF
           2.  ASN.1

   The Working Group recommends the use of ASN.1.  It provides us with a



Genovese                                                        [Page 5]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   set of pre-defined attributes and encoding syntax's. Also, it is well
   documented and widely available.

4.2 Registration of IWPS Information Object Templates.

   The Working Group recommends the registration and publication of all
   Information Object Templates used for the IWPS.  We will use the IANA
   branch of the ISO OID tree for registration of the IWPS Object
   Templates.  This branch was used by the Object Templates listed in
   Appendix A.  To facilitate distribution of IWPS Information Object
   Templates they should be made available on the Internet Information
   server (i.e. InterNIC).  At a minimum it is recommended that any new
   Information Object Template that will be made available via the IWPS
   will be published in a RFC and its OID registered with IANA.

   Individual organizations may define Information Object Templates that
   are only local in scope.  This may be needed to meet local
   organizational needs.  If these Information Object Templates are not
   registered with the IWPS, they may not be processable by the general
   IWPS UAs.  All information that the organization wishes to be part of
   the IWPS must use an IWPS registered Information Object Template.

4.3 Database Structure

   It is envisioned that the IWPS will consist of a number of
   independent information servers.  Each of these servers will
   construct their own Databases. Therefore, no Internet wide directory
   Database will be provided.  This by its nature will cause
   interoperability and synchronization problems that must be worked
   out. This area of research is under development in the IETF
   Application Area.

5.0 Security

   The IWPS must deal with two general security issues:

           1. Privacy laws/rules
           2. Access Control/Authentication

   The Global nature of the Internet creates a  complex interplay of
   Country and Organizational laws/rules.  It would best serve the IWPS
   if all information was readily available to all people in the
   Internet but, this comes up against the security/privacy needs of
   Organizations and/or people.  Security is further complicated by the
   potential diverse nature of the IWPS server environment. Each server
   could have different forms of Access/Authentication controls in place
   to meet their needs.

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


5.1 Privacy

   The question of User's Privacy requirements for North America has
   been addressed by NADF [NADF92].  The NADF document does not take
   into account the Global Internet set of Users.  This topic is an area
   of research in the IETF Applications Area.  It will not be dealt with
   in this document.

5.2 Access Control/Authentication

   With the IWPS environment consisting of multiple server types and
   different autonomous management domains the question of Access
   control is at best problematic. It is also clear that a model to
   approach this problem is needed if the IWPS is to be deployed.

   To meet the current needs of this community it is recommended that
   the general issues of Access Control/Authentication be broken down
   into the following two models:

           1.  Anonymous or Public Access
           2.  Administrative Access

   The issue of Administrative Access Control is a current research area
   of the IETF Application Area.  This topic deals in general with the
   issues associated with the ability to add or modify entries in the
   IWPS. This document will only address the  Anonymous or Public Access
   issues of the IWPS.

   The IWPS is to be considered a public access service only.  If an
   organization is participating in this service, they must provide at a
   minimum anonymous access to their service.  It may be the result of a
   query posted to one of these servers that a response is returned that
   the requested information is not available to the requester. This
   negative response is a minimum requirement for all IWPS servers.

6.0 Data Integrity

   The question of Data Integrity was first addressed in RFC1107 [KS89].
   It basically states, that if the information is out of date it is
   useless and the service will not be used.  Therefore, a clear
   requirement is that any production IWPS provider must insure that all
   data is reasonably correct and current.

   To facilitate the User in determining the quality of the data that
   has been retrieved it is recommended that the optional Ancillary
   Information attribute of the IWPperson Template be supported. This
   would require the IWPS UA to be able to retrieve and display this
   information. This may be done as a separate operation from the fetch



Genovese                                                        [Page 7]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   of the Information Object. The Ancillary Information Attribute is
   defined in Appendix A. It is further recommended that any new
   Information Object Template include as a minimum the Ancillary
   Information attribute as an optional attribute.  It would then be
   left to the IWPS servers to optionally support the storage and
   retrieval of this data.

   The Ancillary Information attribute has been designed to provide the
   following information about the Information Object it is part of:

           1.  The date and time of the last modification.

           2.  Who performed the last modification.

           3.  Who owns or is responsible for the data stored
               in the Information Object.

           4.  What is the official source of the data.

           5.  Which attributes in the Information Object has
               been changed.

   As new Information Object Templates are defined for the IWPS a new
   changeRecord type will need to be defined for it and assigned to the
   changeRecord attribute.

   This attribute is not a part of the WPN.  It is not to be used as
   part of the Purported Name presented to the IWPS UA.

7.0 Performance

   If the IWPS is to be useful to its User community it must provide for
   reasonable performance.  To set a performance requirement is
   unnecessary.  Simply because, if the service does not meet the
   performance needs demanded by its Users it will not survive.

   The performance of the distributed IWPS will be affected by many
   things potentially outside the control of the local provider. The
   local provider can not control:

           1.  Remote server response or availability
           2.  Network speeds or partitions

8.0 Conceptual Model

   The Internet White Page Service will utilize the current information
   servers and not restrict the development of new information servers.
   It will also, strive to provide a consistent User view of the



Genovese                                                        [Page 8]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


   service.  To achieve these potentially tangential requirements it
   will be necessary to develop a model that can guide the current use
   and future development.

   At first glance it would seem that a simple Client/Server model would
   meet our needs. Yet, a clean model along these lines can not be
   achieved because, the different information servers that constitute
   the the IWPS will not, at least initially, use common designs or
   protocols. So, in our case the server or in general the servers of
   the IWPS are not definable.

   The only way to achieve a ubiquitous IWPS within the constraints
   setup in this document is to utilize a Conceptual Client/Server
   model. It can only be a conceptual model because, we can not define
   the underlaying servers. The IWPS will consist of a number of
   different Information servers. So, the exact structure of the servers
   will be opaque from our point of view.

   This document will concentrate on how and what these servers must do
   as a minimum to participate in the IWPS.  We have developed so far a
   description of the data that will constitute the IWPS data model. We
   need to augment this data model with the type of operations that will
   need to be supported by the IWPS Clients and Servers.  Through out
   this document we have been discussion the IWPS UA as the software
   that the User uses to access the IWPS. This UA can be seen as a
   Client of the IWPS servers. Therefore, you can use the term Client or
   UA interchangeably when discussing IWPS.

   There are two basic modes of operation that describe the way the UA
   will be used to access the servers.

           1.  Connection oriented - Interactively
           2.  Connectionless - Command/Response

   Long lived connections would help serve Users that are doing
   interactive types of searches or requesting multiple Information
   Objects.  Connectionless mode of use would serve more the DNS style
   of requests.  Both modes of UA to server interactions are expected by
   IWPS Users.

   There are no restrictions on the general design or operations of
   Information service UAs.  Any UA that is going to participate in the
   IWPS must be capable of passing required operational requests to the
   various Information servers. These request must conform to the
   servers requirements.  There are two basic operational requests
   defined for IWPS complaint UAs.

           1.  Search



Genovese                                                        [Page 9]

Internet Draft     Internet White Pages Requirements        15 July 1994


           2.  Fetch (get, read, retrieval)

   The UA would use a WPN as the set of input parameters for the Search
   operation.  The UA would use a WPI as the input parameter for the
   Fetch operation.  Some UAs may wish to support addition modifiers to
   these operations.  On a Fetch the User may be allowed to request that
   only certain attributes be returned. This would imply that the server
   supports this modifier or the UA would have to support it.

   There are two forms of response expected from the server for each of
   the above requested operations.

           1. Positive - data or results
           2. Negative - errors or suggestions

   With the Search operation a Positive response would imply that a WPI
   was returned to the UA. A Positive response to a Fetch operation
   would be the actual Information Object.  Some negative responses to a
   Fetch or Search operation will be:

   Fetch:
           1. Access denied.
           2. Server specific Errors - administrative limit notices.
           3. Referral to one or more servers.

   Search:
           1. Access denied.
           2. Server specific Errors - administrative limit notices.
           3. Partial match notification.
           4. Suggestions for possible WPNs to try.

   With respect to the Search Operation, effective server responses of
   the type 3 and 4 form above would help facilitate IWPS navigation.

Appendix A Information Object Template Definitions

   The Information Objects Template and attributes defined in this appendix are
   used to define the contents of Information Objects of the IWPS.
   In particular the the Template defined below deals with the
   person Object.  Any new Information Object must be registered with IANA.
