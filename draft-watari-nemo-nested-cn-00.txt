Abstract

   This document aims at assisting the problem statement of route
   optimization in nested mobile networks.  We describe the paths
   packets would take using existing Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support
   mechanisms when one or both end nodes of a communication flow are
   located in a nested NEMO.  One of both of the end nodes may
   themselves be either mobile nodes performing Mobile IPv6, or standard
   IPv6 nodes performing no mobility function at all.  The path can

   become extremely suboptimal if no optimization is provided.

1.  Introduction

   This document assumes the reader is familiar with the NEMO Basic
   Support protocol defined in [1], and with Mobile IPv6 defined in [4].
   The reader should also be familiar with the NEMO Terminology defined
   in [2].

   The NEMO Basic Support protocol uses a bi-directional tunnel
   established between the mobile router and its home agents for all
   communications.  Such communication path brings many problems such as
   delay, packet loss, less MTU and so on as described in [3].  The
   values become even more crucial under a nested mobile network, and
   brings the need for route optimization.

   As the solutions to provide such route optimization are proposed, in
   this document, we try to describe some different communication models
   which involves a nested mobile network, and to clarify the issues for
   each cases.  We focus on the different cases involving nested
   correspondent nodes, from the NEMO Basic Support perspective.  A
   nested correspondent node is a correspondent node which itself is
   also a mobile network node.

   In the following sections, we illustrate the path followed by packets
   if we assume nodes only performing Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support
   mechanisms.  There are different cases to consider since a CN may
   either be located in the fixed infrastructure, in a nested NEMO, or
   in the same nested NEMO as the MNN.  Also, we have to consider the
   cases where CNs and MNNs are either standard IPv6 nodes or MIPv6
   nodes.  As defined in [2], standard IPv6 nodes are nodes with no
   mobility functions whatsoever, i.e.  they are not MIPv6-enabled nor
   NEMO-enabled (this does not only mean they cannot move around keeping
   open connections, but also that they can't process BUs sent by
   MIPv6-enabled peers).

2.  CN located in the fixed infrastructure

   The most typical configuration is the case where a MNN communicates
   with a Correspondent Node (CN) attached in the fixed infrastructure.
   Figure 1 below shows an example of such topology.  The 3 models
   generally assumed for route optimization are CN as a MIPv6-enabled
   node, CN attached behind a Correspondent Router, or a standard IPv6
   node using a bi-directional tunnel between the root-MR and its HA.

2.1  Case A: LFN and standard IPv6 CN

   The simplest case is where both MNN and CN are fixed nodes with no
   mobility functions.  That is, MNN is a LFN, and CN is a standard IPv6
   node.  Packets are encapsulated between each MR and its respective
   HA.  As shown in Figure 2, in such case, the path between the two
   nodes would go through:

             The digits represent the number of IPv6 headers.


              Figure 2: MNN and CN are standard IPv6 nodes

   Route optimization would require collaboration among the MRs.  To
   avoid tunneling through any HA, Correspondent Routes (CRs) may be
   placed near CNs to handle bindings.  CRs are routers enhanced which
   the ability to handle bindings for a mobile network, allowing a
   direct tunnel to the MR providing a certain level of optimization.

2.2  Case B: VMN and MIPv6 CN

   In this second case, both end nodes are MIPv6-enabled mobile nodes,
   that is, MNN is a VMN.  MIPv6 route optimization may thus be
   initiated between the two and packets wouldn't go through the HA of
   the VMN nor the HA of the CN (not shown in the figure).  However,
   packets will still be tunneled between each MR and its respective HA,
   in both directions.  As shown in Figure 3, the path between VMN and
   CN would go through:


        1       2       3       4          3          2          1

              Figure 3: MMN and CN are MIPv6 mobile nodes


2.3  Case C: VMN and standard IPv6 CN

   When the communication involves a MIPv6 node either as a MNN or as a
   CN, MIPv6 route optimization can not be performed because the
   standard IPv6 CN cannot process MIPv6 signaling.  Therefore, VMN
   would establish a bi-directional tunnel with its HA, which causes the
   flow to go out the nested NEMO.  Packets between MNN and CN would
   thus go through VMN's own HA (VMN_HA).  The path would therefore be
   as shown on Figure 4:

3.  CN located in distinct nested NEMOs

   The CN may be located in another nested NEMO, different from the one
   MNN is attached to, as shown on Figure 5.  We define such
   configuration as ``distinct nested NEMOs.''

   The models generally assumed for route optimization are optimization
   among all MRs in both NEMOs, and a bi-directional tunnel between the
   two root-MRs.

3.1  Case D: LFN and standard IPv6 CN

   Similar with Case A, we start off with the case where both end nodes
   do not have any mobility functions.  Packets are encapsulated at
   every mobile router on the way out the nested NEMO, decapsulated by
   the HAs and then encapsulated again on its way down the nested NEMO.

              Figure 6: MNN and CN are standard IPv6 nodes


3.2  Case E: VMN and MIPv6 CN

   Similar with Case B, when both end nodes are MIPv6 nodes, the two
   nodes may initiate MIPv6 route optimization.  Again, packets will not
   go through the HA of the VMN nor the HA of the MIPv6 CN (not shown in
   the figure).  However, packets will still be tunneled for each MR to
   its HA and vise versa.  Therefore, the path between MNN and CN would
   go through:

              Figure 7: MNN and CN are MIPv6 mobile nodes


3.3  Case F: VMN and standard IPv6 CN

   Similar to Case C, when the communication involves a MIPv6 node
   either as a MNN or as a CN, MIPv6 route optimization can not be
   performed because the standard IPv6 CN cannot process MIPv6
   signaling.  VMN would therefore establish a bi-directional tunnel
   with its HA.  Packets between MNN and CN would thus go through VMN's
   own HA as shown on figure Figure 8:

4.  CN and MNN located in the same nested NEMO

   Figure 9 below shows the case where the two communicating nodes are
   connected behind a different MR, but the MRs are connected in the
   same nested NEMO, and thus behind the same root-MR.  Route
   optimization can avoid packets being tunneled outside the nested
   NEMO.

4.1  Case G: LFN and standard IPv6 CN

   Again, we start off with the case where both end nodes do not have
   any mobility functions.  Packets are encapsulated at every mobile
   router on the way out the nested NEMO via the root-MR, decapsulated
   and encapsulated by the HAs and then make their way back to the
   nested NEMO through the same root-MR.  Therefore, the path between
   MNN and CN would go through:

4.2  Case H: VMN and MIPv6 CN

   Similar with Case B and E, when both end nodes are MIPv6 nodes, the
   two nodes may initiate MIPv6 route optimization which will avoid the
   packets to go through the HA of the VMN nor the HA of the MIPv6 CN
   (not shown in the figure).  However, packets will still be tunneled
   between each MR and its respective HA in both directions.  Therefore,
   the path would be the same with Case G and go through:

4.3  Case I: VMN and standard IPv6 CN

   As for Case C and Case F, when the communication involves a MIPv6
   node either as a MNN or as a CN, MIPv6 route optimization can not be
   performed.  Therefore, VMN will establish a bi-directional tunnel
   with its HA.  Packets between MNN and CN would thus go through VMN's
   own HA.  The path would therefore be as shown on Figure 12:

5.  CN located behind the same nested MR

   Figure 13 below shows the case where the two communicating nodes are
   connected behind the same nested MR.  The optimization is required
   when the communication involves MIPv6-enabled nodes.

5.1  Case H: LFN and standard IPv6 CN

   If both end nodes are LFNs, no special function is necessary for
   optimization of their communication.  The path between the two nodes
   would go through:

             Figure 14: MNN and CN are standard IPv6 nodes


5.2  Case I: VMN and MIPv6 CN

   Similar with Case H, when both end nodes are MIPv6 nodes, the two
   nodes may initiate MIPv6 route optimization.  Although few packets
   would go out the nested NEMO for the Return Routability
   initialization, however, unlike Case B and Case E, packets will not
   get tunneled outside the nested NEMO.  Therefore, packets between MNN
   and CN would eventually go through:


                                  1
                             MNN --- CN

              Figure 15: MNN and CN are MIPv6 mobile nodes

   If the root-MR is disconnected while the nodes exchange keys for the
   RR procedure, they may not communicate even though they are connected
   on the same link.

5.3  Case I: VMN and standard IPv6 CN

   When the communication involves a MIPv6 node either as a MNN or as a
   CN, MIPv6 route optimization can not be performed.  Therefore, even
   though the two nodes are on the same link, VMN will establish a
   bi-directional tunnel with it's HA, which causes the flow to go out
   the nested NEMO.  Path between MNN and CN would require another HA
   (HA4) to go through for this MIPv6 node:

6.  Conclusion

   This document described the paths packets would take using existing
   Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support mechanisms when one or both end
   nodes of a communication flow are located in a nested NEMO.  One of
   both of the end nodes may themselves be either mobile nodes
   performing Mobile IPv6, or standard IPv6 nodes performing no mobility
   function at all.

   This draft aims at helping the definition of the problem statement
   for route optimization when one or both end nodes are located in a
   nested NEMO.  As emphasized on our figures, the path can become
   extremely un-optimal if no optimization is provided besides the sole
   opetation of existing Mobile IPv6 by some end nodes and NEMO Basic
   Support by the MR.  The generic solution to come up should cover all
   cases, providing certain level of optimization for each case.
