     Internet Draft                  TIFF-F                    May 30, 1997


 1. Abstract
  
  
  This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
  image/tiff.  The baseline encoding is defined by [TIFF] and a common
  Internet fax format is defined in [TIFF-F].  This document refines
  an earlier sub-type registration in RFC 1528 [TPC.INT].
  
  
 2. TIFF Definition
  
  
  TIFF (Tag Image File Format) Revision 6.0 is defined in detail by
  Adobe in [TIFF].  The documentation can be obtained from Adobe at:
  
     Adobe Developers Association
     Adobe Systems Incorporated

     San Jose, CA 95110-2704

     Fax:   +1-408-537-6000

  f6.pdf
  
  
 2.1 TIFF-F Definition
  
  
  Though it has been in common usage for many years, TIFF-F has
  previously never been documented in the form of a standard.  An
  informal TIFF-F document was originally created by a small group of
  fax experts led by Joe Campbell.  The existence of TIFF-F is noted
  in [TIFF] but it is not defined.  The formal definition for TIFF-F
  for Internet applications can be found in [TIFF-F].
  
  
 3. MIME Definition
  
  
 3.1 image/TIFF
  
  
  The image/TIFF sub-type was originally defined in RFC 1528 as
  containing TIFF 5.0 encoded image data.  This document re-defines
  the original image/TIFF definition to refer to TIFF 6.0 encoded
  image data.  The TIFF 6.0 specification is a cleaner document and is
  compatible with previous TIFF 5.0 encoded image data.

 3.2 Application parameter
  
  
  Up until TIFF 6.0, TIFF supported various "Classes" which defined
  the use of TIFF for various applications.   The intent of Classes
  had been to reduce the information burden on TIFF readers and
  writers that wished to support narrow applications.
  
  There are it cases where it may be useful to identify the
  application applicable to the content of an image/TIFF body.  As a
  result, an optional "application" parameter is defined for
  image/TIFF to identify the TIFF application of the encoded image
  data, if it is known.
  
  TIFF-F [TIFF-F] has been known historically as "TIFF Class F" and
  previous informal TIFF-F documents used this terminology.  This
  document defines the application parameter value "F" to correspond
  to a bi-level facsimile image defined by [TIFF-F].
  
  Example:
  
            Content-type: image/TIFF; application=F
  
  There is no default value for application, as the absence of the
  application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF image is
  Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the
  application.   It is up to the implementation to determine the
  application (if necessary) and present the image to the user.
  
  
 3.3 Interoperability considerations
  
  
  The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
  applications of TIFF may not be ubiquitous.  As a result, the
  absence of the application parameter would force implementations to
  decode and attempt to display the encoded TIFF image data in order
  to determine if it could actually be viewed.

       Optional parameters: application
  
          The applications of TIFF are denoted by letters.  A single
          application is defined here for TIFF-F as follows:
          
               F - Bi-Level Facsimile
          
          There is no default value for application, as the absence of
          the application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF
          image is Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to
          identify the application.  It is up to the implementation to
          determine the application (if necessary) and present the
          image to the user.
  
       Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred
  
       Security considerations: none
  
       Interoperability considerations:
  
          The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
          applications of TIFF may not be ubiquitous.  As a result,
          the absence of the application parameter would force
          implementations to decode and attempt to display the encoded
          TIFF image data in order to determine if it could actually
          be viewed.
