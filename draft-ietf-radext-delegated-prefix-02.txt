   Service) attribute that carries an IPv6 prefix that is to be
   delegated to the user.  This attribute is usable within either RADIUS
   or Diameter.

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute           July 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix is a RADIUS attribute [1] that carries an
   IPv6 prefix to be delegated to the user, for use in the user's
   network.  For example, the prefix in a Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
   attribute can be delegated to another node through DHCP Prefix
   Delegation [2].

   The Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute [4] serves a similar purpose, but
   may also be used for other purposes other than delegating a prefix
   for use in a user's network.  Definition of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix
   allows the simultaneous use of the Framed-IPv6-Prefix for other
   purposes and the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix for prefix delegation.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


3.  Attribute format

   The format of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute           July 2006


       Length

            The length of the entire attribute, in bytes.  At least 4
            (to hold Type/Length/Reserved/Prefix-Length for a 0-bit
            prefix), and no larger than 20 (to hold Type/Length/
            Reserved/Prefix-Length for a 128-bit prefix)

       Reserved

            Always set to zero by sender; ignored by receiver

       Prefix-Length

            The length of the prefix being delegated, in bits.  At least
            0 and no larger than 128 bits (identifying a single IPv6
            address)

   Note that the prefix field is only required to be long enough to hold
   the prefix bits and can be shorter than 16 bytes.  Any bits in the
   prefix field that are not part of the prefix MUST be zero.

   The definition of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute is based on the
   Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute [4].

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet, and
   can appear multiple times.  It MAY appear in an Access-Request packet
   as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would prefer these
   prefix(es), but the server is not required to honor the hint.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute MAY appear in an Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packets.

   The following table describes which messages the Delegated-IPv6-
   Prefix attribute can appear in and in what quantity.

   +------------------------------------------------------+
   | Request Accept Accounting  #   Attribute             |
   |                Request                               |
   | 0+      0+     0+          TBD Delegated-IPv6-Prefix |
   +------------------------------------------------------+

   In this table 0+ means that zero or more instances of this attribute
   MAY be present in packet.  This attribute MUST NOT appear in any
   packet not listed in the table.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   When used in Diameter, the attribute defined in this specification
   can be used as a Diameter AVP from the Code space 1-255, i.e., RADIUS
   attribute compatibility space.  No additional Diameter Code values
   are therefore allocated.  The data types of the attributes are as
   follows:

        Delegated-IPv6-Prefix             OctetString

   The attribute in this specification has no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways,
   i.e., the attribute is copied as is, except for changes relating to
   headers, alignment, and padding.  See also RFC 3588 [5], Section 4.1,
   and RFC 4005 [6], Section 9.

   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Access-Request applies in
   Diameter to AA-Request [6] or Diameter-EAP-Request [7].

   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Access-Accept applies in
   Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer that indicates success.

   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Accounting-Request applies
   to Diameter Accounting-Request [6] as well.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a Type value, TBD, for this attribute
   from the RADIUS Attribute Types registry.


6.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed
   in RFC 2607 [8], RFC 2865 [1] and RFC 2869 [9].  Use of IPsec [10]
   for providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in
   RFC 3162.

   Security considerations for the Diameter protocol are discussed in
   RFC 3588 [5].
