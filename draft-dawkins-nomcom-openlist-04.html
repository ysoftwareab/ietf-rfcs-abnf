Introduction</h3>

<p>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), 
		and at-large IETF representatives to the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are 
		selected by a "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as "NomCom").
		<a class='info' href='#RFC3777'>[RFC3777]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Galvin, J., &ldquo;IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> defines how the NomCom is selected, and the processes it follows 
		as it selects candidates for these positions.
	
</p>
<p>The NomCom is responsible for filling positions across the breadth of the Internet Engineering
		Task Force (IETF). The NomCom needs relevant information about nominees being considered
		for these positions, but current <a class='info' href='#RFC3777'>[RFC3777]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Galvin, J., &ldquo;IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> requirements for confidentiality
		limit the ability of the NomCom to solicit that information. The process change described in
		this document allows the 
		NomCom to openly solicit information about nominees who are willing to be considered.

Current Rules on Confidentiality</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3777'>[RFC3777]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Galvin, J., &ldquo;IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom process, and it 
		describes the confidential nature of NomCom deliberations in
		section 3, "General", bullet 6, which states:
	
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
      			specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
      			confidential.
		
</p>
<p>The nominating committee and confirming body members will be
     			exposed to confidential information as a result of their
     			deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and
      			from those who provide requested supporting information.  All
      			members and all other participants are expected to handle this
      			information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.
		
</p>
<p>It is consistent with this rule for current nominating committee
      			members who have served on prior nominating committees to advise
      			the current committee on deliberations and results of the prior
      			committee, as necessary and appropriate.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Problems with Existing Rules</h3>

<p>There are two problems with existing practice - nominee lists aren't as confidential as
		<a class='info' href='#RFC3777'>[RFC3777]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Galvin, J., &ldquo;IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> would lead the reader to believe, but they aren't visible to
		the entire IETF community, either.
	
</p>
<p>Since at least 1996, most NomComs have sent out a "short list" of nominees under consideration
		to a variety of audiences. The target audiences differ from year to year, but have included
		members of specific leadership bodies, working group chairs in
		a specific area (for IESG positions), all working group chairs 
		(for IAB and IAOC positions), and all document authors. 
		The combined target audience for all short lists
		includes multiple hundreds of recipients - recent NomComs have sent out about 1500 
		requests for short list feedback.
	
</p>
<p>This practice is unavoidable, because most NomCom members will not have personal 
		experience with most nominees for most positions, but it is periodically 
		challenged because it's not explicitly allowed as an exception to the blanket 
		requirement for confidentiality.
	
</p>
<p>In an attempt to maintain the required level of confidentiality, 
		past NomComs have also included
		"ringers" (as "padding") on the short list - nominees who are NOT under active
		consideration for a specific position. Since anyone who sees the short list does not 
		know who the ringers are, 
		consciencious IETF participants also provide feedback on 
		nominees who have already 
		declined. This is a waste of precious IETF-participant cycles, 
		and there are widespread reports that strict confidentiality about which
		candidates are "real", and which are included as "padding", is not 
		successfully maintained in practice. 
	
</p>
<p>Even if confidentiality about padding is
		maintained, the community is aware that some nominees on the short list 
		aren't under active consideration. In some cases, people guess 
		incorrectly that an actual nominee
		is part of the padding, and don't provide needed feedback to NomCom
		about a nominee who is actively being considered.
	
</p>
<p>We also note that the practice of publishing a "short list" 
		penalizes IETF participants who aren't members of one of the target
		audiences being surveyed - they have no way of knowing who is being considered, except
		for incumbent(s), 
		and have little incentive to provide feedback to NomCom on individuals who might not 
		even be nominees.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Asking the Entire Community for Feedback</h3>

<p>NomComs are not required to ask for community input at all, but at the current IETF scale,
		many NomComs DO request community input, because members do not have personal experience 
		with all nominees for all positions under review. 
	
</p>
<p>We assume that asking the larger community for 
		feedback about these nominees is preferable to NomCom members without personal experience 
		simply deferring to the members of the NomCom
		who DO have personal experience with specific nominees. 
	
</p>
<p>We assume that asking for feedback from the entire community is preferable to asking for
		feedback from large segments of the community, while keeping the rest of the community 
		"in the dark".

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Publishing a Nominee List</h3>

<p>In proposing that a nominee list be published as part of NomCom's request for
		feedback from the community, we considered three possibilities:
	
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Asking for feedback on all nominees, whether they are willing to be considered or not.
</li>
<li>Asking for feedback on all nominees who are willing to be considered.
</li>
<li>Asking for feedback on the nominees that NomCom is seriously considering (the "short
			list").
</li>
</ol>

<p>Asking for feedback on nominees who are not willing to be considered is a waste of 
		precious IETF-participant cycles, and may make it less likely that NomCom would receive 
		feedback on some nominees who ARE willing to be considered.
	
</p>
<p>Asking for feedback on all nominees who are willing to be considered 
		allows the community to point 
		out specific strengths and weaknesses of all willing nominees, 
		and this feedback should be useful 
		to NomCom in deciding which nominees to seriously consider. It also allows NomCom to
		receive feedback on nominees who might not appear on a "short list" initially, in the event
		that a strong nominee is suddenly unwilling or unable to serve.
	
</p>
<p>We also note that the list of willing nominees would include incumbents who are willing to 
		be considered for an additional term.
	
</p>
<a name="concerns"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Concerns About Open Nominee Lists</h3>

<p>This section acknowledges possible concerns about publishing open nominee
		lists in previous discussions.
	
</p>
<p>One concern is that nominees who are willing to be considered if the nominee list
		is not published, would not be willing to be considered if the nominee list is
		published. This reluctance might be cultural, 
		the result of personal pride, or the result of
		the fear of retribution, for a nominee being considered as a replacement
		for the nominee's managing Area Director (this concern is usually raised in
		an IESG context).
	
</p>
<p>We note that (for example) the Internet Architecture Board publishes the nominee list
		for their representative to the Internet Society Board of Trustees, without apparent
		ill effects, but we are also willing to accept that a NomCom might consider nominees
		whose names have not been announced, for a variety of reasons, if this is the right
		thing to do.
	
</p>
<p>Another concern is that publishing the nominee list publicly would lead to "lobbying",
		public statements supporting nominees on the IETF mailing list, etc. 
	
</p>
<p>We note that nominees know they are under consideration and can "lobby" today, by telling
		people they are willing to be considered 
		and asking them to provide feedback to NomCom. Several
		nominees (both incumbents and non-incumbents) have posted statements of candidacy
		to the IETF Discussion mailing list in recent years, for example.

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
      			specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
      			confidential.
		
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>add the following paragraphs:
	
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The list of nominees willing to be considered for positions under review 
			in the current NomCom cycle is not confidential.
			The NomCom may publish a list of names of nominees who are willing to be considered
			for positions under review to the community,
			in order to obtain feedback from the community on these nominees.
		
</p>
<p>The NomCom may publish an updated list if the NomCom considers this necessary.
			For example, the NomCom might publish an updated list if 
			the NomCom identifies errors/omissions
			in a previously-published version of the public list, or if the NomCom finds 
			it necessary to call for additional nominees, and these nominees indicate 
			a willingness to be considered before NomCom has completed its deliberations.
		
</p>
<p>The list of nominees published for a specific position 
			should contain only the names of  
			nominees who are willing to be considered for the position under review.
		
</p>
<p>Feedback on nominees should always be provided privately to NomCom. 
			Nominees should not solicit support, and other IETF community members should 
			not post statements of support/non-support for nominees in any public forum.
