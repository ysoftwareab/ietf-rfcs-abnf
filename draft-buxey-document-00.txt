Abstract

   RFC 822 [RFC0822] defines many headers which can be applied to email
   messages and RFC 2076 [RFC2076] provides a simple summary of the
   commonly occurring headers in headings of e-mail messages.  Both of
   these RFCs define the 'In-Reply-To' and 'References' fields - which
   have since had their definitions improved in RFC 2822 [RFC2822] and
   RFC 1036 [RFC1036] respectively.  These fields are used by 'thread
   capable' email clients to display messages grouped together in
   organised parent/child relationships that enable the reader to follow
   a train of thought or a process of information dissemination.

   However, if a reply to such a threaded message does not contain
   relevant follow-up information or is used as a platform to deliver a
   new message with new subject, then that reply is put within the
   already existing thread.  This is known as 'Thread-Jacking'.  This
   draft proposes a couple of techniques which can be undertaken to
   resolve this issue within the scope of email.

1.  Thread-Jacking

   Thread-Jacking, in email parlance, is defined as 'High-jacking a
   current topic with your own related or unrelated topic'.  This can be
   done deliberately but is mainly done innocently without the user
   realising the effects - without a knowledge of the underlying
   reference method.  Subject line change often occurs and is an obvious
   way to other readers that the new message is not part of the original
   thread.  One common reason for this occurring is that it is a lot
   easier for a user to press the reply button in their client than it
   is to create a new mail and copy the mailing list address into the
   To: location of their client.

2.  Creation of new threads via a simple procedure

   A trivial method for new messages to be removed from previous threads
   is defined

2.1.  A reply with new subject

   If the user replaces the email clients default Subject line when
   replying to an email within a threaded conversation, then the email
   client MUST clear the In-Reply-To and Reference fields.  As this
   issue is mainly associated with users who use the Reply function of
   their email client as an easy route to getting an email sent to the
   recipients (the To: and Reply-To: fields being automatically
   populated) it is RECOMMENDED that email clients have a second method
   of replying to such emails.  Such a method COULD be a qualifier key
   being pressed when clicking on the Reply button in a graphical email
   client, or an alternative key combination when using a text-based
   client e.g.  Alt-R.

2.2.  A reply with new content

   If a user deletes all previous content and creates a new body of
   content then the thread is no longer valid.  The email client MUST
   clear the In-Reply-To and Reference fields.  Email clients have their
   default quotation markings that define previously written content
   that a user is replying to.  If none of these can be found in the
   body of the email when being sent, then the email client MUST treat
   this as a new message and clear the thread-aware attributes, if email
   security methods are in place such as public key signing then the
   fields must be removed before such processes occur.
