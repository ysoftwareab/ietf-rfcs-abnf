1.  Introduction

   This memo is an implementation report about the peer-to-peer SIP
   system developed in the European IST Ambient Networks research
   project.  The presented system is work in progress and focusses on
   voice/video calls but does currently not consider presence and
   instant messaging.

   The spread of Internet technology in many types of wireless networks,
   presenting different features and technologies, has been a revolution
   for the networking architecture, traditionally based on fixed
   networks.  Nowadays, the interconnection of systems presenting
   heterogeneous network capabilities, access technologies and end-user
   devices is becoming a must for many applications and services.

   The European Community's Sixth Framework Program Integrated Project
   called 'Ambient Networks' [AMBIENT] is trying to address these
   challenges, following generalization and integration procedures.  The
   main ob jective of the pro ject is the definition of a complete
   innovative networking model, respondent to the development of mobile
   network solutions and the integration of different types of fixed and
   mobile networks.

   One of the main interests in this kind of network organization is the
   provision of services to the end-users, in a way transparent to the
   network specific characteristics as much as possible.  In this
   research area, Overlay Networks have been proved to be a powerful
   solution for abstracting services from the network connectivity and
   providing a decentralized network organization.

   Ambient Networks is defining an overlay service of Service-aware
   Adaptive Transport Overlay (SATO).  The main purpose is the design of
   a generalized structure which is able to realize overlay networks on
   demand, in order to carry multiple applications and to provide them
   useful functionalities inside the network paths.  The exchange of
   multimedia traffic like voice and video is one of the applications
   which can benefit of SATO.  Peer-to-peer SIP has been realized on the
   SATO platform and this memo gives an overview of the current
   implementation.

   The remainder of the document is structure in this way that Section 2
   defines the goals of our peer-to-peer SIP system and introduces the
   system.  Section 5 reports some findings.

   You will find the P2PSIP terminology used within this memo being
   mainly aligned with the terminology in [I-D.willis-p2psip-concepts].

2.  SATO System Overview

   This section describes the overall system of the Service-Aware
   Transport Overlay (SATO) system used to build a peer-to-peer SIP
   system.

2.1.  General concepts of SATO

   The purpose of SATO in the Ambient Networks architecture is to
   provide a flexible and customisable transport service to the
   application layer by using overlay networks on top of the transport
   layer connectivity.  Further service needed to run such a SATO are
   included, for instance a distributed lookup service (i.e., DHT but
   not limited to).

   Service-aware Transport Overlay

      Service-aware Adaptive Transport Overlays (SATOs) enable the
      flexible configuration of virtual networks consisting of Overlay
      Nodes (ONodes) on top of the underlying basic network
      connectivity.  The Overlay Network topologies are responding to
      the application needs and can follow point-to-point, point-to-
      multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint paradigms.  Many SATOs can
      be created and deployed simultaneously.


   Dynamic Inclusion of Network Elements

      The novel SATO concept allows the transparent inclusion of
      network-side data processing elements (SATO Ports) in the end-to-
      end transport path (between a client and a server or Peer-to-
      Peer).  These SATO Ports can provide value-added functions such as
      Overlay routing, smart caching, media adaptation, rate adaptation,
      synchronization, filtering, metering, congestion control, etc.


   On Demand Overlay Set Up and Tear Down

      Service-aware Adaptive Transport Overlays are designed for
      accommodating the requests of the application services.  As a
      consequence, they should be established on demand, based on
      particular requirements, and terminated when the service is not
      requested anymore (e.g., after the last user has disconnected).

Internet-Draft            P2PSIP Implementation             October 2006


   Overlay Adaptation

      SATOs could adapt as a consequence of ONodes joining or leaving
      the virtual network or due to ONodes with changing context or as a
      result of adaptation requests from other Ambient Networks
      Functional Entities.  This introduces the notion of Oadaptive
      overlaysO that dynamically re-configure in order to optimise the
      service delivery.  Dynamic adaptation of a SATO can also take
      place in response to changes in other Functional Entities (FEs) or
      in the underlying network.  SATO adaptation requires significant,
      time-consuming control space activities possibly involving
      interactions between many FEs.  Highly dynamism or fast
      alterations within SATOs can therefore be addressed by means of
      internal SATO routing capabilities.


2.2.  Elements of SATO

   The core of the SATO P2PSIP systems are the SATO overlay nodes.
   These nodes are P2PSIP overlay peers participating in the peer-to-
   peer routing.  Each overlay peer hosts a modified SIP proxy, RTP
   proxy, and the overlay manager.  The overlay manager is in charge of
   controlling the overlay, providing a distributed lookup service for
   users and media relays, etc.  Additionally, overlay peers can host
   media relays that are offered to other peers in order to assist in
   NAT/firewall traversal.  Figure 1 shows the overlay peer building
   blocks.

   The overlay manager uses Web Services (chosen for rapid prototyping
   for the P2PSIP Overlay Peer Protocol) to communicate with other
   overlay managers on other peer nodes.  The overlay peer internal
   communication is using Unix sockets.  The SIP proxy is using an off
   the shelf SIP stack with modified routing, i.e., peer-to-peer
   routing, stores the user records in a DHT (see next paragraph), and a
   slightly changed interface to the IP sockets.  The RTP proxy is off
   the shelf as well.  The connections between two SIP proxies or two
   RTP proxies on different overlay peers can use any type of transport
   protocol or network layer setting, e.g., TCP running over IPsec.  The
   used transport protocol, IP version, encryption, etc is negotiated
   via the overlay managers.

   Not shown in Figure 1 is the distributed lookup service for storing
   P2PSIP overlay user records and location information for media
   relays.  For both, the user records and the media relay location, a
   mapping of the respective information to the IP address of the
   overlay peer is stored.  The bamboo DHT implementation [BAMBOO] is
   currently used for storing this information.


3.  Running Peer-to-Peer SIP

   The SATO P2PSIP system is build in such a way that traditional SIP UA
   can participate without any modification.  The SIP UA use their
   standard way of SIP and RTP for signalling and media.  The SIP UAs in
   the example below use SIP with UDP transport.  The settings of the
   UAs need just to point for the SIP registrar and outbound proxy to
   their overlay peer (see also Figure 2.  So, all outgoing SIP
   signalling messages will be forwarded to the respective P2PSIP
   overlay peer.

3.1.  Registering and Deregistering a User

   This section assumes an in advanced happening enrolment process for
   the user with the P2PSIP system.  The enrolment process has not been
   defined and implemented.

   The SIP UA proceeds with the standard registration process as defined
   in [RFC3261] either UDP or TCP to the P2PSIP overlay peer, i.e., the
   P2PSIP Overlay Client Protocol is standard SIP.  The P2PSIP registrar
   (part of the proxy here) uses in the SATO P2P system currently only
   the user part of the SIP URI for the registration process.  The P2P
   SIP registrar stores the given user part of the URI in the DHT
   together with its (or one of its) IP addresses.  The real location of
   the UA is only stored in the P2PSIP registrar.

   The entry in the DHT and P2PSIP registrar is deleted, when the user

Internet-Draft            P2PSIP Implementation             October 2006


   should be deregistered, i.e., either by timeout of the registration
   or explicitly request.


4.  Running a P2P Call

   Placing a call from one UA1 to UA2 (see xref
   target="fig.p2psipsato"/>) is again following the possible call flows
   in [RFC3261] from UA to P2PSIP overlay peer.  The SIP proxy at the
   overlay peer receiving the call request (SIP) is using the user part
   of the SIP URI for the DHT lookup.  If the user is registered in the
   DHT, i.e., register at some overlay peer, the IP address of the
   serving overlay peer is obtained.  Otherwise a 404 (Not Found)
   response is generated and send to the UA.  This IP address is
   transfered from SIP1 to the local overlay manager OM1.  OM1 uses the
   P2PSIP Overlay Peer Protocol to contact OM2 on the target overlay
   peer where UA2 is registered to.  OM1 and OM2 negotiate the possible
   and by the SIP proxy desired transport connection between SIP1 and
   remote P2PSIP proxy SIP2.  Once the transport connection between SIP1
   and SIP2 is setup, both are notified about this.  SIP1 forwards the
   SIP messages from UA1 (with modified values of some SIP headers to
   reflect the routing) to SIP2 via this transport connection (TCP in
   the example).  SIP2 in turn forwards the message to UA2.  Subsequent
   SIP messages are transfered via this transport connection.

   SIP2) will replace the media IP address(es) and port(s) by an IP
   address and port of their local RTP proxy.  The SDP part of UA1 will
   be replaced with IP addresses/ports of RTP2 and of UA2 with IP
   addresses/ports of RTP1.  This behaviour can turned on or off per
   configuration in the respective P2PSIP proxies if the media should
   delivered directly between UA1 and UA2.  OM1 and OM2 will take care
   of setting up the desired transport connection between RTP1 and RTP2.
   The example uses TCP but any other transport can used.  Now the call
   can proceed and when the call ends all transport connections between
   SIP1/SIP2 and RTP1/RTP2 are teared down.


5.  Conclusions

   This memo sketches the Ambient Networks SATO-based peer-to-peer SIP
   system, which is one possible way to realize such a P2PSIP system.
   It uses a generalized overlay deployment system, a well-known
   distributed lookup service and unmodified SIP stacks in proxies and
   user agents.  Not yet described but also implemented is the lookup of
   media/packet relays and their inclusion into the overlay network.
   This enables support for NAT/firewall traversal of signalling and
   data.  The exact changes in the SIP routing and the SIP header values
   are not yet listed in this memo, but will be added to the next
   revision.

   The intention of this document is raise further discussions and not
   to give a final recommendation or similar.


6.  Security Considerations

   To be done.
