                    draft-ietf-ace-cbor-web-token-04

Abstract

   CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web
   Token (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices.  The claims in
   a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
   and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added
   application layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of
   information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/
   value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.

1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] is a standardized security token
   format that has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
   deployments, among other applications.  JWT uses JSON Web Signature
   (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516] to secure the
   contents of the JWT, which is a set of claims represented in JSON.
   The use of JSON for encoding information is popular for Web and
   native applications, but it is considered inefficient for some
   Internet of Things (IoT) systems that use low power radio
   technologies.

   An alternative encoding of claims is defined in this document.
   Instead of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification uses
   CBOR [RFC7049] and calls this new structure "CBOR Web Token (CWT)",
   which is a compact means of representing secured claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  CWT is closely related to JWT.  It
   references the JWT claims and both its name and pronunciation are
   derived from JWT.  To protect the claims contained in CWTs, the CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [I-D.ietf-cose-msg]
   specification is used.

   The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
   "cot".

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terminology from JWT [RFC7519] and COSE
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].

   StringOrURI:
      The "StringOrURI" term has the same meaning, syntax, and
      processing rules as the "StringOrUri" term defined in Section 2 of



Jones, et al.           Expires October 15, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               CBOR Web Token                   April 2017


      JWT [RFC7519], except that a CWT StringOrURI uses CBOR major type
      3 (text string) instead of a JSON string value.

   NumericDate:
      The "NumericDate" term has the same meaning, syntax, and
      processing rules as the "NumericDate" term defined in Section 2 of
      JWT [RFC7519], except that a CWT NumericDate uses one of the CBOR
      numeric types (0, 1, or 7 with subtypes 25, 26, or 27), instead of
      a numeric JSON value.  The numeric date values that can used for a
      CWT NumericDate are identical to the epoch-based date/time values
      that are specified to follow the tag defined in Section 2.4.1
      (Date and Time) of [RFC7049], except that the tag itself need not
      be present.

   CBOR encoded claim key:
      The key used to identify a claim value.

   CWT Claims Set
      A CBOR map that contains the claims conveyed by the CWT.

3.  Claims

   The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is
   context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.
   Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
   understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
   the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
   by implementations MUST be ignored.

   To keep CWTs as small as possible, the CBOR encoded claim keys are
   represented using CBOR major type 0.  Section 4 summarizes all keys
   used to identify the claims defined in this document.

3.1.  Claim Names

   None of the claims defined below are intended to be mandatory to use
   or implement.  They rather provide a starting point for a set of
   useful, interoperable claims.  Applications using CWTs should define
   which specific claims they use and when they are required or
   optional.

3.1.1.  iss (Issuer) Claim

   The "iss" (issuer) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and processing
   rules as the "iss" claim defined in Section 4.1.1 of JWT [RFC7519],
   except that the format MUST be a StringOrURI.  The CBOR encoded claim
   key 1 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.2.  sub (Subject) Claim

   The "sub" (subject) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "sub" claim defined in Section 4.1.2 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the format MUST be a StringOrURI.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 2 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.3.  aud (Audience) Claim

   The "aud" (audience) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "aud" claim defined in Section 4.1.3 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the format MUST be a StringOrURI.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 3 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.4.  exp (Expiration Time) Claim

   The "exp" (expiration time) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "exp" claim defined in Section 4.1.4 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the format MUST be a CWT NumericDate.  The
   CBOR encoded claim key 4 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.5.  nbf (Not Before) Claim

   The "nbf" (not before) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "nbf" claim defined in Section 4.1.5 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the format MUST be a CWT NumericDate.  The
   CBOR encoded claim key 5 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.6.  iat (Issued At) Claim

   The "iat" (issued at) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "iat" claim defined in Section 4.1.6 of JWT
   [RFC7519], except that the format MUST be a CWT NumericDate.  The
   CBOR encoded claim key 6 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.7.  cti (CWT ID) Claim

   The "cti" (CWT ID) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and processing
   rules as the "jti" claim defined in Section 4.1.7 of JWT [RFC7519],
   except that the format MUST be of major type 2, binary string.  The
   CBOR encoded claim key 7 MUST be used to identify this claim.

5.  CBOR Tags and Claim Values

   The use of CBOR tags to prefix any of the claim values defined in
   this specification is NOT RECOMMENDED.  For instance, while CBOR tag
   6.1 (seconds-since-the-epoch) could logically be prefixed to values
   of the "exp", "nbf", and "iat" claims, this is unnecessary, since the
   representation of the claim values is already specified by the claim
   definitions.  Tagging claim values would only take up extra space,
   without adding information.  However, other claims defined by other
   specifications can specify that a tag prefix the claim value, when
   appropriate.

6.  CWT CBOR Tag

   How to determine that a CBOR data structure is a CWT is application-
   dependent.  In some cases, this information is known from the
   application context, such as from the position of the CWT in a data
   structure at which the value must be a CWT.  One method of indicating
   that a CBOR object is a CWT is the use of the "application/cwt"
   content type by a transport protocol.

   This section defines the CWT CBOR tag as another means for
   applications to declare that a CBOR data structure is a CWT.  Its use
   is optional, and is intended for use in cases in which this
   information would not otherwise be known.

   If present, the CWT tag MUST prefix a tagged object using one of the
   COSE CBOR tags.  In this example, the COSE_Mac0 tag is used.  The
   actual COSE_Mac0 object has been excluded from this example.

7.  Creating and Validating CWTs

7.1.  Creating a CWT

   To create a CWT, the following steps are performed.  The order of the
   steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies
   between the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.  Create a CWT Claims Set containing the desired claims.

   2.  Let the Message be the binary representation of the CWT Claims
       Set.

   3.  Create a COSE Header containing the desired set of Header
       Parameters.  The COSE Header MUST be valid per the
       [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] specification.

   4.  Depending upon whether the CWT is signed, MACed, or encrypted,
       there are three cases:

       *  If the CWT is signed, create a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object
          using the Message as the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 Payload; all
          steps specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] for creating a
          COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object MUST be followed.

       *  Else, if the CWT is MACed, create a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 object
          using the Message as the COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 Payload; all steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] for creating a COSE_Mac/
          COSE_Mac0 object MUST be followed.

       *  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object,
          create a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 using the Message as the
          plaintext for the COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object; all steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] for creating a COSE_Encrypt/
          COSE_Encrypt0 object MUST be followed.

   5.  If a nested signing, MACing or encryption operation will be
       performed, let the Message be the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac/
       COSE_Mac0 or COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0, and return to Step 3,
       using a "content type" header value corresponding to the media



Jones, et al.           Expires October 15, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               CBOR Web Token                   April 2017


       type "application/cwt" in the new COSE Header created in that
       step.

   6.  If needed by the application, add the appropriate COSE CBOR tag
       to the COSE object to indicate type of COSE object.  If also
       needed by the application, add the CWT CBOR tag to indicate that
       the COSE object is a CWT.

7.2.  Validating a CWT

   When validating a CWT, the following steps are performed.  The order
   of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
   dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.  If any of
   the listed steps fail, then the CWT MUST be rejected -- that is,
   treated by the application as invalid input.

   1.  Verify that the CWT is a valid CBOR object.

   2.  If the object begins with the CWT CBOR tag, remove it and verify
       that one of the COSE CBOR tags follows it.

   3.  If the object is tagged with one of the COSE CBOR tags, remove it
       and verify that it corresponds to the structure of the following
       COSE object.

   4.  Verify that the resulting COSE Header includes only parameters
       and values whose syntax and semantics are both understood and
       supported or that are specified as being ignored when not
       understood.

   5.  Use the CBOR tag to determine the type of the CWT, COSE_Sign/
       COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0, or COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0.

   6.  Depending upon whether the CWT is a signed, MACed, or encrypted,
       there are three cases:

       *  If the CWT is a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1, follow the steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] Section 4 (Signing Objects)
          for validating a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 object.  Let the Message
          be the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 payload.

       *  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0, follow the steps
          specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] Section 6 (MAC Objects) for
          validating a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 object.  Let the Message be
          the COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 payload.

       *  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object,
          follow the steps specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] Section 5

          (Encryption Objects) for validating a COSE_Encrypt/
          COSE_Encrypt0 object.  Let the Message be the resulting
          plaintext.

   7.  If the COSE Header contains a "content type" header value
       corresponding to the media type "application/cwt", then the
       Message is a CWT that was the subject of nested signing or
       encryption operations.  In this case, return to Step 1, using the
       Message as the CWT.

   8.  Verify that the Message is a valid CBOR object; let the CWT
       Claims Set be this CBOR object.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security of the CWT is dependent on the protections offered by
   COSE.  Unless the claims in a CWT are protected, an adversary can
   modify, add, or remove claims.  Since the claims conveyed in a CWT
   may be used to make authorization decisions, it is not only important
   to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that the recipient
   can authenticate the party that assembled the claims and created the
   CWT.  Without trust of the recipient in the party that created the
   CWT, no sensible authorization decision can be made.  Furthermore,
   the creator of the CWT needs to carefully evaluate each claim value
   prior to including it in the CWT so that the recipient can be assured
   of the validity of the information provided.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Registry

   This section establishes the IANA "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims"
   registry.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis, on
   the advice of one or more Designated Experts.  However, to allow for
   the allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Experts
   may approve registration once they are satisfied that such a
   specification will be published.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the
   registration description is clear.

9.1.1.  Registration Template

   Claim Name:
      The human-readable name requested (e.g., "iss").

   Claim Description:
      Brief description of the claim (e.g., "Issuer").

   JWT Claim Name:
      Claim Name of the equivalent JWT claim, as registered in
      [IANA.JWT.Claims].  CWT claims should normally have a
      corresponding JWT claim.  If a corresponding JWT claim would not
      make sense, the Designated Experts can choose to accept
      registrations for which the JWT Claim Name is listed as "N/A".

   CBOR Key Value:
      Key value for the claim.  The key value MUST be an integer in the
      range of 1 to 65536.

   CBOR Major Type:
      CBOR major type and optional tag for the claim.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IESG".  For others, give the
      name of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal
      address, email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the documents.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be
      included but is not required.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This appendix includes a set of CWT examples that show how the CWT
   Claims Set can be protected.  There are examples that are signed,
   MACed, encrypted, and that use nested signing and encryption.  To
   make the examples easier to read, they are presented both as hex
   strings and in the extended CBOR diagnostic notation described in
   Section 6 of [RFC7049].

A.1.  Example CWT Claims Set

   The CWT Claims Set used for the different examples displays usage of
   all the defined claims.  For signed and MACed examples, the CWT
   Claims Set is the CBOR encoding as a binary string.

   The encryption is done with AES-CCM mode using the 128-bit symmetric
   key from Appendix A.2.1 with a 64-bit tag and 13-byte nonce, i.e.,
   COSE AES-CCM-16-64-128.  Line breaks are for display purposes only.

A.6.  Example Nested CWT

   This section shows a Nested CWT, signed and then encrypted, with a
   single recipient and a full CWT Claims Set.

   The signature is generated using the private ECDSA key from
   Appendix A.2.3 and it can be validated using the public ECDSA parts
   from Appendix A.2.3.  The encryption is done with AES-CCM mode using
   the 128-bit symmetric key from Appendix A.2.1 with a 64-bit tag and
   13-byte nonce, i.e., COSE AES-CCM-16-64-128.  The content type is set
   to CWT to indicate that there are multiple layers of COSE protection
   before finding the CWT Claims Set. The decrypted ciphertext will be a
   COSE_sign1 structure.  In this example, it is the same one as in
   Appendix A.3, i.e., a Signed CWT Claims Set.  Note that there is no
   limitation to the number of layers; this is an example with two
   layers.  Line breaks are for display purposes only.
