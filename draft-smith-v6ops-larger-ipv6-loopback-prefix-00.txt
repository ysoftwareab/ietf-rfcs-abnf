                   A Larger Loopback Prefix for IPv6
            draft-smith-v6ops-larger-ipv6-loopback-prefix-00

Abstract

   In IPv4, 127/8 is the loopback prefix, where as in IPv6 it is
   ::1/128.  The significant difference between these two prefixes is
   the number of addresses they cover; 127/8 covers 2^24 or 16 777 216
   addresses, where as ::1/128 covers just a single address.

   IPv4's large number of loopback addresses has facilitated some novel
   uses of the loopback function that cannot be achieved with the single
   loopback address available in IPv6.  This memo proposes a new larger
   loopback prefix for IPv6 so that these uses of the loopback function
   become available for IPv6.

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix            July 2012


1.  Introduction

   In IPv4, 127/8 is the internal host loopback prefix [RFC1122].  In
   IPv6, ::1/128 is the internal node loopback prefix [RFC4291].
   Packets sent from addresses within these prefixes are not to leave
   the node, and packets destined to addresses from within these
   prefixes are to be returned internally within the originating node
   for local processing.

   The significant difference between the IPv4 127/8 loopback prefix and
   the IPv6 ::1/128 loopback prefix is the number of addresses they each
   cover; 127/8 covers 2^24 or 16 777 216 addresses, where as ::1/128
   covers just a single address.

   The large amount of address space covered by 127/8 has facilitated
   some novel uses of the loopback function, which concurrently utilise
   multiple loopback addresses.  These loopback function uses are not
   possible with the IPv6 ::1/128 loopback prefix.

   The IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address form of 127/8, ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104
   [RFC4291], could be used for these loopback uses under IPv6.
   However, /104 is not a prefix length commonly used in native IPv6
   addressing, and may create unacceptable constraints on these loopback
   uses when applied to IPv6.  For example, 64 bit interface identifers
   [RFC4291] cannot be used within ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104.

   This memo proposes a larger IPv6 loopback prefix to overcome the
   constraints of ::1/128.

   The memo starts by describing some use cases of the loopback function
   that are currently not possible with ::1/128.  Following these uses,
   the requirements a larger IPv6 loopback prefix should attempt to meet
   are provided.  A proposed new larger IPv6 loopback prefix that meets
   the majority of these requirements is then specified.  For this new
   larger IPv6 loopback prefix, the host and router processing rules for
   packets containing addresses within this larger IPv6 loopback prefix
   are described.  Finally, relevant security considerations are
   discussed.

   This memo, if published, updates [RFC4291] and [RFC5156].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Example Loopback Prefix Uses Not Possible With ::1/128

   The following are examples of loopback function use under IPv4,
   facilitated by 127/8, that are not achievable under IPv6 with
   ::1/128.

2.1.  Multiple Application Instances Listening On The Same Transport
      Layer Protocol Port

   During network application development and testing, it can be useful
   to run multiple instances of the same application concurrently.
   Additionally, it can be useful to avoid these networked application
   instances being reachable via the host's external interfaces, for
   security and other reasons.

   Network applications that use a well known transport layer protocol
   port will normally listen on that port for all addresses available on
   the host.  Consequently, attempting to run another instance of the
   application will cause the second instance to fail, as the listening
   port is already in use.

   This port reuse limitation can be overcome by either having each
   application instance listen on a different transport layer protocol
   port.  Alternatively, each application instance could use the same
   well known transport layer port, bound to different and distinct
   addresses available on the host.  The latter method can be more
   convenient, as networked applications tend to be written to more
   easily communicate with processes listening on different addresses,
   typically expressed as DNS names.

   127/8 has provided many IPv4 addresses that can be used on a host to
   run multiple instances of applications listening on the same
   transport layer protocol port, while also preventing those
   application instances from being reachable through the host's
   external interfaces.

2.2.  ntpd Reference Clock Device Drivers

   ntpd [NTPD] supports local reference clocks, in addition to network
   located time sources.  A local reference clock is typically a
   hardware device attached directly to the host, receiving time
   information from an external source, such as a satellite.

   To simplify time source configuration, comparison and selection,
   local reference clocks are represented as though they were network
   attached time sources, by using addresses that fall within 127/8.
   These 127/8 addresses have the form 127.127.t.u, where 't' represents
   the reference clock driver type, and 'u' represents the reference

   clock driver unit or instance.  [NTPD-RCD]

2.3.  Multiple Loopback Interfaces As Routing Next Hops

   Some IPv4 router implementations allow multiple virtual link layer
   loopback interfaces to be created.  These virtual interfaces can then
   be assigned different prefixes and addresses from within 127/8, with
   non-locally assigned addresses within these prefixes used as next hop
   addresses for static or dynamic IPv4 routes.  The state of these
   routes will then depend on the administrative state of the
   corresponding virtual interface.  Administratively enabling or
   disabling a virtual interface will add or remove the corresponding
   routes from the IPv4 route table.  This can be useful for testing
   routing convergence performance or the simulation of networks with
   large numbers of routes.


3.  Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix Requirements

   A new larger IPv6 loopback prefix should attempt to satisfy all of
   the following requirements.

3.1.  Well Known Prefix

   A new larger IPv6 loopback prefix should have a single value and be
   well known.  This allows it to be automatically configured on hosts
   and routers upon system initialisation.  For currently deployed hosts
   and routers that aren't aware of a new loopback prefix, a single well
   known prefix will simplify the configuration of an additional
   loopback prefix static route, additional loopback prefixes and
   addresses on a loopback virtual interfaces, and configuration of
   packet filters or firewall rules.

3.2.  Within An Existing Special Purpose IPv6 Prefix

   A new larger IPv6 loopback prefix should be located within an
   existing aggregate IPv6 prefix already in use for similar well known
   special use prefixes.

3.3.  Easy For A Human To Use

   As previously described, one use of a larger IPv6 loopback prefix
   will be during development and testing of new network applications.
   In this and similar cases, it is likely that a human will be entering
   the prefix or addresses that fall within it quite regularly.
   Therefore, the new larger IPv6 loopback prefix should be both easy to
   remember and easy to enter into a computer system.

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix            July 2012


   A special use IPv6 prefix that is easy use has the following
   characteristics:

   o  is numerically similar or significantly different to other special
      use IPv6 prefixes that serve similar purposes, as this assists
      with remembering the prefix

   o  is as short possible, once leading zeros have been supressed and
      strings of zeros have been suppressed using "::", assisting with
      both remembering the prefix and the accurate entry of the prefix
      into a computing system

3.4.  Covers the Existing IPv6 Loopback Prefix

   The new larger IPv6 loopback prefix should cover the existing ::1/128
   IPv6 loopback prefix, as a single loopback prefix suiting all
   loopback uses is less complex than two loopback prefixes, with one
   providing a single address, and the other providing many addresses.

3.5.  Supports 64 bit Interface Identifiers

   The network applications being developed and tested using the
   loopback prefix may perform IPv6 addressing related functions.  To
   simulate native IPv6 addressing, the new larger IPv6 loopback prefix
   should accomodate 64 bit interface identifers.

3.6.  Supports Multiple Subnets

   New network applications may also perform IPv6 subnet related
   functions, or need to be tested with multiple IPv6 addresses from
   different subnets, including situations such as phasing in and
   phasing out of subnets via the preferred and valid lifetime
   mechanism.  The new larger IPv6 loopback prefix should support
   multiple IPv6 subnets, typically /64s, with the number of supported
   subnets being large enough for most if not all conceivable uses.


4.  Proposed Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix

   The proposed larger IPv6 loopback prefix is:

   0001:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/48

   This prefix meets all but one of the previously described
   requirements; the exception being that it does not cover the existing
   ::1/128 loopback prefix.  Specifically,

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix            July 2012


   o  it would be a well known prefix

   o  it would fall within an existing IPv6 prefix used for similar
      special purpose prefixes (0::/8)

   o  it would be easy for a human to use, as concisely it is 1::/48

   o  it would support 64 bit interface identifiers

   o  and would provide 2^16 or 65536 /64 subnets

   It is not possible to meet the requirement that ::1/128 falls within
   the new larger loopback prefix, if the prefix length of the new
   prefix is /48.  This would result in a new larger loopback prefix of
   ::/48, which would also cover the IPv4 mapped IPv6 address prefix,
   ::ffff:0.0.0.0/104.  It would not be acceptable to locally loop
   traffic destined to these addresses, as it would prevent their use as
   described in [RFC4038].  A compromise of excluding the IPv4 mapped
   IPv6 address prefix from the loopback function applied to ::/48 is
   not feasible, as that would prevent a range of 64 bit IPv6 interface
   identifier values from being available within all loopback prefix
   subnets.

   Some Internet Protocol implementations represent or perform the
   loopback function using a virtual link layer interface, commonly
   known as the "loopback" interface.  Conceptually, or in actuallity,
   the node's operating system transmits packets out the virtual
   interface, and then the loopback interface device driver returns the
   packet to the host as though it had been received by the loopback
   interface.  The packets are then processed by the local network layer
   protocol implementation.

   Although all addresses within 127/8 are considered assigned to the
   host, it is common to have the individual address 127.0.0.1/8
   automatically configured on the loopback interface during system
   initialisation, and to show this address when querying the loopback
   interface for assigned IPv4 addresses.  This is for operational
   convenience rather than necessity.  Similarly, ::1/128 is also
   typically automatically configured on the loopback interface.

   For the 1::/48 loopback prefix, the address automatically configured
   on the loopback interface should be:

   1::1/64

   The implementation will still consider all addresses within 1::/48 to
   be locally assigned, such that removal of 1::1/64 from the loopback
   interface by a system administrator will not change the loopback

   behaviour for 1::1/64, or any other address within 1::/48.


5.  1::/48 Processing Rules

   The following processing rules apply to packets containing ::1/48
   source and/or destination addresses.

5.1.  Host Rules

   The following rules apply to IPv6 hosts.

5.1.1.  Packets Sent with 1::/48 Source and/or 1::/48 Destination
        Addresses

   Packets with 1::/48 source and/or destination addresses MUST be
   returned to the host for processing by the local IPv6 protocol stack.
   They MUST NOT be sent over any external links attached to the host.

   Processing of the locally returned packers is to occur as though they
   originated externally and had entered the host via a link layer
   interface.  Standard incoming IPv6 packet processing occurs, which
   may include generating appropriate ICMPv6 error messages.  For
   example, for an IPv6 packet with a 1::/48 source address, and a
   unicast destination address that is not assigned to the host, an
   ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable, Address Unreachable is likely to be
   generated.  This ICMPv6 error message would be returned locally to
   the host for further processing, as it will have a 1::/48 destination
   address.  (ICMPv6 error messages cannot be generated in response to
   received ICMPv6 error messages, preventing an endless loop of ICMPv6
   error messages in this situation.)

   In addition to unicast IPv6 addresses assigned to interfaces via
   other means, all destinations within 1::/48 MUST be considered
   assigned to the host.

5.1.2.  Packets Received Externally With 1::/48 Source and/or
        Destination Addresses

   Packets with 1::/48 source and/or destination addresses received over
   any of the external links attached to the host MUST be dropped.
   ICMPv6 error messages, such as Destination Unreachable messages, MUST
   NOT be generated for these dropped packets.

   For these dropped packets, it may be useful to generate an
   appropriate system log message, indicating a packet with an invalid
   source or destination address (a "martian") was received over an
   external interface.  By default, these messages should be suppressed.

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix            July 2012


   If they are enabled, they should be appropriately rate limited, with
   the rate limit being able to be set by a system administrator.  An
   appropriate rate limiting mechanism could be the one suggested for
   ICMPv6 messages, described in section 2.4, (f) of [RFC4443].

5.2.  Router Rules

   IPv4 loopback packet processing rules for routers, specified in
   [RFC1812], by default, prohibited forwarding of packets with 127/8
   destinations, other than those originated locally by and returned
   back to the router itself.  However, a software switch could be
   provided to disable this prohibition.  This special case of allowing
   forwarding of packets towards 127/8 destinations has been taken
   advantage of by [RFC4379].  An equivalent function for IPv6 is
   provided by using the IPv4 mapped IPv6 prefix of ::ffff:127.0.0.0/
   104.

   The existing loopback IPv6 packet processing rules for routers is the
   same as for IPv6 hosts; traffic towards ::1/128, not originated
   locally, and must not be forwarded by a router [RFC4291].

   For the new 1::/48 loopback prefix, the IPv6 router processing rules
   are modified to match those of IPv4.

5.2.1.  Packets Sent with 1::/48 Source and/or 1::/48 Destination
        Addresses

   By default, an IPv6 router MUST follow the host processing rules,
   described previously, for packets sent with 1::/48 source and/or
   destination addresses.  In summary, IPv6 packets with 1::/48 source
   and/or 1::/48 destination addresses are not to leave the router, and
   are to be looped back to the router for host oriented processing.

   A software switch may be provided to permit packets with 1::/48
   source and/or destination addresses to be sent via an external
   interface, to facilitate uses of 1::/48 similar to those described in
   [RFC4379].  If provided, this software switch MUST default to off.

5.2.2.  Packets Received Externally With 1::/48 Source and/or
        Destination Addresses

   By default, an IPv6 router must follow the host processing rules,
   described previously, for packets received externally with 1::/48
   source and/or destination addresses.  In summary, IPv6 packets with
   1::/48 source and/or 1::/48 destination addresses are to be dropped,
   and ICMPv6 error messages are not to be generated in response.  The
   ability to log reception of these types of packets could be provided,
   however, by default, they must not be logged.

   A software switch may be provided to permit packets with 1::/48
   source and/or destination addresses to be forwarded via an external
   interface, to facilitate uses of 1::/48 similar to those described in
   [RFC4379].  This software switch MUST default to off.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The following people provided useful comments on this memo:


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate 1::/48 from within 0::/8 of the
   Internet Protocol Version 6 Address Space, for use as a larger
   loopback prefix for IPv6 as described in this memo.


8.  Security Considerations

   Today, 1::/48 is an unallocated prefix.  Traffic with source and/or
   destination addresses that fall within 1::/48 will be processed by
   hosts and routers using conventional unicast packet functions, rather
   than the processing rules specified in this memo.  These types of
   hosts and routers will be described as "legacy" in this section.  The
   result of this conventional unicast processing is that packets that
   are intended and expected to be looped back locally within the origin
   node may leave the legacy node ("leak") via an externally attached
   interface, and subsequently may be forwarded through the local
   routing domain, towards the global public Internet.  This may
   disclose information to unauthorised parties, and therefore may have
   unacceptable security consequences, depending on local security
   policy.

   A legacy node that does not have any external network attachments,
   while not looping packets for local processing, will inherently keep
   packets local to the node either by locally processing them or
   dropping them, eliminating the security implications of packets
   leaving the node.

   For legacy nodes with externally attached interfaces, the following
   classes of packets will be forwarded by conventional unicast
   processing, contrary to the ruls specified in this memo:

   1.  non-1::/48 source, 1::/48 destination

   2.  1::/48 source, non-1::/48 destination

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix            July 2012


   3.  1::/48 source, 1::/48 destination

   Packet filters (also commonly known as Access Control Lists, or
   ACLs), filtering on source and/or destination 1::/48 addresses,
   should be used to prevent these classes of packets being forwarded.

   The ideal location to place packet filters for these classes of
   packets is as cl ose to the source of these packets as possible,
   which is on the origin hosts themselves.  If the hosts support a
   packet filtering or more advanced firewalling capability, the filters
   would be applied to all externally attached interfaces and therefore
   to the packets traversing them.  Preferably this should not be to
   distinct external interfaces, but rather to a class that contains
   active external interfaces, allowing the packet filter to be applied
   to dynamically created interfaces, such as those that may appear and
   disappear over time on mobile hosts.  This is the best option to
   mitigate 1::/48 packet leaking if the hosts support this capability.

   As a defence-in-depth measure, 1::/48 packet filters should also be
   applied to packets egressing and ingressing the local network, with
   the boundary of the local network likely to be where the local
   network has one or more attachments to the Internet or other external
   parties.  These packet filters should be the first to be deployed,
   even if host based filtering is being used, to both cover the period
   during which filters are deployed to individual hosts, and to
   continue to act as a backup defence mechanism should the host filters
   fail or not be deployed on new hosts attached to the network.

   It may also be useful to deploy packet filters at key, if not all
   routers within the local network.  The chosen routers would likely
   correspond with security domain boundaries where it is important to
   drop packets with 1::/48 source and/or destination addresses.  For
   example, if application developers are using 1::/48 addresses on
   their hosts, the router(s) where 1::/48 packet filters would be
   deployed as at the boundary between the application developer's sub-
   network and the rest of the local network.

   Service Providers, in addition to deploying packet filters as above
   for their own 1::/48 use, should also apply 1::/48 packet filters to
   traffic received from their downstream customers' networks and their
   peer and upstream suppliers' networks.  Service Providers are likely
   to have deployed ingress source address filtering to prevent denial
   of service attacks via source addres spoofing [BCP38], which will act
   as a filter for packets with 1::/48 source addresses.  Service
   Provider routers that do not contain a default route (i.e. have
   complete knowledge of all Internet destinations) will drop packets
   with 1::/48 destinations, which may be an acceptable mitigation for
   1::/48 packet leaks, if the customer, peer and upstream supplier

   networks are attached to this class of routers.  However, routing
   policy may change over time, so an explicit packet filter that drops
   packets with 1::/48 source and/or destination addresses, applied to
   all incoming packets would be wise.

   In additon to packet filters, Service Providers must not accept route
   announcements for 1::/48.  They must also ensure they do not announce
   route announcements for 1::/48 to their customers, peers and upstream
   providers.
