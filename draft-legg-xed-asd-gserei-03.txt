1.  Introduction

   Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) [ASN.X] is an Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) [XML10][XML11] representation for Abstract Syntax
   Notation One (ASN.1) [X.680] specifications.  The ASN.X
   representation for the ASN.1 basic notation [X.680] [X.680-1] is
   described elsewhere [ASN.X].

   The grammar of ASN.1 permits the application of encoding instructions
   [X.680-1], through type prefixes and encoding control sections, that
   modify how abstract values are encoded by nominated encoding rules.

   The generic notation for type prefixes and encoding control sections
   is defined by the ASN.1 basic notation, however the notation for
   specific encoding instructions, i.e., the EncodingInstruction and
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList productions of the notation, are
   defined separately for each set of encoding rules using encoding
   instructions.  This document specifies the ASN.X representation for
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList and EncodingInstruction as they are
   defined for the Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER) [GSER][GSEREI].

   ASN.X is defined in terms of rules for translating from an ASN.1
   specification.  This does not preclude an ASN.X module being written
   directly without a pre-existing ASN.1 module, however such an ASN.X
   module is considered valid if and only if there exists, in principle,
   an ASN.1 module that when translated would yield the ASN.X module.

   By design, an ASN.X module is also the Robust XML Encoding Rules
   (RXER) [RXER] encoding of an ASN.1 value.  The ASN.1 type definitions
   for such values, insofar as they pertain to the ASN.1 basic notation,
   are provided elsewhere [ASN.X], however this document provides the
   ASN.1 type definitions for representing GSER encoding instructions as
   abstract values.  These definitions appear in Appendix A.

   The ASN.X translation of the ASN.1 module in Appendix A is presented

   in Appendix B.

   The General Considerations of the specification for ASN.X [ASN.X]
   also apply here.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED" and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [BCP14].  The key
   word "OPTIONAL" is exclusively used with its ASN.1 meaning.

   A reference to an ASN.1 production [X.680] (e.g., Type, NamedType) is
   a reference to the text in an ASN.1 specification corresponding to
   that production.

   The description of the translation of GSER encoding instructions into
   ASN.X makes use of definitions from the XML Information Set (Infoset)
   [INFOSET].  In particular, information item property names follow the
   Infoset convention of being shown in square brackets, e.g.,
   [local name].  Literal values of Infoset properties are enclosed in
   double quotes, however the double quotes are not part of the property
   values.  In the sections that follow, "information item" will be
   abbreviated to "item", e.g., "element information item" is
   abbreviated to "element item".  Element items will be referred to by
   their [local name] in angle brackets, e.g., "the <type> element item"
   means the element item with the [local name] "type".

3.  EncodingInstructionAssignmentList Translation

   As described in the specification for ASN.X [ASN.X], the translation
   of an EncodingControlSection for GSER is an element item with the
   [local name] "GSER".  The translation of the
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList in such an EncodingControlSection
   determines the content of the <GSER> element item.

   The EncodingInstructionAssignmentList for GSER is currently defined
   to be empty [GSEREI], therefore the [attributes] and [children] of
   the <GSER> element item are both empty.

4.  EncodingInstruction Translation

   The translation of an EncodingInstruction for GSER can appear in the
   translation of an EncodingPrefix.  The translation for an
   EncodingPrefix is described by the specification for ASN.X.

   The translation of an EncodingInstruction for GSER is the translation
   of the ChoiceOfStringsInstruction in the EncodingInstruction

INTERNET-DRAFT      ASN.X: GSER Encoding Instructions  December 22, 2006


   (currently the only defined encoding instruction for GSER).

4.1.  ChoiceOfStringsInstruction Translation

   The translation of a ChoiceOfStringsInstruction is an element item
   with the [local name] "choiceOfStrings".

   If the ChoiceOfStringsInstruction has an AlternativesPrecedence, then
   an attribute item with the [local name] "precedence" SHALL be added
   to the [attributes] of the <choiceOfStrings> element item.  The
   [normalized value] of this attribute item is the white space
   separated list of qualified names for the expanded names [XMLNS10] of
   the NamedType instances (see [RXEREI]) corresponding to the
   identifiers nested in the PrecedenceList in the
   AlternativesPrecedence.

   Example

      [GSER:CHOICE-OF-STRINGS PRECEDENCE utf8 visible] CHOICE {
          visible  [RXER:NAME "ascii"] VisibleString,
          utf8     UTF8String
      }

      <type xmlns:asnx="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:asnx">
       <prefixed>
        <GSER><choiceOfStrings precedence="utf8 ascii"/></GSER>
        <type>
         <choice>
          <element name="ascii" identifier="visible"
                   type="asnx:VisibleString"/>
          <element name="utf8" type="asnx:UTF8String"/>
         </choice>
        </type>
       </prefixed>
      </type>

5.  Security Considerations

   The ASN.X translation of a GSER encoding instruction is semantically
   equivalent to the original GSER encoding instruction.  The security
   considerations that apply to an application built from an original
   ASN.1 specification with GSER encoding instructions apply equally to
   an application built from the ASN.X translation of the ASN.1
   specification.

   See the main specification for ASN.X [ASN.X] for security
   considerations related to ASN.X modules.

Changes in Draft 01

   The <encodingControl-GSER> element has been renamed to <GSER> and now
   appears as a child element of an <encodingControls> element.

   An insertion encoding instruction has been added to the ASN.1 for
   GSER Encoding Instruction Notation to remove extension ambiguity.

Changes in Draft 02

   The URL for the ASN.1 namespace has been replaced.  A permanent URN
   will be requested from the IANA.

Changes in Draft 03

   The effective name definition has been replaced by the expanded name
   definition from Namespaces in XML.
