Abstract

   This document defines an no-op payload format for the Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP), and a mechanism to request an immediate
   RTCP report.  This can be used to verify RTP connectivity and to keep
   Network Address Translator (NAT) bindings and Firewall pinholes open.

Internet-Draft          RTP No-Op Payload Format                May 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a new RTP payload format called "no-op".  This
   payload behaves like a normal RTP payload, except that it isn't
   played by the receiver.  It is also explicitly designed to interact
   constructively with the RTCP feedback profile [5].

   This new payload format is useful for:

   o  media session reception quality assessment, such as at the
      beginning of a session;
   o  keepalives to keep NAT bindings and/or firewall pinholes open when
      RTP media traffic is not otherwise being transmitted.

   In addition it has a number of uses whose utility is speculative but
   for which it is easy pressed into service:

   o  measurement-based admission control by probing available
      bandwidth, and
   o  synthetic load generation for performance testing and other
      minimally-intrusive instrumentation.

   Unlike Comfort noise [9], which is specific to voice RTP streams, RTP
   No-Op is applicable to any kind of RTP stream including video, audio,
   realtime text, or any other media type that would benefit from the
   capabilities listed above.  This gives RTP No-Op an advantage as a
   NAT keepalive mechanism.  Certain functions and RTP payload types can
   use RTP No-Op without re-inventing their own payload-specific NAT
   keepalive mechanism -- such as video muting, Clearmode [10], and text
   [11].

   Some audio codecs have their own 'silence' packets.  However, some
   codecs only send such 'silence' packets if the noise floor changes;
   G.729b [12] is an example of such a codec.  RTP No-Op allows the RTP
   stack itself, rather than the codec, to send periodic packets as a
   keepalive mechanism.

2.  RTP Payload Format for No-Op

2.1  Registration

   The RTP payload format is designated as "no-op" and the MIME types
   are "audio/no-op", "video/no-op", and "text/no-op".  The default
   clock rate is 8000 Hz, but other rates MAY be used.  In accordance
   with current practice, this payload format does not have a static
   payload type number, but uses a RTP payload type number established
   dynamically out-of-band, e.g. through SDP [3].

Internet-Draft          RTP No-Op Payload Format                May 2005


2.2  Use of RTP Header Fields

   Timestamp: The RTP timestamp reflects the measurement point for the
      current packet.  The receiver calculates jitter for RTCP receiver
      reports based on all packets with a given timestamp.  Note: The
      jitter value should primarily be used as a means for comparing the
      reception quality between two users or two time-periods, not as an
      absolute measure.
   Marker bit: The RTP marker bit has no special significance for this
      payload type.

2.3  Payload Format

   The payload format is shown below.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |R|                         reserved                            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      padding (OPTIONAL)                       |
      |                             ....                              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The payload contains at least 4 bytes.  The first 32 bits are defined
   as follows:

   bit 0:      "R", "Request immediate RTCP", is used to request
               invocation of RTCP feedback by timely transmission of an
               RTCP report (see Section 2.6).
   bits 1-31:  Reserved; contents are ignored.

   Additional padding bytes MAY be appended up to the negotiated ptime
   value in SDP (see Section 2.7).  These bytes are ignored.  Padding
   may be useful to generate RTP packets that are the same size as a
   normal media payload.

2.4  Sender Operation

   When an endpoint is in 'recvonly' or 'inactive' the endpoint isn't
   allowed to send RTP data.  However, to keep a NAT binding alive, the
   endpoint will need to send packets over the RTP port.  RTP No-Op is
   ideally suited to this.  In comparison, if one participant in an
   audio multicast conference is in 'recvonly' or 'inactive', yet
   occasionally sends RFC3389 comfort noise packets in order to keep its
   NAT binding open, these comfort noise packets are interpreted as
   audio packets by receivers and mixers which can cause undesirable
   behavior -- such as selection of the primary speaker or the playout

Internet-Draft          RTP No-Op Payload Format                May 2005


   of comfort noise when no audio should be played.  To keep NAT and
   firewall bindings active, endpoints MUST occasionally send a packet
   to their RTP peer.  The type of RTP packet depends on the negotiated
   RTP payload:

   o  if both ends support RFC3389 and the negotiated RTP payload is
      appropriate for RFC3389, an RFC3389 packet SHOULD be transmitted.
   o  if both ends support RTP No-Op and the negotiated RTP payload is
      inappropriate for RFC3389, RTP No-Op SHOULD be transmitted.

2.5  Mixer, Translator Operation

   An RTP mixer or unicast-to-unicast RTP translator SHOULD forward RTP
   No-Op payload packets normally.  A unicast-to-multicast RTP
   translator SHOULD replicate RTP No-Op payload packets normally.

   A multicast-to-unicast RTP translator SHOULD NOT replicate an RTP
   No-Op packet with the Request Immediate RTCP bit set unless:

   1.  all receivers are known to be operating under the bandwidth
       limitations rules of [5], and
   2.  the restriction of applicability to "small groups" in [5] is
       observed
   Otherwise the sender may be flooded with RTCP reports.

2.6  Receiver Operation

   Upon receipt of an RTP packet with the No-Op payload format and the
   "Send Immediate RTCP Report" bit set to 0, the receiver performs
   normal RTP receive operations on it -- incrementing the RTP receive
   counter, calculating jitter, and so on.  The receiver then discards
   the packet -- it is not used to play out data.

   Upon receipt of an RTP packet with the No-Op payload format and the
   "Se""nd Immediate RTCP Report" bit set to 1, the receiver adjusts
   counters as described above and then also performs the following
   steps (with reference to the definitions and procedures of the AVPF
   profile [5]):

   1.  ascertains whether the associated RTP session is operating under
       the AVPF RTP profile (or one derived from it via combination with
       another RTP profile).  If not the receiver takes no further
       action on this packet.  If so, it continues as follows.
   2.  generates a feedback "Event" which in turn may trigger the
       generation of a "FB message".
   3.  sends the FB message as an "early RTCP packet" assuming the
       bandwidth constraints for feedback messages are satisfied.

   4.  Otherwise, takes no further action

2.7  Indication of No-OP Capability using SDP

   Senders and receivers may indicate support for the No-Op payload
   format, for example, by using the Session Description Protocol SDP
   [3].  If the payload format is being used for connectivity
   verification (e.g. in conjunction with [4]) senders and receivers
   MUST advertise the AVPF profile (or a profile used in combination
   with it).

   The default packetization interval for this payload type is 20ms
   (ptime:20) but alternate values can be advertised in SDP using the
   ptime attribute value [3].

5.  Security Considerations

   Without security of the RTP stream (via SRTP [8], IPsec [7], or other
   means), it is possible for an attacker to spoof RTP packets,
   including this new packet type.  As this new RTP payload type
   includes a method to request immediate transmission of RTCP, this

   could be used to cause endpoints to flood the network with RTCP
   reports.  Thus, the RTCP transmissions MUST NOT exceed the bandwidth
   recommendations described in section 6.3 of RFC3550 [2].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIME type registration as specified above
   in Section 4
