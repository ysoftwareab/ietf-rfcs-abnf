Abstract 
   Currently there are no policy classes defined for the PEP to convey 
   provisioned policy usage feedback to the PDP. The purpose of this 
   document is to define the accounting framework PIB that specifies the 
   policy classes common for COPS accounting type reports. The basic 
   operation and objects for reporting usage information are defined in 
   [COPS]. A specific clientSI accounting type object named REPORT is 
   defined in [COPS-PR]. This document further describes operational 
   behavior that is implied in [COPS] and [COPS-PR.]

1 Introduction  
    
   Policy usage reported by the PEP makes a richer set of information 
   available to the PDP for decision-making. This report accounting 
   information can influence future decisions made by the PDP and the 
   resulting policy installed by the PDP at the PEP. For example, A PDP 
   determining policy for a SIP signaled multimedia session may need to 
   base the decision in part on usage information related to previously 
   installed QoS policy decisions. Further, the PDP may coordinate this 
   usage information with other external systems to determine the future 
   policy such as the case with the PDP coordinating multimedia session 
   QoS and clearinghouse authorizations [SIP-AAA-QOS]   
        
   The scope of this document is to describe the policy class framework 
   for policy usage monitored and reported by the PEP and collected at 
   the PDP. The charging and billing models as well as other accounting 
   events detectable by the PDP are beyond the scope of this framework.    
    
    
2 General Concepts  
     
2.1 Overview  
   There are two aspects to defining policies for an accounting type 
   report “ the  selection aspect and the  policy usage aspect. The 
   usage policy and selection policy are associated with one another. 
   The usage criteria policy class defines what metrics are monitored, 
   recorded and reported by the PEP. The selection criteria policy class 
   specifies the conditions for the monitoring and recording of the 
   associated usage policy. For example, a usage policy may be defined 
   to provide counts of packets received. The selection criteria policy 
   may identify the filter on which to base the packet counts. A third 
   policy may be used to associate, or link, the selection and usage 
   policies. The linking is performed by the accounting type report 
   linkage policy.    
    
2.2 Normal Operation   
        
   The PDP specifies the minimum accounting interval in the Accounting 
   Timer object that is included in the Client Accept message during 
   connection establishment. This specifies the maximum frequency with 
   which the PEP issues unsolicited accounting type reports. The PEP 
   notifies the PDP of  the selection criteria policy classes and usage 
   policy classes it supports during the initial request for 
   configuration data using the frwkPRCSupportTable entries[FR-PIB].  
         
   The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a 
   DECISION that installs policies. The PDP may also specify maximum 
   reporting intervals associated with each of the policies. The PEP 
   monitors and records the usage per the selection criteria defined by 
   the PDP. Periodically the PEP reports the usage with an accounting 
   type REPORT.

   The PDP is the collection point for the usage information monitored 
   and reported by the PEP clients within the administrative domain. The 
   PDP may also collect other accounting event information that is 
   outside the scope of this document.    
    
2.3 Failover   
        
   In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the PEP 
   continues to track usage information as long as it continues to 
   operate with the installed policy. When the locally installed policy 
   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.  
        
   Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy, 
   the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the 
   accounting type report messages. The PDP does this deterministically. 
   It issues an unsolicited decision containing the 
   frwkAtRptResumeIndicator set to resume reporting. The PDP is aware of 
   the request state Handle(s) and the supported PRCs either through the 
   state synchronization mechanism or because the PDP considers itself 
   synchronized with the PEP upon reconnection.   
 
2.4 Context  
    
   The monitoring and recording of usage policies is subject to context 
   switches in a manner similar to enforcement policy. The usage policy 
   is monitored, recorded and reported while the associated PIB instance 
   is active. The PEP should retain existing accounting data during 
   inactive contexts and resume it's monitoring and reporting when the 
   PIB instance becomes active again.   
      
2.5 Delete Request States  
    
   The PEP may send any outstanding accounting data monitored during the 
   interval to the PDP via an unsolicited report immediately prior to 
   issuing a Delete Request State if the time interval since the last 
   report is not less than the interval defined by the Accounting Timer.  
   This is also the case when the PDP initiates the Delete Request State 
   with a decision request delete state. In this case where a PDP 
   initiates a Decision Request State Remove, the PEP acknowledges with 
   the Report, but the actual Delete Request State may be delayed until 
   the next reporting interval has completed.   
    
2.6 Periodic nature of report accounting    
               
   The PDP informs the PEP of the minimal accounting interval it 
   supports in the Accounting Timer object during client connection 
   establishment. The PDP may specify accounting intervals in the 
   specific accounting policies per the PEP's indicated capabilities. 
   The PDP may also halt reporting for a request state by issuing an 
   unsolicited decision with the frwkAtRptResumeIndicator set to halt 
   reporting. Any usage information associated with that request state

   at the PEP since the last accounting interval is discarded by the 
   PEP. 
             
   Generally the accounting policy is periodic in nature and the 
   reporting is unsolicited. The unsolicited reports are supplied within 
   the interval decided by the PDP. Note that periodic unsolicited 
   reports (as dictated by timer intervals) use a deterministic amount 
   of network resources.    
        
   There may be instances where the nature of the accounting policy for 
   a given client type or accounting PIB module is such that it is 
   useful for the PDP to control when it receives the feedback. The PDP 
   may therefore have the capability to solicit the accounting report 
   for a request state.    
    
3 Definition of Accounting Type Report Policy   
  
   There are three basic types of policy used to define what the PEP is 
   to monitor, record and report. These are the selection criteria 
   policy, the usage policy and the accounting type report linkage 
   policy.  
         
   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP. It defines the 
   conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy. 
   Generally, the selection criterion is an existing PRC such as the 
   frwkIPFilterTable. This PRC is useful for specifying conditions on 
   which to base usage - i.e. count the number of packets received for 
   this filter. The filter (source address, destination address, etc.) 
   in this case defines the conditions. In the case of the accounting 
   framework PIB, the frwkIPFilterTable is the only PRC used to base 
   selection on.   
        
   The usage policy defines what attributes are monitored and recorded 
   by the PEP. These policies have an ACCESS clause of Report. 
   Generally, the usage policies specify counts related to a specific 
   action such as a packet being dropped. The accounting framework PIB 
   defines one usage policy class, frwkAtRptFilterStats. It counts 
   packets and bytes as well as records the timestamp when the last 
   packet was received. Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting basic 
   statistics, or they may be specific to a particular usage. The PDP 
   decides which PRC(s) best suit(s) its requirements. The PEP may 
   support only one usage PRC, in which case all statistics are gathered 
   using instances of that PRC. Alternatively, the PEP may support 
   multiple usage PRCs. The PDP then decides which PRC to associate with 
   a particular selection criterion.  
     
   The accounting type report linkage permits the same selection 
   criteria instance to be re-used for various usage policies. For 
   example, the same IP Filter selection criteria could be the basis of 
   different usage policies such as packet count, drop count, and remark 
   count. The accounting type report linkage references the selection 
   criteria instance as well as defines the policy class of the usage 
   PRC. As noted above, the selection criteria policy may be used for

   enforcement policies as well as usage policies. This is the case with 
   the frwkIPFilterTable.

                               Figure 1  
     
   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between a selection criteria, 
   linkage and usage policies.   
        
   The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage policy 
   when installing the selection criteria and accounting type report 
   linkage policies. The usage policy is enabled on the PEP by the 
   installation of an   accounting type report linkage and the PEP 
   designates the instance identifier. The usage policy class always 
   contains an attribute of type Prid. This attribute contains the value 
   of the accounting type report linkage PRID [COPS-PR] installed by the 
   PDP that is associated with the usage policy. Note that the Prid type 
   is a textual convention for an object identifier that is the PRC of 
   the table used for the selection criteria and where the last sub-
   identifier is an instance ID of the accounting type report linkage.   
      
          
4 Summary of the Accounting Framework Policy Information Base  
     
4.1 SPPI ACCESS clause report-only    
           
   The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the 
   definitions specified by [SPPI.] This structure specifies well-
   defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common, 
   virtual repository [FR-PIB.] The additional PIB-ACCESS clause 
   attribute of "report-only" denotes the usage policy class reported by 
   the PEP.  
    
4.2 Textual Conventions Counts  
     
   The usage policy attributes are often defined in the terms of counts. 
   This type is a non-negative value that is incremented. This value is 
   to "stick" at the maximum value if the maximum value is reached 
   before the reporting interval. It is reset to the value zero after 
   the usage is reported to the PDP and continues the incremental   
   operation. A textual convention defining the counts is defined in the 
   Accounting Framework PIB.  
     
4.3 Accounting Type Report Group and PRCs

   It is useful to define reporting intervals and restart 
   characteristics as well as the common usage and selection criteria 
   polices. These policy classes are common to account type reporting 
   for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT-CATEGORIES. The 
   policy classes belong to a new group, Accounting Type Report Group. 
   The policy classes in the Accounting Type Report Group are:  
        
      1) Accounting Type Report Device Intervals Table   
      2) Accounting Type Report Linkage Table  
      3) Accounting Type Filter Statistics Usage Table  
     
    
4.3.1 The Accounting Type Report Resume Table  
        
   This table contains one row. It indicates that the PDP, to which a 
   PEP having cached usage policy has reconnected, is ready to receive 
   the accounting type report messages from the PEP.  
     
4.3.2 The Accounting Type Report Linkage Table  
     
   This table links the selection criteria instance with the usage 
   instance. It specifies the PRID of the selection criteria and the PRC 
   of the usage instance. This table permits the reuse of a selection 
   criteria instance for multiple usage policies.   
     
   The linkage table also permits the definition of a maximum reporting 
   interval to use when issuing the accounting type reports for the 
   usage instance. This interval is defined in units of the Accounting 
   Timer Interval specified in the client accept message.  
     
4.3.3 The Filter Usage Table  
     
   This table describes the packet counts, byte counts, last timestamp 
   when a packet was received and the PRID of the associated Accounting   
   Type Report Linkage instance. The count and timestamp information is 
   monitored and recorded by the PEP and supplied to the PDP with the 
   accounting type report message within the maximum interval specified.

6 Security Considerations  
        
     The accounting information is sensitive and requires that 
     authorized messaging occur between the PEP and the PDP. This 
     protection can be accomplished with IPSEC between the PEP and the 
     PDP or using the security mechanisms described in the base COPS 
     protocol.
