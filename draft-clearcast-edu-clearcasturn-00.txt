1.  Introduction

   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for Clearcast Identifiers.

   Clearcast identifiers are centrally registered, globally unique 
   identifiers for video advertising works and their variants.
   A unique set of metadata parameters describing the associated 
   work is bound to the Clearcast identifier at the time of 
   registration.

   Clearcast identifiers are a file identifier name (Clock ID) 
   allocated by Clearcast for advertising standards.  

   The following are examples of Clearcast Identifiers for both 
   short and long form clock IDs in their canonical 
   representation:

   QQQ/AAAA123/030 (short form)	
   QQQ/AAAA12/1800 (long form)		

   The canonical URN representation of the short Clearcast 
   Identifier is:

   urn:clearcast:QQQ_AAAA123_030

   Note that "_" is used as separator within the Clearcast 
   Identifier since "/" is a URN reserved character.

   [CLEARCAST-CLOCK] and [CLEARCAST-CLEARANCE] will provide 
   additional background information for Clock ID.


2.  Completed URN Namespace Definition Template


   Declaration of syntactic structure:

   A Clearcast Identifier is a special kind of ID consisting of 
   four components:

   Agency Code
   Product, client or Agency
   Internal Agency Number
   Duration

   URN-Clearcast = "urn:clearcast:" 
   Clearcast-NSS = CLOCK ID
   Clearcast-AGENCY CODE = QQQ
   Clearcast-PRODUCT, CLIENT OR AGENCY = AAAA
   Clearcast-DURATION = 030 OR 1800
   Clearcast-CHARS = DIGIT*3/ALPHA*4DIGIT*3/DIGIT*3
   OR
   Clearcast-CHARS = DIGIT*3/ALPHA*4DIGIT*2/DIGIT*4



   Clearcast operates a web service that requires authentication
   and allows the Clearcast Identifier associated to be
   resolved by issuing an HTTP GET request to the following URI
   (see[RFC7231]):

   EXAMPLE: "http://id.Clearcast.co.uk/"


   If the Clearcast Identifier exists, then an XML Schema instance 
   document (see [XMLSchema]) containing metadata associated with 
   the Clearcast Identifier is returned; otherwise, the HTTP status 
   code "404 Not Found" is returned.

   EXAMPLE: "http://id.Clearcast.co.uk/QQQ_AAAA123_030"


   NOTE: At the time of this writing, this service of the ISO 26324 
   Registration Authority is not available over TLS, and hence the 
   confidentiality of queries is not protected.

   Clearcast operates additional services specifically tailored to 
   Clearcast users (see [Clearcast Services]).  
   These services include additional features
   e.g., Copy clearance, subtitling and flash testing.



   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   Lexical equivalence of clearcast-URN is defined by 
   case-insensitive string match.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

   As specified above, the syntax of Clearcast-URN is a subset of the 
   URN syntax specified in [RFC8141].

   Validation mechanism:

   The validity of a clearcast-NSS can only be guaranteed by completing 
   the resolution process.

   Scope:

   Clearcast Identifiers are registered using Copy Central, globally 
   unique identifiers for use with advertising worldwide.



3.  Namespace Considerations

   Clearcast Identifiers are intended for use in Internet applications, 
   where URNs are routinely used to identify television advertising 
   content.  There is no direct mapping from Clearcast Identifiers to 
   existing URN namespaces.


4.  Community Considerations

   The primary registrants of Clearcast Identifiers are Advertising 
   Agencies, Brands, Media Agencies, Post Production and Production 
   companies, metadata aggregators and media companies.
   
   Clearcast Identifiers can be used by anyone to unambiguously 
   identify an advertising asset and retrieve underlying metadata 
   or connect directly to an API.  The primary benefits of their use 
   are for the Advertising Industry to identify information, metadata 
   and connect with API?s. This can be in the form of TV, Online, and 
   other forms of advertising distribution chains and sources.
  

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the Formal URN Namespace 'clearcast' in the 
   "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry, using the 
   registration template in Section 2 of this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the syntax of the Clearcast-URN namespace 
   which is implemented via an authenticated API and makes no security 
   representations. Furthermore, the details of assignment and 
   resolution processes are defined external to this document by 
   Clearcast and thus are outside the scope of this document.  
   Note, however, that once authenticated, failure to conform to the 
   criteria for accessing restricted resources can result in gaining 
   unauthorized access to these resources.
