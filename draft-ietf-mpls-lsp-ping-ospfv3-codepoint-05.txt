                   OSPFv3 CodePoint for MPLS LSP Ping
              draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-ospfv3-codepoint-05

Abstract

   IANA has created "Protocol in the Segment ID Sub-TLV" and "Protocol
   in the Label Stack Sub-TLV of the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV"
   registries under the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry.  RFC8287 defines the
   code points for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate
   System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocols.

   This document specifies the code point to be used in the Segment ID
   sub-TLV and Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV when the Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) is OSPFv3.  This document also updates RFC8287 by
   clarifying that the existing "OSPF" code point is to be used only to
   indicate OSPFv2, and by defining the behavior when the Segment ID
   sub-TLV indicates the use of IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   IANA has created the "Protocol in the Segment IS Sub-TLV" registry
   and "Protocol in the Label Stack Sub-TLV of the Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV" registries under the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry
   [IANA-MPLS-LSP-PING].  [RFC8287] defines the code points for OSPF and
   IS-IS.

   "OSPF for IPv6" [RFC5340] describes OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) to
   support IPv6.  "Support of Address Families in OSPFv3" [RFC5838]
   describes the mechanism to support multiple address families (AFs) in
   OSPFv3.  Accordingly, OSPFv3 may be used to advertise IPv6 and IPv4
   prefixes.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 Code Point for MPLS LSP Ping    September 2021


   This document specifies the code point to be used in the Segment ID
   sub-TLV (Type 34, 35 and 36) and in the Downstream Detailed Mapping
   (DDMAP) TLV when the IGP is OSPFv3.

   This document also updates "Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping/Traceroute
   for Segment Routing (SR) IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment
   Identifiers (SIDs) with MPLS Data Planes" [RFC8287] by clarifying
   that the existing "OSPF" code point is to be used only to indicate
   OSPFv2, and by defining the behavior when the Segment ID sub-TLV
   indicates the use of IPv6.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in "Segment Routing
   Architecture" [RFC8402], "Detecting Multiprotocol Label Switched
   (MPLS) Data-Plane Failures" [RFC8029], [RFC8287] and so the readers
   are expected to be familiar with the same.

3.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  OSPFv3 protocol in Segment ID sub-TLVs

   When the protocol field of the Segment ID sub-TLV of Type 34 (IPv4
   IGP-Prefix Segment ID), Type 35 (IPv6 IGP-Prefix Segment ID) and Type
   36 (IGP-Adjacency Segment ID) is set to 3, the responder MUST perform
   the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) validation using OSPFv3 as the
   IGP.

   The initiator MUST NOT set the protocol field of the Segment ID sub-
   TLV Type 35 as OSPF (value 1) as OSPFv2 is not compatible with the
   use of IPv6 addresses indicated by this sub-TLV.

   When the protocol field in the received Segment ID sub-TLV Type 35 is
   OSPF (value 1), the responder MAY treat the protocol value as "Any
   IGP Protocol" (value 0) according to step 4a of Section 7.4 of
   [RFC8287].  This allows the responder to support legacy
   implementations that use value 1 to indicate OSPFv3.

5.  OSPFv3 protocol in Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV

   The protocol field of the Downstream Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV in
   an echo reply is set to 7 when OSPFv3 is used to distribute the label
   carried in the Downstream Label field.

6.  Update to RFC8287 - OSPFv2 Protocol in Segment ID and DDMAP sub-TLVs

   Section 5 of [RFC8287] defines the code point for OSPF to be used in
   the Protocol field of the Segment ID sub-TLV.  Section 6 of [RFC8287]
   defines the code point for OSPF to be used in the Protocol field of
   the DDMAP TLV.

   This document updates [RFC8287], by specifying that the "OSPF" code
   points SHOULD be used only for OSPFv2.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Protocol in the Segment ID sub-TLV

   IANA is requested to assign a new code point from the "Protocol in
   the Segment ID sub-TLV" registry under the "Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters"
   registry as follows:

     Value        Meaning     Reference
   ----------     -------    ------------
     3          OSPFv3     This document

   IANA is also requested to add a note for the existing entry for code
   point 1 (OSPF) to read: - "To be used for OSPFv2 only".

7.2.  Protocol in Label Stack sub-TLV of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV

   IANA is requested to assign a new code point for OSPFv3 from
   "Protocol in Label Stack Sub-TLV of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV"
   registry under the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry as follows:

     Value        Meaning      Reference
   ----------    ---------    ------------
     7         OSPFv3       This document

   IANA is also requested to add a note for the existing codepoint 5
   (OSPF) to read - "To be used for OSPFv2 only".

8.  Security Considerations

   This document updates [RFC8287] and does not introduce any additional
   security considerations.  See [RFC8029] to see generic security
   considerations about the MPLS LSP Ping.
