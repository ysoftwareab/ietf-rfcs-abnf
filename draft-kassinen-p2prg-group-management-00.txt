   structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks.  Group management
   enables efficient and secure interaction between the group members
   (peers), by controlling the scope of propagation for the group-
   specific P2P messaging and other communications.  The mechanism for
   group management, introduced in this document, is based on a
   multiple-overlay scheme.  Each group is a separate overlay network
   with its own address space, resources, and message routing
   information.  A common overlay is used for sharing information about
   the group overlays (sub-overlays).

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Emerging popularity of social networking services, such as Facebook
   [FACEBOOK], Google Groups [GOOGLEGRP], or Yahoo Groups[YAHOOGRP],
   emphasizes the importance of group management.  This is especially
   the case with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks that are natural platforms
   for interpersonal communications.  Content and information sharing
   within and between communities can be seen as the major driving force
   behind P2P networks.  Users usually have certain interests when they
   join the network.  Thus, they inherently tend to create interest
   groups among each other, called communities.  The users of
   traditional P2P applications, such as content sharing, ip telephony,
   or video/audio conferencing, are increasingly getting organized as
   peer groups.

   Main motivation for users and services to form groups is to control
   their scope of communications for privacy reasons.  Peer group
   members usually trust the members of the group to some extent.
   Groups can also be used for security reasons, as the access to the
   group and thus group-specific resources and communication is usually
   granted only to the members of the group.  Even though group
   management is generally considered as one of the basic
   functionalities of P2P services, standardization initiatives, such as
   IETF's P2PSIP working group [P2PSIP], have not yet paid much
   attention on it.

   Group management has for long been utilized in different forms in
   different P2P systems.  The most common approach is to manage groups
   on application layer, i.e. using a separate protocol above P2P layer
   for group management.  However, application-specific group management
   is not optimal in the situations where group members want to use
   multiple applications within the same group.  Perhaps the best known
   P2P-layer group management mechanism is the one used in JXTA [JXTA].
   In JXTA, each peer is a member of a global peer group, called
   "NetPeerGroup", and optionally one or more other peer groups.  JXTA,
   however, does not specify in detail how to create or manage a group.
   With structured P2P systems, the most natural way for group
   management (in addition to application layer solutions) is to use
   separate overlays for each group.  Hierarchical overlay structures,
   such as [HIERAS] and [HierarchP2P], have been proposed as a measure
   to improve routing efficiency of structured P2P networks.  However,
   the fundamental model of hierarchical overlays is also useful for
   group management purposes.

   This document describes a mechanism for managing groups of entities
   in structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks.  In the proposed
   group management mechanism, each group forms a separate P2P overlay
   network that is specific to the group.  Every member of the group

   participates in the routing activities and other routines of the
   overlay as defined by the P2P protocol and the DHT algorithm.  A peer
   can be a member in more than one group.

   A group overlay isolates the group-specific activities from the other
   P2P overlay based activities of the peers.  This multi-overlay
   approach has the following advantages, compared to using a single
   large overlay that would contain the activities of all groups and
   would utilize a separate mechanism for group management.

      - Routing efficiency: Small overlays provide more efficient
      routing, compared to a single large overlay.  Hop count is lower
      in small overlays.
      - Fairer load distribution: Only the member nodes are responsible
      for maintaining the specific group.
      - Simplicity of operation: All group-related activities are
      inherently contained in group-specific overlays.
      - Security: A base for security is provided with independent
      overlays that separate the communications of different groups from
      each other.  There is no need to separately monitor the access
      rights to group-specific resources (except with the security
      measures of the selected P2P protocol that, of course, apply).
      - Transparency: The group management system supports an arbitrary
      combination of a DHT-algorithm and a DHT-based P2P overlay
      protocol.  Furthermore, it is possible to use different DHT-
      algorithms within different group overlays thanks to the
      independent nature of the overlays.

   All peers are members of the `main overlay'.  The introduced
   mechanism uses the main overlay for distributing information about
   the existing groups and group memberships.  Every peer has access to
   the publicly available information on groups, since the peers can
   perform searches in the main overlay.

   In the following sections, certain P2P protocol related terms and
   action examples are used.  The terms or exact details or actions
   might be slightly different depending on the actual P2P protocol that
   is used in an implementation of the group management mechanism.  This
   document attempts to use terms and P2P actions that are common to
   most DHT-based P2P protocols.

   As much as possible, the solution utilizes the existing DHT-based
   data storing (publish) and finding (lookup) mechanisms of a P2P
   protocol.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Overlay: A structured P2P network that is realized on top of a lower-
   level network (in practice an IP-supporting network).

   Peer: As in P2PSIP terminology: A node that participates in the
   maintenance of an overlay.

   Client: As in P2PSIP terminology: A node that does not participate to
   the maintenance of an overlay, and uses the services provided by the
   peers.

   Group: Any group of nodes within a structured P2P network; their
   intercommunication is realized within a group overlay.

   Group ID: A human-readable or binary identifier that identifies a
   group.  The ID is used as a search key in the DHT system for finding
   information about the group overlay.

   Group Description: A human-readable description of a group, bound to
   a group ID.

   Group Overlay: An overlay that contains the member peers of a group.
   Group activities take place in a group overlay.

   Main Overlay: A large overlay where all the peers of a certain
   network are members.  It is used for distributing information about
   group overlays and group memberships.

   Community: A sub-type of groups; a group that consists of human
   users.  The terminal device of a human member acts as a peer in the
   group overlay.


3.  Overview of the Architecture

   The core idea behind the presented group management architecture is
   to use one DHT overlay network per community, resulting in multiple
   small overlays that are subsets of the main overlay.  This results in
   an overlay hierarchy where each DHT overlay is a self-contained,
   independent network as illustrated in Figure 1.  The group
   information, containing at least the contact information of the
   group's bootstrap peer and the group description, SHOULD be published
   in the main overlay.  If the users, however, wish to have private

   groups that are not publicly advertised, the group information can
   remain unpublished.  There can be both public and private groups in
   existence at the same time in a network.

   The relationship of overlays is illustrated in the example in Figure
   1.  All peers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are members of the main overlay.  Peers
   1 and 2 are members in group A (and thus in group overlay A).  Peers
   2 and 4 are members in group B. Peer 3 is not a member in any group.

4.  Overview of the Operations

4.1.  Creation of Groups

   A new group is created by establishing a new overlay network (the
   group overlay), where the group activities will take place.  Such
   creation usually implies that a new instance of the P2P protocol
   stack is created so that its routing tables, resource tables, etc.
   are specific to the created group.  Before creating a new group, the
   creator checks with a resource lookup request from the main overlay
   that no other group already exists with the same ID.

   In the basic case, the creator peer will act as the bootstrap node
   for the group.  This means that the node will respond to the joining
   nodes' initial requests when they try to become members of the group.



Kassinen, et al.        Expires January 11, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2009


   The creator peer does not need to be the bootstrap peer; the role can
   be assumed by any other peer of the group.

   The creator peer publishes a DHT key-value pair of <group ID, group
   info> to the main overlay.  Group info contains the bootstrap node's
   ID and its contact information i.e. the IP address and port.  In
   addition, the creator peer publishes the members list, which contains
   only the first member, itself, at this point.  The list is published
   under a DHT key that contains an equivalent of the phrase "members
   of" along with the group ID; thus it is possible for others to search
   for the members of a specified group.  Finally, the creator peer
   publishes a key-value pair where the key is a wildcard that enables
   listing all groups and the value is the group ID. `Wildcard' here
   means that the same key is used for all groups created by any peer;
   thus, searching for the key will yield a list of resources, each
   related to a specific group.  The action sequence of creating a
   public group is illustrated in Figure 2.

   If a node that cannot be responsible for overlay management (for
   example, a low-capability P2PSIP client) wants to create a group, it
   needs to ask another node (with more capabilities or public IP
   address) to become the creator of the group.  This more capable node
   will, at least temporarily, take the responsibility of maintaining
   the group information in the main overlay.  A node can also be a
   client in the main overlay and a peer in a group overlay, or vice
   versa.

   Groups can be public or private.  Private groups are not published to
   the main overlay.  The same logic applies to memberships.  Even if a
   group is public, the memberships might be private, thus the members
   list is not published in that case.

4.2.  Maintenance of Groups

   Maintenance of a group refers to the publishing of group existence
   and group membership information in the main overlay.  In addition,
   group maintenance also comprises the overlay maintenance messaging
   (e.g. keepalive signals between neighbor nodes) as required by the
   used P2P protocol.  Publishing is typically done repeatedly, if the
   overlay's P2P protocol requires resource objects to be refreshed
   periodically.

   In every group there MUST be at least one peer that is capable of
   maintaining the group overlay's routing and resource-management
   functionalities.  If all peers leave the group overlay so that only
   clients remain, at least one of the clients SHOULD become a peer, or
   alternatively, peer services MAY be requested from an external peer

   (this functionality is not defined in this version of this draft).
   If neither of the mentioned conditions is not fulfilled, the group
   ceases to exist.

   If the advertiser peer leaves the group overlay and this group is a
   public group, another peer SHOULD assume the role of advertiser peer;
   otherwise, the refreshing of the public group info in the main
   overlay ceases.

4.3.  Joining and Leaving from Groups

   Joining is typically done via the bootstrap node of the group.  This
   node is initially the creator peer.  Joining can occur through any
   member peer of the group (if the underlying P2P protocol allows
   this), but usually the joining peer knows specifically about the
   bootstrap peer that is advertised in the main overlay.  In the case
   of public groups, information about the existing nodes (members) in
   the group is found in the main overlay.  In the case of private
   groups, the information can be conveyed in some other way, for
   example, by an e-mail or a paper note that instructs the joiner to
   contact a specific existing overlay-node.  The action sequence of
   joining a public group is shown in Figure 3.

   Leaving a group is done by the departing from the corresponding group
   overlay, using the leave function of the underlying P2P protocol.  A
   leaving node MUST also stop refreshing its group membership
   publication in the main overlay, and SHOULD, if possible, remove the
   information's existing version from the main overlay.  If the leaving
   node participated as a peer in the group overlay, it also naturally
   retires from the maintenance functionalities, which happens when it
   leaves the overlay.

                          Joining a public group.

                                 Figure 3

   Pointers [I-D.hardie-p2psip-p2p-pointers] in P2P networks have been
   proposed as a mechanism for referring to a specific overlay network
   or resource in a way such that these pointers can be used in
   communication outside the P2P network.  In group management, pointers
   can be used for referring to a specific group.  For example, a
   pointer-based "link" containing an overlay pointer could be used when
   inviting new members to a group overlay.  Opening the "link" then
   results in the instantiation of the DHT-utilizing protocol stack
   (and/or other similar required actions) and performing the overlay
   joining operation of the used P2P protocol.

4.4.  Removal of Groups

   Removing a group is done by shutting down the group overlay so that
   no nodes remain there anymore.  Group and membership information
   SHOULD be actively removed from the main overlay.  This means



Kassinen, et al.        Expires January 11, 2010               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2009


   removing all of the following: 1) the resource (key-value pair) whose
   key is the group ID in the main overlay; 2) the group from the list
   contained in the resource whose key is the groups wildcard; and 3)
   the membership resources whose key is "members of <group ID>".

   The group overlay can also cease to exist even without an explicit
   removal of the group.  If no peers remain in the overlay, i.e. only
   clients remain and no nodes willing to act as new peers are found,
   the group disappears.

4.5.  Binding of Groups to an "Alias" ID

   It is possible to establish aliases for existing groups with a `bind'
   action.  Binding is done by publishing to the main overlay a key-
   value pair, where the key is the new group ID (bind ID, i.e. an alias
   of the existing overlay) and the value contains the original overlay
   ID along with a tag which indicates that the key-value pair is a
   result of binding.  This is similar to the key-value pair published
   during group creation, but instead of group info, the value only
   contains the above-mentioned information.  Thus, when a peer joins to
   a group by identifying the group with a bind-ID, the peer learns the
   original (actual) ID of the group overlay and must initiate another
   Lookup request to find the group info of the group overlay.

   Binding is useful when, for example, creating location-based
   communities where the ID of a location-specific Bluetooth beacon
   device or an RFID label is used for triggering joining to an existing
   group overlay; the bind ID in this case would be the Bluetooth ID or
   the ID of the RFID label.


5.  Data Formats

   In order to enable the peers to interpret the group-related pieces of
   information correctly, the related DHT-stored values (in the key-
   value pairs that are mentioned in the various group operations in
   this document) have some syntax requirements that are specified in
   this section.

   XML is used for encoding the group-related information in the
   resource values.  All these XML documents are preceded by the header
   "GROUP-MANAGEMENT:" (outside of the XML document), which enables a
   peer to recognize group-management related resources from other kinds
   of resources, simply by checking if the beginning of the resource
   value matches "GROUP-MANAGEMENT:".  This also eliminates the need for
   trying XML parsing in the case of non-group-related resources.  In
   the future, a dedicated MIME type might be registered, to be used
   instead of the "GROUP-MANAGEMENT:" header that currently serves as a

   type identifier.

   Inside all these XML documents, the root element is called
   "group_management".  The root element has an attribute called "type"
   that indicates, how to interpret the inner elements.  In group info
   (published during group creation), the attribute value is
   "group_info".  In group binding, the attribute value is
   "group_id_redirect".  This way, when joining a group, the joining
   peer can determine if the found XML resource contains directly the
   contact information of a group (the group ID was used as the lookup
   key), or does it contain the actual ID of a bound group, which of
   course requires a second lookup request in order to find the group
   info of the group in question (the bind ID was used as the lookup
   key).

   The following XML document is an example of a published group info.



   GROUP-MANAGEMENT:
   <group_management type="group-info">
     <bootstrap-address>12.34.56.78</bootstrap-address>
     <bootstrap-port>5080</bootstrap-port>
     <description>The most jolly group!</description>
   </group_management>


   The following XML document is an example of a published binding.
   When a lookup is performed with the bind ID as the search key, this
   resource value is found.  The value of the attribute "encoding" can
   be either "as-is", indicating that the contained group ID (possibly
   intended as human-readable) can be used as such for the lookup of
   actual group info, or "hex", indicating that the contained group ID
   (possibly binary) is encoded in hexadecimal characters, two hex
   characters per byte.



   GROUP-MANAGEMENT:
   <group_management type="group-id-redirect">
     <actual-group-id encoding="hex">0276EC1F</actual-group-id>
   </group_management>


   The case of joining to a group with an ID that is a result of a
   binding is not shown in the figures of this document.  Figure 3 only
   showed the case, where the group info is directly found.

   Thanks to the overlay-per-group scheme, the need for special data
   formats is minimal, since the group-internal activities (resource
   publishing for communications, collaboration, etc.) are free from
   syntax requirements from the viewpoint of group management.  This
   means that those resources do not need any special tagging to
   indicate "this data belongs to the group Foo", because all group-
   specific acitivity is automatically contained in the group overlay
   and is not risked to being confused with other overlays' activities.


6.  Performance Considerations

   Optimization techniques for facilitating a node's concurrent
   membership in multiple overlays can be used.  For example, to
   decrease memory consumption, routing information about remote nodes
   can be shared between the locally stored data structures in such a
   way that maintaining duplicate pieces of information about remote
   nodes is avoided.  However, this kind of techniques are optional.  A
   straightforward implementation can simply utilize several
   concurrently running P2P protocol stacks that are not coordinated
   among each other.  In a simple case where a peer is a member in the
   main overlay and one group overlay, such an implementation would run
   two protocol stack instances concurrently.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA at this time.


9.  Security Considerations

   The introduced group management mechanism effectively encapsulates
   group-specific traffic inside a group overlay, and thus helps to
   improve the security and privacy.  However, the problem of
   bootstrapping, i.e. how to ensure that only legitimate members are
   able to join a particular group, remains.  The future work includes
   developing mechanisms for secure group access management.
