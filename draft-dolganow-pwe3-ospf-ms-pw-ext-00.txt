Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs      December 2006 
    

   Multi-segment pseudo wires have been defined to enable emulated layer 
   1 and layer 2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet 
   switched network over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control 
   protocol adjacencies. MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks 
   over both a single AS, or between multiple ASs. However, there is a 
   particular need to be able to automatically route MS-PWs through 
   access and metro PSNs. These networks typically comprise a single AS. 

   This draft proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic 
   advertisement of summarized PW FECs, thus enabling the automatic 
   routing of MS-PWs across an OSPF domain.

1. Introduction 

   Multi-segment pseudo wires have been defined to enable emulated layer 
   2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet switched network 
   over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control protocol 
   adjacencies. MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks over both 
   a single AS, or between multiple ASs. Requirements for MS-PWs are 
   detailed in [8]. 

   A basic approach to MS-PWs, where the switching points are statically 
   placed, is described in [10]. This is extended in [11] to allow the 
   automatic placement of the MS-PWs. This draft uses FEC 129 with AII 
   type II to summarize the PW end points that are reachable through a 
   given PE, and to provide a layer 2 address for the S-PEs. MP-BGP is 
   used to distribute FECs. However, although MP-BGP may be used within 
   a single AS, the use of MP-BGP is primarily focused on scenarios 
   where each PWE3 domain is a separate AS, and S-PEs are used to switch 
   PWs between adjacent ASs. 

   A second important case is where MS-PWs are deployed in service 
   provider access and metro networks. Pseudo wires in these networks 
   typically span only a single IGP domain or AS. Furthermore, the nodes 
   contain a minimal routing implementation to cut operational 
   complexity. MP-BGP is not typically deployed on MTUs and full MP-BGP 
   functionality may not be required. However, there is also a 
   particular need to be able to automatically route MS-PWs through 
   these topologies. 

   These two cases demonstrate the need for a MS-PW routing protocol 
   for: 

      -  MP-BGP incapable domains. 

      -  Domains where only an incremental increase in routing 
        functionality is required over the simple statically placed MS-
        PWs.

   In these cases, it is possible to leverage the mechanisms of the PSN 
   IGP to distribute MS-PW routing information. 

   This draft proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic 
   advertisement of summarized PW layer 2 addresses within a single AS, 
   thus enabling the automatic routing of MS-PWs across an OSPF domain. 
   This information is then used by T-PEs and S-PEs to derive the MS-PW 
   routing tables. These are used to signal the next-hop S-PE or T-PE, 
   as described in [11].

                      Figure 1 MS-PW Routing Model 

   Figure 1Figure 1 illustrates the MS-PW routing model. ACs attached to 
   TPE2 are associated with the OSPF Router_ID or any locally assigned 
   routable address.  

   The proposed model assumes the existence of a signaling adjacency 
   between T-PE/S-PE, S-PE/S-PE and/or S-PE/T-PE. An example of a 
   signaling adjacency is a Targeted LDP session used by MS-PW signaling 
   [11]. A pair of routable IP addresses represents this signaling 
   adjacency. Each S-PE / T-PE is also assigned its own layer 2 address 
   in the form of an AII as described in [11]

Internet-Draft   OSPF Extensions for Dynamic MS-PWs      December 2006 
    

   When such an adjacency is to be used for the establishment of 
   intermediate PW segments, both ends can advertise the set of AIIs 
   reachable across this set of intermediate PW segments. This is done 
   using summarized Type 2 AIIs so that a separate advertisement is not 
   required to every AC reachable via that adjacency. AIIs may be 
   summarized using the aggregation rules for AII Type 2 described in 
   [6]. The corresponding advertisement is modeled a set of PE nodes, 
   interconnected with signaling adjacencies, and a set of AII's 
   associated with each node. 

   The resulting topology is a connected graph that identifies each S-PE 
   by an AII (which includes its IP address), an optional set of PW 
   links between PEs, and each T-PE by one or more AIIs containing an IP 
   address for the T-PE and a set of AC identifiers. Based on that 
   topology, each PE builds a routing information containing all 
   routable AIIs. When creating MS-PW, the PE looks up the AII and 
   determines the next hop PE for LDP signalling as described in [11]. 

   Figure 1Figure 1 depicts the simple model of one-to-one relations of 
   a T-PE to S-PE and S-PE to S-PE, and of a single S-PE to S-PE 
   segment. In the general case, multiple S-PE segments will exist, and 
   the relation between two S-PEs or/and T-PE and S-PEs will be one-to-
   many or many-to-one. Processing in these cases follows that of the 
   general case illustrated in Figure 1Figure 1. Selection of an S-PE 
   from a set of multiple available S-PEs is left for further revisions 
   of this draft.  

2. Applicability 

   The proposed OSPF protocol extensions are intended for domains where 
   MP-BGP is not used. In many cases, this will apply to routing MS-PWs 
   across a single AS, where the source T-PE (ST-PE), the Terminating T-
   PE (TT-PE) and all of the intermediate S-PEs reside in the same AS.  

   However, the above application does not preclude cases where OSPF is 
   used to route one portion of a MS-PW across a given AS where the ST-
   PE and the TT-PE reside in different ASs. Here, OSPF is used to 
   advertise the AIIs reachable through S-PEs corresponding to ASBRs. 
   This enables the ingress S-PEs and intermediate S-PEs in an AS to 
   route MS-PWs to the correct egress S-PE in the AS to reach a TT-PE in 
   another AS. This draft does not define how the egress S-PE learns 
   what AIIs are externally reachable through it, but this could be by 
   configuration, or by an exterior gateway protocol.

3. OSPF Extensions 

3.1. Attachment Circuit Addressing 

   As in [11], attachment circuit addressing is derived from AII type 2 
   [2], as shown in the following figure: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                         Global ID (contd.)                    | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                         Prefix                                | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                         AC ID                                 | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
                  Figure 1 Attachment Circuit Addressing 

   Implementations of this procedure MUST interpret the AII as described 
   in [11].  

3.2. S-PE Addressing 

   The T-PE may select a known specific path along a set of S-PEs for a 
   specific PW. This requires that each S-PE be uniquely addressable in 
   terms of pseudo wires. For this purpose at least one AII address of 
   the format similar to AII type 2 composed of the Global ID, and 
   Prefix part only MUST be assigned to each S-PE. 

   The prefix must be derived from the S-PE address associated to the 
   locally assigned routable address. 

3.3. OSPFv2 LSAs 

   This extension makes use of the opaque LSA. 

   One new LSA is defined: the PW Switching LSA This LSA describes the 
   S-PEs/T-PEs, and PSN tunnels between peer S-PEs or T-PEs. 

3.3.1. Pseudo Wire Switching LSA 

   OSPFv2 routers behaving as S-PEs or T-PEs MAY optionally advertise 
   the layer 2 addresses reachable through them. This advertisement MUST 
   be in an AS-scoped opaque LSA.

   The LSA MUST contain a TLV for the IP address of the advertising 
   router. For OSPF v2 routers, this is the Router Address TLV defined 
   in Section 2.4.1 of RFC 3630 [4]. For OSPF v3 routers, this is the 
   Router IPv6 Address TLV specified in Section 3 of draft-ietf-ospf-
   ospfv3-traffic-07.txt [5]. In each of these, the router address MUST 
   be set to the IP address of the advertising T-PE/S-PE. 

   This document defines two additional TLVs: : 

   Type TBD: AII 

   Type TBD: PW Adjacency 

3.5.1. AII TLV 

   If the LSA information is of type AII, then the value field contains 
   one or more AII Type 2 TLVs, as described above. 

3.5.2. PW Adjacency TLV 

   The PW Adjacency TLV is used to describe the presence of a PW 
   signaling adjacency between two S-PEs or T-PEs. The PW Adjacency TLV 
   contains the following sub TLVs: 

   o Advertising PE Layer 2 Address: 
      This is the AII Type 2 address of the local PE 

   o Remote PE Layer 2 Address: 
      This is the AII Type 2 address of the remote PE at the far end of 
      the PW signaling session 

   Extensions to the PW Adjacency TLV to support the advertisement of 
   traffic engineering information and other metrics are for further 
   study.

4. Procedures for Advertising PW Signaling Adjacencies 

   The signaling adjacencies that exist between S-PEs and T-PEs must be 
   advertised. However, the PWE3 topology over which PWs can be signaled 
   is a superset of the MS-PW topology, and it is assumed that the PWE3 
   topology coincides with the topology of PWE3 control protocol (i.e. 
   PW signaling) adjacencies. That is, not all PEs can be S-PEs, and not 
   all S-PEs can be assumed to be capable of dynamic PW routing. In 
   order to use a given signaling session to a peer S-PE/T-PE to signal 
   dynamically placed MS-PWs, S-PEs/T-PEs need to know which of the PW 
   adjacency TLVs received represent switching capable PEs along a path 
   to reach advertised AIIs.  

   The following procedure is used to establish this association. 

   T-PEs/S-PEs that are switching capable announce this using the PW 
   adjacency TLV in the PW switching LSA. The PW adjacency TLV contains 
   all of the configured adjacencies currently operationally up. A T-
   PE/S-PE must associate the originator of that LSA with the endpoint 
   of one of its own signaling sessions (either directly or through 
   another PW adjacency TLV in case of multi-hop switching) In a single 
   hop case, this may be achieved automatically by matching router IP 
   addresses in the LSA with signaling endpoints, or by configuration.   

 

5. LSA Processing Procedures 

   Nodes capable of pseudowire switching on either side of a signaling 
   session exchange PW switching LSAs with the AII and PW adjacency TLV. 
   Note that the PW adjacency TLV will only contain those adjacencies 
   that are currently configured and operationally up (i.e. targeted LDP 
   session is operationally UP ). These PW switching LSAs are processed 
   and flooded as described in Section 5.2. The signaling adjacency is 
   maintained using a signaling protocol specific mechanism e.g. LDP 
   hellos. Changes in the state of the adjacency should be advertised 
   using the updated PW adjacency TLV within the PW switching LSA. A 
   router should use a mechanism to reduce the number of advertisements 
   in case of bouncing signalling adjacency. Such a mechanism is out of 
   scope for this specification. 

   The application database includes thus a set of signaling sessions 
   (PW signaling adjacencies) that may be used for signaling dynamically 
   placed MS-PWs. AII TLV associates end-point information to the PW 
   adjacency (that are providing access to these end-points). AII TLVs 
   are flooded in the PW switching opaque LSA.

5.1. P Routers 

   OSPF routers that receive LSAs described in this document and that 
   are not S-PEs or T-PEs MUST flood them according to the rules of 
   OSPFv2 or OSPFv3, as applicable. 

5.2. PE Routers 

   S-PEs and T-PEs that are OSPF routers and that receive LSAs described 
   in this document MUST flood them according to the rules of OSPFv2 or 
   OSPFv3, as applicable. These LSAs are also installed in a PW link 
   state database. The link state database, which represents a connected 
   graph of S-PEs and T-PEs (as described above) MAY be used by S-PEs 
   and T-PEs to calculate a PW routing table. The PW routing table has 
   the structure described in Section 7 of [11], and is used to 
   determine the next signaling hop when a S-PE receives a PW setup 
   message as described in that draft. PW static routes may also be 
   provisioned, as described in [11]. 

   The algorithm used to calculate the PW routing table from the link 
   state database, and the application of routing constraints, is beyond 
   the scope of this draft. However, all T-PEs and S-PEs within the same 
   PWE3 domain SHOULD use the same algorithm. 

    

6. Deployment Considerations 

   Addition and Removal of ACs, S-PEs and T-PEs 

   The operational and deployment considerations for the addition and 
   removal of S-PEs, T-PEs and ACs will be described in a future version 
   of this draft. 

6.1. Impact on Existing P-Routers 

   P-routers supporting Opaque LSA processing procedures must exist 
   along the flooding path in the AS to ensure propagation of the 
   information required for dynamic pseudowire routing. Ideally, 
   multiple "Opaque LSA" flooding paths exist, so a failure of a router 
   along a path does isolate subset of a network. 

   Routers supporting Opaque LSA processing as described in [3], will 
   flood the LSAs as specified in [3]. The impact of this additional 
   flooding load may be constrained through appropriate levels of

   aggregation of AIIs. Section 6.2.  below describes other methods for 
   limiting the impact of any additional flooding. 

 

6.2. Congestion in the Underlying PSN Routing 

   This document describes the use of the underlying interior gateway 
   protocol in an IP network to advertise routing information for the 
   automatic placement of MS-PWs. Congestion may occur in the routing 
   plane of the PSN if a large amount of pseudowire LSAs are flooded. It 
   is therefore important to ensure that this does not degrade the 
   performance of the IGP for the underlying PSN.  

   Implementations may use a number of methods to avoid routing 
   congestion, including: 

   o Separate IGP instances for the underlying PSN and for the MS-PWs. 

   o Prioritization of PSN LSAs over PW Switching LSAs. 

   o Rate limiting PW Switching LSAs so that they do not consume 
      excessive bandwidth or route processor capacity. 

   o OSPF Refresh and Flooding reduction mechanisms as defined in [7]. 

    

7. Security Considerations 

   This section will be added in a future version. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests that the following allocations be made from 
   existing registries: 

   o The OSPFv2 opaque LSA type TBD for the PW switching opaque LSA. 

   o The OSPFv3 LSA type function code TBD for the PW switching LSA
