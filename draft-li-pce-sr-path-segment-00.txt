  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extension for
              Path Identification in Segment Routing (SR)
                    draft-li-pce-sr-path-segment-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
   functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.

   The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture
   describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets
   through an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm.  A
   Segment Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms,
   including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or
   a Path Computation Element (PCE).

   Path identification is needed for several use cases such as
   performance measurement in Segment Routing (SR) network.  This
   document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) to support requesting, replying, reporting and
   updating the path identifier between PCEP speakers.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication
   Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
   purpose of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as
   well as Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
   control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
   [RFC4657].  It includes mechanisms to effect LSP State
   Synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of control over
   LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path
   computations within and across PCEP sessions.  The model of operation
   where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in [RFC8281].

   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] specify the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller for static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as
   explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.

   Segment routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] leverages the
   source routing and tunneling paradigms.  SR supports steering packets
   into an explicit forwarding path according to the Segment Routing
   Policy ( SR Policy) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] at the
   ingress node.

   An SR path needs to be identified in some use cases such as
   performance measurement.  For identifying an SR path,
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment] introduces a new segment that is
   referred to as Path Segment.
   [I-D.li-idr-sr-policy-path-segment-distribution] defines extensions
   to BGP to distribute SR policies carrying Path segment identifier.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions to the Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] for SR networks, that
   allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate SR-TE paths, as well as
   a PCC to request, report or delegate SR paths.
   [I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] extend PCEP to support SR for
   IPv6 data plane.

Internet-Draft               Path ID in PCEP                   June 2018


   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] specifies the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions when a PCE-based controller
   is also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions on the
   routers (SR SID distribution in this case), in addition to computing
   the paths for packet flows in a segment routing network and telling
   the edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter
   the network.

   This document specifies a mechanism to carry the SR path
   identification information in PCEP messages [RFC5440] [RFC8231]
   [RFC8281].  The path ID can be a path segment in SR-MPLS
   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment], or a path ID in SRv6
   [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np], or other IDs that can
   identify the SR path.  This document also extends the PCECC-SR
   mechanism to inform the path ID to the egress PCC.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4655],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing], and
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

3.  Overview of Path ID Extensions in PCEP

   This document specifies a mechanism of encoding (and allocating) path
   ID (path segment in case of MPLS, path ID in case of IPv6, etc) in
   PCEP extensions.  For supporting path ID in PCEP, several TLVs and
   flags are defined.  The formats of the objects and TLVs are described
   in Section 4.  The procedures of path ID allocation are described in
   Section 5.

   There are various modes of operations, such as -

   o  The path ID can be allocated by Ingress PCC itself and informed to
      the PCE.  The PCE can then inform the egress PCC.

   o  The PCC can also request PCE to allocate the path ID, in this
      case, the PCE would allocate and inform the assigned path ID to
      the ingress/egress PCC using PCEP messages.

   o  For PCE can allocate a path ID on its own accord and inform the
      ingress/egress PCC , useful for PCE-initiated LSPs.

   The path ID information to the ingress PCC and PCE is exchanged via
   an extension to [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] and
   [I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6].  The path ID information to the
   egress PCC is informed via an extension to the PCECC-SR procedures
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

Internet-Draft               Path ID in PCEP                   June 2018


   For the PCE to allocate a path ID, the PCE MUST be aware of the path
   ID space from the PCCs.  This is done via mechanism as described in
   [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space].

   [Editor's note - There is currently no mechanism for the PCE to ask
   PCC to allocate path ID.  Further discussion is needed to check if
   that would be useful in any way.]

4.  Objects and TLVs

4.1.  The OPEN Object

4.1.1.  The SR PCE Capability sub-TLV

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] defined a new Path Setup Type (PST)
   and SR-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV for SR.  PCEP speakers use this sub-TLV
   to exchange information about their SR capability.  The TLV includes
   a Flags field and one bit (L-flag) was allocated in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].

   This document adds an additional flag for path ID allocation, as
   follows -

      P (Path Identification bit): A PCEP speaker sets this flag to 1 to
      indicate that it has the capability to encode SR path
      identification (path segment, as per
      [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment]).

4.1.2.  The SRv6 PCE Capability sub-TLV

   [I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] defined a new Path Setup Type
   (PST) and SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV for SRv6.  PCEP speakers use
   this sub-TLV to exchange information about their SRv6 capability.
   The TLV includes a Flags field and one bit (L-flag) was allocated in
   [I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6].

   This document adds an additional flag for path ID allocation, as
   follows -

      P (Path Identification bit): A PCEP speaker sets this flag to 1 to
      indicate that it has the capability to encode SRv6 path
      identification.

4.1.3.  PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV

   The PCECC Capability as per
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] MUST also be
   advertised on the egress PCEP session, along with the SR sub-TLVs.

   This is needed to ensure that the PCE can inform the egress PCC of
   the path ID via PCECC mechanism as described in this document.

4.2.  LSP Object

   The LSP Object is defined in Section 7.3 of [RFC8231].  This document
   adds the following flags to the LSP Object:

      P (Path Identification Allocation bit): If the bit is set to 1, it
      indicates that the path identifier needs to be allocated by the
      PCE for this LSP.  A PCC would set this bit to 1 to request for
      allocation of path identifier by the PCE in the PCReq or PCRpt
      message.  A PCE would also set this bit to 1 to indicate that the
      path identifier is allocated by PCE and encoded in the PCRep,
      PCUpd or PCInitiate message (the PATH-ID TLV MUST be present in
      LSP object).

4.2.1.  Path ID TLV

   The PATH-ID TLV is an optional TLV for use in the LSP Object for path
   ID allocation.  The type of this TLV is to be allocated by IANA.  The
   format is shown below.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                     Figure 1: The PATH-ID TLV Format

   The type (16-bit) of the TLV is TBA (to be allocated by IANA).  The
   length (16-bit) has a fixed value of 8 octets.  The value contains
   the following fields:

      IDT (The ID type - 8 bits): The IDT field specifies the type of
      the Path ID field, which carries a Path ID corresponding to the SR
      path.

      *  0: MPLS Path segment, which is an MPLS label as defined in
         [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment].  The PST type MUST be set
         to SR (MPLS).

Internet-Draft               Path ID in PCEP                   June 2018


      *  1: SRv6 Path ID, which is a 4-octet integer as defined in
         [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np].  The PST type MUST be
         set to SRv6.

      Flags (24 bits): Three flag is currently defined:

      *  L-Bit (Local/Global - 1 bit): If set, then the Path ID carried
         by the PATH-ID TLV has local significance.  If not set, then
         the Path ID carried by this TLV has global significance (i.e.
         Path ID is global within an SR domain).

      *  C-bit (PCC/PCE - 1 bit): If set, then the Path ID carried by
         the PATH-ID TLV has been allocated by the PCC.  If not set,
         then the Path ID carried by this TLV has been allocated by the
         PCE.

      *  E-bit (Egress/Ingress - 1 bit): If set, then the Path ID
         carried by the PATH-ID TLV has been allocated from the Egress
         Path ID space.  If not set, then the Path ID carried by this
         TLV has been allocated from the Ingress Path ID space.

      *  The unassigned bits MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored at
         receipt.

      Path ID: The path ID of an SR path.  The path ID type is indicated
      by the ID Type field.  It can be a path segment
      [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment] in MPLS label format.  Or it
      can be a 4 octets integer ID as defined in
      [I-D.li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np] or other IDs that can
      identify a path.

   Only one instance of each TLV is processed, if more than one TLV of
   each type is included, the first one is processed and others MUST be
   ignored.

   When the path ID allocation is enable, a PATH-ID TLV SHOULD be
   included in the LSP object.

   If the path ID is allocated by the ingress node, a PATH-ID TLV MUST
   be included in a LSP object (with C-bit set and E-bit is unset) in
   the PCEP message from PCC.  In this case the P flag in LSP object is
   set to 0.

   If the PCC request the path ID to be allocated by the PCE, P flag in
   LSP object is set to 1 and Path ID TLV MAY be skipped.  After the PCE
   has allocated a path ID, it MUST include the PATH-ID TLV in a LSP
   object (with C-bit unset), the E-bit is set by PCE based on the path
   ID space from which the allocation is made.

   If the PCE allocated the path ID on its own accord, a PATH-ID TLV
   MUST be included in a LSP object (with C-bit unset), the E-bit is set
   by PCE based on the path ID space from which the allocation is made.

4.3.  FEC Object

   The FEC Object [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] is
   used to specify the FEC information and MAY be carried within
   PCInitiate or PCRpt message for the PCECC-SR operations.  The PCE
   MUST inform the Path Identification information to the Egress PCC.
   To do this, this document extends the procedures of
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] by defining a new FEC
   object type for Path.

   FEC Object-Type is TBD 'Path'.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 2: The path FEC object Format

   One or more following TLV(s) are allowed in the 'path' FEC object -

   o  SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV: As defined in [RFC8231], it is a human-
      readable string that identifies an LSP in the network.

   o  LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLVs: As defined in [RFC8231], it is optional for
      SR, but could be used to encode the source, destination and other
      identification information for the path.

   o  SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV: As defined in [RFC8232], a unique
      identifier for the PCEP speaker, it is used to identify the
      Ingress PCC.

   Either SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV or LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV MUST be
   included.  SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV is optional.  Only one instance of
   each TLV is processed, if more than one TLV of each type is included,
   the first one is processed and others MUST be ignored.

4.4.  CCI Object

   The Central Control Instructions (CCI) Object is used by the PCE to
   specify the forwarding instructions is defined in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].  Further
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] defined a CCI object
   type for SR.

   The Path ID information is encoded directly in the CCI SR object.
   The Path ID TLV as described in the Section 4.2.1, MAY also be
   included in the CCI SR object.

5.  Operations

   The path ID allocation and encoding is as per the stateful PCE
   operations for segment routing.  The procedures are as per the
   corresponding extensions defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing]
   and [I-D.negi-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] (which are further based on
   [RFC8231] and [RFC8281]).  The additional operations for path
   identification are defined in this section.

   To notify the path ID to the Egress PCC, the procedures are as per
   the PCECC-SR [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr] (which

   additional operations are defined in this section.

5.1.  PCC Allocated Path ID

5.1.1.  Ingress PCC Allocated Path ID

   The Ingress PCC could allocate the Path ID and inform the PCE via the
   PCRpt message as per [RFC8231].  The PATH-ID TLV MUST be included in
   a LSP object in the PCEP message from PCC.  The P flag in LSP object
   is set to 0.  On receiving this report, the PCE updates the
   information in its database.  The active PCE (where the LSP is
   delegated) further informs the egress about the path ID allocated by
   the PCC using the PCInitiate message as described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

5.2.  PCE Allocated Path ID

5.2.1.  PCE Controlled ID Spaces Advertisement

   For allocating the path IDs to SR paths by the PCEs, the PCE
   controlled ID Spaces MUST be known at PCEs via configurations or any
   other mechanism.  The PCE controlled ID spaces MAY be advertised as
   described in [I-D.li-pce-controlled-id-space].

5.2.2.  Ingress PCC request Path ID to PCE

   The ingress PCC could request the path ID to be allocated by the PCE
   via PCRpt message as per [RFC8231].  The delegate flag (D-flag) MUST
   also be set for this LSP.  The PATH-ID TLV MAY be included with Path
   ID set to 0x0000.  The active PCE would allocated the path ID as per
   the PATH-ID flags and in case PATH-ID is not included, the PCE MUST
   act based on the local policy.  The PCE would further respond to
   Ingress PCC with PCUpd message as per [RFC8231] and MUST include the
   PATH-ID TLV in a LSP object.  The PCE would further inform the egress
   PCC about the path ID allocated by the PCE using the PCInitiate
   message as described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

5.2.3.  PCE allocated Path ID on its own

   The PCE could allocate the path ID on its own accord for a PCE-
   Initiated (or delegated LSP).  The allocated path ID needs to be
   informed to the Ingress and Egress PCC.  The PCE would use the
   PCInitiate message [RFC8281] or PCUpd message [RFC8231] towards the
   Ingress PCC and MUST include the PATH-ID TLV in the LSP object.  The
   PCE would further inform the egress PCC about the path ID allocated
   by the PCE using the PCInitiate message as described in
   [I-D.zhao-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-sr].

5.3.  Two Label Solution

   [I-D.cheng-spring-mpls-path-segment] describe a Path Segment to
   uniquely identify an SR path in a specific context. (e.g., in the
   context of the egress node or ingress node of an SR path, or within
   an SR domain).  It further describes two solution based on 'one
   label' or 'two labels' solution.  For the latter, two segments
   (Source segment and Path segment) are used to identify an SR path
   where the source segment is a global node segment which can uniquely
   identify a node within the SR domain (it is NOT used for forwarding
   and indicates that a Path segment immediately follows).  The
   combination of Source segment and Path segment uniquely identify an
   SR Path with an SR domain.

   The procedure described in this document allocates and encode the
   Path Segment only.  It is expected that the Egress PCC is aware of
   the Source segment by some other procedures.  These procedures could
   be IGP, PCECC-SR, or some other mechanisms.
