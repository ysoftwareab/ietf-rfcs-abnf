   functionality for enhanced telephony services, specifically CLASS 
   signaling services.  This document is the updated version of the 
   alerting and CLASS packages presented originally in draft-brown-
   megaco-supplpkgs-00.txt.

   3.2 Events 
    
       None. 
    
   3.3 Signals 
    
       Ring 
    
          SignalID: ri (0x????) 
    
          Applies ringing to the line. 
    
          Signal Type: TimeOut 
          Duration: Provisioned 
          Additional Parameters: 
    
             Pattern 
    
                ParameterID: pattern (0x????) 
                Type: Enumeration 
                Possible Values: 1 - 8 (0x0001 - 0x0008) 
    
                The pattern is an abstract indication of the 
                distinctive alerting pattern that will be applied to 
                the line. The alert/ri pattern parameter has a direct 
                mapping to the alert/cw pattern parameter, and to the 
                class/cid pattern parameter. The actual 
                cadence/frequency combination is available in the 
                gateway. The default is pattern 1, which indicates the 
                default alerting style. Ring patterns repeat until the 
                signal times out, or is interrupted. 
                 
                It is useful to note that ringing patterns and call 
                waiting patterns are paired to allow for distinctive 
                alerting sets. In expanding this parameter in the 
                future, it would be desirable to expand the alert/ri, 
                alert/cw, and class/cid signals together, maintaining 
                the distinctive pattern pairings. This will continue to 
                allow the class/cid signal to have a definition 
                independent of alerting method, linking it only to the 
                alerting style (pattern). 
    
       Ringsplash 
    
          SignalID: rs (0x????) 
    
          Applies ringsplash to the line.

          Additional Parameters: None. 
    
       Call Waiting 
    
          SignalID: cw (0x????) 
    
          Generate call waiting indication. The cw signal definition 
          takes a pattern parameter, to allow generation of distinctive 
          waiting tones. 
    
          Signal Type: Brief 
          Duration: Varies by pattern.

                ParameterID: pattern (0x????) 
                Type: Enumeration 
                Possible Values: 1 - 8 (0x0001 - 0x0008) 
    
                The pattern is an abstract indication of the 
                distinctive alerting pattern that will be applied to 
                the line. The alert/cw pattern parameter has a direct 
                mapping to the alert/ri pattern parameter, and to the 
                class/cid pattern parameter. The actual 
                cadence/frequency combination is available in the 
                gateway. The default is pattern 1, which indicates the 
                default alerting style. Call wait patterns do not 
                repeat. 
                 
                It is useful to note that ringing patterns and call 
                waiting patterns are paired to allow for distinctive 
                alerting sets. In expanding this parameter in the 
                future, it would be desirable to expand the alert/ri, 
                alert/cw, and class/cid signals together, maintaining 
                the distinctive pattern pairings. This will continue to

   3.4 Statistics 
    
       None. 
    
   3.5 Procedures 
    
      It is anticipated that a Ringing MIB will be necessary to 
      provision the proper frequencies and cadences onto the GW. 
    
    
4. CLASS Signaling Package

   PackageID: class (0x????) 
   Version: 1 
   Extends: alert version 1 
    
   This package defines signaling for CLASS features for an analog 
   line. 
    
   4.1 Properties 
    
       None. 
    
   4.2 Events 
    
       None. 
    
   4.3 Signals 
    
       Caller Identification 
    
          SignalID: cid (0x0001) 
    
          Sends the date, caller's name and caller's number to the CPE 
          display, if the set is so equipped. Caller ID is unique in 
          that it must be applied during alerting -- either power 
          ringing, or call waiting. Therefore, this signal implies 
          alerting, which will be appropriately applied to the CPE by 
          the gateway, based upon the on-hook/off-hook status of the 
          line. 
    
          Signal Type: Brief 
          Duration: Variable 
          Additional Parameters: 
    
             CID Data Block 
    
                ParameterID: cdb (0x0001) 
                Type: String 
                Possible Values: See description. 
    
                The CID Data Block contains the hex message data to be 
                sent to the set. For example, in North America for 
                basic Caller ID, this would be the SDMF or MDMF 
                construct. The default value is an empty data block, 
                which will be discarded by the gateway. 
    
             Pattern 
    
                ParameterID: pattern (0x0002) 
                Type: Enumeration 
                Possible Values: 1 _8 (0x0001 - 0x0008)

                The pattern is an abstract indication of the 
                distinctive alerting pattern that will be applied to 
                the line. The cid pattern parameter maps to the ri 
                pattern parameter for on-hook signaling, and to the cw 
                pattern parameter for off-hook signaling. The default 
                is pattern 1, which indicates the default alerting 
                style. 
                 
                It is useful to note that ringing patterns and call 
                waiting patterns are paired to allow for distinctive 
                alerting sets. In expanding this parameter in the 
                future, it would be desirable to expand the ri, cw, and 
                cid signals together, maintaining the distinctive 
                pattern pairings. This will continue to allow the cid 
                signal to have a definition independent of alerting 
                method, linking it only to the alerting style 
                (pattern). 
    
       Analog Display Services Interface Signaling 
    
          SignalID: adsi (0x0002) 
    
          Sends ADSI data to sets that are so equipped.  ADSI is used 
          for advanced features such as context-specific softkeys, and 
          in-phone visual data editing. 
    
          Signal Type: Brief 
          Duration: Variable 
          Additional Parameters: 
    
             ADSI Data Block 
    
                ParameterID: adb (0x0001) 
                Type: String 
                Possible Values: See description. 
    
                The ADSI Data Block contains the hex message data to be 
                sent to the set. The default value is an empty data 
                block, which will be discarded by the gateway. 
    
   4.4 Statistics 
    
       None. 
    
   4.5 Procedures 
    
      There may be some confusion as to how to build the Signals 
      descriptor when attempting to deliver Caller ID to the set. The 
      class/cid signal is designed to stand alone, and be independent 
      of on-hook/off-hook status. 
       
      Ringing (via the alert package) for a normal call would have a 
      signals descriptor that looks like this: 
 
Boyle & Brown      Informational - Expires Apr 2001                  5 
              Enhanced Alerting Packages for Megaco/H.248  October 2000 
       
        Signals{alert/ri{pattern=1}} 
       
      Now let's add Caller ID to the set.  To apply standard ringing, 
      and signal the Caller ID information the signals descriptor would 
      look like this: 
       
        Signals{class/cid{cdb=802301083035313831363135020A3931393939313
        2363930070B4B6576696E20426F796C656C,pattern=1}} 
       
      (For the record, this block is North American MDMF Caller ID 
      signaling, indicating a call at 4:15 PM, May 18 from Kevin Boyle 
      at (919) 991-2690.  The checksum is included [6C].) 
       
      This signaling implies both standard ringing, and any other 
      signaling necessary to perform the Caller ID function.  For the 
      UK, for example, this signal requests that the gateway ringsplash 
      the set, send the CID data, and then apply normal ringing.  For 
      North America, it requests that the gateway apply normal ringing, 
      sending the CID data between the first and second ring. 
       
      This would be similarly applied to Call Waiting ID.  For normal 
      call waiting, the tone is requested as follows: 
       
        Signals{alert/cw{pattern=1}} 
       
      To perform Call Waiting ID, the descriptor looks identical to the 
      on-hook case: 
       
        Signals{class/cid{cdb=802301083035313831363135020A3931393939313
        2363930070B4B6576696E20426F796C656C,pattern=1}} 
       
      This signaling implies both application of call waiting tone, and 
      any other signaling necessary to perform the Caller ID function.  
      For North America, it requests that the gateway apply call wait 
      tone, then apply the CAS, and send down the Caller ID info after 
      receipt of the ACK digit.  If the gateway controller wants 
      notification of the ACK digit, it should be requested in the 
      Events descriptor. 
       
      For ADSI, there are similar constraints around ACK digits and 
      softkey/digit responses.  Any responses that the gateway 
      controller wishes to be made aware of should be requested in the 
      Events descriptor. Digitmaps would be especially useful for this 
      application. 
       
      The binary encoding of the data blocks is the hex data they 
      represent.
