1  Introduction

   With the development of network technology, there are more and more
   services sensitive to network latency, for example, interactive VR,
   tactile Internet, remote control, automatic drive etc. Also low
   latency has become an important requirement in 5G network design. For
   service with low latency requirements, the network needs to meet its
   end-to-end latency requirements.

   The MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) sinks computing and storage
   capacity to the edge of the network. The MEC server is deployed at
   the edge of the network and applications could be deployed in the MEC
   server. This allows the MN to access the required services in close
   proximity without having to traverse through the core network,
   thereby reducing the end-to-end RTT, and satisfying latency
   requirements. One of the basic MEC deployment scenarios is shown in
   Figure 1:


   +--+           +---+       +---+     +----------+
   |MN|-----------|UP1|       |UP3|-----|MEC Server|
   +--+           +---+       +---+     +----------+

                  +---+       +---+     +----------+
                  |UP2|       |UP4|-----|MEC Server|
                  +---+       +---+     +----------+

                 Figure 1: MEC Deployment Architecture

   In order to meet the low latency requirements of network services, an
   alternative approach is to deploy services with low latency
   requirements in the MEC system. The MEC architecture is an effective
   means of addressing low latency requirements by deploying the
   application in an MEC server close to the terminal equipment.

   Application instance runs in a MEC server, and the service connection
   is established between application runs on MN and application
   instance runs on MEC server. When the MN moves in the MEC server's
   coverage area, in order to ensure continuity of the service, the
   connectivity between MN application and mobile edge application needs
   to be maintained. As MN moves further away from the location of the
   mobile edge application, there could be an increased latency between
   the MN and the mobile edge application. Due to this reason or others
   (e.g. network congestion), for some mobile edge applications, it
   might become necessary to relocate the application instance, i.e.
   relocating the application instance to a new MEC server near to MN's
   current location, in order to satisfy the latency requirements, when
   the application instance is relocated the service continuity need to

   be maintained. [GS_MEC003]

   For instance, when the MN runs interactive VR (Virtual Reality)
   service, in order to guarantee the high bandwidth and low latency
   requirement of the VR's service, the MEC server is used to provide
   service for the MN, that is, the MEC server starts a VM (Virtual
   Machine) running the VR service for MN, when the MN moves far away
   from the original MEC server, if the nearest MEC server is available,
   the VM will be migrated to the new MEC server, and ensuring
   continuity of VR service. The case where the VM relocation follows
   MN's mobility is also referred as VM handoff [Ha2015].

   This memo analyzes the mobility scenario of the correspondent node
   following the MN to avoid the redundancy of the route redundancy, and
   a mobility management solution based on the ID/Locator split scheme
   is provided.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Mobility Management Gap Analysis

   In the DMM, the on-demand mobility scheme [ODMM] is proposed, in
   which the network provides IP session continuity and IP address
   reachability based on application requirements. If the application
   requires both session continuity and IP address reachability, the
   application chooses to use a fixed IP address; if the application
   needs IP session continuity but does not need IP address
   reachability, then the application will use Session-lasting IP
   Address; if the application neither need IP session continuity nor IP
   address reachability, then non-persistent IP Address will be used.

   On-demand mobility scheme separate applications need IP session
   continuity from applications don't need IP session continuity , and
   then the network provides applications with different types of
   session continuity support based on this separation: for a
   application that does not require session continuity support, session
   continuity is not provided, and a new IP address is allowed to be
   used when the MN moves, in this way the routing redundancy problem
   could be avoided; for an application that needs session continuity
   support from the network, the network side sustains the IP address
   used by the MN during the movement of the MN, so that the IP address
   used by the application is not changed, however, this approach
   provides session continuity while also introduces routing redundancy
   for application traffic. The on-demand approach does not address the

   mobility requirements in the VM handoff scenario described earlier.

   The fundamental cause for the route redundancy is the dual attributes
   of the IP address: the network location attribute and the session
   identification attribute. The two communication sides use IP
   addresses to identify the session, so in order to maintain session
   continuity the IP addresses need keep the same, but because IP
   address also determines network location, when the IP address keeps
   the same the service traffic flows back to the IP address's IP
   anchor, which leads to routing redundancy problem.

3  Mobility Solution Based on ID/Locater Split

   ID/Locator separation scheme separate ID attribute from Locator
   attribute in one IP address, it can be a good choice to solve the
   routing redundancy problem caused by mobility.

   In this memo, the architecture of network-based mobility management
   solution based on the concept of ID/Locator split is discussed which
   is also align with DMM working group's existing CP-UP separation
   architecture. Figure 2 illustrates an overview of the mobility
   solution architecture.

   management of Locator, packet encapsulation and decapsulation, packet
   forwarding, signaling interaction with Control Plane (for example,
   ID/Locator relationship update).

   The Control Plane is responsible for maintaining the mapping of
   ID/Locator and configuring the ID/Locator to the corresponding UP to
   control UP's processing of the packet.

   In order not to modify the existing mobile terminal, the two sides of
   communication in the scheme still use the 5-tuple to identify the
   session. It is assumed that the IP addresses used by the MN and CN in
   the communication are IP-mn and IP-cn respectively. During
   communication, IP-mn and IP-cn only act as IDs, which are used to
   identify sessions, but are not used as locators. UP1 to UP4 is
   responsible for allocating Locator for MN and CN.

   When the MN is located at UP1, a communication connection is
   established with MN's correspondent node VM , at which time the VM
   accesses UP3. The packet between MN and the VM is transmitted through
   the tunnel established between UP1 and UP3, where the outer header of
   the tunnel uses the locator assigned by UP1 and UP3.

        Figure3: Communication Connection before Movement Occurs

   When the MN moves to UP2, the communication between the MN and the VM
   adopts the make-before-break mode. The MN communicates with the VM
   instance located at the UP3 position until the VM instance completely
   relocated to the UP4 position. During this period, packets are
   transmitted through tunnels between UP2 and UP3. The outer header of
   the tunnel uses the locators assigned by UP2 and UP3.

   When the VM instance has been relocated to UP4 position, the MN will
   communicate with the VM instance at the UP4 position. That is, the
   communication path will be switched from UP2 to UP3. In this case, it
   is necessary to set up a temporary path between UP3 and UP4 and
   forward previous in-transit packets from UP3 to UP4, the temporary
   path will be released after all the packets has been forwarded to
