    RESTCONF Extensions to Support the Network Management Datastore
                              Architecture
                  draft-ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf-02

Abstract

   This document extends the RESTCONF protocol defined in RFC 8040 in
   order to support the Network Management Datastore Architecture
   defined in I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores.

   This document updates RFC 8040 by introducing new datastore
   resources, adding a new query parameter, and requiring the usage of
   I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis by RESTCONF servers implementing the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture.

   REF Editor: please replace "I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores" and
   "I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis" above with their final RFC assignments.

1.  Introduction

   This document extends the RESTCONF protocol defined in [RFC8040] in
   order to support the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   This document updates [RFC8040] in order to enable RESTCONF clients
   to discover which datastores are supported by the RESTCONF server, as
   well as determine which modules are supported in each datastore and,
   finally, to interact with all the datastores supported by the NMDA.
   Specifically, the update introduces new datastore resources, adds a
   new query parameter, and requires the usage of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis] by RESTCONF servers implementing the
   NMDA.

   The solution presented in this document is backwards compatible with
   [RFC8040].  This is achieved by only adding new resources and leaving
   the semantics of the existing resources unchanged.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined by the NMDA
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Datastore and YANG Library Requirements

   RFC Ed.: Update 201X-XX-XX below with correct date.

   An NMDA-compliant RESTCONF server MUST support the operational state
   datastore and it MUST implement at least revision 201X-XX-XX of the
   "ietf-yang-library" module defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis].

   Such a server identifies that it supports the NMDA both by
   implementing the {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:operational resource,
   and by implementing at least revision 201X-XX-XX of the
   "ietf-yang-library" module.

   A RESTCONF client can test if a server supports the NMDA by using
   either the HEAD or GET methods on {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational.

3.  RESTCONF Extensions

   This section describes the RESTCONF extensions needed to support the
   NMDA.

3.1.  New Datastore Resources

   This document defines a set of new resources representing datastores
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  These resources
   are available using the following resource path template:

     {+restconf}/ds/<datastore>

   The <datastore> path component is encoded as an "identity" according
   to the JSON encoding rules for identities, defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC7951].  Such an identity MUST be derived from the "datastore"
   identity defined in the "ietf-datastores" YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   Specifically:



Bjorklund, et al.         Expires July 21, 2018                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                                              January 2018


   o  The resource {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:operational refers to
      the operational state datastore.

   o  The resource {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:running refers to the
      running configuration datastore.

   o  The resource {+restconf}/ds/ietf-datastores:intended refers to the
      intended configuration datastore.

   An NMDA-compliant server MUST implement {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational.  Other datastore resources are optional to
   implement.

   YANG actions can only be invoked in {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational.

   If a server implements the example datastore "ds-ephemeral" in the
   module "example-ds-ephemeral", it would implement the resource
   {+restconf}/ds/example-ds-ephemeral:ds-ephemeral.

3.2.  Protocol Operations

   The protocol operations available for the new datastore resources
   (Section 3.1) are the same as the protocol operations defined in
   [RFC8040] for the {+restconf}/data resource with the following
   exceptions:

   o  Dynamic configuration datastores are excluded, as each dynamic
      configuration datastore definition needs to be reviewed for what
      protocol operations it supports.

   o  Some datastores are read-only by nature (e.g., <intended>), and
      hence any attempt to modify these datastores will fail.  A server
      MUST return a response with a "405 Method Not Allowed" status-
      line, and error-tag value "operation-not-supported".

   o  The "with-defaults" query parameter ([RFC8040], Section 4.8.9)
      does not apply when interacting with {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
      datastores:operational.  This means that all "in use" values, as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] section 5.3, are
      returned for the operational state datastore, even if a node
      happens to have a default statement in the YANG module, and this
      default value is being used by the server.  If the "with-defaults"
      query parameter is present in a request to this resource, the
      server MUST return a response with a "400 Bad Request" status-
      line.  The error-tag value "invalid-value" is used in this case.

Internet-Draft                                              January 2018


   o  [RFC8040], Section 3.5.4, paragraph 3 does not apply when
      interacting with any resource under {+restconf}/ds.

3.2.1.  New "with-origin" Query Parameter

   A new query parameter named "with-origin" is added to the GET
   operation.  If present, it requests that the server includes "origin"
   metadata annotations in its response, as detailed in the NMDA.  This
   parameter is only valid when querying {+restconf}/ds/ietf-
   datastores:operational or any datastores with identities derived from
   the "operational" identity.  Otherwise, if an invalid datastore is
   specified then the server MUST return a response with a "400 Bad
   Request" status-line, using an error-tag value of "invalid-value".
   "origin" metadata annotations are not included unless a client
   explicitly requests them.

   Data in the operational state datatstore can come from multiple
   sources.  The server should return the most accurate value for the
   "origin" metadata annotation as possible, indicating the source of
   the operational value, as specified in Section 5.3.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   When encoding the origin metadata annotation for a hierarchy of
   returned nodes, the annotation can be omitted for a child node when
   the value matches that of the parent node, as described in
   "ietf-origin" YANG module [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].

   The "with-origin" query parameter is optional to support.  It is
   identified with the URI:

     urn:ietf:params:restconf:capability:with-origin:1.0

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one capability in the "RESTCONF Capability
   URNs" registry defined in [RFC8040]:

     Index          Capability Identifier
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     :with-origin   urn:ietf:params:restconf:capability:with-origin:1.0

5.  Security Considerations

   This documents extends the RESTCONF protocol by introducing new
   datastore resources.  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].  The
   RESTCONF protocol uses the network configuration access control model

   [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc6536bis], which provides the means to restrict
   access for particular RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all
   available RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The security constraints for the base RESTCONF protocol (see
   Section 12 of [RFC8040] apply to the new RESTCONF datastore resources
   defined in this document.
