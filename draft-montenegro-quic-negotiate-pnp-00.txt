             QUIC Negotiation for Packet Number Protection
                 draft-montenegro-quic-negotiate-pnp-00

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to reduce the cost of QUIC
   deployment in environments like datacenters by allowing packet number
   protection to be optionally disabled.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport for the internet.  In its generality, there
   are features which are not well suited for some environments.  In
   particular, QUIC uses Packet Number Protection (PNP) to prevent
   ossification and to provide unlinkability upon (voluntary) migration.
   However, there are environments where these are not a concern, in
   particular, connections within a datacenter.

   This document defines a negotiation mechanism using transport
   parameters to disable PNP.  Internet facing nodes MUST not disable
   PNP, so browsers, for example, should not implement this extension.
   On the other hand, configured nodes within a datacenter could turn
   off PNP in their exchanges to avoid the CPU cost that PNP implies.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Transport Parameter to Disable Packet Number Protection

   This document defines a new transport parameter for QUIC
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]:

   disable_packet_number_protection (0x000c ?, value TBD):  The endpoint
      is disabling packet number protection as specified in [QUIC-TLS].
      This parameter is a zero-length value.  This parameter only
      affects short headers.

   A successful negotiation of the "disable_packet_number_protection"
   parameter requires both peers to send this transport parameter.

   Peers that have successfully negotiated the
   "disable_packet_number_protection" parameter MUST NOT use packet
   number protection on short header packets.

4.  Security Considerations

   Per section 6.11.5 of [QUIC-TLS], PNP is used as a partial mitigation
   against linkability, and to prevent ossification.  The
   "disable_packet_number_protection" parameter should be negotiated in
   environments in which these are not a concern.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per section 13.1 of [QUIC-TLS], this document requests IANA assign a
   value for the new transport parameter and record it in the registry
   for "QUIC Transport Parameters" under the "QUIC Protocol" heading.
   IANA is further requested to assign a value with the first byte in
   the range 0x00 to 0xfe (in hexadecimal) as follows:

       +--------+----------------------------------+---------------+
       | Value  | Parameter Name                   | Specification |
       +--------+----------------------------------+---------------+
       | 0x000c | disable_packet_number_protection | This document |
       +--------+----------------------------------+---------------+
