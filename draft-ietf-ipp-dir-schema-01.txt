       Abstract

       This document is one of a set of documents which together describe
       all aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an
       application level protocol that can be used for distributed printing
       using Internet tools and technology. The protocol is heavily
       influenced by the printing model introduced in the Document Printing
       Application (ISO/IEC 10175 DPA) standard.  Although DPA specifies
       both end user and administrative features, IPP version 1.0 is focused
       on end user functionality.  Although DPA specifies both end user and
       administrative features, IPP version 1.0 is focused only on end user
       functionality.

       The full set of IPP documents includes:

         Internet Printing Protocol : Requirements
         Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics
         Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Security
         Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Protocol Specification
         Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Directory Schema


       The requirements document takes a broad look at distributed printing
       functionality, and it enumerates real-life scenarios that help to
       clarify the features that need to be included in a printing protocol
       for the Internet.  It identifies requirements for three types of
       users: end users, operators, and administrators.  The requirements
       document calls out a subset of end user requirements that must be
       satisfied in the first version of IPP.  Operator and administrator
       requirements are out of scope for v1.0. The model and semantics
       document describes a simplified model with abstract objects, their
       attributes, and their operations.  The security document covers
       potential threats and proposed counters to those threats.  The
       protocol specification incorporates the ideas in all the other
       documents into a concrete mapping using clearly defined data
       representations and transport protocol mappings that real
       implementers can use to develop interoperable client and server side
       components. Finally, the directory schema document shows a generic
       schema for directory service entries that represent instances of IPP
       Printers.

       This document is the "Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Directory
       Schema" document.

       INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP/1.0: Directory Schema     June 12, 1997


       1. Introduction

       A Directory Service is a means by which service users can locate
       service providers.  The directory contains entries for each type of
       object within the system:  entries for users, file systems, servers,
       applications, printers, other devices, etc.  End users use a
       Directory Service to locate objects based on naming and
       organizational contexts.  For example, find all servers in the "Local
       Department" context.  Authentication and authorization are also often
       part of a directory service.  Users are only allowed to find objects
       to which they have certain access rights.  Each service provider
       registers with the directory (either automatically or with the help
       of an administrator) as an entry of a certain type.  For example, an
       IPP Printer can be registered in the directory as a Printer object
       with certain registration attributes (name, address, static
       characteristics, etc.).  Given a Directory Service provides this type
       of interaction for both service providers and service users, it is
       possible for end users to locate an IPP Printer using either a simple
       name lookup or a filtered attribute search.

       After an end user locates one or more IPP Printers, the end user
       selects a Printer.  Certain attributes in the directory entry for a
       Printer provide additional information to the end user, such as the
       cost to print jobs on this Printer, that assist the end user in
       selecting a Printer.

       After an end user selects an IPP Printer, the end user performs an
       IPP print operation on that Printer.  IPP provides the protocol that
       communicates this print operation to the IPP Printer in the network.
       An IPP client addresses an IPP Printer using a URI.  This URI is a
       required attribute in the directory entry for an IPP Printer.  Thus,
       the Printer's URI _links_ the directory entry for an IPP Printer to
       the corresponding IPP Printer in the network.

       IPP does not require any specific Directory Service provider.
       However, this specification does define a generic schema that can be
       used to implement directory entries for Printers using a specific
       Directory Service.

       Section 2 introduces the generic schema for entries in a directory
       that represent IPP Printer objects.

       Sections 3-5 cover security, technical references, and author contact
       information.

       INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP/1.0: Directory Schema     June 12, 1997


       2. Directory Entry Schema

       The following attributes define the generic directory entry schema
       for an IPP Printer.  The conformance terminology, the syntax
       definitions of the attributes and the values of the attributes are
       defined in the _Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 Model and Semantics_
       document and are not repeated in this document.  The attribute
       definitions in this schema match the corresponding attribute
       definitions in the model to facilitate manual and/or automatic
       mechanisms of mapping an IPP Printer to its corresponding directory
       entry.

       All MANDATORY attributes MUST be defined in each directory entry for
       an IPP Printer.  All other attributes SHOULD be defined in each
       directory entry for an IPP Printer.  Furthermore, a directory entry
       for an IPP Printer SHOULD be an instance of a Printer object class
       defined by the Directory Service to scope searches for Printers.
       Finally, a directory entry for an IPP Printer SHOULD reflect the
       current attribute values for an IPP Printer in the network at any
       point in time.

       2.1 printer-URI (uri, MANDATORY)

       This attribute contains the URI for the Printer.  An administrator
       shall determine a printer's URI and shall set this attribute to that
       URI. The precise format of a printer URI SHALL be implementation
       dependent.

       2.2 printer-name (name, MANDATORY)

       This attribute contains the name of the Printer. It is a name that is
       more user friendly than the printer-URI.  An administrator shall
       determine a Printer's name and shall set this attribute to that name.
       This name may be the last part of the printer's URI or it may be
       unrelated. In non-US-English locales, a name may contain characters
       that are not allowed in a URI.

       2.3 printer-location (text)

       This attribute identifies the location of this Printer.

       In order for filtered searches to be more effective, a given site may
       use some regular structuring within the attribute value such as
       "SITE:USA-San Jose,BUILDING:A1,FLOOR:2,ROOM:555" or "department5-
       2ndFloor-A5-IndianHills-Chicago-IL-USA".

       2.4 printer-description (text)

       This attribute identifies the descriptive information about this
       Printer.  This could include things like: "This printer can be used
       for printing color transparencies for HR presentations", or "Out of
       courtesy for others, please print only small (1-5 page) jobs at this
       printer", or even "this printer is going away on July 1, 1997, please
       find a new printer".

       2.5 printer-more-info-site (uri)

       This attribute contains a URI used to obtain more information about
       this specific Printer.  The information obtained from this URI is
       intended for end user consumption.  Features outside the scope of IPP
       can be accessed from this URI.  The information is intended to be
       specific to this Printer and site services (e.g. job pricing,
       services offered, end user assistance).  The manufacturer may
       initially populate this attribute.

       2.6 printer-make-and-model (text)

       This attribute identifies the make and model of the printer.

       2.7 printer-more-info-manf (uri)

       This attribute contains a URI used to obtain more information about
       this type of printer.  The information obtained from this URI is
       intended for end user consumption. Features outside the scope of IPP
       can be accessed from this URI. (e.g. latest firmware,  upgrades,
       print drivers, optional features available).  The information is
       intended to be germane to this printer without regard to site
       specific modifications or services.

       2.8 media-supported (1setOftype4 keyword)

       This attribute identifies the media supported by the Printer.  This
       directory attribute SHOULD only be updated with values that are
       relatively static values, not values which are constantly being
       updated by the Printer.

       2.9 number-up-supported (1setOftype3 keyword)

       This attribute specifies the number of source page-images to impose
       upon a single side of an instance of a selected medium.

       2.10 sides-supported (1setOftype2 keyword)

       This attribute specifies how source page-images are to be imposed
       upon the sides of an instance of a selected medium.

       2.11 printer-resolution-supported (1setOftype2 keyword)

       This attribute specifies the printer resolutions supported by this
       printer.

       2.12 maximum-printer-speed-supported (integerUnits)

       This attribute specifies the maximum printer speed of the Printer.

       2.13 print-quality-supported (1setOftype2 keyword)

       This attribute specifies the print qualities supported by the
       Printer.

       2.14 color-supported (boolean)

       This attribute specifies whether the Printer supports color or not.

       2.15 finishings-supported (setOftype2 keyword)

       This attribute identifies the finishing operations that the Printer
       can apply to each copy of each printed document in a job.

       2.16 document-formats-supported (1setOftype2 keyword)

       This attribute specifies a list of the document formats that the
       Printer supports.

       2.17 printer-locales-supported (1setOflocale keyword, MANDATORY)

       This attribute specifies the locales that the Printer operates in.

       3. Security Considerations

       An end user's access to a directory entry for an IPP Printer is
       controlled by the Directory Service.  An end user's access to an IPP
       Printer in the network is controlled by the service provider for that
       IPP Printer.

       Protocol/1.0: Security."  That document is being drafted and reviewed
       in parallel with this document.  Before this document can become a
