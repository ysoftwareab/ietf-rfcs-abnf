2.  Introduction

   The network virtualization overlay over Layer 3 (NVO3) as depicted in
   Figure 1, allows an overlay cloud provider to provide a logical L2/L3
   interconnect for the Tenant Systems TSes that belong to a specific
   tenant network.  A packet received from a TS is encapsulated by the
   ingress Network Virtualization Edge (NVE).  The encapsulated packet
   is then sent to the remote NVE through a tunnel.  When reaching the
   egress NVE of the tunnel, the packet is decapsulated and forwarded to
   the target TS.  The L2/L3 address mappings to the remote NVE(s) are
   distributed to the NVEs by a logically centralized Network
   Virtualization Authority (NVA) or using a distributed control plane
   such as Ethernet-VPN.  In a datacenter, the NVO3 tunnels can be
   implemented using Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation
   (Geneve) [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  Such Geneve tunnels establish NVE-

   to-NVE communications, may transit within the data center via Geneve
   Transit Nodes (GTN).  The Geneve tunnels overlay network enable
   multiple Virtual Networks to coexist over a shared underlay
   infrastructure, and a Virtual Network may span a single data center
   or multiple data centers.

   The underlay infrastructure on which the multi-tenancy overlay
   networks are hosted, can be owned and provided by an underlay
   provider who may be different from the overlay cloud provider.

   This document discusses the security risks that a Geneve based NVO3
   network may encounter and tries to provide a list of essential
   security requirements that needs to be fulfilled.  In addition, this
   document lists the requirements to protect the Geneve packet
   components defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] that include the Geneve
   tunnel IP and UDP header, the Geneve Header, Geneve options, and
   inner payload.  Protecting the complete Geneve packet - that is the
   full IP packet or the full outer UDP payload for example - is out of

   scope of this document, given that this can be supported using
   existing mechanisms.

   This document assumes that a tenant subscribes to an overlay cloud
   provider for hosting its Tenant Systems, the cloud provider manages
   the Geneve overlay network on behalf of the tenant.  The overlay
   network will be hosted on an underlay network infrastructure, that
   may be managed by another underlay cloud provider.

   The security requirements in this document aims at providing the
   overlay cloud provider the necessary options to ensure:

   1.  Delivering tenant payload traffic and ensuring privacy and
       integrity of the overlay traffic, and isolation between the
       overlay and underlay networks, as well preventing tenant traffic
       from being redirected or injected to other tenants.

   2.  Protecting tenant traffic from rogue devices in the providers of
       Geneve overlay or underlay networks.

   In summary, the document defines the security requirements to protect
   tenants overlay traffic against security threats from the NVO3
   network components that are interconnected with tunnels implemented
   using Geneve.

   The security requirements in the document are expressed regarding the
   threats to mitigate.  It is expected that a security mechanism
   designed for NVO3 overlay network implementing Geneve is able to
   mitigate all the threats and as such fulfills all the security
   requirements expressed in the document.  The document RECOMMENDs that
   the definition of a Geneve security mechanism fulfills all
   requirements expressed in this document

   On the other hand, the specificities and the context of some Geneve
   deployments may consider the risk associated to some threats as very
   low and as such ignore the threats.  In such cases, a specific
   security mechanism designed for that specific deployment may not
   fulfill all the requirements associated to that given threat.  This
   document RECOMMENDs to consider all the threats while designing a
   security mechanism for the Geneve overlay network.  In addition, some
   deployments may not take advantage of some features provided by
   Geneve, in which case, a specific security mechanisms designed for a
   specific deployment may not fulfill the requirements associated to
   that feature.  This document RECOMMENDs that such specific security
   mechanisms be an intermediary approach toward the deployment of a
   Geneve security mechanism.  In fact, such specific mechanisms present
   the risk to ossifying Geneve as well as the security being lowered in
   favor of Geneve features.

   The document strongly recommend to re-use existing security protocols
   like IP Security (IPsec) [RFC4301] and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246], and existing encryption algorithms ( such as [RFC8221]),
   and authentication protocols.

   Authentication requirements for NVO3 devices, automated key
   management, as well as packet level security providing
   confidentiality, integrity and authorization requirements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements] are also requirements for this
   document.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology of [RFC8014], [RFC7365] and
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  In addition to these document the following
   term is used:

   o  Immutable Geneve Option: designate a Geneve Option that are not
      expected to be modified by any on path element, such as a GTN.

   o  Geneve Transit Node (GTN): A transit device that is not Geneve
      termination point.  GTN MAY understand and Geneve packet and MAY
      process Geneve Option.

4.  Security Threats

   Attacks from compromised NVO3 and underlay network devices, and
   attacks from compromised tenant systems defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements] are considered for the Geneve
   overlay network.  Furthermore, the attackers knowing the details of
   the Geneve packets can perform their attacks by changing fields in
   the Geneve tunnel header, base header, Geneve options and Geneve
   packet inner payload.

   Threats include traffic analysis, sniffing, injection, redirection,
   and replay.  Based on these threats, this document enumerates the
   security requirements.

   Threats are divided into two categories: passive attack and active
   attack.

   Threats are always associated with risks and the evaluation of these
   risks depend among other things on the environment.

Internet-Draft    Geneve Protocol Security Requirements    February 2018


4.1.  Passive Attacks

   Passive attacks include traffic analysis (noticing which workloads
   are communicating with which other workloads, how much traffic, and
   when those communications occur) and sniffing (examining traffic for
   useful information such as personally-identifyable information or
   protocol information (e.g., TLS certificate, overlay routing
   protocols).

   A rogue element of the overlay Geneve network under the control of an
   attacker may leak and redirect the traffic from a virtual network to
   the attacker for passive monitoring [RFC7258].

   Avoiding leaking information is hard to enforced and the security
   requirements expect to mitigate such attacks by lowering the
   consequences, typically making leaked data unusable to an attacker..

4.2.  Active Attacks

   Active attacks involve modifying packets, injecting packets, or
   interfering with packet delivery (such as by corrupting packet
   checksum).

   There are multiple motivations to inject illegitimate traffic into a
   tenants network.  When the rogue element is on the path of the TS
   traffic, it may be able to inject and receive the corresponding
   messages back.  On the other hand, if the attacker is not on the path
   of the TS traffic it may be limited to only inject traffic to a TS
   without receiving any response back.  When rogue element have access
   to the traffic in both directions, the possibilities are only limited
   by the capabilities of the other on path elements - GTN, NVE or TS -
   to detect and protect against the illegitimate traffic.  On the other
   hand, when the rogue element is not on path, the surface for such
   attacks remains still quite large.  For example, an attacker may
   target a specific TS or application by crafting a specific packet
   that can either generate load on the system or crash the system or
   application.  TCP syn flood typically overload the TS while not
   requiring the ability to receive responses.  Note that udp
   application are privileged target as they do not require the
   establishment of a session and are expected to treat any incoming
   packets.

   Traffic injection may also be used to flood the virtual network to
   disrupt the communications between the TS or to introduce additional
   cost for the tenant, for example when pricing considers the traffic
   inside the virtual network.  The two latest attacks may also take
   advantage of applications with a large factor of amplification for
   their responses as well as applications that upon receiving a packet



Migault, et al.          Expires August 30, 2018                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Geneve Protocol Security Requirements    February 2018


   interact with multiple TS.  Similarly, applications running on top of
   UDP are privileged targets.

   Note also that an attacker that is not able to receive the response
   traffic, may use other channels to evaluate or measure the impact of
   the attack.  Typically, in the case of a service, the attacker may
   have access, for example, to a user interface that provides
   indication on the level of disruption and the success of an attack,
   Such feed backs may also be used by the attacker to discover or scan
   the network.

   Preventing traffic to cross virtual networks, reduce the surface of
   attack, but rogue element main still perform attacks within a given
   virtual network by replaying a legitimate packet.  Some variant of
   such attack also includes modification of unprotected parts when
   available in order for example to increase the payload size.

5.  Requirements for Security Mitigations

   The document assumes that Security protocols, algorithms, and
   implementations provide the security properties for which they are
   designed, an attack caused by a weakness in a cryptographic algorithm
   is out of scope.

   Protecting network connecting TSes and NVEs which could be accessible
   to outside attackers is out of scope.

   An attacker controlling an underlying network device may break the
   communication of the overlays by discarding or delaying the delivery
   of the packets passing through it.  The security consideration to
   prevent this type of attack is out of scope of this document.

   Securing communication between NVAs and NVEs is out of scope.

   Selectively providing integrity / authentication, confidentiality /
   encryption of only portions of the Geneve packet is in scope.  This
   will be the case if the Tenant Systems uses security protocol to
   protect its communications.

5.1.  Protection Against Traffic Sniffing

   A passive network observer can determine two virtual machines are
   communicating by manipulating activity or network activity of other
   virtual machines on that same host.  For example, the attacker could
   control (or be otherwise aware of) network activity of the other VMs
   running on the same host, and deduce other network activity is due to
   a victim VM.  Comparing application TLS to guest IPsec ESP to NVE
   IPsec ESP, each provides stronger protection from traffic analysis in



Migault, et al.          Expires August 30, 2018                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Geneve Protocol Security Requirements    February 2018


   the same order.  Application TLS exposes TCP port numbers to a
   passive observer, guest IPsec ESP encrypts the inner transport header
   but still identifies the communicating VM's IP address, while NVE
   IPsec ESP encrypts the entire inner payload.

   To protect packet payloads from passive listeners, application-level
   encryption (e.g., JSON Web Encryption [RFC7516]), application TLS,
   guest IPsec ESP, or hypervisor IPsec ESP can be used.  Each provides
   the same protection against a passive listener.

   To protect against the above-described traffic sniffing attacks, we
   require:

   GEN-REQ1:  The NVE MUST ensure the traffic leaving the NVE has its
              payload encrypted.  The encryption operation MAY be
              performed by the NVE, but could also be performed, for
              example, by the TS.

   GEN-REQ2:  To provide best protection from traffic analysis, the NVE
              SHOULD encrypt the payload fields that appears in clear.
              Typically, this could include VM's inner IP address,
              transport header, and IP payload when Geneve carries IP
              packets.

   GEN-REQ1 and GEN-REQ2 are inline with NVE-NVE and NVE-Hypervisor data
   plane security requirements for confidentiality in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements] like REQ 10, 11 and 16.

5.2.  Protecting Against Traffic Injection

   Traffic injection from a rogue non legitimate NVO3 Geneve overlay
   device or a rogue underlay transit device can target an NVE, a
   transit underlay device or a Tenant System.  Targeting a Tenant's
   System requires a valid MAC and IP addresses of the Tenant's System.

   Tenant's System may protect their communications using IPsec or TLS.
   Such protection protects the Tenants from receiving spoofed packets,
   as any injected packet is expected to be discarded by the destination
   Tenant's System.  Such protection does not protect the tenant system
   from receiving illegitimate packets that may disrupt the Tenant's
   System performance.

   The Geneve overlay network MAY still need to prevent such spoofed
   Tenant's system packets from being steered to the Tenant's system.

   When the Tenant's System are not protecting their communications, the
   Geneve overlay network SHOULD be able to to prevent a rogue device
   from injecting traffic into the overlay network.



Migault, et al.          Expires August 30, 2018                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Geneve Protocol Security Requirements    February 2018


   In order to prevent traffic injection to one virtual network, the
   destination legitimate Geneve NVE MUST be able to authenticate the
   incoming Geneve packets from the source NVE.  Authenticated Geneve
   Packet MAY be checked by underlay intermediary nodes.

   Based on a policy partial authentication MAY be performed on Geneve
   packets if tenant's system is protecting it's communication.  In
   situations where the tenant system is already encrypting its traffic
   with application-level encryption (e.g., S/MIME), transport
   encryption (e.g., TLS), or IP encryption (e.g., IPsec ESP), it is
   redundant for the NVE to apply additional encryption.  Note that
   relaying on upper security layers, results from a compromise between
   security and performance as it may introduce cut and paste
   vulnerability.

   The Geneve architecture considers intermediary nodes designated as
   GTN.  A protection established between NVE SHOULD NOT prevent GTN to
   perform their operations, such as the insertion of a Geneve Option,
   authenticating a Geneve Option or steering Geneve packets.  In the
   later case, in order to ease the transition from a non secured to
   secure Geneve overlay network, it is expected that GTN that are not
   aware of Geneve security mechanisms can steer authenticated Geneve
   packets the same way as non protected Geneve packets.  Similarly, the
   transition from non secure to secure Geneve overlay network may also
   be performed by introducing GTN that performs the security
   functionalities - such as authentication of Geneve packets- on behalf
   of NVE.

   This leads to the following security requirements:

   GEN-REQ3:  A Geneve NVE MUST be able to authenticate at least one of
              the Geneve tunnel Header, the Geneve base header, the
              immutable Geneve Options, or the Geneve payload.  The
              combination of fields that are authenticated is defined by
              security policies.

   GEN-REQ4:  A Geneve NVE MAY be able to authenticate only a portion of
              the Geneve payload if the Tenant's system is protecting
              its communication.

   GEN-REQ5:  A GTN MAY be able to validate the authentication before
              the packet reaches the Geneve destination NVE.

   GEN-REQ6:  A GTN MUST be able to insert an authenticated Geneve
              Option into a authenticated Geneve Packet - protected by
              the source Geneve NVE.

Internet-Draft    Geneve Protocol Security Requirements    February 2018


   GEN-REQ7:  A GTN capable of forwarding non-authenticated Geneve
              packets MUST be capable of forwarding the Geneve
              authenticated packet without any additional security
              specific functionalities.  In other words, forwarding
              authenticated Geneve packet MUST done the same way as
              authenticated Geneve packets.

   GEN-REQ8:  A Geneve NVE SHOULD be able to set different security
              policies for different flows.  A flow MUST be identified
              at minimum by the Geneve virtual network identifier and
              the inner IP and transport headers, and optionally
              additional fields which define a flow (e.g., inner IP
              DSCP, IPv6 flow id, Geneve options).

   GEN-REQ9:  In the case when Tenant systems secure their
              communications using protocols such as TLS or IPsec.  A
              Geneve NVE MAY be able to selectively encrypt and/or
              authenticate only the sections that are not encrypted/
              authenticated by the Tenant System.  For example, only the
              IP, transport (TCP / UDP) in case of TLS/DTLS MAY be
              encrypted/authenticated, while only the IP header and ESP
              header MAY be encrypted/authenticated.

   Requirements listed in this section are inline with authentication
   and integrity requirements in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements],
   like REQ 9, 10, 11, 14 and 16.

   The requirements further define mechanisms to fully and partially
   authenticate Geneve Header, and Geneve options, as well fully and
   partially encrypt the same.

5.3.  Protecting Against Traffic Redirection

   A rogue device of the NVO3 overlay Geneve network or the underlay
   network may redirect the traffic from a virtual network to the
   attacker for passive or active attacks.  If the rogue device is in
   charge of the securing the Geneve packet, then Geneve security
   mechanisms are not intended to address this threat.  More
   specifically, a rogue source NVE will still be able to redirect the
   traffic in clear text before protecting ( and encrypting the packet).
   A rogue destination NVE will still be able to redirect the traffic in
   clear text after decrypting the Geneve packets.  The same occurs with
   GTN that are in charge of encrypting and decrypting a Geneve Packet,
   Geneve Option or any information.  The security mechanisms are
   intended to protect a Geneve information from any on path node.

   To prevent an attacker located in the middle between the NVEs and
   modifying the tunnel address information in the data packet header to

Internet-Draft    Geneve Protocol Security Requirements    February 2018


   redirect the data traffic, the solution need to provide
   confidentiality protection for data traffics exchanged between NVEs.

   Based on a policy partial encryption MAY be performed on Geneve
   packets if tenant's system is protecting it's communication.

   The Geneve architecture considers intermediary nodes designated as
   GTN.  A protection established between NVE SHOULD NOT prevent GTN to
   perform their operations, such as the insertion of a Geneve Option,
   encrypting a Geneve Option or steering Geneve packets.  In the later
   case, in order to ease the transition from a non secured to secure
   Geneve overlay network, it is expected that GTN that are not aware of
   Geneve security mechanisms can steer encrypted Geneve packets the
   same way as non protected Geneve packets.  Similarly, the transition
   from non secure to secure Geneve overlay network may also be
   performed by introducing GTN that performs the security
   functionalities - such as encryption of Geneve packets- on behalf of
   NVE.

   This leads to the following security requirements:

   GEN-REQ10: A Geneve NVE MUST be able encrypt Geneve base Header, and/
              or Geneve Payload and/or Geneve Options not intended for
              the GTN.

   GEN-REQ11: A Geneve NVE MAY be able encrypt portion of Geneve Payload
              as well as as Geneve Options not intended for the GTN.

   GEN-REQ12: A transit underlay intermediary node MUST be able to
              insert an encrypted Geneve Option into an encrypted/
              authenticated Geneve Packet - protected by the source
              Geneve NVE.

   GEN-REQ13: A Geneve NVE SHOULD be able to assign different
              cryptographic keys to protect the unicast tunnels between
              NVEs respectively.

   GEN-REQ14: If there are multicast packets, a Geneve NVE SHOULD be
              able to assign distinct cryptographic group keys to
              protect the multicast packets exchanged among the NVEs
              within different multicast groups.  Upon receiving a data
              packet, an egress Geneve NVE MUST be able to verify
              whether the packet is sent from a proper ingress NVE which
              is authorized to forward that packet.

   Requirements listed in this section are inline with the requirements
   in the data plane sections in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements]
   to protect against traffic redirection and man in the middle attacks.

   The requirements further define mechanisms for a transit intermediary
   node to insert an encrypted Geneve option to an encrypted/
   authenticated Geneve packet.

5.4.  Protecting Against Traffic Replay

   A rogue device of the NVO3 overlay Geneve network or the underlay
   network may replay a Geneve packet, to load the network and/or a
   specific Tenant System with a modified Geneve payload.  In some
   cases, such attacks may target an increase of the tenants costs.

   When traffic between tenants is not protected, the rogue device may
   forward the modified packet over a valid Geneve Header.  The crafted
   packet may for example, include a specifically crafted application
   payload for a specific Tenant Systems application, with the intention
   to load the tenant specific application.

   Updating the Geneve header and option parameters such as setting an
   OAM bit, adding bogus option TLVs, or setting a critical bit, may
   result in different processing behavior, that could greatly impact
   performance of the overlay network and the underlay infrastructure
   and thus affect the tenants traffic delivery.

   The NVO3 overlay network and underlay network nodes that may address
   such attacks MUST provide means to authenticate the Geneve packet
   components.

   This leads to the following security requirements:

   GEN-REQ15: A Geneve NVE or a GTN MUST be able to validate the Geneve
              Header corresponds to the Geneve payload, and discard such
              packets.

   GEN-REQ16: A Geneve NVE or a GTN SHOULD provide anti replay
              mechanisms and discard replayed packet.

   The requirements in this section are inline with REQ 10 and 14 in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements], and they further specifies
   requirements to validate that a Geneve Header corresponds to the
   Geneve payload.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA consideration for this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   The whole document is about security.

   Limiting the coverage of the authentication / encryption provides
   some means for an attack to craft special packets.

   The current document details security requirements that are related
   to the Geneve protocol.  Their purpose is to design appropriated
   Geneve security Options or to appropriately secure NVE-NVE
   communication based on Geneve.  Instead,
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements] provides generic architecture
   security requirement upon the deployment of an NVO3 overlay network.
   It is strongly recommended to read that document as architecture
   requirements also apply here.  In addition, architecture security
   requirements go beyond the scope of Geneve communications, and as
   such are more likely to adress the security needs upon deploying an
   Geneve overlay network.

   More precisely, REQ 1 to REQ 8 are focused on the control plane which
   is outside the scope of this document.

   REQ 9 is a data plane security requirement, but focused on the
   establishment of a NVO3 tunnels.  This is outside the scope of Geneve
   which only address data in motion.  As such REQ 9 is outside the
   scope of this document.

   REQ 10 to REQ 14 are in the scope of this document.  REQ 12 and REQ
   13 are identical as GEN-REQ13 and GEN-REQ14.  All other requirements
   from GEN-REQ1 to GEN-REQ16 are declinasons of REQ 10, REQ 11 and REQ
   14.  These requirements are the declination of architecture
   requirements in a context for Geneve, which includes the presence of
   GTN, Geneve Options as well as the possibility to split the security
   opration between tenants and teh overlay infrastructure.

   REQ 15 to REQ 18 from [I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements] are
   focused on the NVE-Hypervisor Data Plane which is not based on Geneve
   and thus is outside the scope of the document.
