                    Delivered-To Email Header Field
                   draft-crocker-email-deliveredto-03

Abstract

   The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were
   created by the author.  The address used by the mail transport
   service is provided separately, through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO"
   command.  Before final delivery, handling can entail a sequence of
   submission/delivery events, using different destination addresses,
   that lead to the recipient.  It can be helpful for a message to have
   a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to
   include each address used for that recipient.  This specification
   defines a header field for this information.

   Email handling information is a matter of modifying the email
   infrastructure and possibly creating privacy concerns.  A header
   field such as this is not automatically assured of adoption or use.
   Therefore it is being published as an Experiment, looking for
   constituency and for operational utility.

1.  Introduction

   The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields [Mail-Fmt]
   that were created by the author's Mail User Agent (MUA) [Mail-Arch].
   The address used by the Message Handling Service (MHS) is provided
   separately, through an envelope "RCPT TO" command [SMTP].

   Delivery is the final processing of an envelope address, with a
   transition of responsibility from the MHS, over to an agent
   responsible for that address (Section 4.3.3 [Mail-Arch]).  After this
   transition there might be further, fresh processing of the message,
   before reaching a final destination.  Each transition of
   responsibility, from the MHS to an agent of the addressee,
   constitutes a delivery.

   Given aliasing, mailing lists, and the like, the transit of a message
   from its author to a final recipient might include a series of
   submission/delivery events.  It can be helpful for a message to have
   a common way of indicating each delivery in the handling sequence,

   and to include each address that led to the final delivery.  One use
   can be for detecting a delivery sequence loop.

   Email handling information is a matter of modifying the email
   infrastructure and possibly creating privacy concerns.  A header
   field such as this is not automatically assured of adoption or use.
   Therefore it is being published as an Experiment, looking for
   constituency and for operational utility.

2.  Framework & Terminology

   Unless otherwise indicated, basic architecture and terminology used
   in this specification are taken from:

   o  [Mail-Arch]

   o  [SMTP]

   o  [Mail-Fmt]

   and syntax is specified with:

   o  [ABNF]

   Normative language, per [RFC8174]:

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   RFC EDITOR: Remove before publication:

      Discussion of this draft is best conducted in the ietf-
      smtp@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

3.  Delivered-To:

   This specification defines the "Delivered-To" header field, for
   annotating a delivery event and the individual address to which
   delivery has been effected.

   o  A sequence of deliveries, such as when a message goes through
      multiple mailing lists, SHOULD be recorded with a series of
      Delivered-To: header fields





Crocker                 Expires October 20, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    react                       April 2021


   o  As with some other information, each additional Delivered-To:
      header field MUST be placed at the current 'top' of the message --
      as the first header field, in a fashion similar to the trace
      fields specified in [SMTP], such as in Section 4.1.1.4

   o  As with other fields placed at the current top, the Delivered-To
      header field MUST NOT be reordered, with respect to other
      Delivered-to fields AND those other fields

   The Delivered-To: header field is added at the time of delivery, when
   responsibility for a message transitions from the Message Handling
   (Transport) Service (MHS) to an agent of the specified individual
   recipient address.  The header field contains the individual address
   used to determine the immediate location for that transition.

   Note:    The presence of an existing Delivered-To: header field, for
      the same Mailbox, is indicative of a handling loop.

   Syntax of the header field is:

   "Delivered-To:" FWS Mailbox CRLF
                    ; Mailbox is from [SMTP]

   Note:    The field records only a single address, for one recipient.
      See Section 5 for the privacy-related concerns about divulging
      addresses.

4.  Multi-hop Example

   The Delivered-To: header field can indicate a sequence of deliveries,
   as demonstrated by this example, which has a message traveling
   through a mailing list, on through an alias, and then reaching final
   delivery:

   1.  Origination @ example.com

   2.  List @ example.org

   Delivered-To: list@example.org
   Received: by submit.example.org with SMTP id i17so17480689ljn.1
      for <list@example.org>; Mon, 25 Jan 2021 15:29:19 -0800 (PST)

   Subject: [list] Sending through a list and alias
   Sender: Ann Author <aauthor@example.com>

   3.  Alias @ example.edu

5.  Security Considerations

   As with Received header-fields, their presence in a message discloses
   handling information and, possibly, personal information.

   In some email implementations, a message that is for multiple (local)
   recipients has a single stored version.  Supporting Delivered-To:,
   while maintaining recipient privacy, creates a challenge.  However,
   exposing different mailbox addresses to other recipients MUST NOT
   occur.

   An issue specific to this mechanism is disclosure of a sequence of
   addresses, if a message goes through a series of recipient envelope
   address modifications.  The specification calls for each of these
   addresses to be recorded in separate Delivered-To: fields.  This does
   not disclose addresses of other recipients, but it does disclose a
   address-transformation handling path for the recipient.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of the "Delivered-To" header field is requested, per
   [RFC3864]:



      Header field name:    Delivered-To

       Applicable protocol:    mail

      Status:    Provisional

      Author/Change controller:    Dave Crocker

      Specification document(s):    *** This document ***

      Related information:    None.

7.  Experimental Goals

   Specific feedback is sought concerning:

   o  Technical issues in recording the Delivered-To field into a
      message, through its entire submission/delivery seuence

   o  Market interest

   o  Utility

   So the questions to answer for this Experimental specification are:

   o  Is there demonstrated interest by MTA/MSA developers?

   o  If the capability is implemented and the header field generated,
      is it used by operators or MUAs?

   o  Does the presence of the header field create any operational
      problems?

   o  Does the presence of the header field demonstrate additional
      security issues?

   o  What specific changes to the specification are needed?

   o  What other comments will aid in use of this mechanism?

   Please send comments to ietf-smtp@ietf.org.
