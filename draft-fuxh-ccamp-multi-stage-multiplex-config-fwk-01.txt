 Framework for Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration in G.709 Optical
                           Transport Network
          draft-fuxh-ccamp-multi-stage-multiplex-config-fwk-01

Abstract

   Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been
   considered in G.709.  Multi stages multiplexing would be desirable to
   facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an
   existing network without having to upgrade every node in the network.
   So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and transit across
   the 2.5G TS region.  Multi stages multiplexing are also used to
   support the multi-domain OTN applications based on carrier-Carrier,
   regional-national core interconnection or network tunnels design.
   This document describes the framework for multi stages multiplexing
   configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.

Internet-Draft   Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration       July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Multi stages multiplexing configuration requirement is defined in
   [draft-fuxh-ccamp-multi-stage-multiplex-config-req-01] document.  It
   describes two typical use case of multi stages multiplexing
   configuration.

   The introduction of ODU0 and ODUflex to the OTN hierarchy creates the
   requirement where multi stages of multiplexing would be desirable to
   facilitate the introduction of these new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to
   an existing 2.5G TS network without having to upgrade every node in
   the network.

   A second potential application for multi stages outside of an upgrade
   scenario would be the carrier-carrier, regional-national core
   interconnection cases or network design based on tunnels.  Multi
   stages multiplexing are used to support the multi-domain OTN
   applications based on the tunnel design.  If there are a large number
   of circuits that share the same endpoints (or even part of an overall
   path), it may be convenient from a management perspective to first
   multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2 or ODU3 to minimize
   the number of connections that need to be made in intermediate nodes.
   The ODU2/ODU3 effectively creates a tunnel through the ODU4 network
   that the ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex can use.

   This document describes the framework for multi stages multiplex
   configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.


2.  Multi Stages Multiplexing vs Single Stage Multiplexing

2.1.  Bandwidth Fragmentation

   Single-stage ODU multiplexing can provide non-fragmented bandwidth,
   maximizing the support of higher bit rate LO ODU signals.  While two-
   stage ODU multiplexing may introduce fragmented bandwidth into
   smaller bandwidth subsets.  Suppose 8 ODU0 service needs to be
   created over ODU2 link by using ODU0-ODU1-ODU2 multiplexing.

   o  1st ODU1 for 1st and 2nd ODU0 service.

   o  2nd ODU1 for 3rd and 4th ODU0 service.

   o  3th ODU1 for 5th and 6th ODU0 service.

   o  4th ODU1 for 7th and 8th ODU0 service.

   After 1st and 3rd ODU0 service is deleted and one new ODU1 service

   needs to be created, there is no any avaible TS for the ODU1 service
   creation.  There will be some fragmented bandwidth within one ODU2
   link.  If ODU0-ODU2 multiplexing is used and TSs have not to be
   sequential for ODU1 service in order to prevent further bandwidth
   fragmentation, the fragmentation can be avoided.

   GMPLS could defragment such fragmented ODU link by using make-before-
   break method, for example by moving ODU0 connections from one (half
   empty) ODU1 trail to another (half empty) ODU1 trail.  An operator
   may have a policy that allows GMPLS to perform such defragmentation.
   How to deal with defragementation is out scope of this document.  But
   the bandwidth fragment should not be an obstacle for the multi stages
   multiplexing application.

2.2.  Integrated Line Card vs Cascade Line/Equipment

   Figure 1 shows two models of multi stages multiplexing.  But it
   doesn't going to restrict the implementation of equipment.  In the
   cascade equipment or line card model, it require the operator to
   backhaul service to other seperate equipments or line cards which can
   support the re-multiplexing in order to follow the single stage
   multiplexing.  So it will introduces unnecessary network complexity,
   power and cost.

3.  GMPLS and PCE Extension to Support Multi Stages Multiplexing
    Configuration

   From the perspective of Control Plane, path computation entity must
   get multi stages multiplexing capability of each node to support
   multi stages multiplexing for path computation.  Path computation
   entity can use the IGP protocol or configurations from Management
   Plane to get this information.  Path computation entity must select a
   proper kind of multi stages multiplexing of nodes which may support
   different multi stages multiplexing hierarchies along a specific end-
   to-end connection.  Signaling message must carry the multi stages
   multiplexing hierarchy that has been determined by path computation
   entity.  Multi stages multiplexing for a specific service must be
   configured after node receives the signaling of service creation.

   The purpose of this section is to provide a framework for extensions
   of the current GMPLS and PCE protocols for multi stages multiplexing
   configuration in OTN network.

3.1.  Routing Extension to Support Multi Stages Multiplexing
      Configuration

   Path computation entity needs to get the multi stages multiplexing

   capability information of nodes which are designed to support multi
   stages multiplexing.  Multi stages multiplexing capability
   information must be advertised into topology by the IGP protocol.
   LSAs which are advertised must carry multi stages multiplexing
   capability information.  Multi stages multiplexing capability can be
   configured into nodes by Management Plane (e.g., Network Planning
   Tool) or discovered within nodes based on the switching and
   adaptation capability of switching fabrics and cards.

3.1.1.  Multi Stages Multiplexing Capability

   The content of this section describes the information needed for path
   computation.  In terms of Figure 3, there is a network element
   between the 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS network.  In order to facilitate the
   introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals from 1.25G TS network
   (i.e., 10G network), ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2 first
   and transit across the 2.5G TS network (i.e., 40G network).

   This document does not imply restrictions to the equipment
   implementation.  It just gives an info model of how the multi stage
   multiplexing capability could be represented.  Modeling of routing
   information must be independent of equipment design.

   G1 of Figure 3 supports the following single stage and multi stages
   multiplexing capability when signal is mapped into ODU3.

   o  ODU1-ODU3

   o  ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODU0-ODU1-ODU3

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODU1-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3

   G1 of Figure 3 supports the following single stage multiplexing
   capability when signal is mapped into ODU2.

   o  ODU0-ODU2

   o  ODUflex-ODU2

   o  ODU1-ODU2

   NE G1 of Figure 3 can also add or drop the STM-16 (ODU1) and 10GigE

   [RFC5339][draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mln-extensions-12] to describe the
   switching/adaptation capability of OTU2 and OTU3 TE Link.  OTU2 TE
   Link can directly support ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex and ODU2 switching
   capability.  OTU3 TE Link can directly support ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3
   switching capability.  OTU3 TE Link can support ODU0, ODU1 and
   ODUflex by multi stages multiplexing hierarchies.  In order for path
   computation, following information needs to be advertised into
   topology.

   o  ODUk Type (e.g., OTU3 and OTU2 of Figure 3).

   o  Tribute Slot Type: 1.25G TS or 2.5G TS.

   o  Supported ODUi: Max/Available/Allocated (k > i).

      *  Max: maximum numbers of ODUi which can be supported directly by
         the ODUk link.

      *  Available: available numbers of ODUi which can be supported
         directly by ODUk link.

      *  Allocated: the numbers of ODUi which has been allocated.  This
         information isn't necessary to be advertised.  It may be
         maintained in the control plane instance.

   o  Supported ODUflex: max/available/allocated.

      *  Max TSs: The maximum tribute slots that could be supported
         directly for ODUflex by the ODUk (k=2, 3, 4).

      *  Available TSs: maximum numbers of tribute slots that are not
         assigned for ODUflex.

      *  Allocated TSs: tribute slots that have been allocated for
         ODUflex.  This information isn't necessary to be advertised.
         It may be maintained in the control plane instance.

   We can only use ISCDs to represent single stage and multi stages
   multiplexing capability.  But other further information is necessary.

   o  Multiplexing Hierarchy Flag (MHF): single stage multiplexing or
      multi stages multiplexing.  When it is set to 0, ODUi (i < k) is
      mapped into ODUk by single stage multiplexing.  When it is set to
      1, ODUi (i < k) is mapped into ODUk by multi stages multiplexing.

   o  Multi Stages Multiplexing Hierarchy (MSMH).

   We would have the following TE link advertisements:


   OTU2 TE Link (Port1):

   If there are three 10GigE (ODU2) services and one STM-16 service
   which are added into NE G1 of Figure 3 accross the OTU3 link,
   following ISCDs has to be changed.  There is no any adaptation
   capability between ODUflex, ODU0, ODU1 and ODU2.  So ODUflex, ODU0
   and ODU1 can not be mapped in ODU2 in ODU3 when they are going to
   across the 2.5G TS network.  There is no any changing for the
   adaptation capability of ODU0 being mapped in ODU1 in ODU3.

   We could also combine ISCDs and IACDs to represent single stage and
   multi stages multiplexing capability of OTU3 Port2.  We would have
   another TE link advertisements for single stage multiplexing.  Only
   ODUi which could be supported directly by ODUk TE Link is representd
   in ISCD.

   In order to make path computation entity be aware of the multi stages
   multiplexing capability information, following information needs to
   be advertised into topology.

   o  Supported ODUj: max/available/allocated (k > i > j)

      *  Max: maximum numbers of ODUj which can be directly adapted into
         ODUi.

      *  Available: available numvers of ODUj which can be directly
         adapted into ODUi.

      *  Allocated: the numbers of ODUj which has been allocated for the

         It should be stored in the control plane instance.

   We would have the following TE link advertisements for the adaptation
   capability between different ODUk containers:

      Supported ODU0 which is adapted into ODU1:
      - IACD 1 sub-TLV: Type of ODUi: ODU1

   In order to reduce the information which has to be advetised into
   toplogy.  IACD2, IACD3 and IACD4 could be combined into one IACD
   (e.g., IACD5), as ODUflex, ODU0 and ODU1 are all adapted into the
   same ODU2 container.

   If there are three 10GigE services and one STM-16 service which are
   added into NE G1 of Figure 3 accross the OTU3 link, following IACD
   and IACD has to be changed.  There is no any adaptation capability
   between ODUflex, ODU0, ODU1 and ODU2.  So ODUflex and ODU0 can not be
   mapped in ODU2 in ODU3 when they are going to across the 2.5G TS
   network.  There is no any changing for ISCD4 (i.e., adaptation
   capability of ODU0 being mapped in ODU1 in ODU3).

      #6         ODUflex 8      0        0

   The following multiplexing hierarchies matrix could be inferred by
   path computation entity in terms of ISCD1, ISCD2, IACD1, IACD2, IACD3
   and IACD4.  So path computation entity will infer that ODU0-ODU1-
   ODU2-ODU3 multi stages multplexing could be supported by the network
   element.  But the fact is that ODU0-ODU1-ODU2-ODU3 three stage
   multiplexing hierarchy couldn't be supported within the NE G1 of
   Figure 3.  The constraint of prohibiting ODU0 in ODU1 in ODU2 must be
   expressed in topology view and considered by path computation entity.
   The allowable multi stages multiplexing hierarchies should be also
   known by path computation entity.

3.1.2.  Selection of Multi Stages Multiplexing Hierarchies

   The multi stages multiplexing capability information should be
   discovered/enabled by the OSS and as described in the previous point
   distributed via routing.  Path computation entity can get multi
   stages multiplexing capability of each nodes for path computation.
   It must select some proper kinds of multi stages multiplexing
   hierarchies for different nodes along a specific end-to-end
   connection.  For example, there are two multi stages multiplexing
   hierarchies for ODU0 being mapped into ODU3 in NE G1 of Figure 3
   (i.e., ODU0-ODU1-ODU3 and ODU0-ODU2-ODU3).  So it has to determine
   which kind of multi stages multiplexing hierarchies should be used
   for the ODU0 service and the type of tunnel (FA-LSP).  In Figure 4,
   if path computation entity select the ODU0-ODU2-ODU3 multi stages
   multiplexing hierarch in Node B and C for one end-to-end ODU0 service
   from A to Z, there has to be an ODU2 tunnel between B and C. The
   selection of multi stages multiplexing hierarchies is based on the
   operator policy and the equipment capability.  How to select the
   multiplexing hierarchies is the internal behavior of path computation
   entity.

   hierarchies which are supported or prohibited.

3.2.  Signaling Extension to Support Multi Stages Multiplexing
      Configuration

   All kinds of multi stages multiplexing hierarchies which has been
   determined for all nodes along one end-to-end connection by path
   computation entity must be carried with signaling message.  For
   example, if path computation entity select the ODU0-ODU2-ODU3 multi
   stages multiplexing hierarch in Node B and C of Figure 4 for one end-
   to-end ODU0 service from A to Z, the signalling message must carry
   this ODU0-ODU2-ODU3 multi stages multiplexing hierarchy to inform
   Node B and C. After one node which can support the flexible multi
   stages multiplexing hierarchies receives the signaling message who
   carries one kind of multi stages multiplexing hierarchy for it, it
   must config this kind of multi stages multiplexing hierarchy to its
   data plane.  It needs to extend the signaling protocol to carry this
   informationn. [draft-fuxh-ccamp-multi-stage-multiplex-config-rsvp-01]
   describes RSVP-TE extension for multi stages multiplexing
   configuration.

   The ODU2 tunnel is signalled based on [RFC4328] signalling.  It can
   be resolved by using pre-established HO ODU2 or triggered by ODU0
   connection signalling.  After the ODU2 tunnel is created, one ODU2
   link is added into the topology for other ODUflex/ODU0/ODU1 path
   computation.  When the "last" LO ODU type service (e.g.  ODU0, ODU1
   and ODUflex) removed, the ODU2 must be torn down and removed from the
   ODU0 /ODU1/ODUflex topology; the timing for this should be set by a
   policy e.g. immediately, after 10 days, or...

3.3.  PCE Extension to Support Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration

   Based on the [draft-fuxh-ccamp-multi-stage-multiplex-config-ospf-01],
   path computation entity can get multi stages multiplexing capability
   of each nodes for path computation.  Path computation entity in
   Management Plane and/or Control Plane must support the path
   computation by using the multi stages multiplexing capability and
   supported or prohibited multi stages multiplexing hierarchies
   information.  It must determine some proper kinds of multi stages
   multiplexing hierarchy for different nodes along the path.

   A request from a PCC to a PCE MUST support the inclusion of an
   optional indication of which kinds of multi stages multiplexing
   hierarchy can be used for sepecific node or not.  So the path
   computation entity must consider these multi stage multiplexing
   hierarchy constraints.  In the absence of such an indication, the
   default is that there is no any multi stage multiplexing hierarchy
   constraint for path computation.

   PCReq has a desire to be extended to carry some kindes of multi

   stages multiplexing hierarchy constraints of some specific nodes for
   path computation from PCC.  PCRep also has a desire to be extended to
   carry all kindes of multi stages multiplexing hierarchy which have
   been selected by PCE for each nodes along the path.

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of control plane protocols for signaling, routing, and path
   computation opens an OTN to security threats through attacks on those
   protocols.  The data plane technology for an OTN does not introduce
   any specific vulnerabilities, and so the control plane may be secured
   using the mechanisms defined for the protocols discussed.  For
   further details of the specific security measures refer to the
   documents that define the protocols ([RFC3473], [RFC4203], [RFC4205],
   [RFC4204], and [RFC5440]).  [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of
   security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS
   control plane.
