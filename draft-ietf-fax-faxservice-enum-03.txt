Abstract
     
     This document describes the functional specification 
     and the definition of the ENUM NAPTR record, for IFax 
     service. IFax is "Facsimile using Internet Mail".  For 
     this use, the DNS returns the email address of the 
     referenced IFax system. This mechanism allows email-based 
     fax communication to use telephone numbers, rather than 
     requiring that the sender already know the recipient 
     email address.


1.   Functional Specification

    An IFax client makes an [ENUMbis] DNS query, using the target  
    system's telephone number.  The returned NAPTR record 
    specifies an email address that is to be used for reaching
    the target system.  The email address is then used in 
    accordance with "Simple Mode of Facsimile using Internet 
    Mail" [RFC2305] or "Extended Facsimile using Internet 
    Mail" [RFC2532]. "Full Mode Fax Profile for Internet Mail" [FFPIM]
    is applied when it is approved as an Internet standards-track 
    specification.


2.  IFax service Registration 

    Service Name : "E2U+ifax"

    Type: "ifax"

    Subtype: "mailto"

    URI Scheme: "mailto"
    The URI Scheme is "mailto" because facsimile is a profile of  
    standard Internet mail and uses standard Internet mail addressing.

    Functional Specification: see section 1

    Security Considerations: see section 3

    Intended usage: COMMON

3. Security Consideration

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database. Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously. Whilst
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone
   Directory, it does open the data subject to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that 
   this has been done or by whom.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate 
   lists of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are 
   used to address "spam". Publication of a telephone number in ENUM, 
   especially when it is an associated Internet Fax service, may be 
   used to send "junk faxes" for example.

   In the case of electronic mail, users subscribed to mailing lists
   can have "sacrificial" email accounts. These special-purpose
   addresses help the user to filter out unrequested email that is
   sent to them. This is not so easy with published telephone
   numbers. The PSTN E.164 number assignment process is much more
   involved and less flexible; usually a single E.164 number (or a
   fixed range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access. Thus
   it is not possible to use a "sacrificial" phone number.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give their explicit
   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.

   Internet Fax is based on use of existing Internet mail. Developers 
   and users should also consider the Security Consideration section 
   in [RFC2305] and [RFC2532].

   In addition to the specific security considerations given above, 
   the Security Consideration section of [ENUMbis] applies to this 
   document.


4.  Example
    The following is an example of the use of IFax service

    in a NAPTR record.

    $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa
      IN NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+ifax:mailto" 
                             "!^.*$!mailto:toyo@example.com!"


5. IANA CONSIDERATIONS

     This specification creates a DNS NAPTR registration, according to
     the terms specified in [ENUMbis]

     The registration details are contained in section 2, 
     "Fax service Registration", above.
