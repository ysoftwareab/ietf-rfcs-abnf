Abstract

   This Internet-Draft proposes a mechanism for finding information
   about solicitation class keywords which are defined in RFC 3865, the
   No Soliciting SMTP Service Extension.  The mechanism uses a DNS NAPTR
   Resource Record to associate a URI with a solicitation class keyword.

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit Discovery         January 2005


1.  Solicitation Class Keywords

   [RFC3865] defines the concept of a "solicitation class keyword",
   which is an arbitrary string or label which can be associated with an
   electronic mail message and transported by the ESMTP mail service as
   defined in [RFC2821] and related documents.  Solicitation class
   keywords are formatted like domain names, but reversed.  For example,
   the registrant of "example.com" might specify a particular
   solicitation class keyword such as "com.example.adv" that could be
   inserted in a "No-Solicit:" header or in a trace field.  [RFC3865]
   explicitly placed discovery of the meaning of a solicitation class
   keywords as outside of the scope of the basic ESMTP service
   extension.

   If that standard becomes widely deployed, a  mail message might
   contain a large number of solicitation class keywords.  The
   "No-Solicit:" header has keywords inserted by the sender of the
   message, which might include the sender's own keywords, as well as
   those mandated by regulatory authorities or recommended by voluntary
   industry associations.  Likewise, the "received:" trace fields might
   contain a large number of keywords produced by message transfer
   agents (MTAs), filtering software, forwarding software in the message
   user agent (MUA), or any other system in the chain of delivery.

   As the number of keywords employed grows, it will be important to
   find a method for discovering the meaning behind the various labels.
   This draft specifies such a mechanism using the DNS NAPTR Resource
   Record, which is defined in [RFC3403].  An explicit design goal is to
   keep the system as simple as possible.  Approaches such as defining
   an XML-based structure that would contain keyword meta-data or other
   approaches that define the format of the explanation were ruled out.
   Instead, the goal is to associate a solicitation class keyword with a
   URI, which in turn contains an explanation of the keyword.

2.  The No-Solicit NAPTR Application

   The DDDS framework of [RFC3401] and related documents provides a
   powerful set of mechanisms that can yield sophisticated applications
   such as ENUM.[RFC3761] There is a simplification of the DDDS
   framework called the Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) application
   [RFC3958].  Unfortunately, S-NAPTR does not permit the use of the "U"
   flag for terminal lookups and does not support the regular expression
   field of the NAPTR RR.  Since a replacement field in a NAPTR record
   must contain only a domain name, and our goal is to find a URI, this
   draft does not use the S-NAPTR mechanism.

   This draft uses the NAPTR RR to do a single lookup from solicitation
   class keyword to URI.  The fields of the NAPTR RR are used as

   follows:
   o  The "ORDER" and "PREFERENCE" fields are to be processed as
      specified in [RFC3403]: if multiple records are returned, the
      one(s) with the lowest "ORDER" value that have a matching
      "SERVICE" field MUST be used.  Of those with the lowest ORDER
      value, those with the lowest "PREFERENCE" SHOULD be used.
   o  The "FLAGS" field MUST contain the character "U".
   o  The "SERVICES" field MUST contain only the string "no-solicit".
   o  The "REGEXP" field MUST contain a valid URI as further specified
      in this section.
   o  The "REPLACEMENT" field MUST be empty.

   The "REGEXP" field is defined in [RFC3402] as consisting of a
   "delim-character", a POSIX Extended Regular Expression, another
   "delim-character", a replacement value, and a final
   "delim-character".  For this application the following rules apply:
   o  The "delim-character" MAY be any valid character as defined in
      section 3.2 of [RFC3402].
   o  The extended regular expression MUST be empty.
   o  The replacement value MUST contain a valid URI as specified in
      [RFC2396].
   o  The replacement value SHOULD contain a URI limited to the "ftp",
      "http", and "https" schemes as specified in [RFC2396] and
      [RFC2660].
   o  The document that is retrieved at the URI SHOULD conform to
      [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], including the Accessibility Guidelines
      contained therein.

3.  DDDS Application Specification

   The following definitions apply to this application:
   o  Application Unique String: The application unique string is a
      Solicitation Class Keyword as defined in [RFC3865].
   o  First Well Known Rule: The Solicitation Class Keyword is reversed
      in order to produce a valid domain name.  For example,
      "com.example.adv" would become "adv.example.com".
   o  Valid Databases: The DNS _is_ the database.
   o  Expected Output: A URI.
   o  The "SERVICE" field MUST contain the string "no-solicit", the
      "FLAGS" field MUST contain the string "U", the "REPLACEMENT" field
      MUST be empty, and the "REGEXP" field MUST be formatted as
      specified in Section 2.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There does not appear to be a central registry maintained by the IANA
   of values that might appear in a "SERVICE" field of a NAPTR resource
   record.  Thus, no direct IANA actions are required.



Malamud                   Expires July 31, 2005                 [Page 4]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit Discovery         January 2005


   However, the IANA does maintain an Application Service Tag Registry,
   which is used to support the S-NAPTR DDDS application defined in
   [RFC3958].  The IANA is advised that the "no-solicit" value for the
   SERVICE field is in use per this draft and thus should not be used in
   the Application Service Tag Registry for other applications.

5.  Security Considerations

   Use of a URI with the "https:" scheme without the use of DNSSEC makes
   an unwarranted illusion of authenticity and the possibility of active
   attacks a serious concern.
