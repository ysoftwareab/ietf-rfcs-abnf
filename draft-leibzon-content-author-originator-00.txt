Internet-Draft    Content-Author and Content-Originator         May 2005


1.  Introduction

   There has been an interest expressed by many for simple way to
   identify author of the MIME-encoded document at the time of
   transmission and to identify origin of the document transmission.

   Currently the way it is done is at the document level itself, which
   for some data types (such as word-processing documents) may have
   "owner" or "author" document description fields.  While this is
   sufficient for many of situations, it does and can not cover all the
   transmitted documents and many of those that are binary do not have
   document description fields.  Additionally author of the document,
   even if known, may not necessarily be the person or entity actually
   responsible for document transmission and such information is also
   very important and while for email there exist "Sender:" and "From:"
   headers in the email message itself, neither one of those are
   reliable way to do it for specific included document (in some cases
   "From" and "Sender" are changed in transmission and some documents
   when arrived may also include MIME parts added by different systems).

   This document attempts to resolve the issue by defining two new
   header fields Content-Author and Content-Originator, that can be used
   together with other Content-* header fields when MIME-encoded
   document is generated and transmitted.  The relationship between
   these two fields is somewhat similar to that of "From:" and "Sender:"
   header fields in email (but the emphasis is on specific MIME-part)
   with "Content-Author" specifying person or entity who actually
   created given MIME document and "Content-Originator" specifying the
   person or entity responsible for current transmission of that
   document.  The use of these fields is not limited to email and can
   easily apply to any protocol that is using MIME as way to encapsulate
   documents that are transmitted, such as HTTP.

Internet-Draft    Content-Author and Content-Originator         May 2005


2.  Content-Author Field

   The Content-Author MIME field is for identifying actual author(s) of
   the document, i.e. the person or persons or entity that created it.
   It is notable that document may have multiple authors and, as such,
   it should be possible to list multiple people or entities in this
   field.

   While this field SHOULD include contact information in the form of
   email address, it is understood that in some cases one or more
   authors of the document may not be using email and as such while the
   field's format is similar to that of "From" header (which also has to
   allow for listing multiple persons), the inclusion of email address
   in it is optional.

   The ABNF [RFC2234] syntax of the "Content-Author" field is as
   follows:

   Content-Author     =      "Content-Author:" nameaddr-list CRLF

   nameaddr-list      =      (name-optaddr * ("," nameaddr))

   nameaddr           =      name-optaddr / addr-spec / angle-addr

   name-optaddr       =      display-name [angle-addr]

   angle-addr         =      [CFWS] "<" addr-spec ">" [CFWS]

   display-name       =      phrase

   addr-spec          =      local-part "@" domain

   phrase             =      1*word
   The structures not defined above - word, local-part, domain, CRLF,
   CFWS - are all defined in [RFC2822].

   When document is being encoded in MIME for transmission, the sender
   system should add Content-Author header only if the author can be
   reliably determined, such as if this information is encoded as part
   of document format or if it is available as part of filesystem
   parameter (it is clearly the author and not just owner of the file).
   In cases of automatically generated data, the Content-Owner is person
   or entity that configured such behavior and controls the system that
   generates this data, for mail list this would be mail list owner.

   When the MIME-encoded document is further retransmitted (such as when
   it is forwarded in email) and there has not been any modification to
   the document itself (i.e. data portion of the MIME part remains the

   same), then Content-Author header field MUST remain the same.

   It should be understand that, for receiving system, Content-Owner
   field does not override any author information that is encoded in the
   document itself.  As such, if receiving system is able to work with
   document specific type and able to extract author information from
   the document data.  But if no authorship information is available in
   document data or if the data format type is not supported, then
   Content-Owner MIME field can used for identifying or displaying name
   of the content author to users.

   A special note must be made as to that author of the document is not
   necessarily a document content copyright owner.

3.  Content-Originator Field

   Content-Originator MIME field should be used to identify person or
   entity responsible for inclusion of the MIME content in the current
   transmission.  Because this person or entity are by their very role
   participating in the Internet, they are expected to have an email
   address, and as such and unlike Content-Author, the Content-
   Originator field MUST always include valid email address.

   This all makes it quite close to "Sender:" field of an email message,
   with Content-Originator having similar role, but for specific MIME-
   part.  However, unlike relationship between "Sender:" and "From:"
   fields of email message header, the Content-Originator field is not
   as closely tied to Content-Author and if Content-Originator field is
   not present, but Content-Author field is, it MUST NOT be assumed that
   Content-Author is the party responsible for MIME content inclusion in
   the transmission.

   The ABNF of the "Content-Originator" field is as follows:

   Content-Originator =      "Content-Originator:" mailaddr CRLF

   mailaddr           =      optname-addr / addr-spec

   optname-addr       =      [display-name] angle-addr

   angle-addr         =      [CFWS] "<" addr-spec ">" [CFWS]

   display-name       =      phrase

   addr-spec          =      local-part "@" domain

   phrase             =      1*word


   The structures not defined above - word, local-part, domain, CRLF,
   CFWS - are all defined in [RFC2822] and in fact entire "Content-
   Originator:" is equivalent to its "Sender:" field ABNF definition.

   In email in the absence of Content-Originator field for specific MIME
   part, the name and address from Sender header field of an email
   message MAY be used in its place.

4.  Examples

   In several examples below a downloaded media file is being sent and
   further retransmitted to multiple recipients.  For purposes of these
   examples, please assume that the media file has a copyright and
   license that allows for unlimited distribution to the public.

   All names of organizations, groups and persons in the below examples
   are fictional.

4.1  File downloaded fom HTTP site

   On the website bestmp3.example.com a user John finds a new mp3 song
   he particularly likes.  The website has database of authors of all
   songs and list this song as being the work of "The Obscure Wave Band"
   and when John asks to download the HTTP server adds "Content-Author"
   header to indicate that.

   The HTTP response to download the song may look like:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Mon May  2 15:15:21 PDT 2005
   Server: Apache/1.3.6 (Unix)
   Last-Modified: Mon May  1 04:20:58 PDT 2005
   Accept-Ranges: bytes
   Content-length: 2031
   Connection: close
   Content-type: audio/mp3
   Content-Author: "The Obscure Wave Band"
   Content-Originator: "Best Mp3 Song Collection"
     <collection@bestmp3.example.com>

   ...mp3 file data follows here...

4.2  Email Message with Content from Multiple Authors

   John now wishes to share the song from "The Obscure Wave Band" with
   his friend Nancy and includes it as an attachment in his email.  Note
   that while John is the author of the actual message text, he's not
   the author of the song itself so the email message consists of
   multiple mime parts with different Content-Author.  For Content-
   Originator but the same Content-Originator (John).

   Top of the email message from John when it is being submitted for
   transmission to Nancy might look something like:

   From: "John" <john@example.net>
   To: "Nancy" <nancy@example.net>
   Subject: Check out this cool song I just found!

   This message is in MIME format. The first part should be
   readable text, while the remaining parts are likely
   unreadable without MIME-aware tools.

   ...mp3 file data follows here...

4.3  Forwarded Email Message

   As you saw from previous example, word-of-mouth about new song can
   spread quickly even with individually transmitted emails, but it
   would not spread nearly as fast if it was not for discussion groups,
   mail lists and other public forums.  As Nancy participates in popular
   music discussion list "musifans" run by "The Yippee Forums", she
   quickly forwards the new song to that forum.

   Since this is a forwarded email, it is a new transmission and
   Content-Originator field is reset, however Content-Author field
   remains the same for MIME parts from John's original email.

4.4  Email Message Sent by Mail List

   While "Yippee Forums'" are free, it would be difficult to maintain
   such service if it was not for commercial sponsors.  And when email
   from Nancy , reaches the "Yippee Forums" server, it adds a new footer
   to the message as well as advertisement from the mail list sponsor.

   Note that the message being transmitted to subscribers by the Yippee
   Forum still has the same Message-Id as when it was sent to musifans
   list by Nancy and as such it is still the same transmission and
   Content-Originator does not change for existing MIME parts that had
   been sent to the list server (but MIME parts that are added by Yippee
   Forum's mail list server do have it listed as Content-Originator for
   those parts).

6.  Security Considerations

   It is possible for transmitter to have entered incorrect information
   into Content-Author or Content-Originator fields (either on purpose
   to name somebody else as an Author or Originator or just as an error)
   as there is no security features associated with quality of data in
   these fields.  This may cause users to send reports and questions to
   incorrect place and to in case of unwanted content may cause them to
   blame people listed as Content-Originator or Content-Author for such
   a content eventhough they may not have had anything to do with it.
