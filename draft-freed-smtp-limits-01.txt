                   The LIMITS SMTP Service Extension
                       draft-freed-smtp-limits-01

Abstract

   This document defines a "Limits" extension for the Simple Mail
   Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and an associated limit registry.  This
   extension provides the means for an SMTP server to inform the SMTP
   client of limits the server intends to apply to the protocol during
   the current SMTP session.  The client is then able adapt its behavior
   in order to conform to those limits.

1.  Introduction

   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP] provides the ability to
   transfer multiple email messages from one host to another, each with
   multiple recipients, using a single or multiple connections.

   In order to conserve resources as well as protect themselves from
   malicious clients, it is necessary for servers to enforce limits on
   various aspects of the protocol, e.g., a limit on the number of
   recipients that can be specified in a single transaction.

   Additionally, servers may also wish to alter the limits they apply
   depending on their assessment of the reputation of a particular
   client.

   The variability of the limits that may be in effect creates a
   situation where clients may inadvertently exceed a particular
   server's limits, causing servers to respond with temporary (or in
   some cases, permanent) errors.  This in turn can lead to delays or
   even failures in message transfer.

   SMTP servers have always been able to announce a limit, in a reply,
   which means that the client first needed to issue a command.  The
   mechanism specified here avoids the overhead of that interactions, by
   announcing limits prior to any substantive interaction.

   The "Limits" extension provides the means for a server to inform a
   client about specific limits in effect for a particular SMTP session.
   This information, combined with the inherent flexibility of SMTP,
   makes it possible for clients to avoid server errors and the problems
   they cause.

   Limits are registered with the IANA.  Each registration includes the
   limit name, value syntax, and a description of its semantics.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [KEYWORDS].

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF]
   notation and its core rules to define the formal syntax of the
   "Limits" extension.

   This specification makes extensive use of the terminology specified
   and used in [SMTP].

3.  The "Limits" SMTP Extension

   Extensions to SMTP are defined in Section 2.2 of [SMTP].

   The name of the extension is "Limits".  Servers implementing this
   extension advertise an additional "LIMITS" EHLO keyword.  The
   associated parameter is used by the server to communicate one or more
   limits, each with an optional value, to the client.  The syntax of
   the parameter is:

     limits-param = limit-name-value [SP limit-name-value]
     limit-name-value = limit-name ["=" limit-value]
     limit-name = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
     limit-value = 1*(%x21-3A / %x3C-7E) ; Any VCHAR except ";"


   This extension introduces no new SMTP commands, and does not alter
   any existing command.  However, it is possible for a LIMITS parameter
   to be associated with another SMTP extension that does these things.

3.1.  Limits

   In order to achieve consistent behavior, all limits MUST be
   registered with the IANA, as described below.

3.2.  Limit Naming Conventions

   Limit names MUST be comprehensible, but also should be kept as short
   as possible.  The use of commonly understood abbreviation, e.g.,
   "MAX" for "maximum", is encouraged.

   When a limit is associated with a particular SMTP, its name SHOULD
   begin with the name of that command.

   Limit names SHOULD end with one or more terms that describe the type
   of limit.

3.3.  Interaction With Pipelining

   The SMTP "Pipelining" extension [PIPELINING] is commonly used to
   improve SMTP performance, especially over high latency connections.
   Pipelining allows entire transaction to be sent without checking
   responses and in some cases it may be possible to send multiple
   transactions.

Internet-Draft              LIMITS Extension                  March 2021


   The use of pipelining affects limits in an important way: Since a
   pipelining client cannot check intermediate command responses without
   stalling the pipeline, it cannot count the number of succesful versus
   failed responses and adjust its behavior accordingly.  Limit
   designers need to take this into account.

   For example, it may seem like it would be better to impose a limit on
   the number of succesful RCPT TO commands as opposed to the way the
   RCPTMAX limit is specified in Section 4.2 below.  But counting the
   total number of RCPT TOs is simple, whereas counting the number of
   successful RCPT TO stalls the pipeline.

3.4.  Varying Limits

   This extension provides an announcement as part of the reply to an
   EHLO command.  Some servers vary their limits, as a session
   progresses, based on their obtaining more information.  This
   extension does not cover in-session limitation changes.

3.5.  Interaction With SMTP Minimums

   Section 4.5.3.1 of [SMTP] specifies minimum values for various server
   sizes, limits, and timeouts, e.g., servers must accept a minimum of
   100 RCPT TO commands (section 4.5.3.1.8).  Unfortunately, the reality
   is that servers routinely impose smaller limits than what SMTP
   requires, and when this is done it's especially important for clients
   to be aware that this is happening.

   For this reason there is no requirement that the limits advertised by
   this extension comply with the minimums imposed by SMTP.

3.6.  Multiple EHLO Commands

   SMTP requires that EHLO command be reissued Under certain
   circumstances, e.g., after successful authentication [AUTH] or
   negotiation of a security layer [STARTTLS].

   Servers MAY update their limits any time the protocol requires
   clients to reissue the EHLO command.  Clients MUST discard any
   previous limits in favor of those provided by the most recent EHLO.
   This includes the case where the original EHLO provided a set of
   limits but the subsequent EHLO did not; in this case the client MUST
   act as if no limits were communicated.

4.  Initial Limits

   An initial set of limits are specified in the following sections.

4.1.  MAILMAX Limit

   Name: MAILMAX

   Value syntax: %x30-39 0*5DIGIT ; 0 not allowed, 6 digit maximum

   Description: RCPTMAX specifies the maximum number of transactions
   (MAIL FROM commands) the SMTP will accept in a single session.  The
   count includes all MAIL FROM commands, regardless of whether they
   succeed or fail.

   Security Considerations: See Section 5

4.2.  RCPTMAX Limit

   Name: RCPTMAX

   Value syntax: %x30-39 0*5DIGIT ; 0 not allowed, 6 digit maximum

   Description: RCPTMAX specifies the maximum number of RCPT TO commands
   the SMTP will accept in a single transaction.  It is not a limit on
   the actual number of recipients the message ends up being sent to; a
   single RCPT TO command may produce multiple recipients or, in the
   event of an error, none.

   Security Considerations: See Section 5

4.3.  RCPTDOMAINMAX Limit

   Name: RCPTDOMAINMAX

   Value syntax: %x30-39 0*5DIGIT ; 0 not allowed, 6 digit maximum

   Description: RCPTMAX specifies the maximum number of different
   domains that can appear in a recipient (RCPT TO) address within a
   single SMTP session.  This limit is imposed by some servers that bind
   to a specific internal delivery mechanism on receipt of the first
   RCPT TO command.

   Security Considerations: See Section 5

5.  Security Considerations

   A malicious server can use limits to overly constrain client
   behavior, causing excessive use of client resources.

   A malicious client may use the limits a server advertises to optimize
   the delivery of unwanted messages.

   A man-in-the-middle attack on unprotected SMTP connections can be
   used to cause clients to misbehave, which in turn could result in
   delivery delays or failures.  Loss of reputation for the client could
   also occur.

   All that said, decades of operational experience with the SMTP "SIZE"
   extension [SIZE], which provides servers with the ability to indicate
   message size, indicates that such abuse is rare and unlikely to be a
   significant problem.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  SMTP Service Extension Registry

   The IANA is requested to add "LIMITS" to the SMTP Service Extension
   Registry:

   Keywords: LIMITS
   Description: Server limits
   Reference: [RFCxxxx]


6.2.  SMTP Server Limits Registry

   The IANA is requested to create a new registry for SMTP server
   limits.  The policy for this registry is "Specification Required".
   Registry entries consist of three required values:

   1.  The name of the limit

   2.  The syntax of the limit value, if the limit has one.  Use of
       [ABNF] is preferred but not required.

   3.  A description of the limit's semantics

   4.  Security considerations for the limit

   The IANA is also requested to register the limits specified in this
   document.
