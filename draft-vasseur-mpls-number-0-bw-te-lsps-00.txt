   unconstrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(s) (TE LSP).

1.  Introduction

   Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS (see
   [ISIS-TE] and [OSPF-TE]) in the context of MPLS Traffic Engineering
   in order to advertise various link characteristics such as the
   available bandwidth, traffic enginering metric, adminstrative group
   and so on.  There are various circumstances where it would be useful
   to also know the number of unconstrained Traffic Engineering Label
   Switch Path(s) (TE LSP).

   It is not uncommon to deploy MPLS Traffic Engineering for the sake of
   fast recovery with MPLS TE Fast Reroute (see [FAST-REROUTE]).  In
   this case, a common deployment model consists of deploying a full
   mesh of unconstrained TE LSPs between a set of LSRs and protect these
   TE LSPs thanks to pre-established backup tunnels against link, SRLG
   and/or node failures.

   When a set of unconstrained TE LSPs is deployed, various algorithms
   can be designed so as efficiently load balance the traffic carried by
   such unconstrained TE LSPs provided that the number of unconstrained
   TE LSPs traversing each link in the network is known.  As currently
   defined in [OSPF-TE] and [ISIS-TE] the information related to the
   number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) is not available.  Note that the
   specification of load balancing algorithms is outside of the scope of
   this document and merely listed for the sake of illustration of the
   motivation for gathering such information.  Furthermore, the
   knowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across
   each link can be used for other purposes (e.g. management, ...).

   This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLV
   used to indicate the number of unconstrained TE LSP signalled across
   a specific link.


2.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document LSR: Label Switch Router.

   TE LSP: MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

   Backup tunnel: the TE LSP that is used to backup up one of the many
   TE LSPs in many-to-one backup (as defined in [FAST-REROUTE]).

   Unconstrained TE LSP: A TE LSP signalled with a bandwidth requirement
   equal to 0.

3.  Protocol extensions

   A new Sub-TLV named NB-O-BW-LSP is defined that specifies the number
   of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.

3.1.  ISIS

   The NB-0-BW-LSP TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST appear at most once within
   the extended IS reachability TLV (type 22) specified in [ISIS-TE].
   The NB-0-BW-LSP consists of:

   Type (1 octet): To be assigned by IANA (Recommended value = 19)

   Length (1 octet): 4

   Value (4 octets): field value that comprises the number of
   unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across the link.

3.2.  OSPF

   The NB-0-BW-LSP is OPTIONAL and MUST appear at most once within the
   Link TLV (Type 2) that is itself carried within the Traffic
   Engineering LSA specified in [OSPF-TE].  The NB-0-BW-LSP consists of:

   Type (2 octets): To be assigned by IANA (Recommended value = 19)

   Length (2 octets): 4

   Value (4 octets): field value that comprises the number of
   unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across the link.


4.  Elements of procedure

   An implementation may decide to implement a dual-thresholds mechanism
   so as to trigger the origination of an updated OSPF LSA or ISIS LSP.
   Similalry to other MPLS Traffic Engineering link characteristics,
   LSA/LSP origination trigger mechanisms are outside of the scope of
   this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will assign a new code point for the newly defined ISIS sub-TLV
   (NB-0-BW-LSP) carried within the TLV 22 (suggested value =19)

   IANA will assign a new code point for the newly defined OSPF sub-TLV
   (NB-0-BW-LSP) carried within the Link TLV (Type 2) of the Traffic

   Engineering LSA (suggested value=19).


6.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS and OSPF.
