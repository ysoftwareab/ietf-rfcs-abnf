Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


1.  Introduction

   As the deployment of IEEE 802.16 access networks progresses, users
   will be connected to IPv6 networks.  While the IEEE 802.16 standard
   defines the encapsulation of an IPv4/IPv6 datagram in an IEEE 802.16
   MAC payload, a complete description of IPv4/IPv6 operation and
   deployment is not present.  The IEEE 802.16 standards are limited to
   L1 and L2, so they may be used within any number of IP network
   architectures and scenarios.  In this document, we will discuss main
   components of IPv6 IEEE 802.16 access networks and their differences
   from IPv4 IEEE 802.16 networks and how IPv6 is deployed and
   integrated in each of the IEEE 802.16 technologies.

   This document extends the work of [RFC4779] and follows the structure
   and common terminology of that document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The IEEE 802.16 related terminologies in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [I-D.ietf-16ng-ps-goals].
   o  Subscriber Station (SS): An end-user equipment that provides
      connectivity to the 802.16 networks.  It can be either fixed/
      nomadic or mobile equipment.  In mobile environment, SS represents
      the Mobile Subscriber Station (MS) introduced in [IEEE802.16e].
   o  Base Station (BS): A generalized equipment set providing
      connectivity, management, and control between the subscriber
      station and the 802.16 networks.
   o  Access Router (AR): An entity that performs an IP routing function
      to provide IP connectivity for subscriber station (SS or MS).
   o  Connection Identifier (CID): A 16-bit value that identifies a
      connection to equivalent peers in the 802.16 MAC of the SS(MS) and
      BS.
   o  Ethernet CS (Convergence Sublayer): 802.3/Ethernet CS specific
      part of the Packet CS defined in 802.16 STD.
   o  IPv6 CS (Convergence Sublayer): IPv6 specific subpart of the
      Packet CS, Classifier 2 (Packet, IPv6) defined in 802.16 STD.


2.  Deploying IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks

2.1.  Elements of IEEE 802.16 Networks

   [IEEE 802.16e] is an air interface for fixed and mobile broadband
   wireless access systems.  [IEEE 802.16] only specifies the
   convergence sublayers and the ability to transport IP over the air
   interface.  The details of IPv6 (and IPv4) operations over IEEE
   802.16 are defined in the 16ng WG.  The IPv6 over IPCS definition is
   already an approved specification [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs].

   IP over Ethernet CS in IEEE 802.16 is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802.16].

   deployments.

2.2.  Scenarios and IPv6 Deployment

   [IEEE802.16] specifies two modes for sharing the wireless medium:
   point-to-multipoint (PMP) and mesh (optional).  This document only
   focuses on the PMP mode.

   Some of the factors that hinder deployment of native IPv6 core
   protocols are already introduced by [I-D.ietf-16ng-ps-goals].

   There are two different deployment scenarios: fixed and mobile access
   deployment scenarios.  A fixed access scenario substitutes for
   existing wired-based access technologies such as digital subscriber
   lines (xDSL) and cable networks.  This fixed access scenario can
   provide nomadic access within the radio coverages, which is called
   Hot-zone model.  A mobile access scenario exists for the new paradigm
   of transmitting voice, data and video over mobile networks.  This
   scenario can provide high speed data rates equivalent to the wire-
   based Internet as well as mobility functions equivalent to cellular
   systems.  There are the different IPv6 impacts on convergence
   sublayer type, link model, addressing, mobility, etc. between fixed
   and mobile access deployment scenarios.  The details will be
   discussed below.  The mobile access scenario can be classified into
   two different IPv6 link models: shared IPv6 prefix link model and
   point-to-point link model.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


2.2.1.  Mobile Access Deployment Scenarios

   Unlike IEEE 802.11, the IEEE 802.16 BS can provide mobility functions
   and fixed communications.  [IEEE802.16e] has been standardized to
   provide mobility features on IEEE 802.16 environments.  IEEE 802.16
   BS might be deployed with a proprietary backend managed by an
   operator.

   There are two possible IPv6 link models for mobile access deployment
   scenarios: shared IPv6 prefix link model and point-to-point link
   model [RFC4968].  There is always a default access router in the
   scenarios.  There can exist multiple hosts behind an MS (networks
   behind an MS may exist).  The mobile access deployment models, Mobile
   WiMax and WiBro, fall within this deployment model.

   (1) Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   This link model represents the IEEE 802.16 mobile access network
   deployment where a subnet consists of only single AR interfaces and
   multiple MSs.  Therefore, all MSs and corresponding AR interfaces
   share the same IPv6 prefix as shown in Figure 2.  The IPv6 prefix
   will be different from the interface of the AR.

     | MS4 |<-(16)-+
     +-----+

                  Figure 2: Shared IPv6 Prefix Link Model

   (2) Point-to-Point Link Model

   This link model represents IEEE 802.16 mobile access network
   deployments where a subnet consists of only single AR, BS and MS.
   That is, each connection to a mobile node is treated as a single
   link.  Each link between the MS and the AR is allocated a separate,
   unique prefix or unique set of prefixes by the AR.  The point-to-
   point link model follows the recommendations of [RFC3314].

                    Figure 3: Point-to-Point Link Model

2.2.1.1.  IPv6 Related Infrastructure Changes

   IPv6 will be deployed in this scenario by upgrading the following
   devices to dual-stack: MS, AR and ER.  In this scenario, IEEE 802.16
   BSs have only MAC and PHY layers without router functionality and
   operate as a bridge.  The BS should support IPv6 classifiers as
   specified in [IEEE802.16].

2.2.1.2.  Addressing

   An IPv6 MS has two possible options to get an IPv6 address.  These
   options will be equally applied to the other scenario below (Section
   2.2.2).

   (1) An IPv6 MS can get the IPv6 address from an access router using
   stateless auto-configuration.  In this case, router discovery and DAD
   operation should be properly operated over an IEEE 802.16 link.

   (2) An IPv6 MS can use DHCPv6 to get an IPv6 address from the DHCPv6
   server.  In this case, the DHCPv6 server would be located in the
   service provider core network and the AR should provide a DHCPv6
   relay agent.  This option is similar to what we do today in case of
   DHCPv4.

   In this scenario, a router and multiple BSs form an IPv6 subnet and a
   single prefix is allocated to all the attached MSs.  All MSs attached
   to same AR can be on the same IPv6 link.

   As for the prefix assignment, in case of the shared IPv6 prefix link
   model, one or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link and hence
   shared by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  In the point-
   to-point link model, the AR assigns a unique prefix or a set of



Shin, Ed., et al.         Expires July 31, 2008                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


   unique prefixes for each MS.  Prefix delegation can be required if
   networks exist behind an MS.

2.2.1.3.  IPv6 Transport

   In an IPv6 subnet, there are always two underlying links: one is the
   IEEE 802.16 wireless link between the MS and BS, and the other is a
   wired link between the BS and AR.

   IPv6 packets can be sent and received via the IP specific part of the
   packet convergence sublayer.  The Packet CS is used for the transport
   of packet based protocols which include Ethernet and Internet
   Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6).  Note that in this scenario IPv6 CS may be
   more appropriate than Ethernet CS to transport IPv6 packets, since
   there is some overhead of Ethernet CS (e.g., Ethernet header) under
   mobile access environments.  However, when PHS (Payload Header
   Suppression) is deployed it mitigates this overhead through the
   compression of packet headers.  The details of IPv6 operations over
   the IP specific part of the packet CS defined in
   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs].

   Simple or complex network equipment may constitute the underlying
   wired network between the AR and the ER.  If the IP-aware equipment
   between the AR and the ER does not support IPv6, the service
   providers can deploy IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms to transport
   IPv6 packets between the AR and the ER.

   The service providers are deploying tunneling mechanisms to transport
   IPv6 over their existing IPv4 networks as well as deploying native
   IPv6 where possible.  Native IPv6 should be preferred over tunneling
   mechanisms as native IPv6 deployment options might be more scalable
   and provide the required service performance.  Tunneling mechanisms
   should only be used when native IPv6 deployment is not an option.
   This can be equally applied to other scenarios below (Section 2.2.2).

2.2.1.4.  Routing

   In general, the MS is configured with a default route that points to
   the AR.  Therefore, no routing protocols are needed on the MS.  The
   MS just sends to the AR using the default route.

   The AR can configure multiple links to ER for network reliability.
   The AR should support IPv6 routing protocols such as OSPFv3 [RFC2740]
   or IS-IS for IPv6 when connected to the ER with multiple links.

   The ER runs the IGP such as OSPFv3 or IS-IS for IPv6 in the service
   provider network.  The routing information of the ER can be
   redistributed to the AR.  Prefix summarization should be done at the

   ER.

2.2.1.5.  Mobility

   There are two types of handovers for the IEEE 802.16e networks: link
   layer handover and IP layer handover.  In a link layer handover, BSs
   involved in the handover reside in the same IP subnet.  A MS only
   needs to re-establish a link layer connection with a new BS without
   changing its IP configuration, such as its IP address, default
   router, on-link prefix, etc.  The link layer handover in IEEE 802.16e
   is by nature a hard handover since the MS has to cut off the
   connection with the current BS at the beginning of the handover
   process and cannot resume communication with the new BS until the
   handover completes [IEEE802.16e].  In an IP layer handover, the BSs
   involved reside in different IP subnets, or in different networks.
   Thus, in an IP layer handover, a MS needs to establish both a new
   link layer connection, as in a link layer handover, and a new IP
   configuration to maintain connectivity.

   IP layer handover for MSs is handled by Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].
   Mobile IPv6 defines that movement detection uses Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection to detect when the default router is no
   longer bidirectionally reachable, in which case the mobile node must
   discover a new default router.  Periodic Router Advertisements for
   reachability and movement detection may be unnecessary because the
   IEEE 802.16 MAC provides the reachability by its ranging procedure
   and the movement detection by the Handoff procedure.

   Mobile IPv6 alone will not solve the handover latency problem for the
   IEEE 802.16e networks.  To reduce or eliminate packet loss and to
   reduce the handover delay in Mobile IPv6, therefore, Fast Handover
   for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [RFC4068] can be deployed together with
   MIPv6.  To perform predictive packet forwarding, the FMIPv6's IP
   layer assumes the presence of handover-related triggers delivered by
   the IEEE 802.16 MAC layers.  Thus, there is a need for cross-layering
   design to support proper behavior of the FMIPv6 solution.  This issue
   is also being discussed in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fh80216e].

   Also, [IEEE802.16g] defines L2 triggers for link status such as
   link-up, link-down, handoff-start.  These L2 triggers may make the
   Mobile IPv6 or FMIPv6 procedure more efficient and faster.

2.2.2.  Fixed/Nomadic Deployment Scenarios

   The IEEE 802.16 access networks can provide plain Ethernet end-to-end
   connectivity.  This scenario represents deployment model using
   Ethernet CS.  Wireless DSL deployment model is an example of a fixed/
   nomadic IPv6 deployment of IEEE 802.16.  Many wireless Internet

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


   service providers (Wireless ISPs) have planned to use IEEE 802.16 for
   the purpose of high quality broadband wireless services.  A company
   can use IEEE 802.16 to build up a mobile office.  Wireless Internet
   spreading through a campus or a cafe can be also implemented with it.

    This network

                Figure 4: Fixed/Nomadic Deployment Scenario

   This scenario also represents IEEE 802.16 network deployment where a
   subnet consists of multiple MSs and multiple interfaces of the
   multiple BSs.  Multiple access routers can exist.  There exist
   multiple hosts behind an SS (networks behind an SS may exist).  When
   802.16 access networks are widely deployed as in a WLAN, this case
   should be also considered.  The Hot-zone deployment model falls
   within this case.

   While Figure 4 illustrates a generic deployment scenario, the
   following Figure 5 shows in more detail how an existing DSL ISP would

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


   In this approach the 802.16 BS is acting as a DSLAM (Digital
   Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).  On the network side, the BS is
   connected to an Ethernet bridge which can be separate equipment or
   integrated into the BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server).

2.2.2.1.  IPv6 Related Infrastructure Changes

   IPv6 will be deployed in this scenario by upgrading the following
   devices to dual-stack: MS, AR, ER, and the Ethernet Bridge.  The BS
   should support IPv6 classifiers as specified in [IEEE802.16].

   The BRAS in Figure 5 is providing the functionality of the AR.  An
   Ethernet bridge is necessary for protecting the BRAS from 802.16 link
   layer peculiarities.  The Ethernet bridge relays all traffic received
   through the BS to its network side port(s) connected to the BRAS.
   Any traffic received from the BRAS is relayed to the appropriate BS.
   Since the 802.16 MAC layer has no native support for multicast (and
   broadcast) in the uplink direction, the Ethernet bridge will
   implement multicast (and broadcast) by relaying the multicast frame
   received from the MS to all of its ports.  The Ethernet bridge may
   also provide some IPv6 specific functions to increase link efficiency
   of the 802.16 radio link (see Section 2.2.2.3).

2.2.2.2.  Addressing

   One or more IPv6 prefixes can be shared to all the attached MSs.
   Prefix delegation can be required if networks exist behind the SS.

2.2.2.3.  IPv6 Transport

   Transmisson of IPv6 over Ethernet CS follows [RFC2464] and does not
   introduce any changes to [RFC4861] and [RFC4862].  However, there are
   a few considerations in the viewpoint of operation, such as
   preventing periodic router advertisement messages from an access
   router and broadcast transmission, deciding path MTU size, and so on.
   The details about the considerations are described in
   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802.16].

2.2.2.4.  Routing

   In this scenario, IPv6 multi-homing considerations exist.  For
   example, if there exist two routers to support MSs, a default router
   must be selected.

   The Edge Router runs the IGP used in the SP network such as OSPFv3
   [RFC2740] or IS-IS for IPv6.  The connected prefixes have to be
   redistributed.  Prefix summarization should be done at the Edge
   Router.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


2.2.2.5.  Mobility

   No mobility functions of Layer 2 and Layer 3 are supported in the
   fixed access scenario.  Like WLAN technology, however, nomadicity can
   be supported in the radio coverage without any mobility protocol.
   So, a user can access Internet nomadically in the coverage.

   Sometime, service users can demand IP session continuity or home
   address reusability even in the nomadic environment.  In case of
   that, Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] may be used in this scenario even in the
   absence of Layer 2's mobility support.

2.3.  IPv6 Multicast

   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802.16] realizes IPv6 multicast
   support by IGMP/MLD proxying [RFC4605] and IGMP/MLD snooping
   [RFC4541].  Additionally, it may be possible to efficiently implement
   multicast packet transmission among the multicast subscribers by
   means of IEEE 802.16 Multicast CIDs.  However, such a protocol is not
   yet available and under development in WiMAX Forum.

2.4.  IPv6 QoS

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, a connection is unidirectional and has a QoS
   specification.  Each connection is associated with a single data
   service flow and each service flow is associated with a set of QoS
   parameters in [IEEE802.16].  The QoS related parameters are managed
   using the Dynamic Service Addition (DSA) and Dynamic Service Change
   (DSC) MAC management messages that specified in [IEEE802.16].  The
   [IEEE802.16] provides QoS differentiation for the different types of
   applications by five scheduling service.  Four scheduling services
   are defined in 802.16 such as Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), real-
   time Polling Service (rtPS), non-real-time Polling Service (nrtPS)
   and Best Effort (BE).  A fifth scheduling service is Extended Real-
   time Polling Service (ertPS) that is defined in [IEEE802.16e].  It is
   required to provide IP layer quality of service mapping to MAC layer
   QoS types [IEEE802.16], [IEEE802.16e].

2.5.  IPv6 Security

   When initiating the connection, an MS is authenticated by the AAA
   server located at its service provider network.  To achieve that, the
   MS and the BS use Privacy Key Management [IEEE802.16],[IEEE802.16e],
   while the BS communicates with the AAA server using a AAA protocol.
   Once the MS is authenticated with the AAA server, it can associate
   successfully with the BS and acquire an IPv6 address through
   stateless autoconfiguration or DHCPv6.  Note that the initiation and
   authentication process is the same as the one used in IPv4.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Scenarios        January 2008


2.6.  IPv6 Network Management

   [IEEE802.16f] includes the management information base for IEEE
   802.16 networks.  For IPv6 network management, the necessary
   instrumentation (such as MIBs, NetFlow Records, etc) should be
   available.

   Upon entering the network, an MS is assigned three management
   connections in each direction.  These three connections reflect the
   three different QoS requirements used by different management levels.
   The first of these is the basic connection, which is used for the
   transfer of short, time-critical MAC management messages and radio
   link control (RLC) messages.  The primary management connection is
   used to transfer longer, more delay-tolerant messages such as those
   used for authentication and connection setup.  The secondary
   management connection is used for the transfer of standards-based
   management messages such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).

   IPv6 based IEEE 802.16 networks can be managed by IPv4 or IPv6 when
   network elements are implemented dual stack.  For example, network
   management systems (NMS) can send SNMP messages by IPv4 with IPv6
   related object identifiers.  Also, an NMS can use IPv6 for SNMP
   requests and responses including IPv4 related OID.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no action by IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a detailed description of various IPv6
   deployment scenarios and link models for IEEE 802.16 based networks,
   and as such does not introduce any new security threats.  No matter
   what the scenario applied is, the networks should employ the same
   link-layer security mechanisms defined in [IEEE802.16e] and IPv6
   transition security considerations defined in [RFC4942].  However, as
   already described in [RFC4968], a shared prefix model based mobile
   access deployment scenario may security implications for protocols
   that are designed to work within the scope.  This is the concern for
   a shared prefix link model wherein private resources cannot be put
   onto a public 802.16 based networks.  This may restrict the usage of
   a shared prefix model to enterprise environments.
