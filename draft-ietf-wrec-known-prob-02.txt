Abstract

   This memo catalogs a number of known problems with World Wide Web
   (caching) proxies and cache servers. The goal of the document is to
   provide a discussion of the problems and proposed workarounds, and
   ultimately to improve conditions by illustrating problems. The
   construction of this document is a joint effort of the web caching
   community. It is being done under the auspices of the IETF Web
   Replication and Caching working group. We gratefully acknowledge
   RFC2525[1], which helped define the initial format for this known
   problems list.

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


1. Introduction

   This memo discusses problems with both proxies, which act as
   application-level intermediaries for Web requests, and caching
   proxies which additionally hold copies of previously requested
   resources in the hope of improving overall quality of service by
   serving the content more locally. Commonly used terminology in this
   memo can be found in the companion document "Internet Web
   Replication and Caching Taxonomy"[2].

   No individual or organization has complete knowledge of the known
   problems in web caching. If you know of a problem that is not
   documented on this list you are encouraged to send it to the WREC
   mailing list, <wrec@cs.utk.edu> for discussion or to the memo's
   editors, <jad@akamai.com> & <ian.cooper@mirror-image.com>, for
   review and inclusion in the list.

     Description:     describes the problem succinctly
     Significance:    magnitude of problem, environments where it exists
     Implications:    the impact of the problem on systems and networks
     See Also:        a reference to a related known problem

   Name 
      A short, descriptive name (3-5 words) name associated with the
      problem.

   Classification 
      Problems are grouped into categories of similar problems for ease
      of reading of this memo. Choose the category that best describes
      the problem. The suggested categories include three general
      categories and several more specific categories. 

      *  Architecture: the fundamental design is incomplete, or
         incorrect

      *  Specification: the spec is ambiguous, incomplete, or incorrect.

      *  Implementation: the implementation of the spec is incorrect.

      *  Performance: perceived page response at the client is
         excessive; network bandwidth consumption is excessive; demand
         on origin or proxy servers exceed reasonable bounds.

      *  Administration: care and feeding of caches is or causes a
         problem.

      *  Security: privacy, integrity, or authentication concerns. This
         is the first draft of this memo. The classification structure
         is in revision. In the published drafts of the memo the
         classification structure should be fixed but may be revised
         from time to time.

2. Known Problems

   The remaining sections present the currently documented known
   problems. The problems are ordered by classification and
   significance. Issues with protocol  specification or architecture
   are first, followed by implementation issues. Issues of high
   significance are first, followed by lower significance.  A full list
   of the problems is available in the table of contents.

2.1 Architecture

2.1.1 Interception proxies break client cache directives

   Name 
      Interception proxies break client cache directives 

   Classification 
      Architecture 

   Description 
      HTTP[3] is designed for the user agent to be aware if it is
      connected to an origin server or to a proxy. User agents
      believing they are transacting with an origin server but which
      are really in a connection with an interception proxy may fail to
      send critical cache-control information they would have otherwise
      included in their request.

   Significance 
      High

   Implications 
      Clients may receive data that is not synchronized with the origin
      even when they request an end to end refresh because of the lack
      of inclusion of either a cache-control: no-cache or
      must-revalidate header. These headers have no impact on origin
      server behavior so may not be included by the browser if it
      believes it is connected to that resource. Other related data
      implications are possible as well. For instance data security may
      be compromised by the lack of inclusion of private or no-store
      clauses of the cache-control header under similar conditions.

   Indications 
      Easily detected by placing fresh (un-expired) content on a proxy
      while changing the authoritative copy and requesting an end to
      end reload of the data through a proxy in both interception and
      explicit modes.

   Solution(s) 
      Eliminate the need for interception proxies and IP spoofing which

      will return correct context awareness to the client.

   Workaround 
      Include relevant cache-control: directives in every request at
      the cost of increased bandwidth and CPU requirements.

2.1.2 Interception proxies prevent introduction of new HTTP methods

   Name 
      Interception proxies prevent introduction of new HTTP methods

   Classification 
      Architecture

   Description 
      A proxy that receives a request with a method unknown to it is
      required to generate an HTTP 501 Error as a response. HTTP
      methods are designed to be extensible so there may be
      applications deployed with initial support just for the user
      agent and origin server. An interception proxy that hijacks
      requests which include new methods destined for servers that have
      implemented those methods creates a de-facto firewall where none
      may be intended.

   Significance 
      Medium within interception proxy environments.

   Implications 
      Renders new compliant applications useless unless modifications
      are made to proxy software. Because new methods are not required
      to be globally standardized it is impossible to keep up to date
      in the general case.

   Solution(s) 
      Eliminate the need for interception proxies. A client receiving a
      501 in a traditional HTTP environment may either choose to repeat
      the request to the origin server directly, or perhaps be
      configured to use a different cache.

   Workaround 
      Level 5 switches (sometimes called Level 7 or application layer
      switches) can be used to keep HTTP traffic with unknown methods
      out of the proxy. However, these devices have heavy buffering
      responsibilities, still require TCP sequence number spoofing, and
      do not interact well with persistent connections.

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


      The HTTP/1.1 specification allows a proxy to switch over to
      tunnel mode when it receives a request with a method or HTTP
      version it does not understand how to handle.

2.1.3 Cannot specify multiple URIs for replicated resources

   Name 
      Cannot specify multiple URIs for replicated resources

   Classification 
      Architecture

   Description 
      There is no way to specify that multiple URIs may be used for a
      single resource, one for each replica of the resource. Similarly,
      there is no way to say that some set of proxies (each identified
      by a URI) may be used to resolve a URI.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      Forces users to understand the replication model and mechanism.
      Makes it difficult to create a replication framework without
      protocol support for replication and naming. 

   Indications 
      Inherent in HTTP 1.0, HTTP 1.1.

   Solution(s) 
      Architectural - protocol design is necessary.

   Workaround 
      Replication mechanisms force users to locate a replica or mirror
      site for replicated content.

2.1.4 Replica distance is unknown

   Name 
      Replica distance is unknown

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


      Architecture

   Description 
      There is no recommended way to find out which of several servers
      or proxies is closer either to the requesting client or to
      another machine, either geographically or in the network topology.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      Clients must guess which replica is closer to them when
      requesting a copy of a document that may be served from multiple
      locations. Users must know the set of servers that can serve a
      particular object. This in general is hard to determine and
      maintain. Users must understand network topology in order to
      choose the closest copy. Note that the closest copy is not always
      the one that will result in quickest service. A nearby but
      heavily loaded server may be slower than a more distant but
      lightly loaded server.

   Indications 
      Inherent in HTTP 1.0, HTTP 1.1.

   Solution(s) 
      Architectural - protocol work is necessary. This is a specific
      instance of a general problem in widely distributed systems. A
      general solution is unlikely, however a specific solution in the
      web context is possible.

   Workaround 
      Servers can (many do) provide location hints in a replica
      selection web page. Users choose one based upon their location.
      Users can learn which replica server gives them best performance.
      Note that the closest replica geographically is not necessarily
      the closest in terms of network topology. Expecting users to
      understand network topology is unreasonable.

      Proxy resource location

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


   Description 
      There is no way to tell a proxy that it may request a resource
      from an alternate location;  the receiver may need to check the
      authenticity of the resource if redirected.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      Proxies have no systematic way to locate resources within other
      proxies or origin servers. This makes it more difficult to share
      information among proxies. Information sharing would improve
      global efficiency.

   Indications 
      Inherent in HTTP 1.0, HTTP 1.1.

   Solution(s) 
      Architectural - protocol design is necessary.

   Workaround 
      Certain proxies share location hints in the form of summary
      digests of their contents (e.g., Squid). Certain proxy protocols
      enable a proxy query another for its contents (e.g., ICP). (See
      however "ICP Performance" issue.)

2.1.6 Caching proxy peer selection in heterogeneous networks

   Name 
      Caching proxy peer selection in heterogeneous networks

   Classification 
      Architecture

   Description 
      Caching proxy peer selection in networks with large variance in
      latency and bandwidth between peers can lead to non-optimal peer
      selection. For example take Proxy C with two siblings, Sib1 and
      Sib2, and the following network topology (summarized).

      *  Cache C's link to Sib1, 2 Mbit/sec with 300 msec latency

      *  Cache C's link to Sib2, 64 Kbit/sec with 10 msec latency.


      ICP does not work well in this context. If a user submits a

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


      request to Proxy C for page P that results in a miss. C will send
      an ICP request to Sib1 and Sib2. Assume both siblings have the
      requested object P. The ICP-HIT reply will always come from Sib2
      before Sib1. However, for large objects it is clear that the
      retrieval will be faster from Sib1 rather than Sib2.

      In fact, the problem is more complex because Sib1 and Sib2 can't
      have a 100% hit ratio. With a hit rate of 10%, it is more
      efficient to use Sib1 with resources larger than 48K. The best
      choice depends on at least the hit rate and link characteristics;
      maybe other parameters as well.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      By selecting the first peer to respond, peer selection algorithms
      are not optimizing retrieval latency to end users. Furthermore
      they are causing more work for the high-latency peer since it
      must respond to such requests but will never be chosen to serve
      content if the lower latency peer has a copy.

   Indications 
      Inherent in design of ICP v1, ICP v2, and any proxy mesh protocol
      that selects peer based upon first response.

      This problem is not exhibited by cache digest or other protocols
      which (attempt to) maintain knowledge of peer contents and only
      hit peers that are believed to have a copy of the requested page.

   Solution(s) 
      This problem is architectural with the peer selection protocol.

   Workaround 
      Proxy mesh design when using such a protocol should be done in
      such a way that there is not a high latency variance among peers.
      In the example presented in the above description the high
      latency high bandwidth peer could be used as a parent, but should
      not be used as a sibling.

2.1.7 ICP performance

   Name

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


   Classification 
      Architecture(ICP), Performance

   Description 
      The ICP protocol exhibits O(n^2) scaling properties, where n is
      the number of peer proxies participating in the protocol. This
      can lead ICP traffic to dominate HTTP traffic within a network.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      If a proxy has many ICP peers the bandwidth demand of ICP can be
      excessive. System managers must carefully regulate ICP peering.
      ICP also leads proxies to become heterogeneous in what they
      serve. This means if your proxy does not have a document it is
      unlikely your peers will have it either. Therefore, ICP traffic
      requests are largely unable to locate a local copy of an object
      [credit to Ingrid Melve's 3WCW talk for this].

   Indications 
      Inherent in design of ICP v1, ICP v2.

   Solution(s) 
      This problem is architectural - protocol redesign or replacement
      are required to solve it if ICP is to continue to be used. 

   Workaround 
      Implementation workarounds exist, for example to turn off use of
      ICP, to carefully regulate peering, or to use another mechanism
      if available, such as cache digests. A cache digest protocol
      shares a summary of cache contents using a Bloom Filter
      technique. This allows a cache to estimate whether a peer has a
      document. Filters are updated regularly but are not always
      up-to-date so cannot help when a spike in popularity occurs. They
      also increase traffic but not as much as ICP.

      Proxy clustering protocols organize proxies into a mesh provide
      another alternative solution. There is ongoing research on this
      topic.

   Description 
      A caching proxy mesh where a request may travel different paths
      depending on the state of the mesh and associated caches can
      break HTTP content serialization, possibly causing the end user
      to receive older content than seen on an earlier request where
      the request traveled another path in the mesh.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      Can cause end user confusion. May in some situations (sibling
      cache hit, object has changed state from cacheable to
      uncacheable) be close to impossible to get the caches properly
      updated with the new content.

   Indications 
      Older content is unexpectedly returned from a caching proxy mesh
      after some time.

   Solutions(s) 
      Work with caching proxy vendors and researchers to find a
      suitable protocol for maintaining proxy relations and object
      state in a mesh.

   Workaround 
      When designing a hierarchy/mesh, make sure that for each
      end-user/URL combination there is only one single path in the
      mesh during normal operation.

2.1.9 Interception proxies break IP address-based authentication

   Name 
      Interception proxies break IP address-based authentication

   Classification 
      Architecture

   Description 
      Some web servers are not open for public access, but restrict
      themselves to accept only certain IP address ranges for security
      reasons. Using interception proxies at the ISP level, for
      example, will alter the source (client) IP addresses to that of

      the proxy itself. This will break such authentication mechanisms
      and prohibit the otherwise allowed clients access to the servers.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      This creates end user confusion and frustration.

   Indications 
      Users may start to see refused connections to servers after
      interception proxies are deployed.

   Solution(s) 
      Use user-based authentication instead of (IP) address-based
      authentication.

   Workaround 
      By using IP filters at the intercepting device (L4 switch) and
      bypass all requests to such servers concerned.

   Description 
      Many (if not most) implementations incorrectly interpret
      Cache-Control response headers.

   Significance 
      High

   Implications 
      CC headers will be spurned by end users if there are conflicting
      or non-standard implementations.

   Indications

2.2.2 Lack of HTTP/1.1 compliance for caching proxies

   Name 
      Lack of HTTP/1.1 compliance for caching proxies

   Classification 
      Implementation

   Description 
      Although performance benchmarking of caches is starting to be
      explored, protocol compliance is just as important.

   Significance 
      High

   Implications 
      Caching proxy vendors implement their interpretation of the
      specification; because the specification is very large, sometimes
      vague and ambiguous, this can lead to inconsistent behavior
      between caching proxies.

      Caching proxies need to comply to the specification (or the
      specification needs to change).

   Indications 
      There is no currently known compliance test being used. 

      There is work underway to quantify how closely servers comply
      with the current specification. A joint technical report between
      AT&T (#990803-05-TM, available at
      <URL:http://www.research.att.com/~bala/papers/procow-1.ps.gz> and
      HP Labs (to be published) describes the compliance testing. This
      report examines how well each of a set of top traffic-producing
      sites support certain HTTP/1.1 features.

      The IRCache group is working to develop protocol compliance
      testing software. Running such a conformance test suite against
      proxy cache products would measure compliance and ultimately
      would help assure they comply to the specification.

   Solution(s) 
      Testing should commence and be reported in an open industry
      forum. Proxy implementations should conform to the specification.

   Workaround 
      There is no workaround for non-compliance.

2.2.3 ETag support

   Name 
      ETag support

   Classification 
      Implementation

   Description 
      No currently released caching proxy implements ETag (strong)
      validation.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      LM/IMS validation is inappropriate for many requirements, both
      because of its weakness and its use of dates. Lack of a usable,
      strong coherency protocol leads developers and end users not to
      trust caches.

   Indications 
      -

   Solution(s) 
      Work with vendors to implement ETags; work for better validation
      protocols.

   Workaround 
      use LM/IMS validation.

2.2.4 User agent/proxy failover

   Name 
      User agent/proxy failover

   Classification 
      Implementation

   Description 
      Failover between proxies at the user agent (using a proxy.pac
      file) is erratic and no standard behavior is defined.
      Additionally, behavior is hard-coded into the browser, so that
      proxy administrators cannot use failover at the user agent
      effectively.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      Architects are forced to implement failover at the proxy itself,
      when it may be more appropriate and economical to do it within
      the user agent.

   Indications 
      If a browser detects that its primary proxy is down, it will wait
      n minutes before trying the next one it is configured to use. It
      will then wait y minutes before asking the user if they'd like to
      try the original proxy again. This is very confusing for end
      users.

   Solution(s) 
      Work with browser vendors to establish standard extensions to
      JavaScript proxy.pac libraries that will allow configuration of
      these timeouts.

   Workaround 
      User education; redundancy at the proxy level.

Internet-Draft     Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems           July 2000


   Description 
      Many web servers and much web content could be implemented to be
      more conducive to caching, reducing bandwidth demand and page
      load delay.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      By making poor use of caches, origin servers encourage longer
      load times, greater load on cache servers, and increased network
      demand.

   Indications 
      The problem is most apparent for pages that have low or zero
      expires time, yet do not change.

   Solution(s) 
      ...

   Workaround 
      For example servers could start using unique object identifiers
      for write-only content: if an object changes it gets a new name,
      otherwise is is considered to be immutable and therefore have an
      infinite expire age. Certain hosting providers do this already.

2.2.6 Some servers send bad Content-Length header files that contain CR

   Name 
      Some servers send bad Content-Length header files that contain CR.

   Classification 
      Implementation

   Description 
      Certain web servers send a Content-length value that is larger
      than number of bytes in the HTTP message body. This happens when
      the server strips off CR characters from text files with lines
      terminated with CRLF as the file is written to the client. The
      server probably uses the stat() system call to get the file size
      for the Content-Length header. Servers that exhibit this behavior
      include the GN Web server (version 2.14 at least)
      (http://gopher.unicom.com/gn-info/).

   Significance 
      Low. Surveys indicate only a small number of sites run faulty

      servers.

   Implications 
      In this case, an HTTP client (e.g. user agent or proxy) may
      believe it received a partial response. HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)
      advises that caches MAY store partial responses.

   Indications 
      Count the number of bytes in the message body and comparing it to
      the Content-length value. If they differ the server exhibits this
      problem.

   Solutions 
      Upgrade or replace the buggy server.

   Workaround 
      Some browsers and proxies use one TCP connection per object and
      ignore the Content-Length. The document end of file is identified
      by the close of the TCP socket.

   Name 
      Lack of fine-grained, standardized hierarchy controls

   Classification 
      Administration

   Description 
      There is no standard for instructing a proxy as to how it should
      resolve what parent to fetch a given object from. Because of
      this, implementations vary greatly, and it can be difficult to
      make them interoperate correctly in a complex environment.

   Significance 
      Medium

   Implications 
      Complications in deployment of caches in a complex network (esp.
      corporate networks)

   Indications

2.3.2 Proxy/Server exhaustive log format standard for analysis

   Name 
      Proxy/Server exhaustive log format standard for analysis

   Classification 
      Administration

   Description 
      Most proxy or origin server logs used for characterization or
      evaluation do not provide sufficient detail to determine
      cacheability of responses.

   Significance 
      Low (for operationality; high significance for research efforts)

   Implications 
      Characterizations and simulations are based on non-representative
      workloads.

   See Also 
      W3C Web Characterization Activity (http://www.w3.org/WCA/) since
      they are are also concerned with collecting high quality logs and
      building characterizations from them.

   Indications 
      -

   Solution(s) 
      To properly clean and to accurately determine cacheability of
      responses, a complete log is required (including all request
      headers as well as all response headers such as User-agent [for
      removal of spiders] and Expires, max-age, set-cookie, no-cache,
      etc.)

2.3.3 Trace log timestamps

   Name 
      Trace log timestamps

   Classification 
      Administration

   Description 
      Some proxies/servers log requests without sufficient timing
      detail. Millisecond resolution is often too small to preserve
      request ordering and either the servers should record request
      reception time in addition to completion time, or elapsed time
      plus either one.

   Significance 
      Low (for operationality; medium significance for research efforts)

   Implications 
      Characterization and simulation fidelity is improved with
      accurate timing and ordering information. Since logs are
      generally written in order of request completion, these logs
      cannot be re-played without knowing request generation times and
      reordering accordingly.

   See Also 
      -

   Indications 
      Timestamps can be identical for multiple entries (when only
      millisecond resolution is used). Request orderings can be jumbled
      when clients open additional connections for embedded objects
      while still receiving the container object.

   Solution(s) 
      Since request completion time is common (e.g. Squid), recommend
      continuing to use it (with microsecond resolution if possible)
      plus recording elapsed time since request reception.

2.3.4 Exchange format for log summaries

   Name 
      Exchange format for log summaries

   Classification 
      Administration/Analysis?

   Description 
      Although we have (more or less) a standard log file format for
      proxies (plain vanilla Common Logfile and Squid), there isn't a
      commonly accepted format for summaries of those log files.
      Summaries could be generated by the cache itself, or by
      post-processing existing log file formats such as Squid's.

   Significance 
      High, since it means that each log file summarizing/analysis tool
      is essentially reinventing the wheel (un-necessary repetition of
      code), and the cost of processing a large number of large log
      files through a variety of analysis tools is (again for no good
      reason) excessive.

   Implications 
      In order to perform a meaningful analysis (e.g. to measure
      performance in relation to loading/configuration over time) the
      access logs from multiple busy caches, it's often necessary to
      run first one tool then another, each against the entire log file
      (or a significantly large subset of the log). With log files
      running into hundreds of MB even after compression (for a cache
      dealing with millions of transactions per day) this is a
      non-trivial task.

   See Also 
      IP packet/header sniffing - it may be that individual
      transactions are at a level of granularity which simply isn't
      sensible to be attempting on extremely busy caches. There may
      also be legal implications in some countries, e.g. if this
      analysis identifies individuals.

   Indications 
      Disks/memory full(!) Stats (using multiple programs) take too
      long to run. Stats crunching must be distributed out to multiple
      machines because of its high computational cost.

   Solution(s) 
      Have the proxy produce a standardized summary of its activity
      either automatically or via an external (e.g. third party) tool,
      in a commonly agreed format. The format could be something like
      XML or the Extended Common Logfile, but the format and contents
      are subjects for discussion. Ideally this approach would permit
      individual cache server products to supply subsets of the
      possible summary info, since it may not be feasible for all
      servers to provide all of the information which people would like
      to see.

   Workaround 
      Devise a private summary format for your own personal use - but
      this complicates or even precludes the exchange of summary info
      with other interested parties.
