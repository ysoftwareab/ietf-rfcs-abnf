1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new HTTP authentication scheme [RFC7235]
   named "PrivacyToken".

   This scheme is built to be used to authenticate to proxies, using the
   Proxy-Authorization header field, with a blind signature that allows
   a proxy to verify that a client has a token signed by a particular
   key, but without identifying the client.  The initial version of this
   scheme is intended to be used with RSA Blind Signatures [RSASIG].

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Privacy Token Structure

   A privacy token is a structure that begins with a single byte that
   indicates a version.  This document defines version, 1, which
   indicates use of private tokens based on RSA Blind Signatures
   [RSASIG], and determines the rest of the structure contents.

   struct {
       uint8_t version;
       uint8_t key_id[32];
       uint8_t message[32];
       uint8_t signature[Nk];
   } Token;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "version" is a 1-octet integer.  This document defines version 1.

   *  "key_id" is a collision-resistant hash that identifies the key
      used to produce the signature.  This is generated as
      SHA256(public_key), where public_key is a DER-encoded
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo object carrying the public key.

   *  "message" is a 32-octet random message that is signed by the
      signature.

   *  "signature" is a Nk-octet RSA Blind Signature that covers the
      message.  For version 1, Nk is 512.

3.  PrivacyToken Authentication Scheme

   The "PrivacyToken" authentication scheme defines one parameter,
   "token".  All unknown or unsupported parameters to "PrivacyToken"
   authentication credentials MUST be ignored.

   The value of the "token" parameter is a Privacy Token Structure
   Section 2, encoded using base64url encoding [RFC4648].

   As an example, a Proxy-Authorization field in an HTTP request would
   look like:

   Proxy-Authorization: PrivacyToken token=abc...

4.  Security Considerations

   Note that the KeyID is only a hint to identify the public
   verification key.  With a sufficiently large number of public keys,
   KeyID collisions may occur.  By approximation, a KeyID collision
   between two distinct keys will occur with probability sqrt(p * 2^33).
   In such cases, servers SHOULD attempt verification using both keys.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "PrivacyToken" authentication scheme in
   the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme
   Registry" established by [RFC7235].
