                  The application/osp-token MIME type

STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents
   at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as work in progress.

1. Abstract

   The Open Settlement Protocol (OSP)[1], an open standard from the
   European Telecommunications Standards Institute, specifies a means
   by which IP telephony equipment in one administrative domain may
   request access to IP telephony equipment (including, but not limited
   to: Gateways, Gatekeepers, Border Elements, etc.) in another
   administrative domain. OSP grants such access by returning
   authorization tokens, which must then be passed to the destination
   IP telephony gateway during call signaling. In order to support
   access control via OSP, IP telephony signaling protocols must be
   capable of carrying these authorization tokens in an interoperable
   way. This memo defines just such a method for protocols, such as the
   Session Initiation Protocol[2], that can support carriage of MIME
   types during call signaling. This memo conforms to the requirements
   for MIME type registration defined in RFC 2048[3].

2. Registration Information

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: osp-token

Internet Draft   The application/osp-token MIME type        April 1999



   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:
     osp-token-format: a value of "asn.1" indicates the token contents
     use the ASN.1 format defined in Annex D, section D.2.1 of the OSP
     specification; a value of "xml" indicates the token contents use
     the XML format defined in Annex D, section D.2.2 of the OSP
     specification. In the absence of any value for this parameter, the
     token contents shall use the XML format of D.2.2.

     osp-token-version: a character string indicating the earliest
     revision of the OSP specification to which the token contents
     conform. In the absence of any value for this parameter, the token
     contents shall conform to version "1.4.2" of the OSP
     specification.

   Encoding considerations:
     OSP tokens are normally carried as binary data by the call
     signaling protocol. Call signaling protocols which cannot reliably
     transfer binary data may use alternate encodings such as base-
     64[4], in which case standard MIME content-encoding parameters may
     indicate the particular encoding.

   Security considerations:
     OSP tokens are intended to provide access control to resources of
     other administrative domains, and, as such, are inherently
     designed to address security concerns. For that reason, OSP tokens
     are digitally signed and, optionally, encrypted, as defined in the
     OSP specification.

   Interoperability considerations:
     The means and/or algorithms by which a receiving system determines
     whether or not an OSP token is valid are a local matter. However,
     at a minimum, receiving systems should verify the digital
     signature of the token, and they should ensure that any call
     details included in the token contents (e.g. called number,
     calling number, etc.) are appropriate for the contemplated call.

   Published specification:
     "Telecommunications and Internet Protocol Harmonization Over
     Networks (TIPHON); Inter-domain pricing, authorization, and usage
     exchange". Technical Specification 101 321. European
     Telecommunications Standards Institute. Version 1.4.2, December
     1998.[1]

   Applications which use this media type:
     IP telephony call signaling protocols that use MIME types to
     convey additional information during call setup.

   Additional information:
     Magic number(s): none
     File extension(s): none
