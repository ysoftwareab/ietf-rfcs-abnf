Abstract 
    
   This document discusses the typical network operation user cases of 
   Large Access Providers (LAP).  Since a LAP has hundreds location, 
   thousand node, millions subscriber, where the law of large number 
   affects bottom line of network operation, LAP has been always 
   striving to streamline all the possible network operation functions.   
   The user cases presented in this document are generic with respect 
   to the type of network technology and can be augmented with 
   technology-specific details.  They are intended to be used for 
   baseline for other network operation streamlining requirements.

1.   Introduction 
 
   Large providers of broadband Internet access are faced with 
   difficult demands that need be alleviated by streamlining network 
   operation.  This document discusses the typical network operation 
   user cases of Large Access Providers (LAP).  Since a LAP has 
   hundreds location, thousand node, millions subscriber, where the law 
   of large number affects bottom line of network operation, LAP has 
   been always striving to streamline all the possible network 
   operation functions.  The user cases presented in this document are 
   generic with respect to the type of network technology and can be 
   augmented with technology-specific details.  They are intended to be 
   used for baseline for other network operation streamlining 
   requirements.   
    
   A LAP typical has one or few network management systems (NMSs) 
   deployed to manage its network.  NMSs are located in network 
   operations centers, remote from the network elements (NEs) but 
   connected to them by a central office data communications network 
   (CODCN).  While most NEs provide some local means of accessing the 
   device for management purposes (ôcraft interfaceö or "command line 
   interface"), this is usually used only during extraordinary 
   situations, as the cost and time required sending a technician to 
   the NE site is burdensome.  Also it is time consuming and expensive 
   to train a technician to be proficient in many varieties of "craft 
   interface" or "command line interface".  Thus, the NMS is a service 
   provider's primary access for managing network elements. 
    
   This does not mean that all network operation functions will be 
   performed by people sitting in front of a NMS terminal.  To the 
   contrary, streamlining network operation functions requires the NMS 
   to be integrated with a service provider's Operation Support Systems 
   (OSSs).  The NMS must provide electronic protocol interfaces to 
   accomplish this. 
 
   The user cases are described to center on network management system 
   (NMS). Each use case description indicates the actor(s) involved in 
   the use case.  An actor is a user of the system and may be a human 
   or a machine.  In addition to the behavior described in the use case 
   body, each use case also lists preconditions and post conditions.  
   Preconditions are statements that must hold true before the system 
   is expected to exhibit the behavior described in the use case.  Post 
   conditions are statements that must hold true at the completion of 
   the use case.

3.   User Cases of Network Infrastructure Operation 
 
3.1. NE Installation 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions: 
      1.   A new NE has been installed. 
      2.   The NE is connected to OCN to which NMS is also connected.  
      3.   The NE has been assigned an IP address through some local 
        means and the IP connectivity between NE and NMS has been 
        established. 
   Descriptions: 
      1.   Operator navigates to the NE by entering its IP address. 
      2.   Operator assigns the NE a unique name (which could be a CLLI 
        code). 
      3.   The NMS then MUST automatically synchronize itself with the 
        current configuration of the NE. See User Case 3.3. 
   Post Conditions:  The NMS is in sync with the NE and the NMS is now 
   managing the NE. 
    
3.2. NE Software Download 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
      2.   The operator has load new NE software from a distribution 
        medium onto the MS. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The software download MUST be performed from the NMS GUI and 
        MUST NOT require sending a technician to the NE. 
      2.   The software download MUST be performed without halting the 
        NE.  It SHOULD be done without rebooting the NE and 
        interrupting services. 
      3.   The operator SHOULD be able to download the software 
        immediately or schedule the download for a later time. 
      4.   The NE and NMS MUST verify the download and notify the 
        operator of the success or failure of the download. 
      5.   The operator SHOULD be able to activate the new software 
        once the success of it has been verified. The software SHOULD 
        be automatically activated if operator chooses so. 
      6.   The NE and NMS MUST notify the operator of the success or 
        failure of activating the new software.

      7.   If for some reason the new software need be reverted to the 
        previous version, the operator SHOULD be able to accomplish 
        this from the GUI without having to download the previous 
        version. 
      8.   The download MUST be logged. 
   Post Conditions:  The NE is running the new software or is reverted 
   to previous version. 
    
3.3. NE Synchronization 
   Actor:  NE 
   Pre-Conditions: 
      1.   The NMS has just established or re-established connectivity 
        with the NE(s). 
   Descriptions: 
      1.   The NE is the master of "hard" data about itself. The "hard" 
        data is read-only data that cannot be changed by the MS.  This 
        includes, for example, the current alarm and operational state 
        of the resource entity (NE, plug-in, port, etc.), the hardware 
        installed in and software loaded on the NE, performance and 
        usage measurement, etc.  The NMS is responsible for updating 
        itself to match the NE on this data.   
      2.   The NMS is the master of "soft" data about the NE. The 
        "soft" data is writable data that is set by the MS. This 
        includes, for example, configurable parameters such as 
        administrative state of the resource entity (NE, plug-in, port, 
        etc.), whether or not they are assigned, links and connections 
        (circuit, VC, LSP, etc), VPNs, routing and signaling, etc.  The 
        NMS is responsible for updating the NE to match the NMS on this 
        data. 
      3.   If the NE is a new NE, the NMS MUST automatically 
        synchronize with it for the first time. 
      4.   The NMS MUST automatically detects a condition that might 
        have caused it to lose connectivity with the NE.  The NMS MUST 
        automatically synchronize with the NE it has been out of 
        connectivity with.  This includes:  
          .  The NMS has been down and is now active again. 
          .  A NE has been down and is now active again. 
          .  The CODCN between the NMS and NEs has been down and is now 
             active again. 
      5.   Priority SHOULD be placed on re-establishing the ability to 
        synchronize the affected NEs over other management functions. 
      6.   The volume of data update is very large in LAP network.  The 
        bulk data synchronization MUST BE finished during the NMS 
        maintenance window. 
      7.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new 
        synchronized data. 
   Post Conditions:  The data in the NMS and the NE accurately reflects 
   the current state of each other's configuration.

3.4. NE Continuous Synchronization 
   Actor:  NE 
   Pre-Conditions: 
      1.   The state of a NE changes in such a way that data in the NMS 
        may inaccurately reflect the state of the NE configuration. 
   Descriptions: 
      1.   The NE MUST automatically notify the NMS changes to its 
        hardware, software, links and connections, routing and 
        signaling, and any other physical or logical resource entity 
        steward by the NE, especially changes due to technician 
        interaction with the NE through "craft interface" or "command  
        line interface".   
      2.   The NE MUST support automatically notifications of 
        installation, remove, or change, of plug-in units. 
      3.   The NMS MUST automatically maintains data synchronization 
        between itself and the NE. The operator SHOULD NOT be aware 
        exactly where the data physically resides or how the NMS 
        provides synchronization and consistency. 
      4.   Changes are logged, including date time stamp of the change. 
        Items that MUST be logged include: changes to hardware and 
        software, protection switching events, etc. 
      5.   The NMS MUST maintain the time source for the purposes of 
        providing timestamps. The NMS MUST enforces time-stamp 
        synchronization for the NE in its management jurisdiction. It 
        MUST maintain a single normalized time designation (GMT) for 
        all NE events and displays events with the local time. The 
        operator designates the local time zone. The NMS MUST 
        automatically adjusts for daylight savings time. 
      6.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new 
        synchronized data. 
   Post Conditions:  The data in the NMS accurately reflects the 
   current state of the NE configuration. 
    
3.5. Alarm Browsing and Clearing 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under EMS management. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The operator MUST be able to browse any active alarm and 
        history alarm in interactive and bulk method.  The operator 
        MUST be able to force the NMS to re-synchronize its alarm state 
        with a NE. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to select any alarms in 
        interactive and bulk method and write them to a text file that 
        can be stored, transferred, etc. 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to select any alarm in interactive 
        and bulk method and delete them. 
      4.   The operator MUST be able to set a limit on the size of the 
        history alarm log.  The oldest alarm records are dropped from 
        the log to make room for the new records.

      5.   The network resource entity (NE, plug-in, port, link, 
        connection, service, etc.) may send a clearing alarm to clear a 
        previous sent alarm.  The NMS MUST be able to correlate the 
        clearing alarm with the original alarm. 
      6.   The operator may select an alarm and manually clear it.  The 
        reason, note, operator's name MUST be logged. 
      7.   The cleared alarm MUST be marked "cleared", removed from the 
        active alarm log, and moved to the history alarm log.  The date 
        and time, reason of the alarm clearing MUST be logged. 
      8.   Any "descendant" alarms correlated with the cleared alarm 
        MUST be also cleared in the same fashion. 
      9.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new alarm 
        data. 
   Post Conditions:  The alarm and any correlated descendants are 
   marked as cleared and moved from the active alarm log to the history 
   alarm log. 
    
3.6. NE, Plug-In, and Port Configuration 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:  
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
      2.   A new piece of plug-in may have just been installed in the 
           NE. 
   Description: 
      1.   If a new piece of plug-in has just been installed, the NMS 
        MUST automatically detect the addition and retrieve all the 
        "hard" data from the NE about the new hardware. See user case 
        3.4 for more details. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to configure the NE with the 
        following data: 
          .  NE name 
          .  NE user label (e.g. CLLI code) 
          .  NE equipment code and function code 
          .  NE location 
          .  NE administrative state (lock, unlock, defect) 
          .  External time (wall-clock time) 
          .  Network technology-specifc data 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to configure the plug-in with the 
        following data: 
          .  Plug-in name 
          .  Plug-in user label 
          .  Plug-in equipment code and function code 
          .  Plug-in administrative state (lock, unlock, defect) 
          .  Network technology-specifc data 
      4.   If same type of plug-in had previously been installed in the 
        same slot, the NMS MUST automatically configures the new plug-
        in the same way the old plug-in was configured. This is to 
        automate the handling defect repair case in which defect plug-
        in is removed and new one installed.

          .  Network technology-specific data 
      6.   Any configuration by the operator that violates an entity 
        relationship or cause an invalid state transition MUST not be 
        allowed. 
      7.   Any configuration by operator MUST be logged. The log MUST 
        be retrieval in both interactive and bulk method. 
      8.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new 
        configuration data. 
   Post Conditions:  The NE is updated according to the configuration 
   made by the operator. 
 
3.7. NE and Plug-In Remove

3.9. NE, Plug-In, and Port Alarm 
   Actor:  Operator, NE, OSS 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
      2.   The NE, or plug-in, or port experience a notable event, i.e. 
        an alarm. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The NMS MUST be able to receive an alarm regarding NE, plug-
        in, and port from the NE reliably. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to define a default alarm severity 
        assignment profile to be used by the NE and NMS to assign alarm 
        severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) to alarm conditions. 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to define an alarm severity 
        assignment for a specific network resource entity (NE, plug-in, 
        port). 
      4.   The operator MUST be able to set a length of time for a 
        specific network resource entity (NE, plug-in, port) during 
        which alarms on that entity will be suppressed. 
      5.   The operator MUST be able to set "soak" period for the 
        various alarm conditions.  A soak period defines how long an 
        alarm condition must persist before an alarm is declared. 
      6.   New alarms MUST be added to the active alarm log.  Duplicate 
        alarms SHOULD not be added to the alarm log.  Instead, a count 
        of duplicates MUST be kept for each alarm, along with a record 
        of when the first and last occurrences were received. 
      7.   If the communication channel between an NE and the NMS is 
        down, the NMS MUST re-synchronizes to the alarm state of the NE 
        after the communication channel is up again.  The NMS MUST logs 
        and reports outstanding alarm and cleared alarms missed during 
        out of synchronization. 
      8.   Alarms from the same NE MUST be correlated to identify any 
        cause and effect relationships between them.  Therefore alarms 
        are organized into tree structures, where child alarms 
        represent conditions that are actually a result of the parent 
        alarm.  Alarms at the roots of these trees are the actual alarm 
        conditions.  Repairing the root-cause alarm will fixing its 
        descendent alarms. 
      9.   The received alarm MUST contain the following data: 
          .  Alarm unique ID 
          .  Alarm severity 
          .  Alarm type

        and signaling context from the NE reliably. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to define a default alarm severity 
        assignment profile to be used by the NE and NMS to assign alarm 
        severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) to alarm conditions. 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to define an alarm severity 
        assignment for a specific network resource entity (routing and 
        signaling context). 
      4.   The operator MUST be able to set a length of time for a 
        specific network resource entity (routing and signaling 
        context) during which alarms on that entity will be suppressed. 
      5.   The operator MUST be able to set "soak" period for the 
        various alarm conditions.  A soak period defines how long an 
        alarm condition must persist before an alarm is declared. 
      6.   New alarms MUST be added to the active alarm log.  Duplicate 
        alarms SHOULD not be added to the alarm log.  Instead, a count 
        of duplicates MUST be kept for each alarm, along with a record 
        of when the first and last occurrences were received. 
      7.   If the communication channel between an NE and the NMS is 
        down, the NMS MUST re-synchronizes to the alarm state of the NE 
        after the communication channel is up again.  The NMS MUST logs 
        and reports outstanding alarm and cleared alarms missed during 
        out of synchronization. 
      8.   Alarms from the same NE MUST be correlated to identify any 
        cause and effect relationships between them.  Therefore alarms 
        are organized into tree structures, where child alarms 
        represent conditions that are actually a result of the parent 
        alarm.  Alarms at the roots of these trees are the actual alarm 
        conditions.  Repairing the root-cause alarm will fixing its 
        descendent alarms. 
      9.   The received alarm MUST contain the following data: 
          .  Alarm unique ID 
          .  Alarm severity 
          .  Alarm type 
          .  Alarm description 
          .  Alarm date and time

      3.   The routing and signaling contexts are under the NMS 
        management. 
      4.   The provider services are under the NMS management. 
      5.   The subscriber service experiences a notable event, i.e. an 
        alarm. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The NMS MUST be able to receive an alarm regarding 
        subscriber service from the NE reliably. 
      2.   The operator and OSS MUST be able to define a default alarm 
        severity assignment profile to be used by the NE and NMS to 
        assign alarm severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) to 
        alarm conditions.

      3.   The operator and OSS MUST be able to define an alarm 
        severity assignment for a specific network resource entity 
        (subscriber service). 
      4.   The operator and OSS MUST be able to set a length of time 
        for a specific network resource entity (subscriber service) 
        during which alarms on that entity will be suppressed. 
      5.   The operator and OSS MUST be able to set "soak" period for 
        the various alarm conditions.  A soak period defines how long 
        an alarm condition must persist before an alarm is declared. 
      6.   New alarms MUST be added to the active alarm log.  Duplicate 
        alarms SHOULD not be added to the alarm log.  Instead, a count 
        of duplicates MUST be kept for each alarm, along with a record 
        of when the first and last occurrences were received. 
      7.   If the communication channel between an NE and the NMS is 
        down, the NMS MUST re-synchronizes to the alarm state of the NE 
        after the communication channel is up again.  The NMS MUST logs 
        and reports outstanding alarm and cleared alarms missed during 
        out of synchronization. 
      8.   Alarms from the same NE MUST be correlated to identify any 
        cause and effect relationships between them.  Therefore alarms 
        are organized into tree structures, where child alarms 
        represent conditions that are actually a result of the parent 
        alarm.  Alarms at the roots of these trees are the actual alarm 
        conditions.  Repairing the root-cause alarm will fixing its 
        descendent alarms. 
      9.   The received alarm MUST contain the following data: 
          .  Alarm unique ID 
          .  Alarm severity 
          .  Alarm type 
          .  Alarm description 
          .  Alarm date and time 
          .  Alarm source entity (smallest possible unit) 
          .  Alarm ID of the root cause alarm to which this alarm may 
             have been correlated 
          .  Network technology-specific data 
      10.  The network resource entity (subscriber service) may clear a 
        previous sent alarm.  See user case 3.5 for more details. 
      11.  The NMS GUI and the protocol interface to OSS MUST be 
        automatically updated with the new alarm data. 
   Post Conditions:  The active alarm log and history alarm log are 
   updated accordingly. 
    
5.8. Subscriber Service Test 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NEs are under the NMS management. 
      2.   The trunk links or connections are under the NMS management. 
      3.   The routing and signaling contexts are under the NMS 
        management. 
      4.   The provider services are under the NMS management.

   Descriptions:   
      1.   The operator and MUST be able to invoke any network resource 
        entity (subscriber service) test capability from the NMS GUI. 
      2.   The operator SHOULD be able to invoke multiple concurrent 
        tests on the same and different network resource entity 
        (subscriber service). 
      3.   The operator SHOULD be able to schedule the test at a future 
        time. 
      4.   The operator SHOULD be able to set source and sink points, 
        number of iterations, iteration interval, of continuity 
        (loopback) test, if network technology supports it. 
      5.   The test result SHOULD be displayed and retrievable through 
        the NMS GUI. 
   Post Conditions:  The test result is available for diagnosing. 
    
5.9. Subscriber Service Performance and Usage 
   Actor:  Operator, NE, OSS 
   Pre-Conditions:

          .  Number of intervals to be collected into a single data 
             file, typically 96 intervals 
          .  Lifetime of the data files in NE 
          .  Network resource entities or types of entities (subscriber 
             service) from which data is to be collected 
          .  Network technology-specific performance and usage data to 
             be collected 
      2. The operator and OSS MUST be able to set the threshold values 
        for the monitored data attributes. When the data attribute 
        crosses this threshold, a threshold crossing alarm MUST be 
        generated.  See User Case 3.9 for details on alarm processing. 
        The monitored data attributes for threshold crossing are the 
        following: 
          .  Subscriber service QoS data 
          .  Network technology-specific data 
      3.   The operator and OSS MUST be able to browse, delete, and 
        transfer the performance and usage data files based on file 
        names and locations (e.g. URL). 
      4.   Any data files whose lifetimes expire before they are 
        deleted by an operator SHOULD be automatically deleted by the 
        NE or the MS. 
   Post Conditions:  Performance and usage data are collected and 
   stored in data files.
