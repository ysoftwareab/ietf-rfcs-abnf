1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community for
   the purpose of managing ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

   The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] describes objects used
   for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per
   [T1E1.413], [G.992.1] and [G.992.2].  These object descriptions are
   based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations
   Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI) T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication
   Union (ITU-T) G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

   This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] but rather
   provides a more comprehensive management model that includes also the
   ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4 and G.992.5
   ([G.992.3], [G.992.4] and [G.992.5] respectively).  In addition,
   objects have been added to improve the management of ADSL, ADSL2, and
   ADSL2+ lines.

   Additionally the management framework for New Generation ADSL lines
   specified [TR-90]. by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has
   been taken into consideration That framework is based on ITU-T
   G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] as well as on two amendments ([G.997.1
   am1] and [G.997.1 am2]) to it.  The document refer to all three
   documents as G.997.1.  That is, a MIB attribute that its REFERENCE
   section provides a a paragraph number in ITU-T G.997.1 is actually

Internet-Draft               NGDSL-LINE MIB               September 2005


   originated from either G.997.1 [G.997.1] or one of its amendment
   documents.

   Note that future revision of ITU-T G.997.1 standard will refer also
   to next generation of VDSL technology, known as VDSL2, per ITU-T
   G.993.2 [G.993.2].  However, managing VDSL2 lines is currently beyond
   the scope of the MIB this document specifies.

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission,
   as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of
   this document.

2.1.  Relationship to other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other
   MIB modules described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863] is discussed.

2.1.1.  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)

   The New Generation xDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of
   a data interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863
   [RFC2863].  The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes which may be
   applicable for ADSL lines:

      IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
          ...
      SYNTAX INTEGER {
          ...
          channel(70),     -- channel
          ADSL (94),       -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop
          ...
          Interleave(124), -- Interleaved Channel
          Fast(125),       -- Fast Channel
          ...
          ADSL2 (xx),      -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop 2
          ...
          }

   ADSL lines that are identified with ifType=ADSL (94) SHOULD be
   managed with the MIB specified by RFC2662.  ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+
   lines identified with ifType=ADSL2 (xx) SHOULD be managed with the
   MIB specified by this document.

   In any case the management system may use either ifType=Interleave
   (124) or Fast (125) for each channel, e.g., depending on whether or
   not it activates the interleaver on that channel.  It can also use
   the ifType=channel (70).

Internet-Draft               NGDSL-LINE MIB               September 2005


   Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863 [RFC2863] MUST be
   supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB
   module.

2.1.2.  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by ifType contains tables appropriate for
   the interface types described above.  Most such tables extend the
   ifEntry table, and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems
   implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex
   MUST be persistent.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], and are
   not duplicated in the New Generation DSL MIB.

   ===================================================================


      ifIndex               Interface index.

      ifDescr               See interfaces MIB.

      ifType                ADSL2 (xxx) or
                            Channel (70) or
                            Ineterleave (124) or
                            Fast (125)

      ifSpeed               Set as appropriate.

      ifPhysAddress         This object MUST have an octet string
                            with zero length.

      ifAdminStatus         See interfaces MIB.

      ifOperStatus          See interfaces MIB.

      ifLastChange          See interfaces MIB.

      ifName                See interfaces MIB.

      ifAlias               See interfaces MIB.

      ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default to enabled(1).

      ifHighSpeed           Set as appropriate.

      ifConnectorPresent    Set as appropriate.

2.2.  IANA Considerations

   The NGDSL-LINE-MIB module requires the allocation of a new ifType
   value for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2, to
   distinguish between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC2662
   management model and ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines managed with the
   model defined in this document.

   Also the NGDSL-LINE-MIB module requires the allocation of a single
   object identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  The IANA should allocate
   this object identifier in the transmission subtree.

   An assignment was in fact done when RFC 2662 was published, but as
   this MIB does not obsolete RFC 2662 it requires new assignment from
   IANA.

2.3.  Conventions used in the MIB Module

2.3.1.  Naming Conventions

   A.  AtuC refers to a central site terminal unit;
   B.  AtuR refers to a remote site terminal unit;
   C.  xtu refers to a terminal unit; either an AtuC or AtuR.
   D.  CRC is cyclic redundancy check.
   E.  DELT means Dual Ended Loop Test.
   F.  ES means errored second.
   G.  FEC means Forward Error Correction.
   H.  LOF means loss of framing.
   I.  LOS means loss of signal.
   J.  LOSS means LOS Second.
   K.  SES means severely errored second.
   L.  SNR means signal-to-noise ratio.
   M.  UAS means unavailable second.

2.3.2.  Textual Conventions

   The following textual conventions are defined to reflect the line
   topology in the MIB module (further discussed in the following
   section), the various transmission modes, power states,
   synchronization states, possible values for various configuration
   parameters, status parameters and other parameter types.

      ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  It mirrors the EOC addressing mechanism:

         atuc(1)                - central office (CO) terminal unit
         atur(2)                - customer premises equipment (CPE)
                                  terminal unit

   o  Adsl2Direction:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify a transmission
      direction in a ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  Upstream direction is a
      transmission from the customer premises equipment (CPE) towards
      the central office (CO), while downstream direction is a
      transmission from the CO towards the CPE.

         upstream(1)            - Transmission from the CPE to the CO
         downstream(2)          - Transmission from the CO to the CPE

   o  Adsl2TransmissionModeType:

      Attributes with this syntax reference the list of possible
      transmission modes for ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+.

      Specified as a BITS construct, there are currently few dozens of
      transmission modes in the list.

   o  Adsl2RaMode:

      Attributes with this syntax reference if and how Rate- Adaptive
      synchronization is being used on the respective ADSL/ADSL2 or
      ADSL2+ link:

         manual (1)    - No Rate-Adaptation.  The initialization process
                         attempts to synchronize to a specified rate.
         rainit (2)    - Rate-Adaptation during initialization process
                         only, which attempts to synchronize to a rate
                         between minimum and maximum specified values.
         dynamicRa (3) - Dynamic Rate-Adaptation during initialization
                         process as well as during SHOWTIME.

      profile depends on the ADSL Mode:

         defMode (1),         - The default/generic PSD configuration.
                                The default configuration will be used
                                when no other matching mode specific

2.6.  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

2.6.1.  Counters Managed

   There are various types of counters specified in this MIB.  Each
   counter refers either to the whole ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ line, to one of
   the xtu entities or to one of the bearer channels.

   o  On the whole line level

   For full initializations, failed full initializations, short
   initializations, and for failed short initializations there are event
   counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s)
   of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day
   interval-counter(s).  Each current 15-minute "failed" event bucket
   has an associated threshold notification.

   o  On the xtu level

   For the LOS Seconds, ES, SES, FEC seconds, and UAS, there are event
   counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s)
   of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day
   interval-counter(s).  Each current 15-minute event bucket has an
   associated threshold notification.

Internet-Draft               NGDSL-LINE MIB               September 2005


   o  On the bearer channel level

   For the coding violations (CRC anomalies), and corrected blocks
   (i.e., FEC events) there are event counters, current 15-minute and 0
   to 96 15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as
   current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval- counter(s).  Each
   current 15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold
   notification.

2.6.2.  Minimum Number Of Buckets

   Although it is possible to support up to 96 15-minute history buckets
   of "interval-counters", systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   practically support at least 16 buckets, as specified in ITU-T
   G.997.1, paragraph 7.2.7.2.

   Similarly, it is possible to support up to 30 previous 1-day
   "interval-counters" but systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   support at least 1 previous day buckets.

2.6.3.  Interval Buckets Initialization

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals
   with quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align
   one day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an xtU is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB module).

2.6.4.  Interval Buckets Validity

   As in RFC 3593 [RFC3593] and RFC 2662 [RFC2662], in case the data for
   an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST report
   the interval as invalid.  If the current 15-minute event bucket is
   determined to be invalid, the element management system SHOULD ignore
   its content and the agent MUST NOT generate notifications based upon
   the value of the event bucket.

   A valid 15-minute event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for
   exactly 15 minutes.  Similarly, a valid 1-day event bucket SHOULD
   usually count the events for exactly 24 hours.  However, the
   following scenarios are exceptional:






Morgenstern, et al.       Expires April 2, 2006                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               NGDSL-LINE MIB               September 2005


   1) For implementations that align the fifteen minute intervals with
      quarter hours and the 1-day intervals with start of a day the
      management system may still start the PM process not aligned with
      the wall clock.  Such a management system may wish to retrieve
      even partial information for the first event buckets, rather than
      declaring them all as invalid.
   2) For an event bucket that suffered relatively short outages the
      management system may wish to retrieve the available PM outcomes,
      rather than declaring the whole event bucket as invalid.  This is
      more important for 1-day event buckets.
   3) An event bucket may be shorter or longer than the formal duration
      in case a clock adjustment has been performed during the interval.

   This MIB allows supporting the exceptional scenarios described above
   by reporting the actual Monitoring Time of a monitoring interval.
   This parameter is relevant only for Valid intervals but it useful for
   those exceptional scenarios:
   a) The management system MAY still declare a partial PM interval as
      Valid and report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted.
   b) In case the interval was shortened or extended due to clock
      corrections the management system SHOULD report the actual number
      of seconds the interval lasted, beside reporting that the interval
      is Valid.

2.7.  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of xtUs, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every
   xtU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the
   provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles and
   templates.

   A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by
   multiple entities.  There are configuration profiles to address the
   line level provisioning and another type of profiles that addresses
   the channel level provisioning parameters.

   A configuration template is actually a profile-of-profiles.  That is,
   a template is a selection of one line configuration profile and one
   or more channel configuration profiles.  A template provides the
   complete configuration of a line.  Same configuration can be shared
   by multiple lines.

   Similarly to the configuration profiles and templates this MIB module
   makes use of templates and profiles for specifying the alarm
   thresholds associated with performance parameters.  This allows
   provisioning multiple lines identically in respect of generating

   threshold crossing notifications.

   The following paragraphs describe templates and profiles used in this
   MIB module

2.7.1.  Configuration Profiles And Templates

   o  Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles contain
      parameters for configuring the low layer of ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+
      lines.  They are defined in the adsl2LineConfProfTable.

      The line configuration includes issues such as the specific ADSL/
      ADSL2 or ADSL2+ modes to enable on the respective line, power
      spectrum parameters, rate adaptation criteria, and SNR margin
      related parameters.  A subset of the line configuration parameters
      depends upon the specific ADSL Mode allowed I.e.  Does the profile
      allow ADSL, ADSL2 and/or ADSL2+, as well as what annex/annexes of
      the standard are allowed.  This is the reason a line profile MUST
      include one or more mode-specific extensions.

   o  Channel Configuration Profiles - Channel configuration profiles
      contain parameters for configuring bearer channels over the ADSL/
      ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines.  They are sometimes considered as the
      service layer configuration of the ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines.
      They are defined in the adsl2ChConfProfTable.

      The channel configuration includes issues such as the desired
      minimum and maximum rate on each traffic flow direction and
      impulse noise protection parameters.

   o  Line Configuration Templates - Line configuration templates allow
      combining line configuration profiles and channel configuration
      profiles to a comprehensive configuration of the ADSL/ADSL2 and
      ADSL2+ line.  They are defined in the adsl2LineConfTemplateTable.

      The line configuration template includes one index (OID) of a line
      configuration profile and one to four indexes of channel
      configuration profiles.  The template also addresses the issue of
      distributing the excess available data rate on each traffic flow
      direction (i.e., the data rate left after each channel is
      allocated a data rate to satisfy its minimum requested data rate)
      among the various channels.


2.7.2.  Alarm Configuration Profiles And Templates
   o  Line Alarm Configuration Profiles - Line level Alarm configuration
      profiles contain the threshold values for Performance Monitoring
      (PM) parameters counted either on the whole line level or on a xtu



Morgenstern, et al.       Expires April 2, 2006                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               NGDSL-LINE MIB               September 2005


      level.  Thresholds are required only for failures and anomalies.
      E.g., there are thresholds for failed initializations and LOS
      seconds but not for the aggregate number of full initializations.
      These profiles are defined in the adsl2LineAlarmConfProfTable.

   o  Channel Alarm Configuration Profiles - Channel level Alarm
      configuration profiles contain the threshold values for PM
      parameters counted on a bearer channel level.  Thresholds are
      defined for two types of anomalies: corrected blocks and coding
      violations.  These profiles are defined in the
      adsl2ChAlarmConfProfTable.

   o  Line Alarm Configuration Templates - Line Alarm configuration
      templates allow combining line level alarm configuration profiles
      and channel level alarm configuration profiles to a comprehensive
      configuration of the PM thresholds for ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ line.
      They are defined in the adsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable.

      The line alarm configuration template includes one index (OID) of
      a line level alarm configuration profile and one to four indexes
      of channel level alarm configuration profiles.

2.7.3.  Managing Profiles And Templates

   The index value for each profile and template is a locally-unique
   administratively assigned name having the textual convention
   'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   configuration template (e.g., adsl2LConfTempTemplateName = 'silver')
   by setting its adsl2LCnfgLineTemplate objects to the value of this
   template.

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   Alarm configuration template (e.g., adsl2LAlarmConfTempTemplateName =
   'silver') by setting its adsl2LCnfgAlarmTemplate objects to the value
   of this template.

   Before a template can be deleted or taken out of service it MUST be
   first unreferenced from all associated lines.  Implementations MAY
   also reject template modification while it is associated with any
   line.

   Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service it MUST be
   first unreferenced from all associated templates.  Implementations
   MAY also reject profile modification while it is referenced by any
   template.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL'
   for each profile and template type.  The values of the associated
   parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this
   document.  Before a line's templates have been set, these templates
   will be automatically used by setting adsl2LCnfgLineTemplate and
   adsl2LCnfgAlarmTemplate to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This default
   profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context of
   profiles and templates defined in this MIB module.

   Profiles and templates are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically
   using the profile name and profile row status in each of the profile
   tables.

   If the implementation allows modifying a profile or template while it
   is associated with a line, then such changes MUST take effect
   immediately.  These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or
   soft restart) of the units on the line.

2.7.4.  Managing Multiple Bearer Channels

   The number of bearer channels is configured by setting the template
   attributes adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile,
   adsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile,adsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile and
   adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning that template to a
   DSL line using the adsl2LineCnfgTemplate attribute.  When the number
   of bearer channels for a DSL line changes, the SNMP agent will
   automatically create or destroy rows in channel related tables
   associated with that line.  For example, when a DSL line is operating
   with one bearer channel, there will be zero rows in channel related
   tables for channels two, three and four.  The SNMP agent MUST create
   and destroy channel related rows as follows :

   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      higher number, the SNMP agent will automatically create rows in
      the adsl2ChannelStatusTable and adsl2PMChCurrTable tables for that
      line.
   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      lower number, the SNMP agent will automatically destroy rows in
      the adsl2ChannelStatusTable,
      adsl2PMChCurrTable,adsl2PMChHist15MinTable and
      adsl2PMChHist1DTable tables for that line.

2.8.  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [RFC3418]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/
   linkDown (per [RFC2863]) which are per interface (i.e., ADSL/ADSL2 or

   ADSL2+ line) is required.

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC
   Anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp
   notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are
   cleared.

   The notifications defined in this MIB module are for status change
   (e.g., initialization failure) and for the threshold crossings
   associated with the following events: Full initialization failures,
   short initialization failures, ES, SES, FEC Seconds, LOS Seconds,
   UAS, FEC Seconds, FEC events and CRC anomalies.  Each threshold has
   its own enable/threshold value.  When that value is 0, the
   notification is disabled.

   The adsl2LStatusStatusAtur and adsl2LStatusStatusAtuc are bitmask
   representing all outstanding error conditions associated with the
   AtuR and AtuC (respectively).  Note that since the AtuR status is
   obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the
   AtuR is unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
   Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current
   status.  Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those two
   status objects are defined.

   Note that there are other status parameters that refer to the AtuR
   (e.g., downstream line attenuation).  Those parameters also depend on
   the availability of EOC between the central office xtu and the remote
   xtu.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the
   threshold value.  Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval
   per interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter is reset to 0
   every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may
   recur as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a
   notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once
   every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent
   will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Notifications, other than the threshold notifications listed above,
   SHOULD be rate limited (throttled) such that there is an
   implementation-specific gap between the generation of consecutive
   notification of the same event.  When notifications are rate limited,
   they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future time.  This
   is intended to be a general rate-limiting statement for notifications
   that have no explicit rate limiting assertions in this document
   otherwise.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).  At the beginning of the next 15
   minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes by
   and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which
   equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.

      DESCRIPTION
           "
            This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
            module for use with network management protocols in the
            Internet community for the purpose of managing ADSL, ADSL2,
            and ADSL2+ lines.  The MIB module described in RFC 2662
            [RFC2662] describes objects used for managing Asymmetric
            Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1] and
            [G.992.2].  These object descriptions are based upon the
            specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel
            (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute
            (ANSI) T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International
            Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) G.992.1  [G.992.1] and
            G.992.2 [G.992.2].

            This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] but
            rather provides a more comprehensive management model that
            includes also the ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3,
            G.992.4 and G.992.5 ([G.992.3], [G.992.4] and [G.992.5]
            respectively).  In addition, objects have been added to
            improve the management of ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

           Additionally the management framework for New Generation ADSL
           lines specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF)
           has been taken into consideration [TR-90].  That framework is
           based on ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] as well as on two
           amendments [G.997.1 am1] and [G.997.1 am2] for it.

           Note that the revised ITU-T G.997.1 standard refers also to
           next generation of VDSL technology, known as VDSL2, per ITU-T
           G.993.2 [G.993.2].  However, managing VDSL2 lines is
           currently beyond the scope of this document.

           The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
           transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863
           [RFC2863]) section of this document.

           this MIB module is part of RFC XXXX: see the RFC itself for

4.  Implementation Analysis

   A management application intended to manage ADSL links (e.g.
   G.992.1) with this MIB module MUST be modified to adapt itself to
   certain differences between RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and this MIB module,
   including the following aspects:

   o  Though the configuration templates/profiles allow referring to 1-4
      bearer channels, ADSL links are limited to 2 channels at most
   o  Though the channel configuration profile allows higher data rates,
      ADSL links are limited to downstream/upstream data rate as assumed
      in RFC 2662 [RFC2662]
   o  The Impulse Noise Protection (INP) configuration parameters are
      given by minimum protection and maximum delay parameters.
   o  The line configuration profile includes a sub-table that addresses
      mode specific parameters.  For ADSL links the management
      application SHOULD create a row in that table for the 'adsl' mode.
   o  The line configuration profile includes parameters that are
      irrelevant for ADSL links.  Similarly many status parameters in
      the MIB are irrelevant for certain ADSL modes.  It is therefore
      advised to consult with ITU G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] regarding
      to the scope and relevance of each parameter in this MIB.



5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure

   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  adsl2LineTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LineCnfgTemplate
      *  adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate
      *  adsl2LineCmndConfPmsf
      *  adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf
      *  adsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCnfgTemplate could have a major
      adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate could have a
      contrary effect on notifications.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndConfPmsf could have an
      adverse affect on the power consumption of a line and may disrupt
      an operational service.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf could cause an
      unscheduled line test to be carried out on the line.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart could cause
      an unscheduled cold reset to the line.

   o  adsl2SCStatusTable

      This table contains one object, adsl2SCStatusRowStatus, that
      supports SET operations.  Unauthorized changes could result in
      line test results being deleted prematurely.

   o  adsl2LineConfTemplateTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LConfTempLineProfile
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioDs
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioUs

      *  adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioUs
      *  adsl2LConfTempRowStatus

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempLineProfile,
      adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile,
      adsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile
      could have an adverse operational effect on several lines; could
      change several lines over to running in unwanted levels of
      operation; or could result in several services undergoing changes
      in the number of channels that carry the service.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioDs,
      adsl2LConfTempChan2RaRatioDs, adsl2LConfTempChan3RaRatioDs, or
      adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs, would alter the relative rate
      allocations among all channels belonging to a line.  This could
      have an adverse operational effect on several lines.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempRowStatus could result in
      templates being created or brought into service prematurely; or
      could result in templates being inadvertently deleted or taken out
      of service.

   o  adsl2LineConfProfTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LConfProfScMaskDs

      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileRowStatus

      Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a
      notification being suppressed or deferred.  Setting a threshold to
      0 could result in a notification being suppressed.  Suppressing or
      deferring a notification could prevent the timely delivery of
      important diagnostic information.  Decreasing any of the threshold
      values could result in a notification being sent from the network
      falsely reporting a threshold crossing.

      Changing a threshold value could also have an impact on the amount

      of notifications the agent sends.  The Notifications Section of
      this document has a paragraph which provides general guidance on
      the rate limiting of notifications.  Agent implementations not
      providing rate limiting could result in notifications being
      generated at an uncontrolled rate.  Unauthorized changes to a
      threshold value could result in an undesired notification rate.

      Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted line
      alarm profiles being created or brought into service.  Also,
      changes to the row status could result in line alarm profiles
      being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

      profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  adsl2LineInventoryTable

      Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain
      information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the
      network.  Further, such information is considered sensitive in
      many environments for competitive reasons.

      *  adsl2LInvG994VendorId
      *  adsl2LInvSystemVendorId
      *  adsl2LInvVersionNumber
      *  adsl2LInvSerialNumber
      *  adsl2LInvSelfTestResult
      *  adsl2LInvTransmissionCapabilities

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   It is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
   security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure
   that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module
   is properly configured to give access only to those objects whose
   principals (users) have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
