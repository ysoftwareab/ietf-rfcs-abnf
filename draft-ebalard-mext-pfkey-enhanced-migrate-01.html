<h1><br />PF_KEY Extension as an Interface between
    Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE<br />draft-ebalard-mext-pfkey-enhanced-migrate-01</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> This document describes the need for an interface between
      Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can
      interwork. An extension of the PF_KEY framework is proposed
      which allows smooth and solid operation of IPsec/IKE in a Mobile
      IPv6 environment.
</p>
<p> This document is heavily based on a previous draft [MIGRATE]
      written by Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis
      Dupont. It simply reuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the 
      expired document, removes a companion extension
      (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementation feedback
      (complexity, limitations, ...) and fills the gap by very simple
      changes to MIGRATE mechanism. This results in a more simple and
      consistent mechanism, which also proved to be easier to
      implement. This document is expected to serve as a continuation
      of [MIGRATE] work. For that reason, the name of the extension
      has been kept.
</p>
<p> PF_KEY MIGRATE message serves as a carrier for updated
      information for both the in-kernel IPsec structures (Security
      Policy Database / Security Association Database) and those
      maintained by the key managers.  This includes in-kernel
      Security Policy / Security Association endpoints, key manager
      maintained equivalents, and addresses used by IKE_SA (current
      and to be negotiated).  The extension is helpful for assuring
      smooth interworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the
      bootstrapping of mobile nodes and their movements.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>In <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>Mobile IPv6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3775], the Mobile Node
      (MN) and the Home Agent (HA) use some IPsec Security
      Associations (SA): <br />
<br />


      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> in transport mode to protect signaling traffic (Binding
	Update and Binding Ack). Those SA reference the Home Address
	(HoA) of the MN.
</li>
<li>in tunnel mode to protect some mobility signaling messages,
	mobile prefix discovery and optionally payload traffic. Those
	SA reference both the Care-of Address (CoA) and the HoA of the
	MN.
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p> To negotiate initial transport mode SA, the IKE daemon needs
      to be directed to use current CoA as source of the IKE
      exchanges. By default, the (currently unusable) HoA would be
      used. 
</p>
<p>Later, since the MN may change its attachment point to the
      Internet, it is necessary for it to update the tunnel endpoint
      address of its IPsec SA.  This indicates that corresponding
      entries in IPsec databases (Security Policy (SPD) and Security
      Association (SAD) databases) should be updated when MN performs
      movements.
</p>
<p>In a Mobile IPv6 environment, the key manager (KM) also needs
      to be notified when the SPD and SAD are updated. More generally,
      it needs to be provided with updated addresses for already
      negotiated and future IKE_SA. Because of its role and unlike
      common applications, a key manager has to take part to the
      mobility process it secures: it needs to be aware of address
      changes.
</p>
<p>This document describes the need for an interface between
      Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can
      interwork. An extension to the <a class='info' href='#RFC2367'>PF_KEY
      framework<span> (</span><span class='info'>McDonald, D., Metz, C., and B. Phan, &ldquo;PF_KEY Key Management API, Version 2,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2367] which allows smooth and solid operation of IKE
      in a Mobile IPv6 environment is defined. The extension is called
      PF_KEY MIGRATE and serves as a carrier for the necessary
      information for both the in-kernel IPsec stack and the key
      managers.
</p>
<p>For the IPsec stack, this allows migrating the endpoint
      addresses of the IPsec SA (and associated SP). For the key
      managers, this allows the mirrored structures to be updated (SAD
      and SPD). This also allows the addresses of already negotiated
      and associated IKE_SA to be migrated, and to make specific
      addresses available for negotiations of future IKE_SA. This set
      of operations performed by the key manager on its internal
      structures is initiated by the MIPv6 process.
</p>
<p>With the extension, the bootstrapping of the MN appears as a
      common operation for IKE, by having the right addresses needed
      for the negotiation available prior to its beginning (i.e. at
      the reception of the PF_KEY ACQUIRE message by the IKE
      daemon). 
</p>
<p>The extension is helpful for assuring smooth interworking
      between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and achieving performance
      optimization: upon movement, both sides (MN and HA) locally
      notify the IPsec stack and the key manager of the new CoA, thus
      preventing the need to flush and renegotiate existing SA.
</p>
<p> As stated in the abstract, this document is heavily based on
      the content of a previous draft <a class='info' href='#MIGRATE'>MIGRATE<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sugimoto, S., Nakamura, M., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;PF_KEY Extension as an Interface between Mobile IPv6 	  and IPsec/IKE,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [MIGRATE].
      This expired memo served as the basis for this work both from
      technical and editorial standpoints. Numerous technical
      discussions with some of its authors took place while working on
      this memo and associated implementations.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p> In this document, the term IKE implicitly stands for both
      IKEv1 <a class='info' href='#RFC2409'>[RFC2409]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harkins, D. and D. Carrel, &ldquo;The Internet Key Exchange (IKE),&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and IKEv2
      <a class='info' href='#RFC5996'>[RFC5996]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., Hoffman, P., Nir, Y., and P. Eronen, &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. IKEv2 terminology is used
      preferentially when describing actions performed by the key
      manager but they also apply to the IKEv1 counterparts. For
      instance, when actions occur on IKE_SA, they also apply to
      ISAKMP SA for IKEv1, except otherwise specified. The terms "IKE
      daemon" and "Key Manager (KM)" are used interchangeably in the
      document.
</p>
<p> The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	  described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key Words for Use in RFCs to Indicate              Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Needs for Interactions between Mobile IPv6 and
		    IPsec/IKE</h3>

<p> Sections 4.4 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	  Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC4877'>[RFC4877]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V. and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised IPsec 	  Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
      specify the rules which apply to IKE for MN and HA. The
      first requirement is to run IKE over the Care-of Address because
      the Home Address is usable only after the home registration but
      not yet in the bootstrapping phase, when Transport mode IPsec SA
      are commonly negotiated to protect BU/BA.
</p>
<p> A tunnel IPsec SA pair protects some signaling messages and
      optionally all the traffic between the MN and HA.  The initial
      SPD entry uses the HoA for the MN endpoint address and updates
      this address to the new CoA at each movement.  A tunnel SA pair
      is created on demand and is updated too. <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>RFC 3775<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3775] assumes there is an API which
      performs the update in the SPD and SAD on both the MN and HA,
      and notify the IKE daemon. This memo proposes such an API based
      on PF_KEY framework both to document the needs and ease
      interoperability between components which may be provided by
      different vendors.
</p>
<p> Mobile IPv6 may need to make an access to the SPD not only
      for updating an endpoint address but also for deleting/inserting
      a specific SPD entry. When the MN performs Foreign-to-Home
      movement, IPsec SA established between the MN and HA to protect
      data traffic should be deleted, and associated SPD
      entries should have no effect anymore. On the other hand, when
      the MN performs Home-to-Foreign movement, those IPsec SP should
      be restored. Hence security policy entries that are associated
      with tunnel mode SA may dynamically be added/removed

System Overview</h3>

<p> The MIGRATE message is used for providing
          updated information to its two targets, the kernel IPsec
          stack and the key manager (when used). The figure below
          illustrates how Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE components
          interact with each other using PF_KEY MIGRATE message in a
          dynamic keying scenario. On left top is a Mobile IPv6 entity
          (it may be possible that Mobile IPv6 component is completely
          implemented inside the kernel). In any case, Mobile IPv6
          should be the one issuing the MIGRATE message. On right
          top is an IKE daemon which is responsible for establishing
          SA required for Mobile IPv6 operation. In a manual keying
          scenario, the difference is mainly that there is no IKE
          daemon running on the system.

<p> In the kernel, the primary role of PF_KEY MIGRATE
          message is to change the endpoint addresses of SA,
	  i.e. requesting IPsec to update its databases (SPD and SAD).
	  Even if tunnel mode is the primary target for MIPv6, MIGRATE
	  is not limited to that mode. Then, after proper processing by
	  the kernel, the MIGRATE message is sent to all open PF_KEY
	  socket. A listening key manager processes it , which results
	  in a possible update of its internal structures.  The
	  specific actions are introduced on the following figure.

</pre></div>
<p> In more details, the processing of a MIGRATE message can
	  be divided in following steps:<br />
<br />


	    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Mobile IPv6 issues a PF_KEY MIGRATE message to the
	      PF_KEY socket. 
</li>
<li> The operating system (kernel IPsec stack) validates
	      the message and checks if corresponding security policy
	      entry exists in SPD. 
</li>
<li> When the message is confirmed to be valid, the SPD
              entry is updated according to the MIGRATE message. If
              there is any target SA found that is also target of the
              update, it is also updated. This is detailed in <a class='info' href='#processing'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Processing PF_KEY MIGRATE Message</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li> After the MIGRATE has been successfully processed
              inside the kernel, it is sent to all open PF_KEY
              sockets. 
</li>
<li> The IKE daemon receives the MIGRATE message from its
              PF_KEY socket and validates it. 
</li>
<li> The key manager starts by updating the SP entries
              described in the message with the updated endpoint
              information. It also updates in its SPD image the local
              and remote addresses to be used for future negotiation
              of SA associated with those SP (addresses used by future
              IKE_SA). Then, it updates the SA related information:
              the endpoints of already negotiated SA and the local and
              remote values of associated IKE_SA. 
</li>
</ul><p>
	  
</p>
<p> Note that the way IKE maintains its local copy of SPD
          (the SPD image) is an implementation specific issue since
          there is no standard interface to access SPD. Some IKE
          implementations may continuously monitor the SPD inside the
          kernel. Some IKE implementation may expect notifications from
          the kernel when the SPD is modified. In  either way, the
          proposed mechanism gives a chance for IKE to keep its SPD
          image up-to-date which is significant in Mobile IPv6
          operation.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2.&nbsp;
Bootstrapping</h3>

<p> In the bootstrapping stage of Mobile IPv6, the MN and the
        HA need to establish IPsec SA to protect signaling messages of
        Mobile IPv6 such as BU and BA. When IKE is used to establish
        and maintain the SA pairs, the IKE negotiation is the very
        first transaction made between the MN and the HA. 
</p>
<p> As mentioned in <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	  Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, some care is
        needed for the address management during IKE negotiations in
        Mobile IPv6 environments. In particular, IKE negotiation to be
        made to establish a transport mode IPsec SA pair is tricky
        because the local IKE_SA address and the SA endpoint on the MN
        side (the Home Address) are different. This is because the
        Home Address cannot be used prior to the initial home
        registration. SADB_X_EXT_KMADDRESS extension defined in this
	memo enables the MIPv6 module to notify the IKE module about
	the IKE endpoints.
</p>
<p> A simple solution to make the key manager aware that a
        different address must be used for the negotiation of SA is to
        have it record this address within its mirrored SPD entries as
        soon as it becomes available. With that information, the key
	manager is able to inflect its usual processing where it
	selects by default the source address of the SA for the
	negotiation (i.e. as local address of the IKE_SA). By having
	the MIGRATE message emitted by the Mobile IPv6 process before
	the emission of the BU, the address is already available to
	the key manager when the ACQUIRE message is received. 
</p>
<p> Even if the bootstrapping process initially appears
        differently than the usual process, having the internal
        structure of the key manager explicitly record the address (to
        be used for the negotiation of the SA for a specific SP)
        allows to keep things simple. The only requirement is that the
        MIGRATE message be emitted by the Mobile IPv6 process before
        it sends its Binding Update.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3.&nbsp;
Movement</h3>

<p> Next, we will see how migration takes place along with
        home registration. The figure below shows a sequence of mobility
        signaling and PF_KEY MIGRATE messages while the MN roams
        around links. It is assumed that in the initial state the
        tunnel endpoint address for a given MN is set as its home
        address. In the initial home registration, the MN and HA
        migrate the tunnel endpoint address from the HoA to CoA1. It
        should be noted that no migration takes place when the MN
        performs re-registration since the care-of address remains the
        same. Accordingly, the MN performs movement and changes its
        primary care-of address from CoA1 to CoA2. A PF_KEY MIGRATE
        message is issued both on MN and HA for each direction.  When
        the MN returns home, migration takes place updating the
	endpoint address with the MN's home address. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the timing of issuing the MIGRATE message
        on the MN during a handover, it must occur immediately
        before the emission of the binding update performing the home
        registration (as for bootstrapping). It is possible that
        ESP-protected (IPsec tunneled) user traffic be sent from the
        new CoA which is not known to the HA yet. As the HA processes
        the packets protected under IPsec, and as far as it finds a
	valid SA, then those packets will be authenticated regardless
	of their source IP address. In the end, there is no security
	issue in updating the IPsec SA endpoint while sending the BU
	and no reason not to do it. Furthermore, this may help the MN
	to minimize the packet loss of its outbound traffic during the
        handover.

	the local and remote addresses of the IKE_SA (used by already
	negotiated SA associated with the SP). 
</p>
<p> Selector information is required to specify the target
        SPD entry to be updated. Basically the information should
        contain necessary elements which characterize traffic selector
        as specified in the IPsec architecture
        (<a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, &ldquo;Security Architecture 	  for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>[RFC4301]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>). With
        regard to the upper layer protocol, when the Mobile IPv6 stack
        is not fully aware of IPsec configuration, a wildcard value
        can be given. In such case, an upper layer protocol
        information SHOULD NOT be taken into account for searching SPD
        entry. Plus, the direction of the security policy
        (inbound/outbound) SHOULD be provided. 
</p>
<p> The old SA information, along with old locator information
        is used to specify target SA to be updated. For tunnel mode, the
        endpoint addresses refer to the source and destination IP
        addresses that appear in the IP header, and those should be
        provided by the MIGRATE message. For transport mode, we
        require it to be present to keep a fixed message format. For
        all modes, the address information represents the locators of
        the SA. For transport mode, it must match the addresses
        provided in the selector. For tunnel mode, it is obviously not
        required. 
</p>
<p> The source and destination addresses (locators) of the
	target entry should be overwritten. New locator values should
	also be used to update SP. Note that the IPsec protocol and
	mode fields SHOULD NOT be updated by a PF_KEY MIGRATE
	message. 
</p>
<p> A PF_KEY MIGRATE message should be formed, based on
        security policy configuration and binding record.  The
        selector information and some parts of the SA information
        (IPsec protocol and mode) should be taken from the policy
        configuration. The rest of the information should be taken
        from the sequential binding information. For example, in the
        case where the MN updates its inbound security policy and
        corresponding tunnel mode SA pair, the old source address
        should be set as its previous CoA, and the new source address
        should be set as its current CoA. Hence, the MN should
        sequentially keep track of its CoA record. Such information
        shall be stored in binding update list entry. For the same
        reason, the HA should keep track of previous CoAs of MNs. Such
        information shall be stored in binding cache entry. In
        previous scenario, the source and destination entries of the
        address information for the key manager should respectively be
        set to the CoA and the address of the HA. 
</p>
<p> A detailed format of MIGRATE message is provided in
	Appendix A.

Processing PF_KEY MIGRATE Message</h3>

<p> Since a PF_KEY MIGRATE message is applied to a single SPD
	entry, the kernel should first check validity of the
	message. During this process, the content of sadb_x_kmaddress
	structure is skipped, because its content is intended for the
	key manager and is simply relayed by the kernel.
</p>
<p>If the message is invalid, an EINVAL error
        MUST be returned as a return value for the write() operation
        made to the PF_KEY socket.  After the validation, the kernel
        checks if the target SPD entry really exists. If no entry  is
        found, an ENOENT error MUST be returned. If a SPD entry is
        found and successfully updated, a success (0) MUST be returned
        regardless of subsequent result of SAD lookup/update. Note
        that there may be cases where a corresponding SAD entry does
        not exist even if a SPD entry is successfully updated. In any
        error case, a PF_KEY MIGRATE message MUST NOT have any effect
        on the SPD and SAD. 
</p>
<p> With respect to the behavior of a normal process
        (including the IKE daemon) which receives a PF_KEY MIGRATE
        message from a PF_KEY socket, it SHOULD first check if the
        message does not include erroneous information.  When there is
        any error indicated, the process MUST silently discard the
        PF_KEY MIGRATE message. Otherwise, the processing of the
        message may continue. This implies that the kernel is the only
        entity responsible for returning a status regarding message
        validation.

Limitations of PF_KEY MIGRATE</h3>

<p> A Security Parameter Index (SPI) is not
        included in the old SA information to specify target SAD
        entry.  This helps to lessen operational burden of Mobile
        IPv6.  However, this simplification can produce ambiguity in
        searching for the target security association entry.  When the
        unique SPD level is available, it should be used because it
        avoids this problem both by marking the SA to update and by
        limiting SA sharing.
</p>
<p> It should be noted that delivery of PF_KEY MIGRATE
        messages cannot be guaranteed, which is common to other PF_KEY
        messages. It may be possible (even if highly unlikely) that a
        MIGRATE message be lost. In such case, there will be
        inconsistency between the binding record managed by Mobile
        IPv6 and IPsec database inside the kernel or the IKE
        daemon. 

	Once a PF_KEY MIGRATE message is lost, it would not be
        possible for the receiver to process some subsequent MIGRATE
        messages properly. Reinitialization of the Mobile IPv6 stack
        and IPsec databases may be needed for recovery.

Necessary Modifications to Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE</h3>

<p> In order to realize the proposed mechanism, there are some
      necessary modifications to Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE. They are
      listed below for implementors of Mobile IPv6 and/or
      IPsec/IKE.<br />
<br />


	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Modifications to Mobile IPv6:
	    
<ul class="text">
<li> The Mobile IPv6 code needs to make an access to
		PF_KEY socket. In particular, the Mobile IPv6 code
		should have privilege to write messages into a PF_KEY
		socket. 
</li>
<li> Issuing PF_KEY MIGRATE messages: in order to send
                MIGRATE messages, it is required that the Mobile IPv6
                code has some knowledge of its IPsec configuration and
                precise binding record. The Mobile IPv6 code may be
                aware of exact IPsec configuration in form of security
                policy. It would also be possible that the Mobile IPv6
                code is only aware of minimum IPsec configuration
                whether IPsec is used or not. 
</li>
<li> With regard to the emission of the MIGRATE message
		during the home registration, the Mobile IPv6 code
		need to emit it before issuing the Binding
		Update. 
</li>
</ul>
	  
</li>
<li> Modifications to IPsec stack: 
	    
<ul class="text">
<li> Processing PF_KEY MIGRATE messages: the kernel
		should be able to process PF_KEY MIGRATE messages sent

</li>
</ul>

Implementation</h3>

<p> The mechanism described in this memo has been implemented for

<br />

      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Linux kernel IPsec stack: the mechanism is fully
	implemented since version 2.6.28 (released in December 2008)
	both for PF_KEY (as described in this memo) and Linux native

	in-kernel XFRM transformation framework (basis of the IPsec
	stack).
</li>
<li>UMIP (Linux Mobile IPv6 Daemon): the mechanism is fully
	supported for years. Details and documentation are available
	at http://umip.org. Linux native interface (Netlink) is used
	by UMIP to pass MIGRATE message to the kernel which passes it
	after processing to registered (PF_KEY and Netlink/XFRM)
	key managers. 
</li>
<li>Racoon IKEv1 daemon: the mechanism is fully supported and

Conclusion</h3>

<p>
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> There is a need for Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE to interact
          with each other to provide full support of IPsec security
          functions.
</li>
<li> An extension to the PF_KEY framework (PF_KEY MIGRATE
	  message) is proposed, which makes it possible:
	  
<ul class="text">
<li> for the IPsec/IKE to migrate endpoint addresses IPsec SA
              from one to another.
</li>
<li>to make the source address to be used by the key manager for
	      SA negotiation available before it is needed.
</li>
<li> to update addresses of IKE_SA after movement.
</li>
</ul>
	
</li>
<li> An additional requirement associated with the solution for
	  IKE is the addition in SPD image of additional per-SP hints
	  to be used as addresses for negotiation of SA.
</li>
<li> Currently, large portion of the proposed mechanism is
	  implementation dependent due to lack of standard interface to
	  access the SPD (PF_POLICY?).

<p> The figure below shows the message format of PF_KEY MIGRATE.
	The message consists of 7 parts (boundary of each part is
	marked with ">").  The message starts with PF_KEY base message
	header directly followed by a sadb_x_kmaddress{}
	structure. The extension holds the two IKE_SA local and remote
	addresses as opaque data for the key manager (two 64-bit

	extensions: those respectively hold source and destination
	addresses of the selector. The rest of the message is specific
	to IPsec implementations on BSD and Linux. sadb_x_policy{}
	structure holds additional information of security policy.
	The last part of the message is a pair of
	sadb_x_ipsecrequest{} structures that hold old and new SA
	information.
