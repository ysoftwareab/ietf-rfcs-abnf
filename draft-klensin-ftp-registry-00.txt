Abstract

   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
   with the early ones summarized in RFC 959.  RFC 2389 established a
   mechanism for specifying and negotiating FTP extensions.  As the
   number of those extensions increases, it appears useful to establish
   an IANA registry to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and
   the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that
   registry.

Internet-Draft           FTP Extension Registry                July 2008


1.  Introduction

   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
   with the early ones summarized in RFC 959 [RFC0959] RFC 2389
   [RFC2389] established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating
   extensions to the FTP protocol specified in RFC 959 [RFC0959].  As
   the number of those extensions increases, it appears useful to
   establish an IANA registry to reduce the likelihood of conflict of
   names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes
   that registry.

1.1.  Discussion List

   [[anchor3: RFC Editor: please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   Until and unless a WG is created, this proposal will be discussed on
   the list apps-discuss@ietf.org


2.  Registry Definition

2.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is "FTP Extensions".

2.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish an FTP extensions registry whose
   entries should include the following:

   Command Name  The FTP command, either new or modified, used in the
      extension.

   Description  A brief description of the extension.

   Parameters  A listing and brief description of any parameters
      associated with the extension.

   FEAT String  The string expected to be included in the response to
      the FEAT command (see RFC 2389) if the extension is supported.

   Reference  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the
      extension.

2.3.  Initial Contents of Registry

   ... ???  To be supplied ...


3.  Acknowledgments

   Any work to update or extend FTP depends on the base specification in
   RFC 959.  The contributions of its editors, Jon Postel and Joyce
   Reynolds, are gratefully acknowledged.  The option negotiation
   mechanism specified in RFC 2389 and the accumulation of features that
   has followed it made this registry relevant; the authors of those
   documents are acknowledged as well.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish the registry described in Section 2.

   New entries should be added to this registry when extensions to FTP
   are approved or defined in published RFCs.  In other words, the
   requirement for registration is "RFC Required" [RFC5226].
   [[anchor7: Note in Draft: Is there any reason to cut this back to
   "Specification Required" and specify a Designated Expert process?]]


5.  Security Considerations

   The creation of this registry provides improved documentation and
   protection against interoperability problems.  It introduces no new
   security issues.
