   Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) is an Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) representation for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   specifications.  This document specifies the ASN.X representation of
   encoding instructions for the Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER).

1.  Introduction

   Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) [ASN.X] is an Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) [XML10] representation for Abstract Syntax Notation
   One (ASN.1) [X.680] specifications.  The ASN.X representation for the
   ASN.1 basic notation [X.680] [X.680-1] is described elsewhere
   [ASN.X].

   The grammar of ASN.1 also permits the application of encoding
   instructions [X.680-1], through type prefixes and encoding control
   sections, that modify how abstract values are encoded by nominated
   encoding rules.

   The generic notation for type prefixes and encoding control sections
   is defined by the ASN.1 basic notation, however the notation for
   specific encoding instructions i.e., the EncodingInstruction and
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList productions of the notation, are
   defined separately for each set of encoding rules using encoding
   instructions.  This document specifies the ASN.X representation for
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList and EncodingInstruction as they are
   defined for the Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER) [GSER][GSEREI].

   ASN.X is defined in terms of rules for translating from an ASN.1
   specification.  This does not preclude an ASN.X document being
   written directly without a pre-existing ASN.1 specification, however
   such an ASN.X document is considered valid if and only if there
   exists, in principle, an ASN.1 specification that when translated
   would yield the ASN.X document.

   By design, an ASN.X document is also the Robust XML Encoding Rules
   (RXER) [RXER] encoding of an ASN.1 abstract value.  The ASN.1 type
   definitions for such abstract values, insofar as they pertain to the
   ASN.1 basic notation, are provided elsewhere [ASN.X], however this
   document provides the ASN.1 type definitions for representing GSER
   encoding instructions as abstract values.  These definitions appear

   in Appendix A.

   The ASN.X translation of the ASN.1 module in Appendix A is presented
   in Appendix B.

   The General Considerations of the specification for ASN.X [ASN.X]
   also apply here.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED" and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in, BCP 14, RFC 2119 [BCP14].  The key
   word "OPTIONAL" is exclusively used with its ASN.1 meaning.

   A reference to an ASN.1 production [X.680] (e.g., Type, NamedType) is
   a reference to the text in an ASN.1 specification corresponding to
   that production.

   The description of the translation of GSER encoding instructions into
   ASN.X makes use of definitions from the XML Information Set (Infoset)
   [ISET].  In particular, information item property names follow the
   Infoset convention of being shown in square brackets, e.g.,
   [local name].  In the sections that follow, "information item" will
   be abbreviated to "item", e.g., "element information item" is
   abbreviated to "element item".  Element items will be referred to by
   their [local name] in angle brackets, e.g., "the <type> element item"
   means the element item with the [local name] "type".

3.  EncodingInstructionAssignmentList Translation

   As described in the specification for ASN.X [ASN.X], the translation
   of an EncodingControlSection for GSER is an element item with the
   [local name] "GSER".  The translation of the
   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList in such an EncodingControlSection
   determines the content of the <GSER> element item.

   The EncodingInstructionAssignmentList for GSER is currently defined
   to be empty [GSEREI] therefore the [attributes] and [children] of the
   <GSER> element item are both empty.

4.  EncodingInstruction Translation

   The translation of an EncodingInstruction for GSER can appear in an
   EncodingPrefix.  The translation for an EncodingPrefix is described
   by the specification for ASN.X.

   The translation of an EncodingInstruction for GSER is the translation

INTERNET-DRAFT      ASN.X: GSER Encoding Instructions   October 20, 2006


   of the contained ChoiceOfStringsInstruction (currently the only
   defined encoding instruction for GSER).

4.1.  ChoiceOfStringsInstruction Translation

   The translation of a ChoiceOfStringsInstruction is an element item
   with the [local name] "choiceOfStrings".

   If the ChoiceOfStringsInstruction has a PrecedenceList, then an
   attribute item with the [local name] "precedence" SHALL be added to
   the [attributes] of the <choiceOfStrings> element item.  The
   [normalized value] of this attribute item is the white space
   separated list of the RXER encodings [RXER] of the effective names
   [RXEREI] of the NamedType instances corresponding to the identifiers
   in the PrecedenceList.

   Example

      [GSER:CHOICE-OF-STRINGS PRECEDENCE utf8 visible] CHOICE {
          visible  [RXER:NAME "ascii"] VisibleString,
          utf8     UTF8String
      }

      <type xmlns:asnx="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:asnx">
       <prefixed>
        <GSER><choiceOfStrings precedence="utf8 ascii"/></GSER>
        <type>
         <choice>
          <element name="ascii" identifier="visible"
                   type="asnx:VisibleString"/>
          <element name="utf8" type="asnx:UTF8String"/>
         </choice>
        </type>
       </prefixed>
      </type>

5.  Security Considerations

   The ASN.X translation of a GSER encoding instruction is semantically
   equivalent to the original GSER encoding instruction.  The security
   considerations that apply to an application built from an original
   ASN.1 specification with GSER encoding instructions apply equally to
   an application built from the ASN.X translation of the ASN.1
   specification.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

   The <encodingControl-GSER> element has been renamed to <GSER> and now
   appears as a child element of an <encodingControls> element.

   An insertion encoding instruction has been added to the ASN.1 for
   GSER Encoding Instruction Notation to remove extension ambiguity.

Changes in Draft 02

   The URL for the ASN.1 namespace has been replaced.  A permanent URN
