                   UDP payload size for DNS messages
                      draft-madi-dnsop-udp4dns-00

Abstract

   The classic 512-bytes UDP payload for transporting DNS messages is an
   embedded dependence on IPv4.  As the Internet infrastructure is
   evolving to IPv6, the very constraint stemming from IPv4 can be
   removed by the virtue of that IPv6 mandates a MTU of 1280 bytes.
   This document specifies a new minimum size of UDP packet to carry DNS
   message, making DNS implementations going forward more adaptive to
   both applications based on the Internet and infrastructures
   supporting the Internet.

1.  Introduction

   Over the years, the size of DNS response message has increased beyond
   the IPv4 MTU, in part because DNSSEC aware DNS servers will
   automatically attempt to return KEY resources as additional
   information, along with those resource records actually requested
   [RFC2535].  IPv6 records also increase the size of the response,
   along with NAPTR and other record types.  Other new functions added
   to DNS may also bring in more data in DNS responses in the days to
   come.

   The classic 512-bytes UDP payload for transporting DNS messages is an
   embedded dependence on IPv4.  As the Internet infrastructure is
   evolving to IPv6 [ipv6-info], the very constraint stemming from IPv4
   can be removed by the virtue of that IPv6 mandates a MTU of 1280
   bytes.  A larger minimum size of DNS PDU would be more adaptive to
   variable infrastructure evolution and reflects the evolving nature of
   IP transmission.

   This document specifies a new minimum size of UDP packet to carry DNS
   message, making DNS implementations going forward more adaptive to
   both applications based on the Internet and infrastructures
   supporting the Internet.

2.  DNS over larger UDP

   This section explicitly specifies the new minimum size of UDP packet
   for DNS messages, updating the 512-UDP limitation.

   1232 bytes is the minimum size of UDP payload for DNS messages,
   according to the IPv6 MTU specifications.  That is, in addition to
   40- bytes IPv6 header and 8-bytes UDP header, the minimum
   transportation capacity that an IPv6 packet offers to application
   layer is 1232 bytes.

   Based on this enhancement, DNS message exchanges will enjoy a larger
   capacity of protocol data unit, decreasing the number of IP packets,
   which account for some of the increase in the level of the traffic
   processed by intermediate devices along the path of DNS query/
   response exchanges.  DNS software and intermediate devices must
   support 1232 bytes as the minimum size of UDP payload for DNS
   messages.

3.  Backward compatibility

   This section presents considerations on some compatibility issues due
   to the new minimum size of UDP payload for DNS messages.  Yet
   solutions to these issues are out of scope of this document.

3.1.  Networking

   IPv4 will coexist with IPv6 for a long time.  This proposal MUST work
   well with IPv4 infrastructure, relating to packet process by
   intermediate devices and MTU along the path in question.  As
   expected, nonconformant networks will see 1232-bytes as anomaly.

   Some observations, described in the appendix, indicate that 1232-
   bytes will be a safe minimum size of UDP payload for DNS messages in
   IPv4 environments.

3.2.  DNS Implementations

   An embedded dependence on IPv4 MTU, the classic 512-bytes UDP payload
   for transporting DNS messages is bound with some DNS implementations.
   Obsoleting the classic 512-bytes UDP payload would therefore
   introduce some incompatibility.  Priming exchange, among others, may
   see some problems.  Priming exchange is now done with the assumption
   that all DNS response should fit into the classic 512-bytes UDP
   payload.  Given a root server is of dual-stack, receiving priming
   queries based on 1232-bytes UDP payload, a classic DNS implementation
   MAY see this kind of packet as anomaly to ignore or it needs to know

   how to truncate the message to get DNS query or it needs to negotiate
   with recursive servers to reinitiate the very process somehow.

   TBD

Appendix A.  Experiments

   This section is to describe a set of tests to ascertain the
   limitation for a DNS message along its path as with current
   networking environments.

A.1.  Method

   To carry out the very tests for DNS message MTU, a client and a
   server are implemented with Python and Erlang.  The client is
   programmed to send both non-semantically UDP packets and DNS packets
   with no EDNS0 indicator respectively, by comparison.  The UDP payload
   of all the sent packets is designed to be more 512 bytes and sent
   with increasingly larger size with variable bytes, 32 or 16 for
   instance, as a step.  While the functionality of the very server is
   listen on 53 ports and 5333 port (other than traditional DNS port)
   and bounce the received packets to the client.  The corresponding
   client is therefore able to know whether its sent packets could
   travel through networks to the server.

   Two servers are deployed in Beijing, one's upstream ISP is China
   Science & Technology network and the other's is China Unicom.  In
   order to gain diversity, clients are deployed at ZDNS in Beijing,
   TWNIC in Taipei, local ISP in Chengdu, China Mobile in Beijing, TCI
   in Moscow and JPRS in Tokyo.  The tests were carried out in alignment
   with the combination of servers and clients.

A.2.  Observations

   As with the current networking conditions, a DNS message can safely
   pass the overwhelming majority of the intermediate devices along its
   path, as long as it is with no bigger than 1472 bytes size.

   As with observed, generally, firewalls block DNS messages that will
   lead to IP fragmentation.
