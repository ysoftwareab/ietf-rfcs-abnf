Abstract

   This document describes an Application Data Model (ADM) for a Bundle
   Protocol Agent (BPA).  This ADM identifies the Primitive Values,
   Computed values, Reports, Controls, Macros, Literals, Operators, and
   meta-data associated with a BPA.  The information outlined in this
   document MUST be supported by any software claiming to act as a
   managed BPA within the Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP).

1.  Introduction

   An Application Data Model (ADM) provides a guaranteed interface for
   the management of an application or protocol over the Asynchronous
   Management Protocol [AMP] that is independent of the nuances of its
   software implementation.  In this respect, the ADM is conceptually
   similar to the Managed Information Base (MIB) used by SNMP, but
   contains additional information relating to command opcodes and more
   expressive syntax for automated behavior.

   Agents within the Asynchronous Management Architecture [AMA]
   represent applications running on managed devices that are
   responsible for implementing the AMA services of configuration,
   reporting, control, and administration.  These agents provide the
   mechanism through which applications and protocols are managed
   through the AMP.

   Bundle Protocol Agents (BPAs) are software instances that implement
   functionality required by the Bundle Protocol ([RFC5050]).  The BPA
   ADM provides the set of information known to an AMP Agent for the
   management of a BPA via the AMP.

1.1.  Technical Notes

   o  This document describes Version 0.1 of the BP ADM.

   o  The OID Root for this ADM is NOT correctly set.  A sample OID Root
      is used in this version of the specification and MAY change in
      future versions of this ADM.

   o  Currently, ADMs are organizing documents and not used to
      automatically generate software.  Future versions of this ADM
      should include a specification in a data modeling language (such
      as YANG) to better enable software generation.

   o  Agent applications MAY choose to ignore the name, description, or
      OID information associated with the component definitions within
      this ADM as these items are only used to provide human-readable
      information associated with user interfaces and may not be
      necessary on a deployed managed device.

1.2.  Scope

   This ADM specifies the globally unique identifiers and descriptions
   for all Values, Controls, Literals, and Operators associated with BPA
   management via an AMP Agent.

   Any BPA implementation claiming compliance with the BP ADM MUST
   compute all identified primitive data when requested by an AMP Agent.
   Also, any BPA implementation claiming compliance with the BPA ADM
   MUST execute all identified controls when requested by an AMP Agent.

   Any AMP Agent claiming to support the BPA ADM must compute all
   identifier data, perform identified controls/operators, and
   understand identified literals/metadata.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  OID Tree Identification

   The Managed Identifiers (MIDs) used with this ADM encapsulate OIDs
   within a globally managed OID tree.  The OID node from which all of
   the MIDs in this specification derive is called the "BP ADM OID
   Root".  This section identifies this root in the overall OID tree.

   NOTE: This version of the BP ADM uses a proxy BP ADM Root that has
   NOT been assigned.  The BP ADM Root in this version of the document
   is only used for experimental purposes and MAY change before the
   final release of this specification.

                          OID Tree Identification

   The subtree under the BP ADM OID ROOT contains eight subbranches that
   capture metadata, Primitive Values, Computed Values, Reports,
   Controls, Literals, Macros, and Operators as illustrated in Figure 1.

2.1.  Nicknames

   The following managed nicknames are provided to generate compressed
   OIDs within the AMP.  Compressed OIDs enable shortening of common
   subtrees into a single numerical identifier to avoid the significant
   repetition incumbent with using OIDs from a common subtree.  The
   nicknames defined by this ADM are given in Table 1.

2.2.  OID Shorthand

   The components in this specification are identified by their AMP MID
   value.  However, for easier traceability back to the OIDs
   encapsulated in MIDs, an OID string is also provided for each
   component.  These OID strings are provided in a shorthand that makes
   use of the nicknames defined in Table 1 and uses the form
   [nickname].relative-oid.

   For example, the OID String [14].3.2.1 corresponds to the OID
   2B060102030104030201, with 2B060102030104 being the expansion of
   nickname 14 and 030201 being the relative OID.

3.  Metadata Definitions

   ADM metadata consists of the items necessary to uniquely identify the
   ADM to Managers within the AMA.  This includes items such as the name
   of the ADM, its version, and any nicknames used within the ADM.

   Primitive Value definitions represent those values that MUST be
   collected by the BPA.  Changing or updating Primitive Value
   definitions requires making changes to the BPA application and/ or
   its supporting firmware.

                       Table 3: BPA Primitive Values

5.  Computed Values

   The BP ADM defines no computed values.

6.  Reports

   A Report is a listing of data items including Primitive Value
   definitions, Computed Value definitions, and other Reports returned
   from an AMP Agent.  Similar to Computed Values, Report definitions
   are captured as a MID Collection (MC), which is the ordered set of
   MIDs identifying individual data items that comprise the report.

7.  Controls

   Controls represent well-known command opcodes that can be run by the
   Agent in response to direct requests by an AMP Manager, or in
   response to time- or state-based rules on the Agent itself.

7.2.  Control Specification

7.2.1.  Overview

   This section lists the description, parameters, and reports generated
   for each Control specified in this ADM.

   The "DESCRIPTION" section lists the functional requirements of the
   Control when run on an Agent.

   The "PARAMETERS" section illustrates and describes the ordered set of
   data items provided to the Control, when run on the Agent.  A
   parameterized Control is represented in the AMP by a MID
   encapsulating a parameterized OID.  OID parameters are captured as a
   Data Collection (DC).
   The DC capturing these parameters is elided for clarity, as the DC is
   only the container used to transmit the parameters between the Agent
   and Manager and not expected as input to the Control itself.

   The "REPORTS GENERATED" section describes the format of any Reports
   sent from the Agent to a Manager as a result of running the Control.
   This section ONLY describes Reports that are specific to the Control.
   Cases where policy requires Agents to send summary Reports when
   Controls either run or fail to run due to error, are not considered
   in this section as they are not specific to any one Control.  Any
   Control summary reports should be as described in [AMP].
   Reports generated on an Agent by a Control will either be directly
   sent to the Manager executing the Control or otherwise batched and
   send with other Reports destined for the receiving Manager.  This
   behavior will be based on the policy associated with the AMP Agent
   and is not specified in this ADM.

7.2.2.1.  ResetAllCounts

   DESCRIPTION
        The ResetAllCounts control causes the Agent to reset all counts
        associated with bundle or byte statistics and to set the Last
        Reset Time of the BP Primitive Data to the time when the control
        was run.

   PARAMETERS
        This control does not take any parameters.

   REPORTS GENERATED
        This control does not produce any reports.

8.  Literals

   The BP ADM does not define any literals.

9.  Macros

   The BP ADM does not define any macros.

10.  Operators

   The BP ADM does not define any operators.

11.  IANA Considerations

   At this time, this protocol has no fields registered by IANA.
