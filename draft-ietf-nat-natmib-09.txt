1.  Introduction


   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for devices implementing NAT function. This MIB module may be used
   for configuration as well as monitoring of a device capable
   of NAT function. This MIB does not address the firewall functions
   and must not be used for configuring or monitoring the same.
   Section 2 provides references to the SNMP management
   framework, which was used as the basis for the MIB module definition.
   Section 3 describes the terms used throughout the document. Section
   4 provides an overview of the key objects, their inter-relationship
   and how the MIB module may be used to configure and monitor a NAT
   device. Lastly, section 5 has the complete NAT MIB definition.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].



3.  Terminology


   Definitions for majority of the terms used throughout the document
   may be found in RFC 2663 [RFC2663]. Additional terms that further
   classify NAPT implementations are defined in RFC 3489 [RFC3489]. 
   Listed below are terms used in this document.


   Symmetric NAT - Symmetric NAT, as defined in RFC 3489 [RFC3489] is
   a variation of Network Address Port Translator (NAPT) in that 
   Symmetric NAT does not use port bind for translation across all 
   sessions originating from the same private host. Instead, it assigns
   a new public port to each new session, irrespective of whether the
   new session used the same private end-point as before or not.
 
   Bind - Several variations of the term 'bind' are used throughout
   the document. Address-bind is a tuple of (Private IP address,
   Public IP Address) used for translating an IP address end-point in
   IP packets. Address-port-bind (or simply, Port-bind) is a tuple of
   (transport protocol, Private IP address, Private port, Public IP
   Address, Public port) used for translating a port end-point tuple
   of (transport protocol, IP address, port). Bind is used to refer to
   one of address-bind or port-bind. Bind-Mode identifies whether a
   bind is address-bind or port-bind.


   NAT Session - A NAT session is an association between a session
   as seen in the private realm and a session as seen in the public
   realm, by virtue of NAT translation. If a session in the private
   realm were to be represented as (PrivateSrcAddr, PrivateDstAddr,
   TransportProtocol, PrivateSrcPort, PrivateDstPort) and the
   same session in the public realm were to be represented as
   (PublicSrcAddr, PublicDstAddr, TransportProtocol, PublicSrcPort,
   PublicDstPort), the NAT session will provide the translation
   glue between the two session representations.


   The terms 'local' and 'private' are used interchangeably throughout
   the document when referring to private networks, IP addresses, and
   ports. Likewise, the terms 'global' and 'public' are used 
   interchangeably when referring to public networks, IP addresses,
   and ports.

4.  Overview


   NAT MIB is configurable on per-interface basis and depends in
   several parts on the IF-MIB [RFC2863].


   NAT MIB requires that an interface for which NAT is configured
   be connected to one of private or public realm. The realm 
   association of the interface plays an important role in the 
   definition of address maps for the interface. An address map entry
   identifies the orientation of the session (inbound or outbound to
   the interface) for which the entry may be used for NAT translation.
   The address map entry also identifies the end-point of the session
   which must to be subject to translation. An SNMP Textual-Convention
   'NatTranslationEntity' is defined to capture this important
   characteristic that combines session orientation and applicable
   session endpoint for translation.


   An address map may consist of static or dynamic entries. NAT creates
   static binds from a static address map entry. Each static bind has a
   direct one-to-one relationship with a static address map entry.
   NAT creates dynamic binds from a dynamic address map entry, upon
   seeing the first packet of a new session.


   The following subsections define the key objects used in NAT MIB,
   their inter-relationship and how to configure a NAT device using
   the MIB module.



4.1  natInterfaceTable


   natInterfaceTable is defined in the MIB module to configure
   interface specific realm type and the NAT services enabled
   for the interface. natInterfaceTable is indexed by ifIndex
   and also includes interface specific NAT statistics.


   The first step for an operator in configuring a NAT device
   is determining the interface over which NAT service is to be
   configured. When NAT service is operational, translated packets
   traverse the NAT device by ingressing on a private interface and
   egressing on a public interface or vice versa. An operator may
   configure the NAT service on either the public interface or
   the private interface in the traversal path. 


   As the next step, the operator must identify the NAT service(s)
   desired for the interface. The operator may configure one or more
   NAT services on the same interface. The MIB module identifies four
   types of NAT services, namely Basic-NAT, NAPT, twice NAT and 
   bidirectional NAT. These are NAT varieties as defined in RFC 2663
   [RFC2663]. Note, RFC 3489 [RFC3489] further classifies NAPT
   implementations based on the behavior exhibited by the NAPT devices




Rohit, Srisuresh, Raghunarayan, Pai, Wang                       [Page 4]
INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



   from different vendors. However, the MIB module does not explicitly
   distinguish between the NAPT implementations. NAPT implementations
   may be distinguished between one another by monitoring the BIND and
   NAT-session objects generated by the NAT device as described in 
   section 4.6.



4.2  natAddrMapTable


   natAddrMapTable is defined in the MIB module to configure address
   maps on a per-interface basis. natAddrMapTable is indexed by the
   tuple of (ifIndex, natAddrMapIndex). The same table is also used to
   collect Statistics for the address map entries. Address maps are key
   to NAT configuration. An operator may configure one or more address
   map entries per interface. NAT looks up address map entries in the
   order in which they are defined to determine the translation function
   at the start of each new session traversing the interface. An address
   map may consist of static or dynamic entries. A static address map
   entry has a direct one-to-one relationship with binds. NAT will
   dynamically create binds from a dynamic address map entry.
   
   The operator must be careful in selecting address map entries for an
   interface based on the interface realm-type and the type of NAT
   service desired. The operator can be amiss in the selection of
   address map entries when not paying attention to the associated
   interface characteristics defined in natInterfaceTable (described
   in section 4.1). For example, say the operator wishes to configure
   a NAPT map entry on an interface of a NAT device. If the operator
   chooses to configure the NAPT map entry on a public interface
   (i.e., interface realm-type is public), the operator should set the
   TranslationEntity of the NAPT address map entry to be 
   outboundSrcEndPoint. On the other hand, if the operator chooses to
   configure the NAPT map entry on a private interface (i.e., 
   interface realm-type is private), the operator should set the
   TranslationEntity of the NAPT address map entry to be
   InboundSrcEndPoint.



4.3  Default timeouts, Protocol table and other scalars


   DefTimeouts is defined in the MIB module to configure 
   idle Bind timeout and IP protocol specific idle NAT session
   timeouts. The timeouts defined are global to the system and
   are not interface specific.


   Protocol specific statistics are maintained in natProtocolTable.
   natProtocolTable is indexed by the protocol type.


   The scalars, natAddrBindNumberOfEntries and
   natAddrPortBindNumberOfEntries, hold the number of entries that
   currently exist in the Address bind and the Address-Port bind
   tables respectively.


Rohit, Srisuresh, Raghunarayan, Pai, Wang                       [Page 5]
INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



   The generation of natPacketDiscard notifications
   can be configured using the natNotifThrottlingInterval scalar MIB
   object.



4.4  natAddrBindTable and natAddrPortBindTable


   Two Bind tables, natAddrBindTable and natAddrPortBindTable, are
   defined to hold the bind entries. Entries in the bind tables
   are derived from the address map table and are not configurable.
   natAddrBindTable contains address-binds and natAddrPortBindTable
   contains address-port-binds. natAddrBindTable is indexed by the
   tuple of (ifIndex, LocalAddrType, LocalAddr). natAddrPortBindTable
   is indexed by the tuple of (ifIndex, LocalAddrType, LocalAddr,
   LocalPort, Protocol).  These tables also maintain bind specific
   statistics. A Symmetric NAT will have no entries in the Bind
   tables.



4.5  natSessionTable


   natSessionTable is defined to hold NAT session entries.
   NAT session entries are derived from NAT Binds 
   (except in the case of Symmetric NAT) and are not configurable.
   
   NAT session provides the necessary translation
   glue between two session representations of the same end-to-end
   session. I.e., a session as seen in the private realm and the
   same session as seen in the public realm. Session orientation
   (inbound or outbound) is determined from the orientation of the
   first packet traversing NAT interface. Address map entries and 
   bind entries on the interface determine whether or not a session
   is subject to NAT translation. One or both endpoints of a session
   may be subject to translation.


   With the exception of symmetric NAT, all other NAT functions use
   end-point specific bind to perform individual end-point
   translations. Multiple NAT sessions would use the same bind so
   long as they share the same endpoint. Symmetric NAT does not
   retain a consistent port bind across multiple sessions using the
   same endpoint. For this reason, the bind identifier for a NAT
   session in symmetric NAT is set to zero. natSessionTable is indexed
   by the tuple of (ifIndex, natSessionIndex). Statistics for NAT
   sessions are also maintained in the same table.


4.6  RFC 3489 NAPT variations, NAT session and Bind tables


   [RFC3489] defines four variations of NAPT - Full Cone, Restricted
   Cone, Port Restricted Cone and Symmetric NAT. These can be
   differentiated in the NAT MIB based on different values for the
   objects in the session and the bind tables, as indicated below.



Rohit, Srisuresh, Raghunarayan, Pai, Wang                       [Page 6]
INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



   In a Port-restricted Cone NAT, NAT-session objects will contain
   non-zero PrivateSrcEPBindId object. Further, all address and port
   objects within a NAT session will have non-zero values 
   (i.e., no wild card matches). 


   An address-restricted Cone NAT may have been implemented same as
   Port-restricted Cone NAT, except that the UDP NAT-sessions may use
   ANY match on PrivateDstPort and PublicDstPort objects i.e., 
   PrivateDstPort and PublicDstPort objects within a NAT session may
   be set to zero.


   A full-Cone NAT may have also been implemented same as 
   Port-restricted Cone NAT, except that the UDP NAT-sessions may use
   ANY match on PrivateDstAddr, PrivateDstPort, PublicDstAddr and
   PublicDstPort objects i.e., All four of these objects within a NAT
   session may be set to zero. Alternately, all address and port 
   objects within a NAT session may have non-zero values, yet the
   TranslationEntity of the PrivateSrcEPBindId for the Nat sessions
   may be set bi-directional, i.e., as a bit mask of 
   (outboundSrcEndPoint and inboundDstEndPoint) or (inboundSrcEndPoint
   and outboundDstEndPoint), depending upon interface realm type.


   Lastly, a symmetric NAT does not maintain port bindings. As such, 
   the NAT-session objects will have the PrivateSrcEPBindId set to zero.



4.7  Notifications


   natPacketDiscard notifies the end user/manager of
   packets being discarded due to lack of address mappings.
























Rohit, Srisuresh, Raghunarayan, Pai, Wang                       [Page 7]
INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



4.8  Relation among tables


   The association between the various NAT tables can be represented
   as follows.


                         Interface
                             |
                             |
                             |
                        Address map
                             |
                             |
                             |
        ----------------------------------------------
       |                                              |
       |                                              |
       |                                              |
   Address Bind                                Address Port Bind
       |                                              |
       |                                              |
       |                                              |
        ----------------------------------------------
                             |
                             |
                             |
                         NAT Session



   All NAT functions, with the exception of symmetric NAT,
   use bind(s) to provide the glue necessary for a NAT session.
   natSessionPrivateSrcEPBindId and natSessionPrivateDstEPBindId
   objects represent the endpoint binds used by NAT sessions.



4.9  Configuration via the MIB


   Sections 4.1, 4.2 and part of section 4.3 refer to objects that
   are configurable on a NAT device. NAT derives Address Bind, and
   Address-Port Bind entries from the address map table. Hence, an
   Address Bind or an Address-Port Bind Entry must not exist without
   an associated entry in the Address Map table.


   Further, NAT derives NAT session entries from NAT Binds, except
   in the case of symmetric NAT. Symmetric NAT derives translation
   parameters for a NAT session directly from an address map entry.
   Hence, with the exception of Symmetric NAT, a NAT session entry
   must not exist in the NAT Session table without a corresponding
   bind.


   A Management station may use the following steps to configure
   entries in the NAT-MIB:



Rohit, Srisuresh, Raghunarayan, Pai, Wang                       [Page 8]
INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



   -  Create an entry in the natInterfaceTable specifying the
      the value of ifIndex as the interface index of the interface.
      on which NAT is being configured.
      Specify appropriate values, as applicable, for the other
      objects e.g. natInterfaceRealm, natInterfaceServiceType, in the
      table (refer Section 4.1).


   -  Create one or more address map entries sequentially in reduced
      order of priority in the natAddrMapTable specifying the value
      of ifIndex to be the same for all entries. The ifIndex specified
      would be the same as specified for the entry in the
      natInterfaceTable (refer section 4.2).


   -  Configure maximum permitted idle time duration for BINDs and
      TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol sessions by setting the relevant
      scalars in natDefTimeouts object (refer section 4.3).
     


4.10  Relationship to Interface MIB


   The natInterfaceTable specifies the NAT configuration attributes
   on each interface. The concept of "interface" is as defined by
   InterfaceIndex/ifIndex of the IETF Interfaces MIB [IF-MIB].

   A record of changes which will be removed before publication.


   10  September 2001


   o Added the following objects to support notifications:
     natAddrRiseThreshold, natAddrFallingThreshold,
     natAddrMapName and natPktDiscardReason.

     unclear parameters though):
     natAddressUseRising and natPacketDiscard.


   10  November 2001


   o Dynamic and Static Address Map tables are Merged.


   o Protocol Extensibility added.

   07  February 2002


   o Config and Interface Specific tables are Merged.


   o MAX-ACCESS for the bind and session entry objects are
     changed to be read-create.


   o natAddrMapType renamed to natAddrMapDirection.


   14 June 2002


   o Changed the syntax of natConfServiceType to BITS and renumbered
     the enumeration to start with 0.


   o Addressed the warning raised by smilint - all InetAddress values
     now restricted to the size range (0..20) i.e. valid InetAddress
     types are now ipv4, ipv6, ipv4z and ipv6z.


   o MIN-ACCESS for natConfInterfaceRealm restricted to read-only.


   o Changed the natConfIcmpDefIdleTimeout default value to be 300.


   o natConfProtConfigName made a part of the optional
     natConfProtGroup.

8.  Acknowledgements


   The authors of the document would like to thank Randy Turner,
   Ashwini S.T., Kevin Luehrs, Sam Sankoorikal, and Juergen Quittek
   for their valuable feedback.


   The authors would like to especially thank Juergen Schoenwaelder
   for his patient and fine-combed review and detailed comments as a
   MIB doctor. The NAT MIB is much clearer and flatter as a result of
   Juergen's suggestions.



9.  Security Considerations


   It is clear that this MIB can be potentially useful for
   configuration. Unauthorized access to the write-able objects could
   cause a denial of service, and/or widespread network disturbance.
   Hence, the  support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.


   At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond those
   that SNMP Security is itself intended to address. These relate
   primarily to controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result from operator
   error, which is beyond the scope of any security architecture.


   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in
   that they may represent NAT bind and session information.
   The NAT bind and session objects reveal the identity of private
   hosts that are engaged in a session with external end nodes. A
   curious outsider could monitor these two objects to assess the
   number of private hosts being supported by the NAT device. Further,
   a disgruntled former employee of an enterprise could use the nat
   bind and session information to break into specific private hosts
   by intercepting the existing sessions or originate new
   sessions into the host. There are no objects which are sensitive in
   their own right, such as passwords or monetary amounts.
   It may be important to even control GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide
   features for such a secure environment.







Rohit, Srisuresh, Raghunarayan, Pai, Wang                      [Page 64]
INTERNET-DRAFT                 NAT MIB                        April 2004



   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB.


   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
