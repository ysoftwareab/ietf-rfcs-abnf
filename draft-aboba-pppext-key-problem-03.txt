INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


1.  Introduction

The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in [RFC2284], was
developed to provide extensible authentication for use with PPP
[RFC1661]. Since then, new applications of EAP have emerged, including
IEEE 802.1X network port authentication [IEEE8021X], and PIC [PIC].

Although the initial focus of EAP was authentication, it can also
provide keys for use with a ciphersuite, and binding of methods within a
sequence or tunnel.  EAP methods defined in [RFC2284] include EAP MD5,
as well as One-Time Password (OTP) and Generic Token Card methods. Each
of these methods supports one-way authentication only but not key
derivation.  However, subsequent EAP method specifications such as EAP
TLS [RFC2716], EAP SRP [EAPSRP], EAP GSS [EAPGSS] and EAP AKA [EAPAKA]
have provided for mutual authentication, as well as key derivation.

The ciphersuites for which EAP may provide keying material have also
grown in number.  PPP ciphersuites include DESEbis [RFC2419], 3DES
[RFC2420], and MPPE [RFC3078].  The DES algorithm is described in
[FIPSDES], and DES modes (such as CBC, used in RFC 2419 and DES-
EDE3-CBC, used in RFC 2420) are described in [DESMODES].  For PPP
DESEbis, a single 56-bit encryption key is required, used in both
directions; for PPP 3DES, a 168-bit encryption key is needed, used in
both directions. As described in [RFC2419] and [RFC2420] for both
protocols, the IV, which is different in each direction, is "deduced
from an explicit 64-bit nonce, which is exchanged in the clear during
the negotiation phase."

For MPPE, 40-bit, 56-bit or 128-bit encryption keys can be required in
each direction, as described in [RFC3078]. Since MPPE is based on the
RC4 algorithm, no initialization vector is required. While these PPP
ciphersuites provide encryption, they do not provide a per-packet keyed
message integrity check (MIC). Thus, an authentication key is not
required in either direction.

Within 802.11, ciphersuites include WEP-40, described in [IEEE80211],
which requires a 40-bit encryption key, the same in either direction;
and WEP-128, which requires a 104-bit encryption key, the same in either
direction.  These ciphersuites also do not include a keyed MIC.

Recently, new ciphersuites have been proposed for use with 802.11 that
do provide per-packet authentication as well as encryption
[IEEE80211Tgi]. These ciphersuites use either 104-bit or 128-bit keys,
and include definition of their own ciphersuite-specific key hierarchy.

With the increase in the number of EAP methods and applicable
ciphersuites, there is a need for defining how transient session keys
are derived from the master secrets produced by EAP methods, and how

INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


keys are used to provide cryptographic binding between methods used in a
sequence or tunnel.  Allowing each EAP method to handle this in its own
way is likely to produce unacceptable results.

This document reviews the issues involved in EAP key derivation and
provides guidelines for the generation of keys by EAP methods.

1.1.  Requirements language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

This document frequently uses the following terms:

Authentication Server
          An Authentication Server is an entity that provides an
          Authentication Service to an NAS. This service verifies from
          the credentials provided by the peer, the claim of identity
          made by the peer.

Cryptographic binding
          The demonstration of the EAP peer to the authenticator that a
          single entity has acted as the EAP peer for all methods
          executed within a sequence or tunnel. Binding MAY also imply
          that the EAP authenticator demonstrates to the peer that a
          single entity has acted as the EAP authenticator for all
          methods executed within a sequence or tunnel. If executed
          correctly, binding serves to mitigate man-in-the-middle
          vulnerabilities.

Master key
          The key derived between the EAP client and EAP server during
          the EAP authentication process.

Master session key
          Master session keys are derived from the master key, and are
          subsequently used in generation of transient session keys for
          authentication, encryption and IV-generation.  Since the
          transient session keys may be different in each direction,
          master session keys are also required in each direction, and
          are therefore referred to as "asymmetrical".  So that the
          master session keys are to be usable with any ciphersuite,
          they are longer than is necessary, and are truncated to fit.





Aboba & Simon                Informational                      [Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


Transient session keys
          The chosen ciphersuite uses transient session keys for
          authentication and encryption as well as IVs (if required).
          The transient session keys are derived from the master session
          keys, and are of the appropriate size for use with the chosen
          ciphersuite. Depending on the ciphersuite, the transient
          session keys may be different in each direction.

2.  EAP architecture overview

One of the goals of EAP is to enable development of new authentication
methods without requiring deployment of new code on the NAS. As a
result, the NAS acts as a "passthrough", and need not understand
specific EAP methods. Among other things, this implies that a NAS need
not contain code specific to each EAP method.  EAP

Instead of requiring new code on the NAS, EAP methods are installed on
the client and backend authentication server, typically interfacing with
the operating system via an EAP API, such as that described in [EAPAPI].
In order to allow the client and backend server to install new EAP
methods without requiring an operating system upgrade, operating systems
isolate EAP method-specific code within the installed EAP methods, and
thus largely operate as "passthrough" entities with respect to EAP.

Figure 1 describes the relationship between the EAP peer, NAS and AAA
server. As described in the figure, the EAP conversation "passes
through" the NAS on its way between the client and the AAA server As a
result, the NAS does not have knowledge of the keys that are derived
between the AAA server and the client, and these keys need to be
transmitted from the AAA server to the NAS.

EAP methods are installed on the the client and the AAA server,
typically communicating via an EAP API, so that the main client and AAA
server code does not need to be modified to add new methods. Among the
results that are passed back by EAP methods via the APIs are the keys to
be communicated from the AAA server to the NAS.  Ciphersuites are
installed on the NAS and the client.

While EAP methods which derive keys can be used to provide automated
keying for a ciphersuite, this does not imply that the EAP method need
contain ciphersuite-specific code.  Since the client and NAS need to
implement a given ciphersuite, ciphersuite-specific code is expected to
exist on the client and NAS.  However, since the backend authentication
server is not involved in the protection of data traffic, and may not
even be aware of the negotiated ciphersuite, it cannot be assumed to
implement ciphersuite-specific code, and the backend authentication
server will not necessarily have knowledge of the ciphersuites available
on the NAS and client.

2.1.  Implications of the architecture

Since the backend authentication server may not have knowledge of the
ciphersuite that has been negotiated, it may not be possible for this
information to be passed to the EAP method via the EAP APIs.  As a
result, inclusion of ciphersuite-specific code within an EAP method is
inappropriate.  Similarly, because the NAS is assumed to not have
knowledge of individual EAP methods, it cannot be assumed to include
code specific to an EAP method.  Moreover, since operating systems
provide EAP APIs in order to remain "EAP-Method Agnostic", EAP method-
specific code is best kept out of the EAP APIs as well.

Drawbacks to allowing EAP methods to specify session key derivation
mechanisms for individual ciphersuites include:

Document Revision
               If an EAP method specifies how to derive transient
               session keys on a per-ciphersuite basis, then this
               document will need to be revised each time a new
               ciphersuite comes out.  This would also imply that an
               authentication server supporting an EAP method might not
               be usable with a NAS supporting EAP, due to lack of
               support for a ciphersuite implemented on the NAS.  This
               is antithetical to the EAP architecture, which conceives
               of the NAS as a "pass through" device that does not need
               to understand EAP, and which therefore can work with any
               EAP method supported by the authentication server.

EAP method complexity
               Forcing the EAP method to include ciphersuite-specific
               code for transient session key derivation increases the
               complexity of EAP method development, as well as client
               and authentication server implementations.

Knowledge asymmetry
               In practice, an EAP method may not have knowledge of the
               ciphersuite that has been negotiated. In PPP, negotiation
               of the ciphersuite is accomplished via the Encryption
               Control Protocol (ECP), described in [RFC1968].  Since
               ECP negotiation occurs after authentication, unless an
               EAP method is utilized that supports ciphersuite
               negotiation (such as EAP-TLS [RFC2716]), the client, NAS
               and backend authentication server may not be able to
               anticipate the ciphersuite that will be used and
               therefore this information cannot be provided to the EAP
               method.

INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


3.  EAP keying requirements

In the most general case, authentication and encryption keys as well as
initialization vectors must be derived for each direction from the
master secret K derived by the EAP method.  This can accomplished via
the specification of two classes of algorithms:

[1]  Algorithms for the derivation of "master session keys" from the
     negotiated master key.  The "master session keys" are derived from
     the master key derived by the EAP method, but are never directly
     used by ciphersuites; they are only used in the derivation of
     transient session keys.  These "master session keys" are derived on
     the client and the backend authentication server. The backend
     authentication server then transmits the "master session keys" to
     the NAS.

[2]  Algorithms for the derivation of "transient session keys" from the
     "master session keys". The "transient session keys" are used for
     encryption, authentication and IV-generation in each direction, and
     are derived by the NAS and client, based on the negotiated
     ciphersuite.

Depending on the negotiated ciphersuite and media, a different set of
"transient session keys" may be required; for example 802.11 WEP does
not provide a keyed message integrity check, and typically uses only a
single encryption key in both directions.

The algorithm for deriving the "master session keys" from the "master
key" is designed to be ciphersuite-independent, and is specific to the
EAP method. The goal of this algorithm is to provide master session keys
in a well defined format, suitable for passage between the AAA server
and the NAS.

Examples of master session key derivation algorithms are provided in
Section 3.5 of EAP TLS [RFC2716], based on the Pseudo-Random Function
(PRF) defined in TLS [RFC2246]. Equivalent algorithms are provided in
IKE [RFC2409] for the derivation of SKEYID_d, SKEYID_a and SKEYID_e from
the master key SKEYID.  Examples of AAA master session key attributes
are provided in [RFC2548].

Note that because the derivation and validation of these algorithms is
difficult, it is highly desirable to reuse existing algorithms if at all
possible.  This enables the security community to carefully analyze the
proposed algorithm. Such an analysis would be difficult were multiple
algorithms to proliferate. However, since each EAP method is different,
it is also true that existing algorithms may not fit all situations.





Aboba & Simon                Informational                      [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


For example, the master key may not be directly available within all EAP
methods.  For security reasons, the TLS master secret is typically not
directly available via TLS APIs. As a result, [RFC2716] derives master
session keys from the TLS master secret, and uses those master session
keys to derive the required session keys.

Since EAP TLS [RFC2716] does not assume knowledge of the negotiated
ciphersuite, it provides keys large enough for use with any ciphersuite,
assuming that these will be truncated for use within the client and NAS.
Since the raw master secret is typically not available in to EAP-TLS
implementations, when this EAP method is used, the TLS PRF function is
needed to derive keying material from it.

Other EAP methods may also encounter similar issues. For example, EAP
GSS implementations will typically not be able to access the master keys
directly, but can call GSS_Wrap() to encrypted tokens and GSS_GetMIC()
to generate authentication tokens based on the master secret.  EAP GSS
implementations will therefore need to use GSS-API calls to derive
master session keys from the master key, rather than operating on the
master key directly.

By specifying the algorithm by which master session keys are derived
within each EAP method, as well as the format by which the master
session keys are transmitted from the AAA server to the NAS, the NAS can
be assured of obtaining master session keys for each EAP method, in a
well-defined format.  Since it is assumed that the backend
authentication server will perform the required calculations and will
supply the NAS with the master session keys, the master session key
algorithm need not be implemented on the  NAS.

Rather, the NAS will only need code for the second algorithm, namely for
the derivation of ciphersuite-specific "transient session keys" from
"master session keys".

The derivation of ciphersuite-specific "transient session keys" from
"master session keys" occurs after the ciphersuite has been determined,
and provides for the derivation of the keys required within the
ciphersuite-specific key hierarchy.  The algorithm for deriving
"transient session keys" from the "master session keys" is designed to
be EAP-method independent, but is dependent on the negotiated
ciphersuite and media.

Since each ciphersuite and media may have different needs, the
algorithms for transient session key derivation will vary according to
the ciphersuite and media. Nevertheless, as with master session key
derivation algorithms, it is desirable if commonalities can be found, so
that the correctness and security of the algorithms can be more easily
analyzed.

INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


Figure 2 on the next page describes the overall logic of how master
session keys and transient session keys are derived from the master key
negotiated within an EAP method.

The master key K may be of varying length, and as described earlier, may
not be directly available to the EAP method. Where the master key K is
not exportable, an intermediate step is required to generate a "Pseudo-
Master Key" from the master key. For example, in EAP GSS, as described
in [EAPGSS], a "Pseudo-Master Key", K' is derived via GSS-API calls, and
is used instead.

In order to enable interoperability between backend authentication
servers, NASen and EAP clients implementing EAP methods that derive
keys, the following is required:

Key hierarchy
     In order to enable the keys derived within EAP methods to be used
     within any ciphersuite, EAP methods deriving keys need to specify
     the algorithms for master session key derivation. If possible, it
     is desirable to reuse existing key derivation techniques, rather
     than inventing new ones.

Ciphersuite keys
     In order to use the master session keys provided by EAP methods,
     ciphersuites keyed via EAP need to define how ciphersuite-specific
     keys are derived from the master session keys provided by EAP
     methods, based on the ciphersuite-specific key hierarchy.

Keying AVPs
     In order to enable backend authentication servers to provide keying
     material to the NAS in a well defined format, it is necessary to
     standardize the attributes used to transmit keys from the backend
     authentication server to the NAS.

The algorithms for derivation of "master session keys" from the master
key, and for derivation of "transient session keys" from the "master
session keys" are not specified in this document. Rather, the purpose of
this document is to lay out a framework within which algorithms can be
discussed and evaluated.

INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


For a proposed "master session key" derivation algorithm to be
satisfactory, it needs to fulfill several requirements:

Ciphersuite-independence
          A satisfactory "master session key" derivation algorithm MUST
          NOT require ciphersuite-specific code to be implemented within
          an EAP method. In practice, this implies that the master
          session keys MUST enable derivation of authentication and
          encryption keys and IVs in both directions.

Generality
          A satisfactory "master session key" derivation algorithm MUST
          provide master session keys appropriate for use with a wide
          range of ciphersuites. Among other things, this implies that
          the master session keys MUST contain sufficient entropy to be
          usable with existing and future ciphersuites. At a minimum,
          master session keys SHOULD be at least 256 octets in length.

Direct and Indirect Access
          Satisfactory "master session key" derivation algorithms MUST
          be applicable to EAP methods where the master key is not
          directly accessible. These include TLS and GSS-API methods.

Generality
          It is likely that each EAP method will handle the derivation
          of "master session keys" from "master keys" in a different
          manner. However, wherever possible, well known algorithms
          SHOULD be reused, and customized to fit, rather than
          developing entirely new algorithms.

Algorithms for "transient session key" derivation also needs to fulfill
several requirements:

EAP method independence
          Algorithms for deriving "transient session keys" from "master
          session keys" MUST NOT depend on the EAP method.  Derivation
          of "transient session keys" is expected to occur on the NAS,
          which acts as a "passthrough" for EAP. Therefore the NAS
          cannot be expected to have knowledge of the EAP method that
          has been negotiated.

Sufficient keying material
          Algorithms for derivation of "transient session keys" from
          "master session keys" will typically be dependent on the key
          hierarchy of the given ciphersuite and media.  However,
          regardless of the specific key hierarchy, the derived "master
          session key" MUST provide sufficient entropy to enable
          "transient session keys" to be securely derived. For example,



Aboba & Simon                Informational                     [Page 12]





INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


          an EAP method that generates a "master session key" with only
          56 bits of entropy will not be adequate.

4.  Security considerations


4.1.  Key strength

The strength of the session keys is dependent upon the security of the
EAP method providing the master keying material. If the chosen EAP
method has security vulnerabilities, or does not produce a key of
sufficient entropy then it is possible that weak session keys may be
produced.

4.2.  Man-in-the-middle attacks

Since EAP is widely implemented on multiple media, man-in-the-middle
attacks are a fundamental concern. Where methods are used within a
sequence or tunnel, cryptographic binding between the methods and (if
present) the tunnel, is required so that a single peer and authenticator
can be demonstrated to have taken part in the entire exchange.

Without cryptographic binding, a man-in-the-middle attack may be enabled
as described in Figure 3.

Figure 3 - Man-in-the-middle attack on EAP tunnel

In the figure, the NAS (otherwise known as the EAP authenticator)
supports authentication via tunneled EAP. If the EAP tunneling mechanism
does not require client authentication, then an attacker can establish a
tunnel to the NAS without having to authenticate itself. The attacker
can then induce an unsuspecting client to authenticate to it. The
attacker then tunnels EAP packets from the client to the NAS,
authenticating itself to the NAS.





Aboba & Simon                Informational                     [Page 13]





INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


This would not constitute a true man-in-the-middle attack however,
unless the attacker were also able to obtain the keys used to encrypt
data between the client and the NAS. Since the EAP conversation occurs
between the client and the NAS, a well designed EAP method would not
permit the attacker to obtain the key derived between the client and
NAS. However, if the key were to be derived solely from the tunnel setup
between the attacker and NAS, then the attacker obtains the key without
having to execute a man-in-the-middle attack on the EAP method itself.
EAP tunneling protocols MUST demonstrate how they protect against this
attack, by allowing the client to provide the authenticator with a
cryptographic binding between the tunnel and the encapsulated methods.

Another variety of attack is illustrated in Figure 4.

+-+-+-+-+-+               +-+-+-+-+-+        +-+-+-+-+-+

Figure 4. Man-in-the-middle attack on EAP sequence

In this attack, EAP method 1 is terminated on NAS 1, but EAP method 2 is
proxied by NAS 1 to NAS 2. If the intent of the client is to require a
single NAS to authenticate via two factors (say, a password/cert and a
token) then this will not have been demonstrated.

In order to provide the client with the assurance that a single NAS has
acted as the authenticator for all methods within the sequence, the
authenticator needs to demonstrate to the client a cryptographic binding
between the sequence of EAP methods.

The cryptographic binding may be demonstrated via a computation
involving the keys generated during the EAP method sequence, as well as
keys derived during tunnel setup. Where this is the case, it is not
possible to bind EAP methods which do not derive keys.

For an EAP method which does not derive keys to demonstrate
cryptographic binding, the method as well as the EAP implementation
would need to to support method-specific binding -- which existing
methods and EAP implementations typically do not. For example, to allow
the EAP method to incorporate keys derived by other methods, the EAP



Aboba & Simon                Informational                     [Page 14]





INTERNET-DRAFT           The EAP Keying Problem          22 October 2002


implementation would need to support passing of keys between methods and
the method would need to be able to make use of the passed keys. Such a
method would not be implementable within an EAP implementation that did
not support a key passing facility.

The result is that typically only EAP methods that derive keys can be
cryptographically bound in an interoperable way.
