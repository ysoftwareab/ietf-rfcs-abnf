                     draft-ietf-uta-tls-attacks-03

Abstract

   Over the last few years there have been several serious attacks on
   TLS, including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and modes of
   operation.  This document summarizes these attacks, with the goal of
   motivating generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage
   of TLS and DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   Over the last few years there have been several major attacks on TLS
   [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and
   modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but suffice it
   to say that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most
   current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.

   This situation motivated the creation of the UTA working group, which
   is tasked with the creation of generic and protocol-specific
   recommendations for the use of TLS and DTLS.

   "Attacks always get better; they never get worse" (ironically, this
   saying is attributed to the NSA).  This list of attacks describes our

   knowledge as of this writing.  It seems likely that new attacks will
   be invented in the future.

   For a more detailed discussion of the attacks listed here, the
   interested reader is referred to [Attacks-iSec].

2.  Attacks on TLS

   This section lists the attacks that motivated the current
   recommendations.  This is not intended to be an extensive survey of
   TLS's security.

   While there are widely deployed mitigations for some of the attacks
   listed below, we believe that their root causes necessitate a more
   systemic solution.

2.1.  SSL Stripping

   Various attacks attempt to remove the use of SSL/TLS altogether, by
   modifying unencrypted protocols that request the use of TLS,
   specifically modifying HTTP traffic and HTML pages as they pass on
   the wire.  These attacks are known collectively as SSL Stripping and
   were first introduced by Moxie Marlinspike [SSL-Stripping].  In the
   context of Web traffic, these attacks are only effective if the
   client initially accesses a Web server using HTTP.  A commonly used
   mitigation is HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) [RFC6797].

2.2.  STARTTLS Command Injection Attack (CVE-2011-0411)

   Similarly, there are attacks on the transition between unprotected
   and TLS-protected traffic.  A number of IETF application protocols
   have used an application-level command, usually STARTTLS, to upgrade
   a clear-text connection to use TLS.  Multiple implementations of
   STARTTLS had a flaw where an application-layer input buffer retained
   commands that were pipelined with the STARTTLS command, such that
   commands received prior to TLS negotiation are executed after TLS
   negotiation.  This problem is resolved by requiring the application-
   level command input buffer to be empty before negotiating TLS.  Note
   that this flaw lives in the application layer code and does not
   impact the TLS protocol directly.

2.3.  BEAST (CVE-2011-3389)

   The BEAST attack [BEAST] uses issues with the TLS 1.0 implementation
   of CBC (that is, the predictable initialization vector) to decrypt
   parts of a packet, and specifically to decrypt HTTP cookies when HTTP
   is run over TLS.

2.4.  Lucky Thirteen (CVE-2013-0169)

   A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions
   of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks [Padding-Oracle].
   A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack
   [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that allows the attacker
   to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.

   The Lucky Thirteen attack can be mitigated by using authenticated
   encryption like AES-GCM [RFC5288] or encrypt-then-mac
   [I-D.ietf-tls-encrypt-then-mac] instead of the TLS default of MAC-
   then-encrypt.

2.5.  Attacks on RC4

   The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL)
   for many years.  RC4 has long been known to have a variety of
   cryptographic weaknesses, e.g.  [RC4-Attack-Pau], [RC4-Attack-Man],
   [RC4-Attack-FMS].  Recent cryptanalysis results [RC4-Attack-AlF]
   exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted
   plaintexts.

   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
   exploitable; currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.  For further details,
   the reader is referred to [I-D.ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4].

2.6.  Compression Attacks: CRIME, TIME and BREACH

   The CRIME attack [CRIME] (CVE-2012-4929) allows an active attacker to
   decrypt ciphertext (specifically, cookies) when TLS is used with TLS
   level compression.

   The TIME attack [TIME] and the later BREACH attack [BREACH]
   (CVE-2013-3587, though the number has not been officially allocated)
   both make similar use of HTTP-level compression to decrypt secret
   data passed in the HTTP response.  We note that compression of the
   HTTP message body is much more prevalent than compression at the TLS
   level.

   The former attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression.  We
   are not aware of mitigations at the TLS protocol level to the latter
   attack, and so application-level mitigations are needed (see
   [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use CSRF tokens
   will need to randomize them even when the recommendations of
   [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp] are adopted.

2.7.  Certificate Attacks

   There have been several practical attacks on TLS when used with RSA
   certificates (the most common use case).  These include
   [Bleichenbacher98] and [Klima03].  While the Bleichenbacher attack
   has been mitigated in TLS 1.0, the Klima attack that relies on a
   version-check oracle is only mitigated by TLS 1.1.

   The use of RSA certificates often involves exploitable timing issues
   [Brumley03] (CVE-2003-0147), unless the implementation takes care to
   explicitly eliminate them.

   A recent certificate fuzzing tool [Brubaker2014using] uncovered
   numerous vulnerabilities in different TLS libraries, related to
   certificate validation.

2.8.  Diffie-Hellman Parameters

   TLS allows to define ephemeral Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman parameters in its respective key exchange modes.  This
   results in an attack detailed in [Cross-Protocol].  In addition,
   clients that do not properly verify the received parameters are
   exposed to man in the middle (MITM) attacks.  Unfortunately the TLS
   protocol does not require this verification, see [RFC6989] for the
   IPsec analogy.

2.9.  Renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555)

   A major attack on the TLS renegotiation mechanism applies to all
   current versions of the protocol.  The attack and the TLS extension
   that resolves it are described in [RFC5746].

2.10.  Triple Handshake (CVE-2014-1295)

   The triple handshake attack [[TRIPLE-HS, add the reference when
   published]] enables the attacker to cause two TLS connections to
   share keying material.  This leads to a multitude of attacks, e.g.
   Man-in-the-Middle, breaking safe renegotiation and breaking channel
   binding via TLS Exporter [RFC5705] or "tls-unique" [RFC5929].

2.11.  Virtual Host Confusion

   A recent article [Delignat14] describes a security issue whereby
   SSLv3 fallback and improper handling of session caches on the server
   side can be abused by an attacker to establish a malicious connection
   to a virtual host other than originally intended and approved by the
   server.  This attack is especially serious in performance critical
   environments where sharing of SSLv3 session caches is very common.

2.12.  Denial of Service

   Server CPU power has progressed over the years so that TLS can now be
   turned on by default.  However the risk of malicious clients and
   coordinated groups of clients ("botnets") mounting denial of service
   attacks is still very real.  TLS adds another vector for
   computational attacks, since a client can easily (with little
   computational effort) force the server to expend relatively large
   computational work.  It is known that such attacks have in fact been
   mounted.

2.13.  Implementation Issues

   Even when the protocol is fully specified, the are very common issues
   that often plague implementations.  In particular, the integration of
   higher-level protocols, TLS and its PKI-based authentication is the
   source of misunderstandings and implementation "shortcuts".  An
   extensive survey of these issues can be found in [Georgiev2012].

   o  Implementations may omit validation of the server certificate
      altogether.  For example, this is true of the default
      implementation of HTTP client libraries in Python 2 (see e.g.
      CVE-2013-2191).

   o  Implementations may not validate the server identity.  This
      validation typically amounts to matching the protocol-level server
      name with the certificate's Subject Alternative Name field.  Note:
      historically, although incorrect, this information is also often
      found in the Common Name part of the Distinguished Name instead.

   o  Implementations may be validating the certificate chain
      incorrectly or not at all, or using an incorrect or outdated trust
      anchor list.

3.  Applicability to DTLS

   DTLS [RFC4347] [RFC6347] is an adaptation of TLS for UDP datagrams.

   With respect to the attacks described in the current document, DTLS
   1.0 is equivalent to TLS 1.1.  The only exception is RC4 which is
   disallowed in DTLS.  DTLS 1.2 is equivalent to TLS 1.2.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes protocol attacks in an informational manner,
   and in itself does not have any security implications.  Its companion
   documents certainly do.
