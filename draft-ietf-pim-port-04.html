<h1><br />A Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM<br />draft-ietf-pim-port-04.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This draft describes how a reliable transport mechanism can be 
	  used by the PIM protocol to optimize CPU and bandwidth resource 
	  utilization by eliminating periodic Join/Prune message transmission.
	  This draft proposes a modular extension to PIM to use either the TCP
	  or SCTP transport protocol.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The goals of this specification are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To create a simple incremental mechanism to provide reliable
	      PIM message delivery in PIM version 2 for use with PIM
	      Sparse-Mode <a class='info' href='#RFC4601'>[RFC4601]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fenner, B., Handley, M., Holbrook, H., and I. Kouvelas, &ldquo;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> (including Source-Specific
	      Multicast) and Bidirectional PIM
	      <a class='info' href='#RFC5015'>[RFC5015]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M., Kouvelas, I., Speakman, T., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR-PIM),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The reliable transport mechanism will be used for Join-Prune
	      message transmission only.
</li>
<li>When a router supports this specification, it need not
	      use the reliable transport mechanism with every neighbor. That is,
	      negotiation on a per neighbor basis will occur.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The explicit non-goals of this specification are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Changes to the PIM message formats as defined in 
		<a class='info' href='#RFC4601'>[RFC4601]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fenner, B., Handley, M., Holbrook, H., and I. Kouvelas, &ldquo;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>Provide support for automatic switching between Datagram mode
		and Transport mode. Two routers that are PIM neighbors on a
              link will always use Transport mode if and only if both have
              Transport mode enabled.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document will specify how periodic Join/Prune message
	    transmission can be eliminated by using TCP 
	    <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> or SCTP <a class='info' href='#RFC4960'>[RFC4960]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stewart, R., &ldquo;Stream Control Transmission Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> as the 
	    reliable transport mechanism for Join/Prune messages.
</p>
<p>This specification enables greater scalability in terms
	      of control traffic overhead. However, for routers connected
	      to multi-access links that comes at the price of increased
	      control plane state overhead and the control plane overhead 
	      required to maintain this state.
</p>
<p>In many existing and emerging networks, particularly
            wireless and mobile satellite systems, link degradation due
            to weather, interference, and other impairments can result
            in temporary spikes in the packet loss. In these
            environments, periodic PIM joining can cause join latency
            when messages are lost causing a retransmission only 60
            seconds later. By applying a reliable transport, a lost join
            is retransmitted rapidly. Furthermore, when the last user
            leaves a multicast group, any lost prune is similarly
            repaired and the multicast stream is quickly removed from
            the wireless/satellite link. Without a reliable transport,
            the multicast transmission could otherwise continue until it
            timed out, roughly 3 minutes later.  As network resources
            are at a premium in many of these environments, rapid
            termination of the multicast stream is critical to
            maintaining efficient use of bandwidth.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Protocol Overview</h3>

<p>PIM Over Reliable Transport (PORT) is a simple extension to
	  PIMv2 for refresh reduction of PIM Join/Prune messages. It involves
	  sending incremental rather than periodic Join/Prune messages over
	  a TCP/SCTP connection between PIM neighbors.
</p>
<p>PORT only applies to PIM Sparse-Mode <a class='info' href='#RFC4601'>[RFC4601]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fenner, B., Handley, M., Holbrook, H., and I. Kouvelas, &ldquo;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
            and Bidirectional PIM <a class='info' href='#RFC5015'>[RFC5015]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M., Kouvelas, I., Speakman, T., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR-PIM),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> Join/Prune
	    messages.
</p>
<p>This document does not restrict PORT to any specific link types.
	    However, the use of PORT on e.g. multi-access LANs with many PIM
	    neighbors should be carefully evaluated. This due to the fact that
	    there may be a full mesh of PORT connections, and that explicit
	    tracking of all PIM PORT routers is required.
</p>
<p>PORT can be incrementally used on a link between PORT
	  capable neighbors. Routers which are not PORT capable can continue
	  to use PIM in Datagram Mode. PORT capability is detected using
	  new PORT Capable PIM Hello Options.
</p>
<p>Once PORT is enabled on an interface and a PIM neighbor also
	  announces that it is PORT enabled, only PORT Join/Prune messages
	  will be used. That is, only PORT Join/Prune messages are
	  accepted from, and sent to, that particular neighbor. Native
	  Join/Prune messages may still be used for other neighbors.
</p>
<p>PORT Join/Prune messages are sent using a TCP/SCTP connection.
	  When two PIM neighbors are PORT enabled, both for TCP or both
	  for SCTP, they will immediately, or on-demand, establish a
	  connection. If the connection goes down, they will again
	  immediately, or on-demand, try to reestablish the connection.
	  No Join/Prune messages (neither Native nor PORT) are sent while
	  there is no connection.
</p>
<p>When PORT is used, only incremental Join/Prune messages are sent
	  from downstream
          routers to upstream routers. As such, downstream routers do not
          generate periodic Join/Prune messages for state for which the RPF
	  neighbor is PORT-capable.
</p>
<p>For Joins and Prunes, which are received over a TCP/SCTP 
	  connection, 
	  the upstream router does not start or maintain timers on the 
	  outgoing interface
          entry. Instead, it keeps track of which downstream routers have
          expressed interest. An interface is deleted from the outgoing
	  interface list
          only when all downstream routers on the interface, no longer wish to
          receive traffic.
</p>
<p>There is no change proposed for the PIM Join/Prune packet format.
	  However, for Join/Prune messages sent over TCP/SCTP connections, no
	  IP Header is included. The message begins with the PIM common header,
	  followed by the Join/Prune
	  message. See section <a class='info' href='#CH'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Common Header Definition</span><span>)</span></a> for details on the common

Establishing Transport Connections</h3>

<p>While a router interface is PORT enabled, a PIM-over-TCP
	  or a PIM-over-SCTP option is included in the PIM Hello messages
	  sent on that interface. When a router on a PORT-enabled
	  interface receives a Hello message containing a
	  PIM-over-TCP/PIM-over-SCTP Option from a new neighbor,
	  or an existing neighbor that did not previously include the
	  option, it switches to PORT mode for that particular neighbor.
</p>
<p>When a router switches to PORT mode for a neighbor, it stops
	  sending and accepting Native Join/Prune messages for that neighbor.
	  Any state from previous Native Join/Prune messages is left to expire
	  as normal. It will also attempt to establish a Transport connection
	  (TCP or SCTP) with the neighbor. If both the router and its
	  neighbor have announced both PIM-over-TCP and PIM-over-SCTP
	  options, SCTP MUST be used.
</p>
<p>When the router is using TCP it will compare
          the TCP Connection ID it announced in the PIM-over-TCP Capable
          Option with the TCP Connection ID in the Hello received from the
          neighbor. The router with the lower Connection ID will do an
          active Transport open to the neighbor Connection ID. The router
          with the higher Connection ID will do a passive Transport open.
	  An implementation may open connections only on-demand, in that
          case it may be that the neighbor with the higher Connection ID
          does the active open, see <a class='info' href='#ondemand'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>On-demand versus Pre-configured Connections</span><span>)</span></a>.
	  Note that the source address of the active open must be the
          announced Connection ID.
</p>
<p>When the router is using SCTP, the IP address comparison
	  need not be done since the SCTP protocol can handle
	  call collision.
</p>
<p>If PORT is used both for IPv4 and IPv6, both IPv4 and IPv6
          PIM Hello messages are sent, both containing PORT Hello options.
          If two neighbors announce the same transport (TCP or SCTP) and
          the same Connection ID in the IPv4 and IPv6 Hello messages, then
          only one connection is established and is shared. Otherwise,
          two connections are established and are used separately.
</p>
<p>The PIM router that performs the active open initiates the 
          connection with a locally
          generated source transport port number and a well-known destination
          transport port number. The PIM router that performs the passive open
          listens on the well-known local transport port number and does not
          qualify the remote transport port number. See <a class='info' href='#CH'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Common Header Definition</span><span>)</span></a>
          for well-known port number assignment for PORT.
</p>
<p>When a Transport connection is established (or reestablished),
	  the two routers MUST both send a full set of Join/Prune messages
	  for state for which the other router
	  is the upstream neighbor. This is needed to ensure that the
	  upstream neighbor has the correct state. When moving from
	  Datagram mode, or when the connection has gone down, the router
	  cannot be sure that all the previous Join/Prune state was received
	  by the
	  neighbor. Any state received while in Datagram mode that is not
	  refreshed, will be left to expire.
</p>
<p>When a Transport connection goes down, Join/Prune state that 
	  was
	  sent over the Transport connection is still retained. The neighbor 
	  should
	  not be considered down until the neighbor timer has expired. This
	  allows routers to do a control-plane switchover without disrupting
	  the network. If a Transport connection is reestablished before the
	  neighbor timer expires, the previous state is intact and any new
	  Join/Prune messages sent cause state to be created or removed
	  (depending on
	  if it was a Join or Prune). If the neighbor timer does expire, 
	  only the upstream router, that has oif-list state, to the expired
	  downstream neighbor will need to clear state. A downstream
	  router, when an upstream neighboring router has expired, will
	  simply update the RPF for the corresponding state to a new neighbor
	  where it would trigger Join/Prune messages
	  like it would in <a class='info' href='#RFC4601'>[RFC4601]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fenner, B., Handley, M., Holbrook, H., and I. Kouvelas, &ldquo;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. It is required of a 
	  PIM router to clear 
	  its neighbor table for a neighbor who has timed out due to 
	  neighbor holdtime expiration.
</p>
<p>Note that, a Join sent over a Transport connection will only be
	    seen by the upstream router, and thus will not cause  routers on
	    the link that do not use PIM PORT with the upstream router to
	    possibly delay the refresh of Join state for the same state.
	    Similarly, a Prune sent over a Transport connection will only be
	    seen by the upstream router, and will thus never cause routers on
	    the link on the link that do not use PIM PORT with the upstream
	    router, to send a Join to override this Prune.
</p>
<p>Note also, that a datagram PIM Join/Prune message for a said
	    (S,G) or (*,G) sent by some router on a link will not cause
	    routers on the same link that use a Transport connection with the
	    upstream router for that state, to suppress the refresh of that
	    state to the usptream router (because they don't need to
	    periodically refresh this state) or to send a Join to override a
	    Prune (as the upstream router will only stop forwarding the
	    traffic when all joined routers that use a Transport connection
	    have explicitly sent a Prune for this state, as explained in
	    <a class='info' href='#track'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Explicit Tracking</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
TCP Connection Maintenance</h3>

<p>TCP is designed to keep connections up indefinitely during
	    a period of network disconnection. If a PIM-over-TCP router fails,
	    the TCP connection may  stay up until  the neighbor 
	    actually reboots,  
	    and even then it  may continue to stay  up until you actually try 
	    to  send the neighbor some information. This is particularly
	    relevant to PIM, since the flow of Join/Prune messages might be
	    in only one 
	    direction, and the downstream neighbor might never get any 
	    indication via TCP that the other end of the connection 
	    is not really there.
</p>
<p>Implementations SHOULD support the use of TCP Keep-Alives,
	    see <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> section 4.2.3.6. We recommend
	    the use of Keep-Alives to be optional, allowing network
	    administrators to use it as needed. Note that Keep-Alives
            can be used by a peer, independently of whether the other
	    peer supports it. With the use of Keep-Alives one can detect
	    that a connection is not working without sending any TCP data.
</p>
<p>Most  applications using  TCP want  to detect  when a  neighbor
	    is no longer there, so that  the associated application state can  
	    be released.  Also, one wants to clean up the TCP state, and not 
	    keep half-open connections around indefinitely. This is 
	    accomplished by using PIM Hellos and by not introducing an 
	    application-specific or new PIM keep-alive message. Therefore,
	    when a GENID changes from a received PIM Hello message, and a
	    TCP connection is established or attempting to be established, 
	    the local side will tear down the connection and
	    attempt to reopen a new one for the new instance of the neighbor
	    coming up.  However, if the connection is shared by multiple
	    interfaces and the GENID changes only for one of them, then
	    there was not a full reboot and the connection is likely to
	    still work. In that case, the router should just resend all
	    Join/Prune state for that particular neighbor. This is similar
	    to how state is refreshed when GENID changes for PIM in
	    datagram mode.
</p>
<p>There may be situations where a router ignores some joins
	    or prunes. E.g. due to wrong RP information or receiving joins
	    on an RPF interface. A router may try to cache such messages
	    and apply them later if only a temporary error. It may however
	    also ignore the message, and later change its GENID for that
	    interface to make the
	    neighbor resend all state, including any that may have been
	    previously ignored. It is possible that one receives Join/Prune
	    messages for an interface/link that is down. As long as the
	    neighbor has not expired, we recommend processing those
	    messages as usual. If they are ignored, then the router should
	    change the GENID for that interface when it comes back up, in
	    order to get a full update.

Moving from PORT to Datagram Mode</h3>

<p>There may be situations where an administrator decides to
	    stop using PORT. If PORT is disabled on a router interface,
	    we start expiry timers with the respective neighbor holdtimes
	    as the initial values. Similarly if we receive a Hello message
	    without a PORT Capable option from a neighbor, we start expiry
	    timers for all Join/Prune state we have for that particular
	    neighbor.
            The Transport connection should be shut down as soon as there are
            no more PIM neighborships using it. That is, for the connection
	    we have associated local and remote Connection IDs. When there
	    is no PIM neighbor with that particular remote connection ID on
	    any interface where we announce the local connection ID, the
	    connection should be shut down.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
On-demand versus Pre-configured Connections</h3>

<p>Transport connections could be established when they are needed
	    or when a router interface to other PIM neighbors has come up. The
	    advantage of on-demand Transport connection establishment 
	    is the reduction of router resources. Especially in the case
	    where there is no need for n^2 connections on a network interface.
	    The disadvantage is additional delay and queueing when a Join/Prune
	    message needs to be sent and a Transport connection is
            not established yet.
</p>
<p>If a router interface has become operational and PIM neighbors
	    are learned from Hello messages, at that time, Transport 
	    connections may be established. The advantage is that a connection
	    is ready to transport data by the time a Join/Prune message needs
	    to be sent. The disadvantage is there can be more connections 
	    established than needed. This can occur when there is a small set 
	    of RPF neighbors for the active distribution trees compared to
	    the total number of neighbors. Even when Transport connections
	    are pre-established before they are needed, a connection can go
	    down and an implementation will have to deal with an on-demand
	    situation.
</p>
<p>Note that for TCP, it is the router with the lower Connection
            ID that decides whether to open a connection immediately, or
	    on-demand. The router with the higher Connection ID should only
	    initiate a
            connection on-demand. That is, if it needs to send a Join/Prune
	    message and there is no currently established connection.
</p>
<p>Therefore, this specification recommends but does not mandate 
	    the use of on-demand Transport connection establishment.

Possible Hello Suppression Considerations</h3>

<p>This specification indicates that a Transport connection cannot

	    this is to determine if the PIM neighbor supports this 
	    specification and the other is to determine the remote address
	    to use to establish the Transport connection.
</p>
<p>There are cases where it is desirable to suppress entirely the
	    transmission of Hello messages. In this case, it is outside the
	    scope of this document on how to determine if the PIM neighbor
	    supports this specification as well as an out-of-band (outside
	    of the PIM protocol) method to determine the remote address to
	    establish the Transport connection.

Common Header Definition</h3>

<p>It may be desirable for scaling purposes to allow Join/Prune
	  messages from different PIM protocol instances to be sent over the
	  same Transport connection. Also, it may be desirable to have a set
	  of Join/Prune
	  messages for one address-family sent over a Transport connection that
	  is established over a different address-family network layer.
</p>
<p>To be able to do this we need a common header that is inserted
	  and parsed for each PIM Join/Prune message that is sent on a
	  Transport connection.
	  This common header will provide both record boundary and demux
	  points when sending over a stream protocol like Transport.
</p>
<p>Each Join/Prune message will have in front of it the following
	  common header in Type/Length/Value format. And multiple different
	  TLV types can be sent over the same Transport connection.
</p>
<p>To make sure PIM Join/Prune messages are delivered as soon as the
	  TCP transport layer receives the Join/Prune buffer, the TCP Push
	  flag will be set in all outgoing Join/Prune messages sent over a
	  TCP transport connection.
</p>
<p>PIM messages will be sent using destination TCP port number 
	  8471. When using SCTP as the reliable transport, destination
	  port number 8471 will be used. See 
          <a class='info' href='#IANA-Considerations'>Section&nbsp;10<span> (</span><span class='info'>IANA Considerations</span><span>)</span></a> for IANA considerations.
</p>
<p>Join/Prune messages are error checked. This includes a bad PIM
	  checksum, illegal type fields, illegal addresses or a truncated
	  message. If any parsing errors occur in a Join/Prune message, it
	  is skipped, and we proceed processing any following TLVs.
</p>
<p>The TLV type field is 16 bits. The range 61440 - 65535 is
	  for experimental use <a class='info' href='#RFC3692'>[RFC3692]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., &ldquo;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Explicit Tracking</h3>

<p>When explicit tracking is used, a router keeps track of join
	    state for individual downstream neighbors on a given interface.
	    This is done for all PORT joins and prunes. It may also be done
	    for native join/prune messages, if all neighbors on the LAN have
	    set the T bit of the LAN Prune Delay option. In the discussion
            below we will talk about ET (explicit tracking) neighbors, and
	    non-ET neighbors. The set of ET neighbors always includes the
            PORT neighbors. The set of non-ET neighbors consists of all the
	    non-PORT neighbors unless all neighbors have set the LAN Prune
            Delay T bit. Then the ET neighbors set contains all neighbors.
</p>
<p>For some link-types,
	  e.g. point-to-point, tracking neighbors is no different than
	  tracking interfaces. It may also be possible for an implementation
	  to treat different downstream neighbors as being on different
	  logical interfaces, even if they are on the same physical link.
	  Exactly how this is implemented and for which link types, is left
	  to the implementer.
</p>
<p>For (*,G) and (S,G) state, the router starts forwarding 
	  traffic on an interface when a Join is received from a neighbor
	  on such an interface. When a non-ET neighbor sends a Prune,
	  there is generally a small delay to see if another non-ET
	  neighbor sends a Join to override the Prune. If there is no
	  override, one
	  should note that no non-ETP neighbor is interested. If no
	  ET neighbors are interested, the interface can be removed
          from the oif-list. When a ET neighbor sends a Prune, one
          removes the join state for that neighbor. If no other ET or
          non-ET neighbors are interested, the interface can be
          removed from the oif-list. When a PORT neighbor sends a prune,
	  there can be no Prune Override, since the Prune is not visible
	  to other neighbors.
</p>
<p>For (S,G,R) state, the router needs to track Prune state on
	  the shared tree. It needs to know which ET neighbors have sent
          prunes, and whether any non-ET neighbors have sent prunes.
          Normally one would
          forward a packet from a source S to a group G out on an interface
          if a (*,G)-join is received, but no (S,G,R)-prune. With ET one
          needs to do this check per ET neighbor. That is, the packet
          should be forwarded unless all ET neighbors that have sent
          (*,G)-joins have also sent (S,G,R)-prunes, and if a non-ET
	  neighbor has sent a (*,G)-join, whether there also is non-ET
	  (S,G,R)-prune state.

Multiple Instances and Address-Family Support</h3>

<p>Multiple instances of the PIM protocol may be used to support
	e.g. multiple address families. 
	Multiple instances can cause a multiplier effect on the number of
	router resources consumed. To be able to have an option to use
	router resources more efficiently, muxing Join/Prune messages over fewer
	Transport connections can be performed.
</p>
<p>There are two ways this can be accomplished, one using a common
	header format over a TCP connection and the other using multiple
        streams over a single SCTP connection.
</p>
<p>Using the Common Header format described previously in this
	specification, using different TLVs, both IPv4 and IPv6 based
	Join/Prune messages can be encoded within a Transport connection.
	Likewise, within a TLV, multiple occurrences of Join/Prune messages
	can occur and are tagged with an instance-ID so multiple Join/Prune
	messages for different instances can use a single Transport
	connection.
</p>
<p>When using SCTP multi-streaming, the common header is still used
	to convey instance information but an SCTP association is used, on
	a per-instance basis, to send data concurrently for multiple instances. 
	When data is sent concurrently, head of line blocking, which can 
	occur when using TCP, is avoided.
