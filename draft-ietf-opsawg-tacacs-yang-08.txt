1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG module that augments the System
   Management data model defined in the [RFC7317] to support the
   configuration and management of TACACS+ clients.

   TACACS+ [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] provides device administration for
   routers, network access servers and other networked devices via one
   or more centralized servers.

   The System Management Model [RFC7317] defines separate functionality
   to support local and RADIUS authentication:

   o  User Authentication Model: Defines a list of usernames with
      associated passwords and a configuration leaf to decide the order
      in which local or RADIUS authentication is used.

   o  RADIUS Client Model: Defines a list of RADIUS servers used by a
      device for centralized user authentication.

   The System Management Model is augmented with the TACACS+ YANG module
   defined in this document to allow the use of TACACS+ servers as an
   alternative to RADIUS servers or local user configuration.

   The YANG module can be used with network management protocols such as
   NETCONF[RFC6241].

   The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14, [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  configuration data

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Design of the TACACS+ Data Model

   This model is used to configure TACACS+ client on a device to support
   deployment scenarios with centralized authentication, authorization,
   and accounting servers.  Authentication is used to validate a user's
   username and password, authorization allows the user to access and
   execute commands at various command levels assigned to the user, and
   accounting keeps track of the activity of a user who has accessed the
   device.

   The ietf-system-tacacs-plus module augments the "/sys:system" path
   defined in the ietf-system module with the contents of the"tacacs-
   plus" grouping.  Therefore, a device can use local, RADIUS, or

   TACACS+ to validate users who attempt to access the router by several
   mechanisms, e.g., a command line interface or a web-based user
   interface.

   The "server" list is directly under the "tacacs-plus" container,
   which holds a list of TACACS+ servers and uses server-type to
   distinguish between Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
   (AAA).  The list of servers is for redundancy.

   Most of the parameters in the "server" list are taken directly from
   the TACACS+ protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs], and some are derived
   from the various implementations by network equipment manufacturers.
   For example, when there are multiple interfaces connected to the
   TACACS+ client or server, the source address of outgoing TACACS+
   packets could be specified, or the source address could be specified
   through the interface IP address setting, or derived from the
   outbound interface from the local FIB.  For the TACACS+ server
   located in a Virtual Private Network(VPN), a VRF instance needs to be
   specified.

   The "statistics" container under the "server list" is a collection of
   read-only counters for sent and received messages from a configured
   server.

   The data model for TACACS+ client has the following structure:

4.  TACACS+ Client Module

   This YANG module imports typedefs from [RFC6991].  This module also
   uses the interface typedef from [RFC8343], the leafref to VRF
   instance from [RFC8529], and the "default-deny-all" extension
   statement from [RFC8341].

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

Internet-Draft             TACACS+ YANG model                August 2020


   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /system/tacacsplus/server:  This list contains the data nodes used to
      control the TACACS+ servers used by the device.  Unauthorized
      access to this list could cause a complete control over the device
      by pointing to a compromised TACACS+ server.

   /system/tacacsplus/server/shared-secret:  This leaf controls the key
      known to both the TACACS+ client and server.  Unauthorized access
      to this leaf could cause the device vulnerable to attacks,
      therefore has been restricted using the "default-deny-all" access
      control defined in [RFC8341].

   This document describes the use of TACACS+ for purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting, it is vulnerable to all
   of the threats that are present in TACACS+ applications.  For a
   discussion of such threats, see Section 9 of the TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-tacacs-plus
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7950].

        Name: ietf-system-tacacs-plus
        Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang: ietf-system-tacacs-plus
        Prefix: sys-tcs-plus
        Reference: RFC XXXX (RFC Ed.: replace XXXX with actual
        RFC number and remove this note.)
