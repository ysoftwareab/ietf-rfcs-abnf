Abstract

   This document defines a new configuration option for the PPP IPCP
   (PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol), to return a list of the
   IPv4 addresses of SIP proxy servers. This option provides one 
   mechanism that a system may use to locate a SIP proxy server.
   This approach is applicable for a system that is using PPP for the
   link layer protocol and IP address allocation.

1. Introduction

   The SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)[3] is a signaling protocol
   used for the session invitation, modification, and termination. 
   The UAC (User Agent Client) sends a request to the UAS (User Agent
   Server).  However, the request message (INVITE) is not directly sent
   to the callee UAS, it rather goes through proxy servers and possibly 
   redirect servers.  This draft specifyies one mechansim that a
   system may use to locate a SIP proxy server.

   This draft specifies an IPCP (PPP Internet Protocol Control
   Protocol) option that allows SIP clients to locate a list of SIP
   proxy servers that is to be used for all SIP requests. This approach
   is applicable to a system utilizing PPP for its link layer
   protocol and IP address allocation (ex. 3GPP2 Packet Data System)

   Note: the text defining the format and behavior of these options is
   quoted from RFC1877 [2], to ensure a consistent implementation.

2.  Configuration Options

   The IPCP Configuration Option format and the basic options are
   defined in RFC 1332 [4].  This document defines the two new
   options: Primary SIP Server Address and Secondary SIP Server
   Address.

2.1.  Primary SIP Server Address Option

   Description

      This Configuration Option is used for negotiating with the remote
      peer the address of the primary SIP server Address to be used on
      the local end of the link.

   A summary of the Primary SIP Address Configuration Option format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Primary-SIP-Server-Address

      The four octet Primary-SIP-Server Address is the address of the
      primary proxy SIP server to be used by the local peer.  Setting
      these four octets to zero requests that the peer provide the
      address information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      No primary server address is provided.
   

1.3.  Secondary SIP Server Address Option

   Description

      This Configuration Option is used for negotiating with
      the remote peer the address of the secondary SIP server Address 
      to be used on the local end of the link.

   Secondary-SIP-Server-Address

      The four octet Secondary-SIP-Server Address is the address of the
      secondary SIP server to be used by the local peer.  Setting four
      octets are set to zero requests that the peer provide the address
      information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      By default, no secondary SIP address is provided.

3.  IANA Considerations

    Requires IPCP option number assignment

4. Acknowledgements

   A major portion of the text in this memo was quoted from RFC 1877.
