1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for Flow Through 
   Provisioning from a network management system at the Network 
   Operation Center (NOC) of carriers or service providers.

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components:  the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1], the MIB-II,
   STD 17, RFC 1213, and the protocol, RFC 1157 and/or RFC 1905.

   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903, and conformance
   statements are defined in RFC 1904.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI.
   A semantically identical MIB conforming to the SNMPv1 SMI can be 
   produced through the appropriate translation.

2.1 Object Definitions

   The Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual information
   database.  Managed objects in the MIB are defined using the subset
   of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  Managed
   Objects are accessed using SNMP protocol.  Each object type is named
   by an administratively assigned name, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER.  The
   object type and an object instance uniquely identify a specific
   instantiation of the object.  A textual string, the descriptor,
   is usually used to refer to the object type.

3. Overview

3.1 Scope of MIB
   
   The Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) MIB defines managed objects for
   flow though provisioning and management functions.  This document
   defines two groups of management objects of a next-generation customer
   premise equipment (NG-CPE).  The first group of objects is of a 
   general configuration nature and the second group is similar to the
   Analog Line Termination objects of a GR303 Remote Terminal as 
   defined in the GR303 Core document[16].  A NG-CPE that implements
   the OPS MIBs is an OPS compliant NG-CPE. Examples of CPE are
   integrated access device (IAD), digital loop carriers (DLC) and
   digital cross-connects (DACS).

   This MIB will be extended at a later time to handle flow through
   provisioning and management of DLC and DACS.  For the rest of the
   document, the discussion will be focused on OPS compliant IADs.


   Additional standard MIBs may be required to complete the functions
   of an OPS compliant IAD that provides integrated voice and data
   services: 
   o   DS0/DS0 Bundle (RFC 2494)
   o   T1/E1 (RFC 2495)
   o   T3/E3 (RFC 2496)
   o   SONET/SDH (RFC 2558)
   o   Frame Relay (RFC 1604)
   o   PPP (RFC 1471, 1472, 1473, 1474)
   o   ATM (RFC 2514, 2515)
   o   Ethernet (RFC 2665)
   o   TCP/IP, UDP (RFC 1213/STD 0017, RFC 2011, 2012, 2013)
   o   Classical IP over ATM (RFC 2320)
   o   ADSL (RFC 2662)

   Network management system at the Network Operation Center (NOC)
   performs flow through provisioning and management of OPS-IAD
   through an OPS-compliant Multi-service Access Concentrator (MAS)
   such as Universal Access Platform (UAP) 2000 by Anda Networks [17].
   Flow through provisioning and management commands that arrive at
   an OPS-compliant MAS come in many variety of formats.  For example,
   the commands could be in Translation Language 1 (TL1), Common
   Management Information Protocol (CMIP), Hyper Text Transport
   Protocol (HTTP), or SNMP. One of the major functions of an
   OPS-compliant MAS is to translate provisioning commands in those
   formats into OPS SNMP messages before those commands are flowed
   through to the OPS-IADs.

   For clarity, the SNMP messages arrive at OPS-MAS are sometimes
   termed MOPS SNMP messages and SNMP messages generated by OPS-MAS
   for provisioning and management of IADs are termed IOPS SNMP 
   messages, even though there are standard SNMP messages.

3.2 Flow Through Provisioning Architecture

   Fig. 1 depicts a configuration of MAS in a local loop access 
   network.  On the subscriber side, the next-generation OPS complaint
   integrated access device (OPS-IAD) is either directly connected to 
   MAS through copper pairs using technologies such as T1, HDSL or
   other xDSL, or indirectly connected through a loop access network.
   The loop access network shown in the Fig. 1 consists of DSLAMs and
   ATM switches.

   On the network side, the MAS connects to a PSTN class 5 switch
   using GR303 protocol for the voice traffic and connects to ATM/Frame
   Relay networks for the data traffic. The MAS directly 
   Interpolates with circuit based GR303 switch and packet based data 
   switches.  It provides inter-workings with a variety of data and/or 
   voice IADs.

            Fig.1 Flow Through Provisioning Architecture


3.3 OPEN PROVISIONING STANDARD (OPS)

   There are two views that the network manager at the NOC sees through
   MAS and all the attached OPS-IADs.  The first view regards the
   voice services coming from the GR303 PSTN switch.  In this view,
   OPS-IAD implements the Analog Line Termination objects in the GR303
   managed object definition.  The messages coming off the GR303 switch
   are CMIP messages.  Since the messages between MAS and OPS-IAD
   are SNMP messages, software in the MAS functions as a


   mediation device between the CMIP messages and SNMP messages and 
   does the translation between them.

   The second view is a SNMP view and this manages data and voice 
   Services view.  Network manager at the NOC uses either in-band
   channel through the ATM network or out-band channel through Internet
   to access the SNMP agent in the MAS.  In the SNMP terminology, SNMP 
   agent in the MAS functions as a proxy for the OPS-IAD SNMP 
   agents.

3.4 Voice Service Flow Through Provisioning

   A network manager at the NOC manages the MAS and all attached
   OPS-IAD through the GR303 PSTN Class 5 switch.  The Class 5 switch
   and MAS communicate through the EOC channel using OSI CMIP as
   defined in GR303 Core document[16].  The provisioning commands from
   the Class 5 switch will be executed either directly or indirectly
   by the MAS.  For those commands that operate on objects that
   reside on MAS such as configuring the number of DS1 channels between
   GR303 switch and MAS will be executed within MAS.

   For those commands that operate on objects that reside on the OPS-IAD
   (such as phone line ringing cadence), the CMIP message will be
   translated into an IOPS SNMP message, and sent to the appropriate
   OPS-IAD.   The OPS-IAD processes the IOPS SNMP message and sends
   the response back to MAS, which translates the IOPS SNMP
   response back to a CMIP response and sends it back to the class 5
   switch through the EOC channel.

3.5 Data Service Flow Through Provisioning

   The network manager at the NOC uses either in-band channel through 
   ATM network or out-of-band channel through Internet to access the
   SNMP agent in the MAS. The MAS SNMP agent represents all the SNMP
   managed objects residing on the MAS, as well as the SNMP objects
   residing in the OPS-IAD. Provisioning commands such as configuring
   the ATM VPI/VCI cross connection or the traffic parameters at the
   MAS will be executed within the MAS.
  
   For commands that operate on objects that reside on the OPS-IAD (such
   as the Ethernet interface local to the IAD), these SNMP messages in 
   the form of MOPS SNMP messages are
   sent to the MAS first.  The MAS will then translate
   the MOPS SNMP message into an IOPS SNMP message, and forward it to the
   appropriate OPS-IAD.  The OPS-IAD executes the IOPS SNMP messages and
   sends the responses back to MAS. The MAS in turn will
   translate the IOPS SNMP responses back to MOPS SNMP responses and send
   them back to the network manager at the NOC.  Notice that we use MOPS
   SNMP and IOPS SNMP to distinguish between the SNMP message arriving at
   the MAS and OPS-IAD, although they are standard SNMP messages.

3.6 Dynamic Software and Configuration Download
    
   This MIB provides for the capability for network manager to initiate 
   software upgrade and configuration change remotely on a IAD by 


   having it download a new software image or configuration file from 
   a specified server, and then rebooting itself to run the new software
   or reconfigure it to run with the new configuration.

3.6.1 Dynamic Software Upgrade

   Before starting the actual upgrade, information of the server on 
   which the software image or configuration file resides has to be set
   up first. This information could either be specified by the network 
   manager, through setting of iOpsIADServerIP, iOpsIADServerType, 
   iOpsIADServerLoginName, and iOpsIADServerPasswd attributes, or be 
   manually configured on the IAD.

   Next, the filename of the software image is specified in 
   iOpsIADSoftwareUpgradeFileName. Actual download is initiated by 
   setting iOpsIADDownloadSoftware to download(1), and specifying 
   whether the IAD should just save the file or reboot the device after 
   saving the file, by setting iOpsIADSaveSoftware to save(1) or 
   saveAndReboot(2). 
   Please note that both iOpsIADDownloadSoftware and iOpsIADSaveSoftware 
   attributes have to be in the same SET PDU.

   Network manager could monitor for the status of a download by
   polling for the value of iOpsIADDownloadSoftware, and/or listening to
   the softwareDownloadCompleteNotification trap.

   If iOpsIADSaveSoftware is set to save, network manager could initiate 
   the software upgrade at a later time by first setting 
   iOpsIADSoftwareFileName with the software file the IAD should boot up
   with. This file has to already exist locally in the IAD or else the
   request will be rejected. Next, network manager sets iOpsIADResetIAD
   to the value coldReboot(5) to reboot the IAD. 

   If iOpsIADSaveSoftware is set to saveAndReboot, IAD 
   will reboot with the new software if:
	- file transfer is successfully 
	  completed AND
	- the file is not corrupted. 
   Agent MUST update iOpsIADSoftwareFileName with 
   iOpsIADSoftwareUpgradeFileName before reconfiguring.

   If the IAD does not support multiple software images,
   then the save options of iOpsIADSaveSoftware is not applicable.

   If the IAD experience a reboot while downloading, it will load the
   previous image and, after re-initialization, continue to attempt
   loading the image specified in iOpsIADSoftwareUpgradeFileName.

3.6.2 Dynamic Configuration Upgrade

   Before starting the actual upgrade, information of the server on 
   which the software image or configuration file resides has to be set
   up first. This information could either be specified by the network 
   manager, through setting of iOpsIADServerIP, iOpsIADServerType, 
   iOpsIADServerLoginName, and iOpsIADServerPasswd attributes, or be


   manually configured on the IAD.

   Next, the filename of the configuration file is specified in 
   iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName. Actual download is initiated by 
   setting iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration to download(1), and specifying 
   whether the IAD should just save the file or reconfigure the device 
   immediately after saving the file, by setting iOpsIADSaveConfiguration
   to save(2) or saveAndReconfigure(3). 
   Please note that both iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration and 
   iOpsIADSaveConfiguration attributes have to be in the same SET PDU.

   Network manager could monitor for the status of a download by
   polling for the value of iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration, and/or 
   listening to the configUpDownloadCompleteNotification trap.

   If iOpsIADSaveConfiguration is set to save, network manager could 
   initiate the configuration update at a later time by first setting 
   iOpsIADConfigFileName with the configuration file the IAD should 
   configure to. This file has to already exist locally in the IAD or 
   else the request will be rejected. Next, network manager sets
   iOpsIADReConfigIAD to the value reConfig(2) to have IAD load
   the new configuration. 

   If iOpsIADSaveConfiguration is set to saveAndReconfigure, IAD 
   will load the new configuration if:
	- file transfer is successfully 
	  completed AND
	- the file is not corrupted. 
   Agent MUST update iOpsIADConfigFileName with 
   iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName before reconfiguring.

   If the IAD does not support multiple configuration files,
   then the save option of iOpsIADSaveConfiguration is not 
   applicable. 

   If the IAD experience a reboot while downloading, it will load the
   previous configuration and, after re-initialization, continue to 
   attempt loading the file specified in iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName.

   Network manager could also initiate an upload of a configuration
   file from an IAD to a server, by setting 
   iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName to the desired filename and 
   iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration to upload(2). Again, network
   manager can monitor for the status of an upload by polling for 
   the value of iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration, and/or listening to 
   the configUpDownloadCompleteNotification trap.

4. Definitions

-- *********************************************************************
--
--   The Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) MIB defines managed objects for
--   flow though provisioning and management functions.  This document
--   defines two groups of management objects of a next-generation
--   customer premise equipment (NG-CPE).  The first group of objects 
--   is of a general configuration nature and the second group is similar
--   to the Analog Line Termination objects of a GR303 Remote Terminal
--   as defined in the GR303 Core document. A NG-CPE that implements
--   the OPS MIBs is an OPS compliant NG-CPE.
--
--   Network management system at the Network Operation Center (NOC)
--   performs flow through provisioning and management of OPS-IAD
--   through an OPS-compliant Multi-service Access Concentrator (MAS).

5. Security Considerations 

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have
a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects may
be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations. There are
a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be service affecting
if not SET properly. These are:
	o  iOpsIADResetIAD
	o  iOpsIADSoftwareUpgradeFileName 
	o  iOpsIADDownloadSoftware 
	o  iOpsIADSaveSoftware 
	o  iOpsIADReConfigIAD 
	o  iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName 
	o  iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration 
	o  iOpsIADSaveConfiguration 

It is thus important to control access to these objects. Not all
versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the
User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
