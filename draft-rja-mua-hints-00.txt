            Configuration Hints for Common Mail User Agents






STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to all provisions in
   Section 10 of RFC-2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups
   may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and
   may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It
   is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite
   them other than as "work in progress."

ABSTRACT

      This informational document describes how certain common Mail User
   Agents  can  be configured for conformance with the IETF Mailing List
   Guidelines.  Subject to normal processes and procedures,  this  draft
   might some day be published as an Informational RFC.

   [NOTE:  Any comments should be sent to the document editor as  email,
           strongly  preferably  with  a  clear Subject: line indicating
           this draft is the topic.   Comments  with  specific  proposed
           edits are much more helpful than broad general comments.]

1. Introduction

           The IETF  uses  mailing  lists  as  its  primary  method  for
   accomplishing  work.  In normal practice, each IETF Working Group has
   at least one mailing list that is used  principally  for  discussions
   within that Working Group's charter.

           The IETF has developed a  set  of  Mailing  List  Guidelines.
   While  these guidelines are optimised for interoperability, some Mail
   User Agent implementers have optimised for  other  objectives.   This
   document provides information on how to configure certain common Mail
   User Agents to send mail in a format more nearly consistent with  the
   IETF Mailing List Guidelines.

2. America Online (AOL) Mail Client

           By default, the AOL Mail  Client  sends  all  email  in  HTML
   format.  This default setting can be changed so that email is sent in
   text/plain format instead. [AOL]

           To cause AOL to  always  send  mail  in  plain-text  so  that
   everyone  is  able  to  read it, please undertake these steps.  Go to
   "Keyword:Preferences".    Click   on   "Font,   Text,   &    Graphics
   Preferences".   Click  on  the  RESET  button  at  the  bottom of the
   resulting window.  Do not make any changes after hitting RESET.  Then
   click on the SAVE button.

           To cause AOL to  not  send  "vacation"  or  "Out  of  Office"
   messages to IETF mailing lists, undertake the following steps.  [TBD.
   Help solicited]

3. Microsoft Outlook Mail Client family

           By default, many versions of Microsoft Outlook send all email
   in HTML or some other "enhanced" (sic) text format.  This setting can
   be changed in most or all versions of  Outlook.   This  informational
   appendix  provides  configuration  hints  for certain widely deployed
   versions of Microsoft Outlook for the benefit of IETF participants.

           For Microsoft Outlook 2000 or Microsoft  Outlook  Express  5,
   one  should select the TOOLS pull-down menu, then select OPTIONS.  In
   this dialogue, click on the MAIL FORMAT tab.   Now,  set  the  output
   format to be "Plain Text", instead of either "Rich Text" or "HTML".

           Also, Microsoft Outlook 2000 also permits  both  text  format
   and charset to be set on a per-message basis.  From the top window of
   the mail message, select FORMAT  then  PLAIN  TEXT  and  also  select
   FORMAT  then  ENCODING  then  US-ASCII.   Now,  right  click  on each

   addressee in turn, select SEND OPTIONS, then check  the  "I  want  to
   specify  the  format of messages sent to this recipient" option, then
   check the PLAIN TEXT radio button, then uncheck the BINHEX box as the
   attachment  type.   Note that the "right click on addressee step" and
   the other steps need to be done for EACH recipient on EACH message.

           To cause Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, or  Exchange  to
   NOT  send  "vacation"  or  "Out  of  Office" messages to IETF mailing
   lists, one  should  undertake  these  steps.   [TBD.   Accurate  text
   solicited.]

4. Qualcomm Eudora Mail Client

           Many versions of  Qualcomm  Eudora  have  the  capability  of
   sending  mail  in  one or another "enhanced" (sic) text format.  This
   setting can be changed in most  or  all  versions  of  Eudora.   This
   informational  appendix  provides  configuration  hints  for  certain
   widely deployed versions of Qualcomm Eudora.

           To disable the sending of HTML or fancy text formats in email
   originated  by  Eudora,  one  uses  the TOOLS menu to select OPTIONS.
   Then one scrolls to STYLED  TEXT.   On  the  STYLED  TEXT  menu,  one
   ensures  that  the  radio  button  marked  "Send  plain text only" is
   selected and that the box marked "Send the signature with styles"  is
   NOT  selected.                   Eudora does not send "Out of Office"
   or "vacation" messages, so no special configuration instructions  are
   needed for that.



5. Security Considerations

           This document raises no new security issues because it merely
   provides information about configuration of certain deployed MUAs.

           Email is generally insecure.   Folks  concerned  about  email
   security  should consider employing IETF standards-track protocols to
   protect their email.
