              draft-wang-secure-access-of-iot-terminals-00

Abstract

   It is difficult to supervise the great deal of Internet of Things
   (IoT) smart terminals which are widely distributed.  Furthermore, a
   large number of smart terminals (such as IP cameras, access control
   terminals, traffic cameras, etc.) running on the network have high
   security risks in access control.  This draft introduces the
   technical requirements for access management and control of IoT smart
   terminals, which is used to solve the problem of personate and
   illegal connection in the access process, and enables users to
   strengthen the control of devices and discover devices that is
   offline in time, so as to ensure the safety and stability of smart
   terminals in the access process.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid development of the IoT and the IP-based communication
   system, a large number of devices have been interconnected through
   the network.  Due to the large number of branches of IoT network, the
   scattered geographical location of smart terminals access, the
   difficulty of human supervision, etc., how to ensure the full control
   and full time availability of IoT is a brand new problem which is
   faced by the industry.  A large number of smart terminals (such as IP
   cameras, access controll terminals, traffic cameras and other dumb
   terminals) running in the network have a large security risk in terms
   of security access control.  With the further development of the
   convergence of IoT systems and information network, if the IoT smart
   terminal is once used by hackers, it is very easy for hackers to
   penetrate the whole network through the IoT smart terminal, causing

   core business systems to stop and a large amount of confidential
   information to leak, which will bring significant losses.  Therefore,
   the establishment of a perfect access control mechanism and
   application control mechanism of smart terminals is an important
   element of the IoT security system.

   This draft outlines the technical requirements for secure access and
   management of smart terminals in the IoT to address the security
   threats and challenges that exist in the access process of terminals.
   We discuss the networking structure of common IoT smart terminals in
   Section 2; we discuss the security threats and challenges faced in
   the access process of IoT smart terminals in Section 3; in Section 4,
   we review the guidelines and regulations related to the access of IoT
   devices; Section 5 we present the requirements for secure access and
   management of IoT smart terminals and describes their details; in
   Section 6 we concludes the whole draft.  This draft provides a
   reference for IoT security access and management.

2.  The Network Structure of IoT system

   IoT smart terminals are generally connected to the network through
   IoT gateway, and then the data information of the terminals is
   reported to the application center through the IoT gateway, thus
   completing the network building.

   A diagram of an IoT system is shown in the figure below.  In the
   perception layer, there are four different types of IoT smart
   terminals that form four different subsystems, which are video
   monitoring subsystem, access control subsystem, alarm subsystem and
   intercom subsystem.  The smart terminals in each subsystem are
   different.  In the video monitoring subsystem, the main terminals are
   IP cameras and intelligent cameras for collecting video and image
   data.  In the access control subsystem, the main terminals are
   turnstiles and vehicle access control hosts for collecting vehicle
   information.  In the alarm subsystem, the main terminals are alarm
   hosts, alarm keyboards and wireless alarm hosts, which are used to
   set alarm policies, issue alarm warnings and report alarm events,
   etc.  In the intercom subsystem, its main terminals are intercom
   hosts and individual equipment, which are used to collect voice data.
   Through this figure, we can know that in the IoT system, smart
   terminals are heterogeneous and complex, and the data are aggregated
   into the application layer through the transport layer, which greatly
   increases the difficulty of the application layer to control the
   terminals in the sensing layer.

3.  Security Threats and Challenges

   The main security threats and challenges in the process of accessing
   IoT smart terminals are as follows:

   1.  Illegal connection of devices.  On the side of IoT smart
       terminals, there exist illegal devices and illegal hosts to
       access to the network for probing attacks.There exists the
       situation that the application layer network is invaded through
       the network of smart terminals and the sensitive data of the
       application layer network is illegally stolen, thus causing great
       damage to the security of IoT.

   2.  Counterfeit connection of devices.  With wide distribution of IoT
       smart terminals and the public deployment environment, it is easy
       for malicious devices to illegally impersonate and replace
       legitimate devices and upload fake data, which leads to abnormal
       function of the devices and causes great damage to the security
       of IoT.

   3.  Devices offline.  The number of IoT smart terminals is huge and
       they are very vulnerable to physical attacks, network anomalies,
       power supply anomalies, and the aging of the device itself, which
       leads to go offline.  And offline devices are difficult to
       discover, making some of the normal functions of the IoT lost.

   4.  Devices management.  There are many kinds of IoT smart terminals,
       and it is often not clear how many IoT smart terminals are owned
       in the whole IoT network and how many IoT smart terminals have
       security problems, which leads to problems such as inability to
       control IoT smart terminals and inability to sort out device
       assets.

4.  Current Technology Level

   1.  On the access control of IoT, there already exist many control
       protocols applied to IoT smart terminals, such as Zigbee [ZB],
       DALI [DALI], BACNET [BACNET], which do not contribute to the
       secure access of IoT devices.  the UPnP [ISOIEC23941] access
       protocol defines the access to IoT smart terminals, but does not
       consider the issue of secure access.

Internet-Draft    Secure Access of IoT Smart Terminals        March 2021


   2.  There are many specialized and generic security protocols being
       used in current IP-based deployments of IoT smart device
       applications.  For example, IPsec [RFC7296], TLS [RFC8446], DTLS
       [RFC6347], HIP [RFC7401], Kerberos [RFC4120], SASL [RFC4422], and
       EAP [RFC3748], etc.  These also do not protect against illegal
       connection of devices,counterfeit connection of devices, and
       device offline encountered during device access.

   3.  There are also a number of groups that are also currently
       focusing on IoT device security . For example, the Cloud Security
       Alliance (CSA) is recommending that enterprises building the IoT
       consider strengthening IoT smart device authentication/
       authorization [CSA];the Global System for Mobile communications
       Association (GSMA) has published a security guide for IoT systems
       [GSMA] to bring a set of security guidelines to the research of
       IoT security product; and the United States Department of
       Homeland Security(DHS) has proposed six IoT security strategic
       principles [DHS] to guide IoT developers, manufacturers, service
       providers, and consumers in considering security issues.  These
       teams give good advice on building security for the IoT, but
       there is no introduction or description of secure access to the
       IoT.

   4.  In the existing security standards on IoT, such as [RFC8576], the
       security issues and solutions existing in IoT are introduced, but
       there is no mention of the problems and solutions existing in the
       access process of smart terminals.

   5.  In other related device access standards, there are 802.1x
       [ISO88021X] based device access and portal-based authentication,
       but because IoT smart terminals exist mainly in the form of dumb
       terminals, they are not suitable for authentication access
       through 802.1x or portal, and the two authentication methods
       cannot be used to solve the illegal connection of devices and
       counterfeit connection of devices .

5.  Secure Access and Management of IoT Smart Terminals

5.1.  Framework of Secure Access Management

   Comparing to three-layer framework of IoT,a layer of access and
   management is added for the framework of secure access management,
   which is between transport layer and application layer.  The
   framework of secure access management for IoT smart terminals is
   shown in the following figure.  In this framework, the access process
   of IoT is divided into four parts, which are sensing&control domain,
   access&management domain, application&service domain and user domain.
   Among them, access&management domain is the specific implementation

   of the secure access and management technical requirements to ensure
   secure access of smart terminals in terms of smart terminals
   management, access control, strategy management and access log audit.

Internet-Draft    Secure Access of IoT Smart Terminals        March 2021


5.1.1.  Sensing & Controlling Domain

   Smart Terminals: including smart terminals through RS-485, RS-232 and
   other wired devices, zigberr, Lora and other wireless terminal
   equipment, smart terminal equipment through IP, WiFi, 5g, 4G access
   network, audio and video equipment, RFID equipment and intelligent
   camera equipment, etc.

   IOT Gateway: an entity used to connect smart terminals and terminals
   of upper layer.

   Among them, smart terminals can be directly connected with the
   access&management domain, or indirectly connected with the access and
   management domain through the Internet of things gateway.

5.1.2.  Access & Management Domain

   Access and management domain is the core, which is used to manage and
   control the access of smart terminals, including four parts: device
   management, device access, access policy management and log audit.

   The contents of each part clarified as follows:

   Device Management: It mainly manages equipment asset information,
   including IP address, MAC address, type of device, brand, model, open
   port and service of smart terminal equipment.

   Device Access: Refers to the device access mode supported by smart
   terminals, including access based on unique identification
