 Abstract  
     
    This draft defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history 
    information associated with a SIP request.  This capability enables 
    many enhanced services by providing the information as to how and 
    why a call arrives at a specific application or user.  This draft 
    defines a new optional SIP header, History-Info, for capturing the 
    history information in requests. A new option tag, HistInfo, to be 
    included in the Supported header is defined to allow UAs to 
    indicate whether the HistInfo should be returned in responses to a 
    request which has captured the history information.

 Overview  
         
    This document provides the solution for the Request History 
    requirements as defined in [1].   
     
    The fundamental functionality provided by the request history 
    information is the ability to inform proxies and UAs involved in 
    processing a request about the history or progress of that request. 
    This functionality provides a standard mechanism for capturing the 
    request history information to enable a wide variety of services 
    for networks and end users, without prescribing the operation of 
    those services.    
    
    Section 1 provides an overall description of the solution, 
    providing references to the appropriate requirements met by each 
    aspect of the solution. For background, further detail on some 
    aspects of the solution with regards to optionality and the 
    detailed protocol requirements is provided in Appendix D. 
     
    Section 2 provides the details of the additions to the SIP 
    protocol, which are required to capture the Request History 
    information.  An example use of the request history information is 
    included in Section 2, with additional scenarios included in the 
    Appendix. It is anticipated that these would be moved and 
    progressed in the Service examples draft [2] or individual 
    informational drafts describing these specific services, since 
    History-Info is just one of the building blocks for implementing 
    these services. Individual drafts would be particularly useful for 
    documenting services for which there are multiple solutions, since 
    the use of the request history information isn't prescriptive.

    Retargeted-to-URI: The new URI or address to which the request is 
    in the process of being retargeted.  
  
  
 1 Request History Information Description 
  
    The fundamental functionality provided by the request history 
    information is the ability to inform proxies and UAs involved in 
    processing a request about the history or progress of that request 
    [CAPABILITY-req].  The solution for the capture of the Request 
    History Information defines a new header for SIP messages: History-
    Info [CONTENT-req].  
     
    The Request History Information can appear in any request not 
    associated with an established dialog, which includes INVITE, 
    REGISTER, MESSAGE and OPTIONS [REQUEST-VALIDITY-req] and any valid 
    response to these requests.[ISSUER-req]  
     
    Request History Information is captured when a request is 
    retargeted. In some scenarios, it might be possible for more than 
    one instance of retargeting to occur within the same Proxy.  A 
    proxy SHOULD also generate request history information for the 
    'internal retargeting'. An entity (UA or proxy) retargeting in 
    response to a redirect or REFER SHOULD include any Request History 
    information from the redirect/REFER in the new request [GENERATION-
    req, FORWARDS-req]. 
        
 1.1 Optionality of History-Info 
        
    The Request History Information is optional in that neither UAs nor 
    Proxies are required to support it. The requirement for Request 
    History information to be returned in Responses is indicated using 
    a new Supported header: HistInfo [BACKWARDS-req]. In addition, 
    local policy can define whether or not the information is captured 
    by the retargeting entity for any request, or a specific Request-
    URI, being retargeted. In many instances, it is likely that this 
    could restrict the applicability of services which make use of the 
    Request History Information to be limited to retargeting within 
    domain(s) controlled by the same local policy, or between domain(s) 
    which negotiate policies with other domains to ensure support of 
    the given policy, or services for which "complete" History 
    Information isn't required to provide the service. [OPTIONALITY-
    req]  Thus, it is highly recommended that all applications making 
    use of the request history information clearly define the impact of 
    the information not being available and specify the processing of 
    such a request.  
     
 1.2 Securing History-Info 
     
    This draft defines a new header for SIP.  Since, the Request 
    History information is being inserted by an entity as it targets a 
    Request, the resulting security requirements introduce a slightly 
    different problem than the basic SIP header or Identity problem. 
    For History-Info, the general requirement is to secure information 
    that is inserted by a proxy.  It is primarily the captured Request-
    URIs that are the security concern, since they can reflect some 
    aspect of a user's identity and service routing. Thus, the primary 
    objective of the security solution is to ensure that the 
    information being captured is protected from being accessed or 
    manipulated by non-authorized entities, with the fundamental

                    SIP Request History Information     February 2003 
  
  
    assumption that retargeting entities are implicitly authorized.  
    The draft does suggest the use of a secure transport mechanism such 
    as TLS to ensure the overall confidentiality of the History-
    Info[SEC-req-4].  However, the complete security solution for 
    History-Info depends upon a general solution for protecting the 
    captured information. This will be addressed in a separate solution 
    draft [TBD]. Details of the use of this proposed mechanism to 
    satisfy the security requirements are provided in section 2.4.  
     
    The security associated with the Request History Information is 
    optional and depends upon local policy and the impact on specific 
    applications of having the information compromised.  Since, the 
    Request History Information itself is also optional and it has been 
    recommended that applications document the impact of the 
    information not being available, it is also suggested that the 
    impact of not supporting the security recommendations also be 
    documented to ensure that it is sufficiently addressed by the 
    application.  
  
 1.3 Ensuring the Privacy of History-Info 
     
    In order to satisfy the requirements of ensuring that the privacy 
    associated with a retargeted request is maintained by the 
    retargeting entity [PRIV-req-1] and by the receiving entity [PRIV-
    req-2], the retargeting entity must determine if there is any 
    privacy associated with a request being retargeted. In some 
    scenarios, the Privacy header would indicate whether the headers in 
    a message should be privacy protected. However, the basic 
    assumption is that local policy would be used to determine whether 
    a specific request should have its privacy maintained and whether 
    maintaining that privacy means that a specific request URI would 
    NOT be captured or that it would be appropriately Privacy protected 
    if it were captured. The proposal for ensuring that the privacy is 
    protected is to recommend the use of a Privacy Service as defined 
    by [6] for headers.  
     
    It is recognized that meeting the privacy requirements can impact 
    the functionality of this solution by overriding the request to 
    generate the information. As with the optionality and security 
    requirements, applications making use of History-Info should 
    address any impact this may have.  
     
  
 2 Request History Information Protocol Details 
     
    This section contains the details and usage of the proposed new SIP 
    protocol elements.  It also discusses the security aspects of the 
    solution and provides some examples.   
  
 2.1 Protocol Structure of History-Info 
     
    History-Info is a header field as defined by [4].  It can appear in 
    any request not associated with an established dialog, which 
    includes INVITE, REGISTER, MESSAGE and OPTIONS and any valid 
    response to these requests.   
     
    It carries the following information: 
     
       o Targeted-to-URI: the Request URI captured as the Request is 
         targeted. By capturing a copy of the Request URI in the

                    SIP Request History Information     February 2003 
  
  
         initial request, the Retargeted-from-URI is already captured 
         when a request is retargeted and the Retargeted-to-URI is 
         being captured.   
  
       o Reason: An optional parameter for History-info. The reason for 
         the retargeting is captured by including the Reason Header [3] 
         as part of the captured Request URI. 
  
       o Index: An optional parameter for History-Info reflecting the  
         chronological order of the information, indexed to also 
         reflect the forking and nesting of requests.  
  
    The semantics of the captured Targeted-to-URIs are derived from the 
    current context of the request as follows:   
     
       o Retargeted-from-URI: this is the Request URI that is being 
         changed due to the retargeting. It is the Targeted-to-URI in 
         the request received by the retargeting entity.  If it was not 
         explicitly captured by the original sender/forwarder of the 
         request, it would be captured and added to the request prior 
         to the Targeted-to-URI currently being captured.  If the 
         sender/forwarder supported History-Info, it would have been 
         added prior to sending/forwarding the Request. 
  
       o Retargeted-to-URI: this is the Targeted-to-URI being captured 
         in the request being retargeted.   
     
    The following summarizes the syntax of the History-Info header, 
    based upon the standard SIP syntax [4]:  
                                                                         
           History-Info = ("History-Info" / "h") HCOLON  
     
                             hist-info *(COMMA hist-info) 
     
           hist-info = hi-targeted-to-uri *( SEMI HI-param ) 
     
           hi-targeted-to-uri= name-addr 
     
           hi-param = hi-index / hi-extension  
     
             hi-index = "index" EQUAL 1*DIGIT *(DOT 1*DIGIT) 
     
           hi-extension = generic-param 
   
     
 2.2 Protocol Examples 
     
    History-Info:<sip:UserA@ims.nortelnetworks.com?Reason=SIP; 
    cause=302;text=öMoved Temporarilyö>; foo=bar 
     
    History-Info: <sip:45432@vm.nortelnetworks.com? 
    Reason=SIP;cause=486;text="Busy Here"> ; index=1.1.2 
  
     
 2.3 Protocol usage 
     
    This section describes the processing specific to UAs and Proxies 
    for the History-Info and the HistInfo option tag.

                    SIP Request History Information     February 2003 
  
  
    [Editor's note: Once the Security solution is fully fleshed out, it 
    may be reasonable to move this section 2.3 after section 2.4 and 
    provide the detailed security related processing prior to this 
    section, so that security aspects can be highlighted in this 
    section, as well.] 
     
    2.3.1 UAC Behavior 
     
    The UAC SHOULD include the HistInfo option tag in the Supported 
    header in any request not associated with an established dialog for 
    which the UAC would like the History-Info in the Response.  In 
    addition, the UAC should initiate the capturing of the History 
    Information by capturing the Request-URI as the hi-targeted-to-uri 
    and initializing the index to 1.  
     
    The processing of the History-Info received in the response is 
    application specific and outside the scope of this draft.  
     
     
    2.3.2 UAS Behavior 
     
    The processing of History-Info by a UAS in a Request depends upon 
    local policy and specific applications at the UAS which might make 
    use of the information.  If the HistInfo option tag is received in 
    a request, the UAS should include any History-Info received in the 
    request in the subsequent response.     
  
  
    2.3.3 Proxy Behavior 
     
    The use of History-Info does not alter the fundamental processing 
    of proxies for determining request targets as defined in section 
    16.5 of [4].  Whether a proxy captures the History-Info depends 
    upon several factors: 
         o Whether the Request contains the HistInfo option tag in the 
           Supported header.  
         o Local Policy 
           The following are further considerations for refinement of a 
           local policy supporting History-Info:  
              o Whether retargeting within a Proxy is captured  
              o Whether the History-Info captured for a proxy/domain 
                should go outside that domain (e.g. a Proxy knows that 
                the information is potentially useful within that 
                domain, however, policies (for privacy, user and 
                network security, etc.) prohibit the exposure of that 
                information outside that domain). 
           Each application making use of History-Info should address 
           the applicability and impacts of the local policies. 
  
    Consistent with basic SIP processing of optional headers, proxies 
    should maintain History-Info captured by other domains, received in 
    messages which they forward, independent of whether local policy 
    supports History-Info. 
     
    The specific processing by proxies for capturing the History-Info 
    in Requests and Responses is described in detail in the following 
    sections.  
  
    2.3.3.1 Capturing History-Info in Requests  
     
  
  
 Barnes                  Expires û August 2003               [Page 6] 
                    SIP Request History Information     February 2003 
  
  
    If the proxy supports History-Info, the proxy SHOULD add any 
    History-Info collected as it retargets a Request. The SIP Response 
    Code should be included in the Reason header of the Targeted-to-
    URI. The History-Info SHOULD be added following any History-Info 
    received in the request being forwarded. Additionally, if a request 
    is received that doesn't include a captured Request URI from the 
    previous entity, the proxy MAY add an additional entry, effectively 
    capturing the retargeted-from-URI in the Request.   
     
    In order to maintain ordering and accurately reflect the nesting 
    and retargeting of the request, it is recommended that an index be 
    included along with the Targeted-to-URI being captured. The basic 
    rule for adding the index are to read the value from the previous 
    History-Info, if available, and capture the index.n as the index 
    for the History-Info being captured, where n would typically be 1 
    for a forwarded request. Thus, the level of nesting of the index 
    reflects the number of hops. For retargets within a proxy, the 
    proxy MUST maintain the current level of nesting by incrementing 
    the lowest/last digit of the index for each instance of 
    retargeting, thus reflecting the number of retargets within the 
    proxy.  If there is no previous History-Info entry, or index in the 
    previous entry, an index MAY be included for the current entry, 
    with the index starting at 1.  An index SHOULD NOT be added in the 
    scenario whereby the received request had no History-Info header 
    and the retargeted-from-URI is being captured for completeness.         
  
    Parallel forking, as with basic SIP processing, does introduce 
    somewhat of a special case. In the case of parallel forking, the 
    proxy SHOULD capture each of the Request-URIs to which the Request 
    is forked in the manner previously described. However, since the 
    forking is parallel, it's recommended that rather than attempt to 
    send the logical order of the requests being sent, that the 
    information for subsequent requests or responses is built upon 
    receipt of the initial response to ensure that the series of any 
    subsequent forking and retargeting of any of the forked requests 
    accurately reflects the logical sequence.  Again, it is recommended 
    that the index be captured for each forked request following a 
    similar model as that previously described, with each new Request 
    having a unique index.  The lack of Reason headers in the captured 
    Request-URIs should be indicative of the parallel nature of forking 
    (i.e the Request-URIs are not the result of retargets, but are 
    rather all simultaneous Targeted-To URIs.)  
     
    2.3.3.2 Processing History-Info in Responses 
     
    A proxy that receives a Request with the HistInfo option tag in the 
    Supported header, and depending upon a local policy supporting the 
    capture of History-Info, SHOULD return captured History-Info in 
    subsequent, provisional and final, responses to the Request. 
     
       
 2.4 Security for History-Info 
  
    As discussed in Section 1, the security requirements are met by 
    recommending the use of TLS (a basic SIP requirement per [4]) and 
    through the use of the security solution defined in [TBD].

    [Editor's Note: Need to add some protocol details based on the use 
    of S/MIME for protecting History-Info once [TBD] is further along]. 
     
 2.5 Example Applications using History-Info 
  
    This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
    response is primarily of use in not retrying routes that have 
    already been tried by another proxy. Note, that this is just an 
    example and that there may be valid reasons why a Proxy would want 
    to retry the routes and thus, this would like be a local proxy or 
    even user specific policy.  
     
    UA 1 sends a call to "Bob" to proxy 1. Proxy 1 forwards the request 
    to Proxy 2.  Proxy 2 parallel forks and tries several places (UA2, 
    UA3 and UA4) before sending a response to Proxy 1 that all the 
    places are busy.   Proxy 1, without the History-Info, would try 
    several of the same places (UA3 and UA4)based upon registered 
    contacts for "Bob", before completing at UA5. However, with the 
    History-Info, Proxy 1 determines that UA3 and UA4 have already 
    received the invite, thus the INVITE goes directly to UA5.  
     
  
     
    UA1        Proxy1  Proxy2     UA2      UA3      UA4      UA5

 3 Security Considerations  
     
    This draft provides a proposal for addressing the Security 
    requirements identified in [1] in sections 1.2 and 2.4 of this 
    draft by proposing the use of TLS between entities. The protection 
    of the History-Info is dependent upon a general solution for 
    securing headers added by proxies. This general solution is 
    described in [TBD] [Editor's note: Assumed to be based upon the SIP 
    Authenticated Identity body model defined in [5].]   
      
 4 IANA Considerations 
  
    (Note to RFC Editor: Please fill in all occurrences of XXXX in this 
    section with the RFC number of this specification). 
  
    This document defines a new SIP header field name with a compact 
    form: History-Info and h respectively, and a new option tag: 
    HistInfo.  
     
    The following changes should be made to http:///www.iana.org/ 
    assignments/sip-parameters 
     
    The following row should be added to the header field section:  
     
    Header Name             Compact Form               Reference 
    History-Info                  h                    [RFCXXXX] 
     
    The following should be added to the Options Tags section: 
  
    Name          Description                          Reference                     
    HistInfo      When used with the Supported header, [RFCXXXX] 
                  this option tag indicates support 
                  for the History Information to be  
                  captured for requests and returned in 
                  subsequent responses. This tag is not 
                  used in a Proxy-Require or Requires  
                  header field since support of  
                  History-Info is optional.

 Appendix A  Forking Scenarios 
     
 A.1 Sequentially forking (Hist-Info in Response) 
     
    This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
    response is useful to an application or user that originated the 
    request.

    UA 1 sends a call to "Bob" via proxy 1. Proxy 1 sequentially tries 
    several places (UA2, UA3 and UA4) unsuccessfully before sending a 
    response to UA1.   
  
    This scenario is provided to show that by providing the History-
    Info to UA1, the end user or an application at UA1 could make a 
    decision on how best to attempt finding "Bob".  Without this 
    mechanism UA1 might well attempt UA3 (and thus UA4) and then re-                      rd    attempt UA4 on a 3   manual attempting at reaching "Bob". With this 
    mechanism, either the end user or application could know that "Bob" 
    is busy on his home phone and is physically not in the office. If 
    there were an alternative address for "Bob" known to this end user 
    or application, that hasn't been attempted, then either the 
    application or the end user could attempt that. The intent here is 
    to highlight an example of the flexibility of this mechanism that 
    enables applications well beyond SIP as it is certainly well beyond 
    the scope of this draft to prescribe detailed applications.

 A.2 Sequential Forking (with Success) 
  
    This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
    request is primarily of use in not retrying routes that have 
    already been tried by another proxy. Note, that this is just an 
    example and that there may be valid reasons why a Proxy would want 
    to retry the routes and thus, this would like be a local proxy or 
    even user specific policy.

    UA 1 sends a call to "Bob" to proxy 1. Proxy 1 sequentially tries 
    several places (UA2, UA3 and UA4) before retargeting the call to 
    Proxy 2.  Proxy 2, without the History-Info, would try several of 
    the same places (UA3 and UA4)based upon registered contacts for 
    "Bob", before completing at UA5. However, with the History-Info, 
    Proxy 2 determines that UA3 and UA4 have already received the 
    invite, thus the INVITE goes directly to UA5.

 Appendix B  Voicemail 
  
    This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the 
    request is primarily of use by an edge service (e.g. Voicemail 
    Server). It should be noted that this isn't intended to be a 
    complete specification for this specific edge service as it is 
    quite likely that additional information is need by the edge 
    service. History-Info is just one building block that this service 
    makes use of. 
  
    UA 1 called UA A which had been forwarded to UA B which forwarded 
    to a UA VM (voicemail server).  Based upon the retargeted URIs and 
    Reasons (and other information) in the INVITE, the VM server makes 
    a policy decision about what mailbox to use, which greeting to play 
    etc.

 Appendix C  Automatic Call Distribution Example 
  
    This scenario highlights an example of an Automatic Call 
    Distribution service, where the agents are divided into groups 
    based upon the type of customers they handle. In this example, the 
    Gold customers are given higher priority than Silver customers, so 
    a Gold call would get serviced even if all the agents servicing the

    Gold group (ACDGRP1) were busy, by retargeting the request to the 
    Silver Group.  Upon receipt of the call at the agent assigned to 
    handle the incoming call, based upon the History-Info in the 
    message, the application at the agent can provide an indication 
    that this is a Gold call, from how many groups it might have 
    overflowed before reaching the agent, etc. thus can be handled 
    appropriately by the agent.  
     
    For scenarios whereby calls might overflow from the Silver to the 
    Gold, clearly the alternate group identification, internal routing 
    or actual agent that handles the call SHOULD not be sent to UA1, 
    thus for this scenario, one would expect that the Proxy would not 
    support the sending of the History-Info in the response, even if 
    requested by the calling UA.  
     
    As with the other examples, this is not prescriptive of how one 
    would do this type of service but an example of a subset of 
    processing that might be associated with such a service.  In 
    addition, this example is not addressing any aspects of Agent 
    availability, which might also be done via a SIP interface.

 Appendix D  Solution options analysis 
  
    This section is included to capture some background analysis 
    forming the basis for the solution proposed in this document.  This 
    section can be deleted from a subsequent version once the content 
    of this document is sufficiently developed and well understood.   
  
    D.1 Optionality Requirements. 
     
    In many cases, it is anticipated that whether the history is added 
    to the Request would be a local policy decision enforced by the 
    specific application, thus no specific protocol element is needed.  
    However, due to the capability being "optional" from the SIP 
    protocol perspective, the impact to an application of not having 
    the "Request History" must be described. For example, in a scenario 
    where there is sequential forking and retargeting, some of the 
    destinations previously tried could be retried. The impact of not 
    having the "Request History" information for this sample 
    application is that routing is inefficient.  However, another 
    scenario involving a voicemail application, the impact of not 
    having the "Request History" information would be the service could 
    not operate without having the information as to why the call was 
    retargeted and the initial target for the call. Thus, the 
    expectation would be that the policy in a system that intended to 
    support this voicemail application would have to require the 
    entities within its domain which are capable of retargeting to 
    capture "Request History" information.   
     
    Thus, there are several aspects to the optionality requirement: 
       o Optionality with regards to whether the History Information is 
         to be included in responses to the original Request. 
       o Optionality with regards to whether a particular retargeting 
         entity records the History Information. 
       o Due to the Privacy requirement, the information MUST not be 
         captured for Request URIs that have indicated a requirement 
         for privacy.  
     
    The optionality mechanisms also depends upon whether the need for 
    the "Request History" is based upon an end user based service (e.g. 
    a GUI that provides the list of tried entities for an unsuccessful 
    call setup, thus ensuring that the caller doesn't re-attempt an 
    entity in that list or attendant services) or a network based 
    service whose use of the "Request History" would likely be 
    transparent to the UA (e.g. the Voicemail example).     
     
    The Supported header is the chosen mechanism for a UAC to indicate 
    that the information should be included in subsequent responses.  
    Whether a server processing the request supports the mechanism 
    would be based upon local policy for that domain.   
     
     
    D.2 Content-req 
     
    The Content-req specifies the following: 
    Retargeted-to-URI 
    Retargeted-from-URI

    Chronological ordering 
     
    The following summarizes the solution considerations for each of 
    these content requirements: 
     
    D.2.1 Is the Retargeted-to-URI required when it can be derived at 
    the next hop, which would capture this as the Retargeted-from-URI 
    for subsequent retargeting?  
     
    In a series of Request History Information, the Retargeted-to-URI 
    becomes the Retargeted-from-URI for the next occurrence of 
    retargeting, thus it would be possible in a scenario where the 
    Request History functionality is supported by each of the 
    retargeting entities to derive a complete set of Retargeted-to and 
    Retargeted-from URIs from the sequence of History Information 
    rather than including both Retargeted-to and Retargeting-from URI 
    in each occurrence of History Information.   
     
    However, for the scenario where a particular proxy retargets, but 
    local policy does not support the Request History Information, this 
    approach could result in a potential loss of information.  In 
    addition, the support of the BACKWARDS-Req does require that the 
    retargeted-to URI also be captured to ensure completeness of 
    information (to the extent possible based on policies, privacy, 
    etc.) in Responses.  
     
    Another option put forth was capture only one URI, but to actually 
    capture the initial targeted-to-URI which then becomes a 
    retargeted-from-URI when the request is retargeted, with the 
    retargeted-to-URI captured as the next targeted-to-URI.  This would 
    require that a UA wanting to make use of History-Info in responses 
    would actually capture the first targeted-to-URI.  In addition, a 
    proxy that supports History-Info would need to capture two 
    targeted-to URIs IF one was not included in the initial Request. 
    This processing could appear to be in conflict with the privacy and 
    optionality requirements, however, since a Request-URI is only 
    retargeted if it indicates a resource that a proxy is responsible 
    for, this isn't an issue. What this does mean is that a request 
    that is only forwarded by a proxy would NOT capture the retargeted-
    from URI, but could capture the retargeted-to URI. 
     
     
    D.2.2 Reason 
     
    The Reason header field [3] seems like a possible solution for 
    carrying the Reason associated with the Retargeting.  It is 
    proposed to include this header as an optional escaped part of the 
    targeted-to-URI.   
     
    D.2.3 Chronological ordering 
     
    The following were considered as options for satisfying this 
    requirement: 
       o No explicit count/index.  The Chronological ordering 
         requirement should not require a specific protocol element if 
         the History-Info entries are recommended to be added in the 
         order they are generated and collected.   
    If a count/index is included, the following were considered as 
    alternatives for maintaining the logical order of the parallel 
    forking:

       o Indexing using a dot delimiter to indicate hops and forking 
         (e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2 would indicate 2 hops with 2 retargeted                       nd         URIs at the 2   hop.) 
       o ABNF reflecting the nesting/hops (whether this is even 
         feasible was not determined). 
       o Allowing the same value for the count/index (i.e. not worrying 
         about duplicates as the value indicates only relative order). 
       o Including a count and an additional branch parameter for the 
         forking (e.g. n=1, br=1.1, n=1, br=1.2).
