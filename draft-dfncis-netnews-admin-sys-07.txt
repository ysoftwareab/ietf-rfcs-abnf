Abstract

   The Netnews Administration System (NAS) is a	framework to simplify
   the administration and usage	of network news	(also known as Netnews)
   on the Internet. Data for the administration	of newsgroups and
   hierarchies are kept	in a distributed hierarchical database and are
   available through a client-server-protocol.

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   The database	is accessible by news servers and news administrators as
   well	as by news readers. News servers can update their configuration
   automatically; administrators are able to get the data manually. News
   reader programs are able to get certain information from an NAS
   server, automatically or at a user's	discretion, to provide detailed
   information about groups and	hierarchies to the user.

   NAS is usable in coexistence	with the current, established process of
   control messages; an	unwanted interference is impossible.
   Furthermore,	NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure of
   Usenet in a hierarchical database. NAS can be used without
   modification	of existing news relay,	news server or news reader
   software, however, some tasks will be better	accomplished with NAS
   compliant software.

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The increasing number of newsgroups,	hierarchies and	articles has
   made	the administration of news servers a complex and time consuming
   task. The tools for the administration have remained	unchanged for
   ten years and are no	longer appropriate. Many hierarchies are
   inconsistent, many new newsgroups are not created or	only with a
   large delay,	removed	groups keep lurking in the configuration files
   for a long period of	time. There is no administration tool that
   utilizes the	power of the Internet, and it is not possible to check
   the consistency of the news server at a given point of time.

   Users find it difficult to get an overview of the newsgroups, the
   charter of a	particular one,	which language is preferred, or	whether
   a group is moderated	or not.	Renaming, the status change from
   moderated to	unmoderated or vice versa, and the splitting of	a group
   into	several	others are dynamic processes. These processes are in
   common use, but it takes a long time	until every news server	is aware
   of these changes.

   An increasing number	of faked control messages has appeared in the
   last	few years. Purposely or	accidentally control messages were sent
   to foreign news servers to create or	remove a certain group,	although
   this	was not	approved according to the rules	of the hierarchy in
   question. Due to this fact, automatic creation and removal is
   disabled on many news servers and several dead groups have not been
   deleted. It is very difficult for users to determine	the current
   status of a group, and in some cases	they simply cannot tell	that the
   group they are posting to is	in reality not an active but a dead or
   invalid group.

   It is the design goal of NAS	to provide an out-of-band system that
   helps to maintain, propagate, and deliver the required information.
   There will not be any interference with current protocols and
   standards. It is not	intended to make use of	control	messages or some
   special NNTP	commands. The advantage	of NAS is that it provides more
   information in a more structured format than	control	messages. Not
   only	news server administrators but also Usenet users can get more
   detailed information	about newsgroups and hierarchies.

   Due to the fact that	a client connects to a server and the server
   asks	for authentication, this is a more reasonable procedure	of
   transmitting	information than control messages. Furthermore,	it is
   possible to check for changes on a regular basis at customized
   intervals to	keep local data	up-to-date.

2.  Overview

   NAS is based	on a database which contains information about certain
   groups and hierarchies. This	database is structured in a hierarchical
   manner, distributed to various servers and is able to receive queries
   at any time.	The service is comparable to directory services	like
   DNS,	LDAP or	NIS. The NAS protocol is inspired by protocols like NNTP
   and SMTP. The port 991 is reserved for NAS and registered by	the
   Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) [IANA-PN].


   The organizational structure	of NAS is hierarchical,	that means a NAS
   root	server collects	data from the sub-servers that are authoritative
   for certain hierarchies. The	root server signs the data and
   distributes it authoritatively. Replication of database entries is
   possible. The hierarchical structure	can consist of multiple	levels.
   Usage of the	database is possible for news servers, news readers and
   special client programs. The	communication is based on TCP and UDP.

   Taking the real world into account, there might be some policy
   problems with a single root server. But it is possible to establish a
   structure like the current Usenet system, where some	hierarchies have
   a good administration with a	well-defined system of rules and some
   are not well	maintained. The	goal is	to get as much information as
   possible under one hat, but there can be no "official" force	to
   achieve this.

   During the startup phase it is quite	likely that there will be a root
   server, handling just hierarchies with strict rules and accepted
   authorities (like BIG8, de.*, us.*, bln.*, fr.*, it.*, etc.).

   However, it is also imaginable to have some NAS servers providing
   data	on - for example - alt.!binaries, some providing data on alt.*,
   and even some providing alt.*  following special policies or	sets of
   rules.

   An administrator using NAS will have	the choice to use just one root
   server (and all its data) and/or to use another NAS server for
   special hierarchies.

				 Figure	1


   NAS contains	information about newsgroups as	well as	complete
   hierarchies.	Furthermore, it	contains information about the
   hierarchies'	inheritable entries and	default	values for a single
   newsgroup.


3.  Protocol Level

   It is expected that the real	life use of NAS	will change the
   requirements	for the	Netnews	Administration System. On the one hand
   the protocol	has to be extensible and flexible in order to implement
   improvements, on the	other hand it must ensure compatibility	between
   different versions. A simultaneous migration	of all sites using NAS
   to a	new protocol version is	not likely to happen. To solve this
   problem, NAS	has a protocol level. This protocol level describes the
   current functionality. The protocol level, being a number between 1
   and 32767, is negotiated at connection setup. Enhancements and
   modifications must use a different protocol level than their
   predecessors. (Usually the protocol level is	incremented by 1 with
   every new version of	the protocol specification.) Every current or
   future implementation MUST be compatible with protocol level	1 in
   order to fall back to this level if communication on	a higher level
   fails.

   An implementation of	higher protocol	levels should be able to emulate



Grau, Heinau, Schlichting, Schuettler			        [Page 6]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   the behavior	of lower levels, even if this implies a	loss of
   features. The negotiation of	the protocol level between client and
   server is described in the specification of the command VERS. If
   there is no agreement on the	protocol level,	only commands of the
   protocol level 1 MUST be used. Documents enhancing or modifying the
   NAS standard	MUST specify on	which level these changes take place and
   how the behavior should be in other protocol	levels.

   This	document describes protocol level 1.


4.  Description	of Functions

   In order to use a NAS server, a connection must be opened by	the
   client. The NAS server can be located in the	same domain or somewhere
   else	on the Internet.

   The NAS system is hierarchical. The idea is to have an NAS root
   server like the DNS root servers. The root server distributes the
   data	collected from client NAS servers that are authoritative servers
   for their hierarchy.	The maintenance	of the authoritative data is
   possible on any system. The root server collects the	data and makes
   them	available to other servers, which can in turn distribute these
   data	to other servers. The administrator has	the opportunity	to make
   use of either all data or only parts	of the database. NAS servers can
   ask multiple	NAS servers for	data. An attached time stamp provides
   the possibility to distinguish between new and old data and to avoid
   loops in the	propagation.

   To describe the NAS in greater detail, it is	necessary to emphasize
   the hierarchical design of the NAS system. The following figure shows
   the propagation of data along the server hierarchy.

   Authoritative data for a newsgroup or a hierarchy are collected and
   written into	a database. These data are available through a local NAS
   server and are collected from this authoritative server by upstream
   NAS servers.

   There may also be NAS servers that are not authoritative servers;
   these servers merely	provide	the information	they collect from other
   NAS servers to clients such as news servers,	administration programs
   and news readers.

				 Figure	2

   Requests to an NAS server originating at a client as	well as	another
   server are accomplished in several steps, as	there are: Establishing
   a connection, authentication	(optional), negotiating	a protocol level
   (optional), queries on the database,	and termination.


5.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"	in this
   document are	to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

6.  Specification of the NAS Protocol (TCP)

6.1.  Responses

6.1.1.	Overview

   An answer starts with a response code (a three digit	number),
   optionally followed by white	space and a textual message. Then the
   actual text/data follows. Text is sent as a series of successive
   lines of textual matter, each terminated with CRLF. A single	line
   containing only a single period ('.') is sent to indicate the end of
   the text (i.e. the server will send a CRLF at the end of the	last
   line	of text, a period, and another CRLF).

   Answer = response-code [answertext] CRLF
	    text CRLF
	    "."	CRLF

   If the original text	contains a period as the first character of the
   text	line, that first period	is doubled. Therefore, the client must
   examine the first character of each line received, and for those
   beginning with a period, determine either that this is the end of the
   text	or whether to collapse the doubled period to a single one.

   Example:

   <-- INFO
   --> 101 Information follows
       Server: nas.example.org (192.0.2.100)
       Uptime: 2 weeks,	3 days,	5 hours, 9 minutes
       Software: NAS 1.0
       Client: client.example.org (192.0.2.123)
       Connection: 9 minutes
       Highest protocol	level supported: 1
       Requested protocol level: 1
       Protocol	level used: 1
       .


6.1.2.	Response Code Values, Structure	and Meaning

   The first digit of the response code	indicates the message type,
   i.e., information, success, warning,	error, or data:

   1xx Information
   2xx Request successful
   3xx Request successful, data	follow
   4xx Request accepted, but no	operation possible



Grau, Heinau, Schlichting, Schuettler			        [Page 9]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   5xx Request is wrong	(syntax	error),	not implemented, or leads to an
       internal	error
   6xx Request successful, data	follow until end mark

   The second digit specifies the message category:

   x0x connection related stuff
   x1x queries,	answers, or data
   x2x server-server communication
   x3x authentication, authorization
   x8x non-standard extensions
   x9x debugging output

   The actual response code for	a specific command is listed in	the
   description of the commands.	Answers	of the type 1xx, 2xx, 4xx, and
   5xx can have	a text after the numerical code. 3xx answers contain one
   or more parameters with data; the exact format is explained in the
   description of the commands.

   An answer to	an incorrect request may be longer than	one line.


6.2.  Connection Setup

   NAS typically uses port 991,	which is reserved by IANA [IANA-PN]. If
   a connection	is set up by the client, the server answers immediately
   (without a request) with the	greeting message, which	will start with
   code	200:

   --> 200 Welcome!
       nas.example.org ready
       .

   If a	connection is refused because the client has no	permission to
   access the server, the answer code is 434. That decision can	be made
   on connection startup based on the client's IP address. When	the
   server is currently out of service, the answer code is 404.

    Examples:

   --> 434 You have no permission to retrieve data. Good bye.
       .

   --> 404 Maintenance time
       .

   After sending a 404 or 434 message the connection will be closed.

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


6.3.  Commands

6.3.1.	Structure

   A command consists of a command word, sometimes followed by a
   parameter. Parameters are separated from the	command	word by	white
   space.

   Commands used in the	NAS protocol are not case sensitive. A command
   word	or parameter may be upper case,	lower case, or any mixture of
   upper and lower case.

   The length of a command line	is not limited.	If the need to limit the
   length of command lines in real life	implementations	arises,	answer
   code	513 (line too long) should be returned.

   The protocol	level described	in this	document uses command words with
   a length of exactly four characters each.

   In examples,	octets sent to the NAS server are preceded by "<-- " and
   those sent by the NAS server	by "-->	". The indicator is omitted if
   the direction of the	dialog does not	change.



6.3.2.	Overview

   The commands	described below	are defined using the Augmented	Backus-
   Naur	Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC2234]. The definitions for `ALPHA',
   `CRLF', `DIGIT', `WSP' and `VCHAR' are taken	from appendix A	of
   [RFC2234] and not repeated here.

   The following ABNF definitions comprise the set of NAS commands which
   can be sent from the	client to an NAS server.

6.3.3.	Detailed Description

   Some	overall	definitions:

   text		 = %d1-9 /	     ; all octets except
		   %d11-12 /	     ; US-ASCII	NUL, CR	and LF
		   %d14-255

   answertext	 = WSP *( ALPHA	/ DIGIT	/ "+" /	"-" / "/" / "_"	/
			      "." / ","	/ ":" /	"=" / "?" / "!"	/ SP )

   utc-time	 = 14DIGIT  ; the date and time	of the server in UTC
			    ; YYYYMMDDhhmmss



Grau, Heinau, Schlichting, Schuettler		               [Page 11]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   response-code = 3DIGIT   ; three digit number

   Newsgroup names and hierarchy names are defined according to	the
   following ABNF definitions. Since a hierarchy name can be the same as
   a newsgroup name (e.g., hierarchy bln.announce.fub.*	and newsgroup
   name	bln.announce.fub) there	is no difference between the two.

   name			 =  plain-component *("." component)
   component		 =  plain-component / encoded-word
   encoded-word		 =  1*(	lowercase / DIGIT /
				"+" / "-" / "/"	/ "_" /	"=" / "?" )
   plain-component	 =  component-start *component-rest
   component-start	 =  lowercase /	DIGIT
   lowercase		 =  %x61-7A ; letter a-z lowercase
   component-rest	 =  component-start / "+" / "-"	/ "_"

NOTE: This definition of newsgroup name	is in reference	to
son-of-1036-draft [SON1036]. When the current draft "News Article
Format"	[USEFOR] is established	as an RFC, its definitions should be
integrated into	a higher protocol level	of NAS.


6.3.3.1.  HELP

   Description

   This	command	prints a short help text on a given command. If	called
   without parameters, it will display a complete list of commands.

   help-cmd =  "HELP" [WSP commandname]	CRLF

   commandname =  "DATA" / "DATE" / "GETP" / "GETA" /
		  "HELP" / "HIER" / "INFO" / "LIST" /
		  "LSTR" / "QUIT" / "VERS"

   Possible answers

   100:	Command	overview, command description
   410:	Indicates that the server is not giving	any information


   help-answer =  "410"	[answertext] CRLF

   Description

   Prints the current time of the server in UTC	(Universal Coordinated
   Time) in the	format YYYYMMDDhhmmss, followed	by an optional comment.
   The DATE command is only for	informational use and to check the
   server time.	For regular transmission of time over the network, the
   Network Time	Protocol (NTP) [RFC1305] should	be used.

6.3.3.4.  VERS

   Description

   The VERS command is used to determine the protocol level to use
   between client and server. The parameter is a protocol level	that the
   client supports and wants to	use. The server	will respond with the
   highest level accepted. This	version	number MUST not	be higher than
   requested by	the client. Client and server MUST only	use commands
   from	the level that the server has confirmed. It is possible, but
   seldom necessary, to	change the protocol level during a session by
   client request (VERS	[protocol level]). When	no option is given, the
   current protocol level will be printed. When	no protocol level is
   negotiated, the protocol level 1 will be used. Commands of a	higher
   level are not allowed without successful negotiation. The protocol
   level can be	followed by an optional	comment.

   vers-cmd =  "VERS" [WSP level] CRLF

   level = 1*5DIGIT ; the valid	range is 1 - 32767

   Possible answers

   hierarchies the command LIST	is used. The status of the hierarchies
   is also given. The highest level consists of	all top-level
   hierarchies and is labeled "*". It can be obtained this way,	too.

   The data consist of a newsgroup- or hierarchy-name/status indicator
   pair	per line. Name and status indicator must be separated by at
   least one white space. The status indicator is a single word	(see
   section 6.4). The interpretation is not case	sensitive.

   level hierarchies and is labeled "*". It can	be obtained this way,
   too.

   The use of "*" as a wildcard	pattern	following the beginning	of a
   hierarchy name is also possible; so a "LSTR de.a*" would return a
   list	of all newsgroups and hierarchies starting with	"de.a".

6.3.3.8.  HIER

   Description

   The command HIER lists all information available about the hierarchy.
   With	data header "Name" a new data block for	each hierarchy is
   started.  The header	"Name" gives the name of the hierarchy.	The data
   headers are described in section 6.3.4. The default is to transmit
   all available information. It can be	limited	to a list of desired
   headers ("Name" and "Status"	are always given). A set of comma
   separated headers, as an option to the HIER command,	will return the
   requested header fields.

   hier-cmd  = "HIER" 1*(WSP name) [WSP	selection] CRLF

   selection = *( "," header )	      ;	Describes the data fields

6.3.3.10.  GETP

   Description

   GETP	is used	for server-server communication. It requests the data
   for the hierarchy specified by the parameter	"name".	The format of
   the data is the same	as for the commands "HIER" and "LIST". If "*" is
   given as hierarchy name, all	data the server	is offering will be
   transmitted.

   The "timestamp" attached to a package consists of the date and time
   that	the package was	created. The timestamp for a package is
   transmitted together	with the package data by the server and	marks a
   specific revision for the package data.




Grau, Heinau, Schlichting, Schuettler		               [Page 23]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   When	a client requests a package with GETP, it transmits the
   timestamp attached to the package in	its database so	that the server
   can check if	the data on the	client side is still valid or if it is
   too old. If the data	on the client side is still valid a 213	answer
   is sent, so the client knows	that its data is OK. If	the timestamp is
   "0",	the server is forced to	transmit the data. Timestamps set by the
   server must be increasing and may not be more that 12 hours in the
   future.

   The data for	a successful request are signed	and sent in ASCII armor
   according to	[RFC2440], so a	client has the possibility to check the
   signature or	to ignore it. The actual data will be surrounded by the
   armor start and end sections	according to section 6.2 of [RFC2440].

   getp-cmd =  "GETP" WSP username WSP password	WSP timestamp
	       WSP ( name / "*"	) CRLF

6.3.3.11.  GETA

   Description

   The GETA command is used for	server-server communication; it	is used
   to collect authoritative data and will request packages that	the
   server is authoritative for.	A package is the authoritative data
   either for a	newsgroup or a hierarchy. Each package has a "timestamp"
   attached to mark the	revision of the	package. This timestamp	is set
   by the server and  of the date of the last modification of the
   package data	in UTC format. A timestamp of "0" indicates that the
   package MUST	be retrieved. If the retrieving	client has a recent
   package (i.e. no modification on the	authoritative server), the
   server sends	only a 215 response. The format	of the data is the same
   as for the commands "HIER" and "LIST".

   geta-cmd =  "GETA" WSP username WSP password	WSP

6.3.3.12.  Unknown Commands and	Syntax Errors

   If a	command	is recognized as unknown, a 519	return code (unknown
   command) is given. If an error occurs after the command string (e.g.
   a missing parameter)	a 510 return code (Syntax error: Missing
   parameter) is given.



6.3.4.	Data Headers

   The following paragraphs describe keywords and key terms which
   support retrieval and storing of information. Every header has a
   unique English name.

   The content of a header is inheritable within a hierarchy, as long as

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   the header is marked	as inheritable.	The content is the default value
   for all downstream newsgroups and sub-hierarchies. For example in the
   hierarchy "de", the language	header has the value "DE" (German),
   therefore this value	is "DE"	for all	newsgroups in this hierarchy,
   except for those which explicitly define a language code of their
   own.

   Hierarchies and newsgroups must have	at least values	for the	headers
   "Name" and "Status".	Unknown	hierarchies or groups get the status
   "Unknown".

   The header used in the NAS protocol are not case sensitive. A header
   may be upper	case, lower case, or any mixture of upper and lower
   case. It is recommended that	the first letter of the	header and the
   first letter	after a	dash are uppercase while all other characters
   are lowercase.

6.6.  Hierarchy	Types

   To describe a hierarchy the following Hierarchy Types are used. These
   Types are used to mark some properties of a news hierarchy. They are
   case-insensitive.

   Type		    Meaning
   --------------   ---------------------------------------------------
   Global	    international, global hierarchy
		    (e.g., the hierarchies comp, de, rec)
   Regional	    regional hierarchy
		    (e.g., the hierarchies ba, bln, tor)
   Alt		    alternative	hierarchy, simpler rules for
		    creating a group, no formal	structure
		    (e.g., the hierarchy alt)
   Non-Commercial   only for personal use, commercial use is prohibited
		    (e.g., the hierarchy de)
   Commercial	    commercial use permitted (e.g., the	hierarchy biz)
   Organization	    hierarchy bound to an organization
		    (e.g., the hierarchy gnu)
   --------------   ---------------------------------------------------



6.7.  PGP Keys

   PGP keys for	Ctrl-PGP-Key and Mod-PGP-Key are transmitted in	the
   following structure:

   PGP-answer =	"V" SP Version CRLF
		"U" SP User-ID CRLF
		"B" SP Bits CRLF
		"I" SP Key-ID CRLF
		"F" SP Finger CRLF

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


		*("L" SP Location CRLF)
		*("K-" Keyblock	CRLF)
		"K" SP Keyblock	CRLF

   Version  = text
   User-ID  = text
   Bits	    = text
   Key-ID   = text
   Finger   = text
   Location = text
   Keyblock = text


   Key	 Name	     Mandatory	 Description
   ---	 ---------   ---------	 --------------------------------------
   K	 Keyblock    yes	 public	key block in ASCII armor format
				 [RFC2440]
   V	 Version     yes	 PGP-Version
   U	 User-ID     no		 key user id
   B	 Bits	     no		 number	of bits
   I	 Key-ID	     no		 key id, without leading "0x"
   F	 Finger	     no		 fingerprint
   L	 Location    no		 URL that points to the	public key
   ---	 ---------   ---------	 --------------------------------------


   A hyphen following the code indicates that the block	is continued on
   the next line. In the last message row, there MUST be white space
   after the code; this	is also	true for a single line code.

7.  Specification of the NAS Protocol (UDP)

   UDP is intended for reading programs	(news readers),	it is not in the
   scope of this document, and the use of UDP for NAS will be described
   in a	separate paper.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA	is asked to register the application/nasdata media type	as
   defined by the following information:

   Media type name:	application
   Media subtype name:	nasdata
   Required parameters:	none
   Optional parameters:	level

			The NAS	protocol level number for the enclosed NAS
			data package. If not present, the protocol level
			defaults to 1.

   Encoding scheme: NAS	data is	plain text; no special encodings are needed.

   Security considerations: see	below


9.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are only addressed in respect to server-server
   communication in this protocol level. Username and password
   combinations	in the GETA and	GETP commands can be used to make sure
   that	connections are	only accepted from authorized clients. PGP keys
   according to	[RFC2440] are used to sign NAS data in server-server
   communication in order to validate that data	is authentic and has not
   been	tampered with.



Grau, Heinau, Schlichting, Schuettler		               [Page 47]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	       July 2005


   Every server	does have the possibility (in both server-server and
   server-client communication)	to deny	some commands or the whole
   connection based on the client's IP number.

   No mechanisms are defined in	the current protocol level to allow a
   client to validate that it is talking to a legitimate server	and/or
   that	the data it receives is	authentic.

   A stronger authentication scheme will be provided in	a higher
   protocol level.



10.  Response Codes (Overview)

   Code	  Description
   ----	  --------------------------------------------------------------
   100	  Command overview, Information, command description (HELP)
   101	  Information about connection,	client and server (INFO)
   200	  Greeting message (Connection Setup)
   201	  Termination of the connection	(QUIT)
   202	  Returns current protocol level (VERS)
   213	  Valid	data at	the client side	(GETP)
