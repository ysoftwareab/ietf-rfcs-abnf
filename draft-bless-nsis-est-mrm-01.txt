Abstract

   The standard operation of the General Internet Signaling Transport
   (GIST) Protocol uses a path-coupled message routing method (PC-MRM)
   to find nodes interested in signaling message exchanges.  This
   specification proposes an Explicit Signaling Target Message Routing
   Method (EST-MRM) in order to allow sending of signaling messages to
   explicit targets.

1.  Introduction

   The standard operation of the General Internet Signaling Transport
   (GIST) Protocol [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] uses a path-coupled message
   routing method (PC-MRM) to find nodes interested in signaling message
   exchanges.  The assumption is that signaling involves the
   manipulation of state held in network elements along the flow's data
   path.  The path-coupled signaling paradigm tries to ensure the
   alignment of control functions to the actual data path.

   For mobility environments seamless handovers are a desirable
   objective.  If signaling takes place after a handover was performed,
   it will take some time until the state update has been completed.
   Thus, there exist proposals to start the signaling before the
   handover takes place and to use the current point of attachment for
   completion of the signaling process.  This "anticipated handover"
   enables a pre-reservation of resources in a quality-of-service
   context for instance, i.e., for QoS NSLP signaling applications
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].  Therefore, a resource reservation can be
   used immediately after the handover was performed.

   With the path-coupled MRM, however, such kind of optimization is
   impossible, since state should be established or manipulated along a
   data path that is not used yet, but probably will be in the future.
   Therefore, in order to support anticipated handovers a signaling
   message routing is required that is not strictly on path.

   In Figure 1 an example for an anticipated handover scenario is shown.
   If the mobile node (MN) is a data sender for flow f_o and has
   information that it may change its point of attachment from access A
   to access B, it starts signaling for resources along the new path
   that begins at B. First, the MN sends signaling messages to A and A
   will signal to B. B can then use path-coupled signaling in order to
   find the correct data path for the potential new flow f_n towards the
   CN.  Since signaling messages are sent to A, but concerning f_n, a
   PC-MRM cannot be used.  Similarly, the signaling between A and B is
   not path related and must be done explicitly.

   (b):  Access router A signals towards the candidate access router B

   It is out of scope of this specification how the addressing
   information about the future flow f_n is obtained by the MN or how A
   determines the address of the candidate router B that must be
   signaled next.  One possibility is to use the CARD protocol [RFC4066]
   or that some additional addressing information (such as MAC addresses
   of access points) is carried in the NSLP.  Thus, it is also allowed
   to let the source address of f_n being unspecified if the MN has no
   knowledge about its actual future address.  Since it can be assumed
   that B has enough information to determine the required address, it
   is then up to B to fill in the missing information for the flow

   The Hypath proposal [I-D.cordeiro-nsis-hypath] defines a similar MRM
   for QoS signaling between off-path resource control elements like
   bandwidth brokers.  It is for further study, how the EST-MRI can be
   unified with the Hypath proposal.


2.  Explicit Signaling Target MRM

   In order to support cases like the ones described in the
   introduction, this document proposes the specification of an Explicit
   Signaling Target MRM (EST-MRM).

Internet-Draft        Explicit Signaling Target MRM            July 2008


   The EST-MRM uses a normal encapsulation for Query messages, i.e., UDP
   encapsulation with the destination default port for GIST and the
   destination IP address set to the next signaling hop.  The source IP
   address SHOULD be set to the signaling source address of the node who
   is sending the message.  EST-MRM routed Query messages do not have to
   be intercepted but are explicitly routed to their next (or final)
   signaling destination.  In contrast to the EST-MRM, the path-coupled
   MRM requires Query messages to be sent with Q-mode encapsulation that
   is using a router alert option.  Furthermore, implementations must be
   aware, that Query messages may use with a different encapsulation
   method than Q-mode encapsulation, i.e., the check for wrong
   encapsulation MUST consider the particular MRM that is being used.

   The EST MRM defines an EST Message Routing Information (EST-MRI)
   object that contains information about the actual data flow that is
   being signaled as well as addressing information for the signaling
   message routing and transport itself.

   A node receiving a GIST message with an EST-MRI must check whether it
   has one local address that matches the destination signaling address.
   If it is not the case, it should forward the GIST message basically
   unchanged towards the signaling destination address, only with a
   decremented GIST Hop Count.  Thus, even if the message gets
   intercepted by accident, it will be forwarded to the final signaling
   destination.

   It is up to the signaling application's logic to determine the next
   signaling hop.  Usually, it will be related somehow to the given data
   flow, e.g., the signaling target will be along a flows data path.  In
   the particular example of the anticipated handover, signaling targets
   are the current access router as well as the candidate access router
   that is presumably the next ingress node for the data flow.

   When transmitting a signaling message with the EST-MRI, the outer IP
   destination address SHOULD be set to the destination signaling
   address of the EST-MRI.  In principle it is also possible to forward
   the signaling message to a node that is not the final destination
   signaling node.  In this case, the destination signaling address and
   the IP destination address are not the same.  This allows to let the
   signaling take multiple intermediate hops.  This mechanisms is,
   however, for further study and its use is currently not recommended.

2.1.  Explicit Signaling Target MRI

   The EST-MRI object (Figure 3) starts with the common MRI header (cf.
   section A.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp]) and carries a data flow
   address description that is identical to the one that is defined in
   the Path-coupled MRI (PC-MRI).  In addition to that it carries at

Internet-Draft        Explicit Signaling Target MRM            July 2008


   least information about the origin signaling address and the
   destination signaling address, which are usually identical to the IP
   source and IP destination address of the UDP encapsulated signaling
   message.  Furthermore, it may contain an additional IP address of a
   network node where the data flow, which is described by the PC-MRI,
   enters the network.  It is necessary to provide this information in
   some cases since the currently deployed routing protocols can only
   determine the next hop in direction towards the destination, but not
   backwards towards the source.  Thus, this information must be
   provided to the next hop in most cases.

   The EST-MRI object has the following layout:

   EST-MRI= MRI-header
            PC-MRI
            EST-Control
            Origin-Signaling-Address
            Destination-Signaling-Address
            [ Ingress-Node-Address ]

   Layout of the Explicit Signaling Target Message Routing Information

                                 Figure 3

   The binary representation is shown in Figure 4.  First, it contains
   the normal data flow address descriptor that is required for path-
   coupled signaling.  The latter is necessary so that an RMF can
   determine the path of the data flow that is being signaled for.  If
   the initiator cannot predict its future address, it is allowed to set
   the source IP address in the PC-MRI to unspecified (either 0.0.0.0 or
   ::).  After the PC-MRI, an EST-Control field is provided, that
   provides further information on the following fields or their
   interpretation respectively.  In addition to this description three
   IP addresses may be provided.  The Origin Signaling Address is the
   address of the node who initiated the signaling.  The Destination
   Signaling Address is the address of the signaling peer that should
   receive the signaling message.  Both Origin Signaling Address and
   Destination Signaling Address are mandatory to specify.  They may be
   both either IPv4 or IPv6.  The actual type is given by the version
   field (IPVerS) in the high order EST-Control word.  Providing the
   signaling addresses explicitly has several advantages: if the outer
   addresses are rewritten by a NAT or if the path-directed signaling is
   relayed via several hops before arriving at the final peer.

   The Ingress Node Address is optional to specify.  When not present,
   the version field (IPVerI) of the low order word in the EST-Control
   field must be set to 0.  Otherwise IPVerI will indicate the protocol
   version of the address.  It may have a different type than the Origin

   Signaling Address or the Destination Signaling Address, but must have
   the same type as the address pair in the PC-MRI flow address
   descriptor.  Mismatching versions must be rejected with an "MRI
   ValidationFailure" error message with subcode 1 ("IP Version
   Mismatch").  The Ingress Node Address is necessary to specify in some
   scenarios, because the RMF cannot determine a flow path in the
   reverse direction, except for very simple topologies.

                                 Figure 4

   The MRI common header carries the N-flag and SHOULD be 0 for this
   MRM.  A NAT may have to translate at least one of the Origin
   Signaling Address, the Destination Signaling Address, or the Ingress
   Node Address.  Depending on the signaling scenario it may also have
   to translate the contained PC-MRI information (for signaling messages
   along (a) and (b) in Figure 2 this is usually not required).

2.2.  Implementation

   The EST-MRI was implemented and tested successfully in the GIST-ka
   implementation [gistka].  Thanks to the object oriented design of the
   protocol itself and also the implementation, the implementation

   effort was quite low.  It was shown that even MA re-use works across
   PC-MRM and EST-MRM flows, i.e., if some flows are signaled path-
   coupled and some are signaled explicitly, further signaling for both
   types can re-use existing messaging associations.

2.3.  MRM Requirements

   Section 3.3. of [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] mentions requirements on the
   content of an MRM definition, that are discussed in this section.

   "The format of the information that describes the path that the
   signalling should take, the Message Routing Information (MRI).": This
   specification describes the MRI format in Section 2.1.  Since this
   signaling message routing method is using an explicit target address
   for the signaling destination (the Destination Signaling Address), as
   well as the Flow Identifier of the data flow, it contains sufficient
   information to determine the signaling path.  The adjacent peer may
   use the Flow Identifier information to determine the next explicit
   signaling hop.

   "A specification of the IP-level encapsulation of the messages which
   probe the network to discover the adjacent peers.  A downstream
   encapsulation must be defined; an upstream encapsulation is
   optional": This MRM is using an explicit target address for the
   signaling destination, i.e., the adjacent peer.  The IP-level
   encapsulation is based on UDP normal encapsulation, i.e., the address
   of the adjacent peer is explicitly written in the outer IP header.
   There is no such thing as a downstream encapsulation since the EST
   MRM may be used to route the signaling data sideways if compared to
   the direction of the data flow (cf. forwarding of signaling messages
   along (b) in Figure 2).

   "A specification of what validation checks GIST should apply to the
   probe messages, for example to protect against IP address spoofing
   attacks.  The checks may be dependent on the direction (upstream or
   downstream) of the message.": This specification requires that a node
   receiving a GIST message with an EST-MRI must check whether it has
   one local address that matches the destination signaling address.
   Other specific validation checks cannot be provided within this
   specification as they depend on the determination algorithm of the
   next signaling hop.  Validation checks should be applied if possible,
   but they are probably only possible within the NSLP.

   "The mechanism(s) available for route change detection, i.e. any
   change in the neighbour relationships that the MRM discovers.  The
   default case for any MRM is soft-state refresh, but additional
   supporting techniques may be possible;" Basically, this MRM also uses
   soft-state refresh and the NLI as indicator whether the adjacent peer



Bless                    Expires January 8, 2009                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Explicit Signaling Target MRM            July 2008


   has changed.  However, since signaling messages routed with the EST
   MRM are explicitly addressed to nodes and not intercepted there
   should be no re-routing events as GIST level.  Re-routing events at
   IP-level will be transparent unless they lead to disconnection of the
   signaling target.


3.  Security Considerations

   Basically, the security considerations of GIST apply.  The main
   change is that Query messages are not sent using Q-mode encapsulation
   and that they contain a different MRI object.  Since normal
   encapsulation is already considered by GIST, no new security
   considerations are necessary.  Even for initial Query messages with
   an EST-MRI, the usual mechanisms like authorized peer database
   checking and late state installation mechanisms apply.


4.  IANA Considerations

   According to section 9 of [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] this specification
   requires assignment of a new MRI-ID.  Until an assignment happens by
   IANA, it is suggested to use MRI-ID 125 for the EST-MRM.
