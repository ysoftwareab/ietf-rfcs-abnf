1.  Introduction

   In order to improve the handover between heterogeneous access
   networks, the IEEE 802.21 standard is being defined to provide Media
   Independent Handover services (MIH).  IEEE 802.21/MIH makes available
   link layer information to the upper network layers, both locally and
   remotely.  Although the standard defines the guidelines to transport
   the MIH protocol messages to remote entities, namely the need to be
   reliable and to guarantee security of the messages exchanged, it does
   not specify a transport mechanism. [1] describes a possible design
   for the MIH transport mechanism; however it requires a multitude of
   new protocol elements and is also limited in several technical
   constraints such as message size and protocol discovery.

   The IETF NSIS WG is finalizing the base protocols to offer flexible
   and extensible signalling services for a variety of application,
   including the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) for support
   secure, reliable, congestion-controlled data transport, as well as
   other features desired for signalling.  Given the potential of NSIS
   to perform Quality of Service (QoS) signalling for real-time
   applications in wired and wireless scenarios, which is also often
   desired by the applications using MIH, we propose to use GIST to
   transport MIH messages.  Therefore, this document defines a Media
   Independent Handover NSIS Signalling Layer Protocol (MIH NSLP) to
   support seamless mobility in heterogeneous network environments
   through the integration of MIH and NSIS.

   This document is structured as follows.  Section 3 presents the
   motivation for the development of a MIH NSLP.  Section 4 details the
   MIH NSLP and Section 5 shows an example of the use of the MIH NSLP in
   a mobility scenario.

3.  Problem Statement

   With the current evolution of network technologies we envision that,
   in a near future, there will be a heterogeneous landscape of
   different technologies such as WLAN, WiMAX, UMTS/MBMS and DVB,
   providing ubiquitous network access to users.  The wide availability
   of co-located technologies and the growing trend of users' mobility,
   require the seamless support of mobility and service continuity.
   Nevertheless, due to the large number of new access technologies, it
   is very difficult to provide seamless mobility across these
   technologies.

   In order to optimize the handover process, the IEEE is currently
   defining the 802.21 standard, focused on Media Independent Handover
   services (MIH).  The main goal of the IEEE 802.21 standard is to
   provide link layer information to the upper layers, optimizing the
   handover process between heterogeneous access networks.  The Media
   Independent Handover Function (MIHF) is the core component of the
   802.21 standard.  It provides a set of well defined and standardized
   Service Access Points (SAP) with both the link layer (MIH_LINK_SAP)
   and the upper layers (MIH_SAP) that will use this information (MIH
   users).  A set of services is provided through these interfaces in
   order to facilitate the communication process:

   o  Media Independent Command Service (MICS): allows higher layers to
      configure, control and get information from the lower layer.

   o  Media Independent Event Service (MIES): allows higher layers to
      receive indications from link layers.

   o  Media Independent Information Service (MIIS): provides a framework
      and corresponding mechanisms by which a MIHF entity obtains static

      network information.

   Events and commands can be local and/or remote.  Local events are
   generated from the link layer and propagated towards the MIH users
   within the local device.  Remote events are propagated towards a MIH
   user connected to a peer MIHF.

   Several network elements might be interested to receive notifications
   from the lower layers, and therefore the MIH protocol has been
   defined to propagate the MIH services towards the peer MIHFs.

   Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the MIHF entities across the
   network components.

   +------+    +------+                        +------+    +------+


                    Figure 1: MIHF Communication Model

   The MIHFs might be spread in several network elements inside the same
   domain, or even across different domains.  In Figure 1 we illustrate
   two different domains (domain X and domain Y).  Each domain is
   composed by the Core Network (CN), responsible for the overall
   management and control of the network, connected to several Access
   Networks (AN).  Each AN provides connectivity to the Mobile Stations
   (MS), using wired/wireless access technologies (e.g.  WiMAX, DVB,
   WiFi, UMTS).  As depicted in Figure 1, each one of these entities -
   CN, AN and MS - is a potential candidate to host the MIHF entity.
   Therefore, MIH messages SHALL be able to reach all the MIHFs in the
   network, independently of their location.

   However, no specific transport mechanism is defined to carry the MIH
   protocol messages between remote MIHFs.  Only the guidelines to
   transmit the MIH messages across the network are defined in the MIH
   standard.  The transport protocol used MUST be reliable, guaranteeing

   the correct delivery of the messages to the peer MIHF, and provide
   security over the exchanged messages.

   The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is able to satisfy the
   reliability requirement posed by the MIH protocol.  It provides error
   control and flow control, guaranteeing the in-order delivery of the
   packets.  However, although TCP offers reliability, it does not
   guarantee fast-packet delivery due to its retransmission mechanism.
   In what concerns the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), it assures fast-
   packet delivery, but it does not guarantee the correct packet
   delivery, and therefore is unreliable.

   As a result, a reliable, secure and fast-delivery solution to
   transport MIH protocol messages between peer MIHFs is required.
   Although a new fast-delivery solution can be designed, other existent
   solutions can be envisioned.

   To address seamless mobility support, media independent handovers
   together with fast/local mobility approaches are not sufficient.
   When users move while accessing real-time services, resources need to
   be reserved in advance in the new network to guarantee that the
   services maintain their quality.  Next Steps in Signalling (NSIS) [3]
   QoS signalling protocol is an emergent QoS signalling and reservation
   protocol with capabilities to be used in mobile environments.  NSIS
   decomposes the overall signalling protocol suite into a generic
   (lower) layer and specific upper layers for each specific signalling
   application.  In the lower layer, General Internet Signalling
   Transport (GIST) [4] offers transport services to higher layer
   signalling applications for two purposes: sending and receiving
   signalling messages between neighbour hops (NSIS entities), and
   exchanging control and feedback information.  Above this layer, there
   is the NSIS Signalling Layer Protocol (NSLP) layer [5], which
   generically stands for any protocol within the signalling application
   layer.

   NSIS is very well suited for heterogeneous wired and wireless
   networks and is able to interact with mobility protocols for seamless
   handovers.  Therefore, to enable the support of seamless mobility,
   MIH can be integrated with NSIS and cooperate in the handover
   process.  To provide a clean cooperation with low overhead (both in
   messages exchanged and time), and since MIH protocol messages require
   a transport protocol, we propose and define a MIH NSLP to use NSIS as
   a transport protocol for MIH messages.

   In order to use the NSIS framework to transport MIH messages, a

   specific NSLP, the Media Independent Handover NSLP, is developed in
   this document.  The MIH NSLP allows the distribution of MIH messages
   across different networks.  The following describes the procedure to
   transport MIH messages within the MIH NSLP, followed by the
   specification of the MIH NSLP architecture.

4.1.  MIH NSLP Architecture

   The MIH NSLP is responsible for the transport of MIH Messages using
   the GIST protocol.  Figure 2 details the architecture of NSIS usage
   as the MIHF transport protocol.

                      Figure 2: MIH NSLP architecture

   This figure shows the interaction between the MIH NSLP, the MIHF and
   the GIST protocol.

   The MIH NSLP interface with MIHF handles the MIHF MIH Message
   exchange.  This interface is compliant with the MIH_NET_SAP defined
   in [6].

   The MIH NSLP interface with GIST handles message transport.  This
   interface is specified in [4].

   The MIH NSLP is split in six different functionalities as follows:

   o  Interface with MIHF

Internet-Draft                  MIH NSLP                   February 2008


   o  Interface with GIST

   o  Message transport (and retransmission if acknowledge is required)

   o  Message reception

   o  Message interception

   o  MIH Registration Server (only active through an election process -
      out of scope)

      *  Registration

      *  DeRegistration

      *  Request

      *  Messages retransmission

   These functionalities are described in the next sections.

4.2.  MIH Message Transport

   As specified in [6], MIHF entities need to propagate MIH messages
   towards peer MIHF entities.  The MIH standard does not include the
   specification of a transport protocol, at layer 3, and only the
   requirements for this protocol are defined.  These requirements can
   be summed up to reliability and security over the MIH exchanged
   messages, requirements that are met by the GIST protocol.

   Figure 3 shows an example of the NSIS usage to transport MIH
   Messages.

              Figure 3: NSIS usage to transport MIH Messages

   This figure presents the interaction between the MIHF and the NSIS
   framework and the transport of MIH Messages between a Source and a
   Destination MIHF.  In this scenario, the Middle MIHF also intervenes
   by receiving the message exchanged due to the intercept NSIS feature.
   The processing of these intercepted messages is out of the scope of
   this document.

   To be able to transport the MIH Messages, NSIS requires the
   destination network address of the MIHF Destination.  However, MIH
   entities only handle MIHF Identifiers (ID) to identify the remote
   MIHF.  Therefore, there is the need to perform the mapping between
   the MIHF ID and the correspondent network addresses, which is under
   NSIS responsibility.

   The main functionality of the MIH NSLP is to handle the mapping
   between MIHF ID and network addresses, since GIST is able to provide
   all the required functionalities required by the MIH specification
   for MIH Message transport.  The mapping procedure is described in the
   next sub-section.

   Figure 4 shows the procedure to send MIH Messages to the remote MIHF
   when the remote MIHF IP Address is available, either through the
   cache mechanisms or resorting to the mapping procedure.

             Figure 4: Message transport between two MIH NSLP

   In this figure the MIHF Message needs to be sent from the Source MIH
   NSLP to the Destination MIH NSLP.  To send the MIHF Message, the MIH
   NSLP creates a MIH NSLP DATA message with the MIHF Message as one of
   its components.

   During the message exchange, the DATA message is intercepted in the

   Middle MIHF.  According to the MIH NSLP architecture, this feature
   could be useful for several scenarios.  However, this feature is out
   of scope of this document.  If no specific action is defined in the
   Middle MIHF entity, the MIH NSLP MUST forward the DATA message to the
   Destination MIH NSLP.

   When a DATA message reaches the destination, the MIHF Message is
   forwarded to the local MIHF for processing.  The MIH Message
   information is transparent to the MIH NSLP.  The MIHF processing is
   defined in [6].

   Optionally, a DATA ACK message can be sent to the Source MIH NSLP
   when the DATA message arrives to the Destination MIH NSLP.  This
   feature can be requested by the Source MIH NSLP and SHOULD depend on
   the transfer attributes requested to GIST (reliable and/or secure).

   A MIHF response to the received MIH Message is treated as a new
   request by the MIH NSLP.  The MIH NSLP does not handle states for the
   MIH Messages.

4.3.  Mapping between MIHF ID and Network Addresses

   In order to map all MIHF ID into network addresses a MIH Registration
   Server is required.  This MIH Registration Server is responsible for
   handling the mapping between MIHF ID and network addresses of MIHF
   entities.  For this purpose one entity MUST be elected as a MIH
   Registration Server.  The election of this entity is out of scope of
   this document because it depends on specific deployment scenarios
   characteristics.  In the example described in Section 5 an
   appropriate choice would be the CN entity.  The knowledge of the MIH
   Registration Server MUST be known to all MIHF entities involved.

   With the usage of the MIH Registration Server, when a MIH NSLP needs
   to send a MIH Message to a remote MIHF, it queries the MIH
   Registration Server in order to receive the appropriate network
   address.  Figure 5 and Figure 6 highlight the MIH NSLP message
   exchange to perform a MIHF ID mapping to a network address.

   Figure 5 describes the procedure that a MIH NSLP performs when it is
   ready to transport MIH Messages.

   Figure 5: MIH NSLP registration/deregistration in a MIH Registration
                                  Server

   This registration procedure is composed by four MIH NSLP messages,
   the IP REGISTER, the IP REGISTER ACK, IP DEREGISTER and the IP
   DEREGISTER ACK.  The IP REGISTER message is sent by the MIH NSLP to
   the MIH Registration Server to register its MIHF ID and IP Address in
   the MIH Registration Server.  To confirm the registration of the MIH
   NSLP, the MIH Registration Server sends an IP REGISTER ACK to the MIH
   NSLP with the result of the registration.  The registration result
   can be:

   o  Successful: the registration process was successful;

   o  Warning due to duplicate MIHF ID: the received MIHF ID already
      exists with a different IP Address;

   o  Warning due to duplicate IP Address: the received IP Address
      already exist with a different MIHF ID;

   o  Internal failure: an error occurred not related to the request
      received.

   After a successful/warning registration procedure the MIH
   Registration Server is able to map this MIHF ID to the appropriate IP

   Address and the MIH NSLP is ready to transport MIH Messages.  The MIH
   NSLP actions to a warning and failure registration are implementation
   dependent.

   The IP DEREGISTER message is sent to the MIH Registration Server when
   the MIH NSLP intends to stop functions.  This message includes the
   MIHF ID that is to be removed from the registry.  After the registry
   deregistration the MIH Registration Server send an IP DEREGISTRATION
   ACK to the MIH NSLP notifying it of the registration result.  The
   deregistration result can be:

   o  Successful: the deregistration process was successful;

   o  Warning due to unknown MIHF ID: the received MIHF ID does not
      exists;

   o  Internal failure: an error occurred not related to the request
      received.

   MIHF ID to an IP Address.

                   Figure 6: MIH NSLP mapping procedure

   In this figure there are two MIH NSLP messages, the IP REQUEST and
   the IP RESPONSE.  The IP REQUEST message is sent from the MIH NSLP
   that requires the mapping to the MIH Registration Server with the
   MIHF ID that needs to be mapped to an IP address.  After the MIH
   Registration Server mapping, an IP RESPONSE message is sent from the
   MIH Registration Server to the requesting MIH NSLP.  This message
   includes the IP address that resulted from the mapping of the request

   MIHF ID.

   In the MIHF ID mapping process some errors MAY occur.  When an error
   happens the MIH Registration Server entity MUST send an IP ERROR
   message to the requesting MIH NSLP stating the error.  The possible
   errors are:

   o  Unknown MIHF ID: there is no reference to the requested MIHF ID;

   o  Unknown IP Address: there is no IP Address associated to the
      requested MIHF ID;

   o  Internal Error: an error occurred not related to the MIHF ID or
      the IP Address.

   When IP REGISTER, IP DEREGISTER and IP REQUEST messages are sent, a
   timer MUST be set to prevent the case of starvation due to a failure
   in receiving the respective responses.  These cases can occur when:

   o  The MIH Registration Server cannot be reached;

   o  The MIH Registration Server fails to respond.

   If a timer expires, the IP REGISTER, IP DEREGISTER or IP REQUEST
   message MUST be retransmitted until a maximum of three times.  Each
   time the timer expires the timer period SHOULD be doubled.

   For the IP REGISTER ACK, IP DEREGISTER ACK, IP RESPONSE and IP ERROR
   messages there is no need for timers.  In the case these messages
   fail to arrive to the MIH NSLP, the retransmission procedure will
   force the resend of the appropriate response message.


5.  Mobility Scenario Example

   This section will present an example (including a picture) of the use
   the Mobility NSLP to transport MIH messages in the mobility context -
   controlled by the CSN.

   This section presents a sample mobility scenario, where the exchange
   of MIHF messages among different network nodes allows the efficient
   management of control plane functionalities, such as data plane
   configuration and resource reservation for the traffic flows involved
   in the handover.

   The example scenario is shown in Figure 7.  It consists of a Mobile
   Node (MN) with two network interfaces (ETH and WiFi) which is
   connected to a Wi-Fi Access-Point attached to a WiMAX fixed

   Subscriber Station (serving SS).  The MN moves and, since the radio
   signal becomes lower, the user decides for the ETH connection and
   plugs in the cable.  The ETH network is connected to another WiMAX
   fixed Subscriber Station (target SS), located in the same Access
   Service Network of the serving SS.  Both the stations are connected
   to Base Stations (BS) controlled by the same ASN gateway (ASN-GW).

    Figure 7: Example of Mobility Scenario with heterogeneous networks

   This type of scenario includes a double mobility.  The host is
   initially connected via Wi-Fi and afterwards uses the wired ETH
   connection (mobility between heterogeneous networks).  At the same
   time the handovers involves two Subscriber Stations of the same WiMAX
   technology (IEEE 802.16d), following the intra-ASN WiMAX mobility
   model.

   The considered MN hosts some active applications that require
   specific levels of guaranteed QoS.  Therefore the related sessions
   are initially associated to a particular set of Service Flows (SFs)
   allocated on the WiMAX channel between the serving SS and its BS.
   Each SF is characterized by a specific scheduling class and some
   parameters, like bandwidth and jitter that specify the QoS level for
   the data traffic.

   Following a network-initiated approach, the SF configuration and
   activation is handled at the ASN-GW level by specific procedures that



Cordeiro, et al.         Expires August 21, 2008               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                  MIH NSLP                   February 2008


   intercept different kinds of high level signalling (i.e.  QoS NSLP,
   SIP) in order to extract the QoS parameters required by the
   application, map them in a set of SFs and finally configure the BSs
   to allocate the resources on the wireless link.

   The MN handover requires the WiMAX channel re-configuration, with the
   creation and the activation of suitable SFs between the target SS and
   the related BS.  On the other hand, the existing SFs between the
   serving SS and the related BS MUST be removed.  This procedure SHOULD
   be transparent to the high level signalling and, at the same time,
   requires the direct action of the ASN-GW for the session management
   and the explicit resource allocation in the WiMAX link.

   This objective can be easily reached with the exchange of MIH
   messages between the MN and the ASN-GW using the MIH NSLP.  When
   specific MIH Events are received by the gateway, the ASN-GW module
   that handles the sessions and the WiMAX resource allocation (i.e. the
   MIH User - MIHU) is informed of probable imminent handovers,
   configures the resources on the new path and updates its internal
   status with the up-to-date information about the involved sessions.

   Similarly, if the mobility management system is based on a
   centralized approach where handovers are controlled entirely at the
   ASN-GW level, this MIHU can be able to send specific MIH Commands in
   order to coordinate all the procedures at the lower layers.  In such
   situation, the handover management and the related decisions can be
   more efficient if the ASN-GW is able to receive and process the
   information provided by the Media Independent Information Service.
   In this case the exchange of MIHF messages with other network
   entities allows the MIHU to receive both lower layers and upper
   layers information that can have an impact on the selection of the
   target network during the handovers.

   In the considered scenario, the MIH NSLP message exchange can be used
   in order to achieve handovers based on the Make Before Break model
   where the needed resources are configured before the actual
   disconnection from the serving Point of Attachment (PoA) and
   afterwards the resources on the old link are released.  This approach
   allows the applications to receive coherent QoS guarantees in case of
   handovers between different networks.

   As shown in Figure 8, the imminent disconnection of the MN from the
   current Wi-Fi Access Point is notified to the ASN-GW through a Remote
   MIH Link Going Down message, leading to the automatic resource re-
   configuration on the WiMAX link.  The deletion of the existing SFs
   between the serving SS and BS is triggered by the following Remote
   MIH Link Down message that signals the occurred disconnection from
   the Wi-Fi network.

              Figure 8: MIHF Signalling and resource control

   As a further example (Figure 9), we can consider a mobility scenario
   in a single WiMAX network, where a Mobile Station IEEE 802.16e (MS)
   moves from the serving BS to the target BS.  Following the intra-ASN
   scenario, both the BSs are located in the same access service network
   and are controlled by the same ASN-GW.  We can assume that the
   management of the high level sessions and the associated QoS is
   handled at the ASN-GW level, as in the previous scenario.

   In this case, the handover management can be coordinated directly
   among the MS and the involved BSs, through the creation and the
   activation of suitable SFs on the target path and the deletion of the
   previous ones.  Nevertheless the ASN-GW can obtain some notifications
   about the handovers and the occurred changes in lower layers through
   the MIH Event Service messages received through the MIH NSLP.  These
   notifications allow the ASN-GW to correctly update the mobility
   "context" (SS and BS MAC address, SFs and classifiers, WiMAX security
   information, HA IP address, CoA, DHCP server, AAA server) for each
   existing session, so that it is able to manage possible resource re-
   configuration if required by the associated high level signalling.

   In IEEE 802.16e networks, the MS can move between BSs under control
   of different ASNs and managed by different ASN-GWs (CSN-anchored
   mobility).  In this case, the functionalities for the handover
   management SHOULD be split among different entities located not only
   in the ASN but also in the Connectivity Service Network and in the
   core network.  The MIH NSLP protocol can be used in order to
   propagate the MIH Event and Command messages along the full path
   between the serving and the target BS, towards all the MIH peers
   located in ASNs and CSNs of different domains (Figure 10).

6.  Security Considerations

   The exchange of MIH NSLP messages MUST be secured against security
   threats, which have been identified in [7].  GIST is responsible for
   some of the security aspects of signalling [3].  Additionally, NSLPs
   MUST be in charge of threats concerning authorization, message
   protection, rate limitation, and prevention of denial of service
   attacks, as described in [4].  The use of these mechanisms in MIH
   NSLP is under study.


7.  Open issues

   This document specifies the MIH NSLP protocol, but leaves some issues
   unaddressed:

   o  The usage of MIH NSLP and GIST as the MIHF transport protocol adds
      additional security threats that are not addressed in the GIST and
      MIHF specifications.  Some of these security issues are:

      *  The interception of MIH Messages by middle MIHF entities;

      *  The registration and deregistration process;

      *  Unauthorized requests or unauthorized MIH Messages.

   o  The MIH NSLP registration procedure needs to include a refresh
      feature to maintain the MIH Registry Server updated.  The MIH
      Registry Server should use soft states to store the mapping
      information;

   o  A default timer value SHOULD be proposed for the MIH NSLP message
      retransmit timer.

   o  The MIH NSLP messages MUST be specified.  A MIH NSLP Message
      SHOULD consist of:

      *  A common message header;

      *  A group of type-length-value (TLV) objects.

   o  Several optimizations SHOULD be done to the MIH NSLP protocol.
      These optimizations SHOULD minimize the number of signalling
      messages and improve the MIH NSLP performance.  An example of an
      optimization is the usage of a cache feature for the MIHF ID and
      IP Address mapping in the source and middle MIH NSLP.

   These open issues will be addressed in future versions of this
   document.
