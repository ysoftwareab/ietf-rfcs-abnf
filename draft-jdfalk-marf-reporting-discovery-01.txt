Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery                May 2010


1.  Introduction

   As the spam problem continues to expand and potential solutions
   evolve, network operators are increasingly exchanging abuse reports
   among themselves and other parties.  While [MARF-BASE] defines the
   Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) for these reports, it assumes that the
   operators will use some undefined method to discover each other and
   enter into any necessary agreements.

   The advertisement method defined in this memo is intended to ease the
   process for potential ARF recipients to discover whether a particular
   Administrative Domain (ADMD) has the facility and willingness to
   generate ARF reports, and for ARF generators to discover whether a
   particular ADMD is able and willing to receive ARF reports.  Also
   included is a facility for end-user MUAs to discover whether there is
   an abuse reporting address within their own ADMD.

   This document only defines the process for advertisement and
   discovery of feedback recipients.  Determination of when it is
   appropriate to send feedback or how trust may be established between
   report generators and report recipients is outside the scope of this
   document.  It is assumed that best practices will evolve over time,
   and will be codified in future documents.


2.  Purpose

   The reports defined in [MARF-BASE] are intended to inform mail
   operators about:
   o  email abuse originating from their networks;
   o  potential issues with the perceived quality of outbound mail, such
      as email service providers sending mail that attracts the
      attention of automated abuse detection systems.
   To support these purposes, this document addresses three primary use
   cases:
   o  Any ADMD may advertise its willingness to receive reports from the
      internet at large, given particular criteria included in or
      referenced by the advertisement;
   o  Any ADMD may advertise their willingness to provide reports to the
      Internet at large, given particular criteria included in or
      referenced by the advertisement;
   o  Any ADMD may advertise the method for their own end users to
      report issues directly (likely through their MUA), so that these
      reports may be handled through that ADMD's own policies -- which
      may include distribution to another ADMD in the form of an ARF
      message.
   This specification also inherits from [MARF-BASE] that it is intended
   specifically for communications among providers regarding email abuse

   and related issues, and SHOULD NOT be used for other reports.  For
   example, the [DKIM-REPORTING] extension includes its own ARF
   recipient discovery method which should not be confused with the
   method defined in this memo.


3.  Requirements

   The advertisement and discovery process must be easily accessible to
   the software involved in providing email service, preferably using
   concepts and technologies an email operator can be assumed to be
   familiar with.  Thus, following the examples of [DKIM] and
   [DKIM-REPORTING], the advertisement is in the form of a [DNS] TXT
   record.  While this may provide challenges for offline processing,
   this is outweighed by the advantages of security and maintainability.

   In order to reflect current usage, advertisements must also provide
   the ability to reference complex "terms of service" or other
   documents outside of the scope of a simple discovery method.  This is
   accomplished through the inclusion of a URI.

   And finally, the advertisement must be readable by humans (assuming
   they have access to this memo) as well as software specifically
   written for the purpose.


4.  Language

   This section defines various terms used throughout this document.

4.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

4.2.  Email Specific

   [EMAIL-ARCH] introduces several terms and concepts that are used in
   this memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar with it as
   well.

4.3.  ARF Specific

   [MARF-BASE] introduces terms and concepts that are necessary for a
   full understanding of this memo, and thus readers are advised to read
   it before continuing.

5.  Characteristics of a Feedback Reporting Advertisement

   An advertisement of willingness to generate or receive feedback is
   accomplished by publishing a TXT record in the [DNS] using the name
   '_report' within the given DNS domain.

   In the case of a feedback consumer, the advertisement should be
   published in the DNS domain matching the [DKIM] 'd=' value used on
   outgoing signatures, and/or in the DNS domain matching the one
   present in the [SMTP] MAIL commands it issues when sending mail,
   and/or in the DNS domain referenced by the DNS PTR record of the IP
   address of the border MTA used to transfer the message outside of its
   ADMD.

   In the case of a feedback generator, to inquire whether or not an
   ADMD wishes to receive feedback reports, the DNS domain to which the
   report should be sent is determined (using a mechanism at the
   discretion of the generator) and then a TXT record query to the above
   name is issued.  For example, if a report generator wishes to
   generate a report about a message bearing DNS domain 'example.com',
   the generator would issue a TXT record query for
   `_report.example.com'.

   In the case of a feedback generator soliciting reports from its own
   end users, the advertisement will be associated with the host that
   provides [IMAP] or [POP] service to that user.  For example, when the
   user's IMAP server is imap.example.net, the applicable advertisement
   will be found at _report.imap.example.net.

5.1.  Feedback Consumers

      "r".  Otherwise, the field is optional; there is no default.

5.2.1.  Feedback Generator Policies

   Policies are listed in the "gp" tag, described above.

   o  open to providing reports to any consumer.  This option is the
      default policy.
   r  open to providing reports only after the prospective consumer has
      completed an application process, which may be found at the URI
      defined by the "gu" tag above.

   HTTP  a message/rfc822 [MIME] document may be transmitted via [HTTP]
      POST to the URI defined in "uu" below.

5.4.  Note about URIs

   While this memo assumes that advertisements will contain http:// or
   similar URIs, implementors should be aware that the URI-related
   fields can carry many different types of data depending on the URI
   scheme used.  For more information, please consult the URI Schemes
   registry maintained by IANA.

Appendix A.  Sample Advertisements

   TBD


Appendix B.  Public Discussion, History and Support

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION]

   Public discussion of this proposed specification is handled via the
   marf@ietf.org mailing list.  The list is open.  Access to
   subscription forms and to list archives can be found at
   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/marf/current/maillist.html


Appendix C.  Document History & Open Issues

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION]

C.1.  draft-jdfalk-marf-reporting-discovery-00

   o  NEEDED: WG input, references cleanup, ABNF and other formal
      definitions, and probably lots of other stuff.
   o  QUESTION: do there need to be IANA considerations for
      extensibility?
   o  QUESTION: should this include IODEF as a format?

C.2.  draft-jdfalk-marf-reporting-discovery-01

   o  Removed "MARF Working Group" until the MARF WG takes up the
      document.
   o  Changed from "Experimental" to "Standards Track".
   o  Various non-normative textual & formatting improvements, most
      importantly changing "hangtext" to "hangText" because xml2rfc is
      (surprisingly) case-sensitive.
   o  Added the PTR record as another place to look for advertisements
      published by ARF consumers.  (This may require additional
      clarifications later in the text.)
   o  Moved a few references from normative to informative.
   o  NEEDED: sections describing the entire process, from advertisement
      to message transfer to discovery to reporting.
   o  QUESTION: should the advertisement for MUAs be moved to a separate
      draft?
   o  Questions & needs listed for version 00 remain valid.
