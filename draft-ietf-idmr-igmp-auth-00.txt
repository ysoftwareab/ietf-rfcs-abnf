Abstract


      The security enhancement is one of the most important enhancements
      to IP multicast. There are no security functions in IGMP, version 2
      (IGMPv2) [1]. Any host can send IP multicast datagrams to a host
      group. Any host can join a host group and receive IP multicast
      datagrams which are sent to the host group. This document describes
      the extensions to IGMPv2 for the authentication of sending and
      receiving hosts which comply with IGMPv2.

1. Introduction

   The rapid deployment of IP multicast over the Internet has been
   realized by MBone, an experimental IP multicast network over the
   Internet. IP multicast is at the experimental stage. In order to make
   IP multicast a commercial service, many enhancements to IP multicast
   are required. Among them, the security enhancement is one of the most
   important enhancements to IP multicast. There are no security functions
   in IGMPv2. Any host can send IP multicast datagrams to a host group.
   Any host can join a host group and receive IP multicast datagrams which
   are sent to the host group. There are no means to know who are the
   current sending and receiving hosts regarding each host group.

   This document describes the security extensions for IGMPv2.

2. Requirements

   The requirements for the security functions of IP multicast are
   described below.

   (1) Group Membership Control: An Internet Service Provider (ISP) needs
       to know who are the current sending and receiving hosts regarding
       each host group, because of the various reasons (e.g. accounting and
       network management). A sending host may request to know who are the
       current receiving hosts regarding the host group.

   (2) Authentication: An Internet Service Provider (ISP) needs to
       authenticate sending and receiving hosts regarding each host group,
       because of the various reasons (e.g. security and accounting).
       A sending host may request to send IP multicast datagrams only to
       receiving hosts that are authenticated.

   (3) IP Multicast Routing Protocols: Various IP multicast routing
       protocols such as DVMRP [2], PIM [3] and CBT [4] are being developed
       within IETF. The security functions of IP multicast must not depend
       on a specific IP multicast routing protocol.

       NOTE: Other requirements on the security functions of IP Multicast
             are for further study.

   This document describes security extensions to IGMPv2, which satisfy
   the above requirements.

3. Architecture

   The overall architecture for the security functions of IP multicast is
   described below.

   A sending host sends IP multicast datagrams to an ingress router in an
   IP multicast network. IP multicast datagrams travel towards egress
   routers through IP multicast routers within an IP multicast network.
   An IP multicast routing is controlled by IP multicast routing
   protocols such as DVMRP, PIM and CBT. An egress router sends IP
   multicast datagrams to receiving hosts which join the host group.

   This document describes the authentication functions of IP multicast,
   using the Challenge-Response mechanism in a similar way as CHAP [5].

   NOTE: Other mechanisms for the authentication functions of IP
         Multicast are for further study.

   An ingress router may optionally authenticate a sending host. When a
   sending host wants to send IP multicast datagrams, it sends a Sender
   Start message to an ingress router. When a ingress router receives a
   Sender Start message, it sends a Challenge message to the sending
   host which sent the Sender Start message. When a Challenge message is
   received, a sending host sends a Response message to an ingress
   router. When a Response message is received, an ingress router
   compares the response value with the expected value for the
   authentication of the sending host. Alternatively, an ingress router
   may ask a RADIUS server to authenticate the sending host.

   NOTE: The interaction between a multicast router and a RADIUS server
         is described in Appendix A. The separate document [6] describes
         the extensions to RADIUS [7] for the authentication of sending
         and receiving hosts which comply with IGMPv2.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, an ingress router
   sends a Success message to a sending host. When a Success message is
   received, a sending host starts to send IP multicast datagrams.

   An egress router may optionally authenticate a receiving host. When a
   receiving host wants to receive IP multicast datagrams, it sends a
   Membership Report message to an egress router. When an egress router
   receives a Membership Report message, it sends a Challenge message to
   the receiving host which sent the Membership Report message. When a
   Challenge message is received, a receiving host sends a Response
   message to an egress router. When a Response message is received, an
   egress router compares the response value with the expected value for
   the authentication of the receiving host. Alternatively, an egress
   router may ask a RADIUS server to authenticate the receiving host.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, an egress router
   sends a Success message to a receiving host. When a Success message is
   received, a receiving host starts to receive IP multicast datagrams.

   There are two levels of multicast routers.

   (1) Level 1: Unsecure Multicast Router
       The multicast router complies with IGMPv2.

   (2) Level 2: Secure Multicast Router
       The multicast router complies with both IGMPv2 and this document.

   All multicast routers in a subnetwork must be either secure or
   unsecure. In other words, unsecure multicast routers and secure
   multicast routers must not coexist in the same subnetwork.

4. Protocol Description

   This section describes the mechanisms for the authentication functions
   of IP multicast.

4.1 Procedures for Authentication of Sending Hosts

4.1.1 Operation of Sending hosts

   When a sending host wants to send IP multicast datagrams, it sends a
   Sender Start message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval]
   expires, a sending host resends a Sender Start message to a multicast
   router, until a Challenge message is received, or [Retry Count]
   expires.

   When a Challenge message is received, A sending host sends a Response
   message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires, a
   sending host resends a Response message to a multicast router, until
   a Success or Failure message is received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Success message is received, a sending host starts to send IP
   multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a sending
   host is not allowed to send IP multicast datagrams.

   After a sending host starts to send IP multicast datagrams, it may
   receive a Challenge message. When a Challenge message is received,
   a sending host sends a Response message to a multicast router. After a
   sending host sends a Response message, it may receive the same
   Challenge message. In this case, a sending host resends the same
   Response message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Response message was lost.

INTERNET-DRAFT             IGMP Authentication               March, 1998

   When [Retry Interval] expires, a sending host resends a Response
   message to a multicast router, until a Success or Failure message is
   received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Success message is received, a sending host can continue to
   send IP multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a
   sending host stops to send IP multicast datagrams.

4.1.2 Operation of Multicast Routers

   When a multicast router receives a Sender Start message, it sends a
   Challenge message to the sending host which sent the Sender Start
   message. After a multicast router sent the Challenge message, it may
   receive the same Sender Start message. In this case, a multicast
   router resends the same Challenge message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Challenge message was lost.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   sending host. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a RADIUS
   server to authenticate the sending host.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the sending host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the sending host. After a multicast router sent the Success
   message, it may receive the same Response message. In this case, a
   multicast router resends the same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

   A multicast router manages a list of IP addresses of authenticated
   sending hosts regarding each host group. When the authentication of
   the sending host is successful, a multicast router adds its IP address
   to the list.

   When a multicast router receives an IP multicast datagram from a
   sending host, it checks the source IP address of the received IP
   multicast datagram. If the source IP address was registered in the
   list of IP addresses of authenticated sending hosts, a multicast router
   forwards the received IP multicast datagram. If the source IP address
   was not registered in the list of IP addresses of authenticated sending
   hosts, a multicast router silently discards the received IP multicast
   datagram.

   The [Validity Period] of the authentication of a sending host is set in
   the authentication parameter of a Success message. If the [Validity
   Period] expires, a multicast router may reauthenticate the sending host.

INTERNET-DRAFT             IGMP Authentication               March, 1998

   When a multicast router reauthenticates the sending host, it sends a
   Challenge message. When a [Retry Interval] expires, the multicast router
   resends a Challenge message, until a Response message is received, or
   [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   sending host. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a RADIUS server
   to authenticate the sending host.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the sending host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the sending host. After a multicast router sent the Success
   message, it may receive the same Response message. In this case, a
   multicast router resends the same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

   A multicast router deletes the IP address of a sending host from a
   list of IP addresses of authenticated sending hosts, in the following
   cases.

   - When the [Validity Period] of the authentication of a sending host
     expires, a multicast router does not want to reauthenticate the
     sending host.
   - The reauthentication of a sending host is not successful.

4.2 Procedures for Authentication of Receiving Hosts

4.2.1 Operation of Receiving Hosts

   When a receiving host wants to receive IP multicast datagrams, it
   sends a Membership Report message with an authentication parameter
   to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires, a receiving
   host resends a Membership Report message to a multicast router,
   until a Challenge message is received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Challenge message is received, a receiving host sends a
   Response message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires,
   a receiving host resends a Response message to a multicast router,
   until a Success or Failure message is received, or [Retry Count]
   expires.

   When a Success message is received, a receiving host starts to receive
   IP multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a receiving
   host is not allowed to receive IP multicast datagrams.

   When a receiving host leaves the host group, it must send a Leave
   message to a multicast router.

   NOTE: The authentication procedure for a Leave message is for further
         study.

INTERNET-DRAFT             IGMP Authentication               March, 1998

   After a receiving host starts to receive IP multicast datagrams, it
   may receive a Group-Specific Query message with a reason parameter
   (reason = "reauthentication is required"). When a Group-Specific Query
   message with a reason parameter (reason = "reauthentication is
   required") is received, a receiving host sets a delay timer to a random
   value selected from the range (0, Max Response Time) for the host group
   being queried. Max Response Time is specified in the Group-Specific
   Query message. If the receiving host receives another Membership Report
   message with an authentication parameter while the timer is running, it
   stops the timer for the host group and does not send a Membership
   Report message with an authentication parameter, in order to suppress
   duplicate Membership Report messages.

   When the timer expires, the receiving host sends a Membership Report
   message with an authentication parameter to a multicast router. When
   [Retry Interval] expires, a receiving host resends a Membership Report
   message to a multicast router, until a Challenge message is received,
   or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Challenge message is received, a receiving host sends a Response
   message to a multicast router. When [Retry Interval] expires, a
   receiving host resends a Response message to a multicast router, until
   a Success or Failure message is received, or [Retry Count] expires.

   When a Success message is received, a receiving host can continue to
   receive IP multicast datagrams. When a Failure message is received, a
   sending host stops to receive IP multicast datagrams.

4.2.2 Operation of Multicast Routers

   When a multicast router receives a Membership Report message with an
   authentication parameter, it sends a Challenge message to the receiving
   host which sent the Membership Report message. After a multicast router
   sent the Challenge message, it may receive the same Membership Report
   message. In this case, a multicast router resends the same Challenge
   message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Challenge message was lost.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   receiving host. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a RADIUS
   server to authenticate the receiving host.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the receiving host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the receiving host. After a multicast router sent the
   Success message, it may receive the same Response message. In this case,
   a multicast router resends the same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

INTERNET-DRAFT             IGMP Authentication               March, 1998

   A multicast router manages a list of group addresses of host groups
   which have at least one authenticated receiving host for each of its
   attached networks. When the authentication of the receiving host is
   successful, a multicast router adds the address of the host group which
   the receiving host wants to join to the list, unless the address is
   already registered in the list.

   The [Validity Period] of the authentication of a receiving host is set
   in the authentication parameter of a Success message. If the [Validity
   Period] expires, a multicast router may reauthenticate the receiving
   host.

   When a multicast router reauthenticates the receiving host, it sends a
   Group-Specific Query message with a reason parameter ( reason =
   "reauthentication is required"). The Group-Specific Query message has
   the Max Response Time set to [Reauthentication Query Interval]. When a
   [Reauthentication Query Interval] expires, the multicast router resends
   the Group-Specific Query message, until a Membership Report message with
   an authentication parameter is received, or a [Retry Count] expires.

   When a multicast router receives a Membership Report message with an
   authentication parameter, it sends a Challenge message to the receiving
   host which sent the Membership Report message. After a multicast router
   sent the Challenge message, it may receive the same Membership Report
   message. In this case, a multicast router resends the same Challenge
   message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Challenge message was lost.

   When a Response message is received, a multicast router compares the
   response value with the expected value for the authentication of the
   receiving host. Alternatively, a multicast router may ask a RADIUS
   server to authenticate the receiving host.

   If the result of the authentication is successful, a multicast router
   sends a Success message to the receiving host. If the result of the
   authentication is not successful, a multicast router sends a Failure
   message to the receiving host. When the result of the authentication
   is not successful, the multicast router resends a Group-Specific Query
   message with a reason parameter ( reason = "reauthentication is
   required"), until the authentication succeeds, or [Retry Count] expires.

   After a multicast router sent the Success message, it may receive the
   same Response message. In this case, a multicast router resends the
   same Success message.

   NOTE: This is the case where a Success message was lost.

   A multicast router deletes the address of the host group from a list of
   the addresses of host groups which have at least one authenticated
   receiving host, in the following cases.

   - When the [Validity Period] of the authentication of a receiving host
     expires, a multicast router does not want to reauthenticate the
     receiving host.
   - The reauthentication of a receiving host is not successful.
   - A multicast router finds that there are no local members for the
     host group in accordance with IGMPv2.

   When a multicast router receives a Membership Report message without an
   authentication parameter, it silently discards the received Membership
   Report message, if the group address set in the Membership Report
   message is not registered in the list of the addresses of host groups
   which have at least one authenticated receiving host.

   NOTE: A multicast router receives a Membership Report message without
         an authentication parameter as the  response to a Membership
         Query, in accordance with IGMPv2.

5. Compatibility with IGMPv2 Hosts

5.1 Compatibility with IGMPv2 Sending Hosts

   A sending host which only complies with IGMPv2 sends IP multicast
   datagrams without having any authentication procedures. In this case,
   a multicast router which complies with this document silently discards
   IP multicast datagrams received. A multicast router must be able to
   manually register the address of a host group to the access control
   list (i.e. the list of host group addresses to which an unauthenticated
   host may send IP multicast datagrams) managed by the multicast router,
   so that a sending host can send IP multicast datagrams to the host
   group without having any authentication procedures.

5.2 Compatibility with IGMPv2 Receiving Hosts

   A receiving host which only complies with IGMPv2 sends a Membership
   Report message without having an authentication parameter. If there
   exists at least one authenticated receiving host on the same subnetwork,
   a multicast router treats this message as a valid Membership Report
   message, and hence the receiving host starts to receive IP multicast
   datagrams. If there exists no authenticated receiving host on the same
   subnetwork, a multicast router silently discards this message, and hence
   the receiving host can not receive IP multicast datagrams. A multicast
   router must be able to manually register the address of a host group to
   the access control list managed by the multicast router, so that a

INTERNET-DRAFT             IGMP Authentication               March, 1998

   receiving host can receive IP multicast datagrams sent to the host group
   without having any authentication procedures. A multicast router treats
   a Membership Report message without an authentication parameter as a
   valid message, if its destination address (i.e. host group address) is
   registered in the access control list.

6. Extensions to IGMPv2 Messages

   The following messages and parameters are added to IGMPv2 for the
   security extensions.

6.1 New Messages

   (4) Group Address

       In a Sender Start message, the address of the host group to which
       a sending host wants to send IP multicast datagrams is set to the
       group address field.

       In a Challenge, Response, Success or Failure message, the group
       address field is set to zero.

6.2.2 Optional Parameters for the Version 2 Membership Report Message
      and the Sender Start Message

   (1) Authentication

       This parameter of a Version 2 Membership Report message is used to
       authenticate an user on a receiving host which wants to receive IP
       multicast datagrams. This parameter of a Sender Start message is used
       to authenticate an user on a sending host which wants to send IP
       multicast datagrams.

       Identifier: This field is one octet (8 bits). When a Challenge
                   message is sent, this field must be copied from the
                   Identifier field of the preceding Version 2 Membership
                   Report or Sender Start message. When a Response message
                   is sent, this field must be copied from the Identifier
                   field of the preceding Challenge message.

       Value-Size: This field is one octet and indicates the length of the
                   Value field.

       Value: The Value field is one or more octets.

              The Challenge Value is a variable stream of octets. Each
              Challenge Value should be unique, since repetition of a
              challenge value in conjunction with the same secret would
              permit an attacker to reply with a previously intercepted
              response. The Challenge Value must be changed each time a
              Challenge message is sent. The length of the Challenge Value
              depends upon the method used to generate the octets, and is
              independent of the hash algorithm used.

              The Response Value is the one-way hash calculated over a
              stream of octets consisting of the Identifier, followed by
              (concatenated with) the "secret", followed by (concatenated
              with) the Challenge Value. The length of the Response Value
              depends upon the hash algorithm used. MD5 [8] is used as the
              hash algorithm. In the case of MD5, The length of the
              Response Value is 16 octets.

              The length of "secret" must be at least 1 octet. The "secret"
              should be at least as large and unguessable as a well-chosen
              password.

       User-ID: The User-ID field is one or more octets representing the
                identification of an user on a receiving or sending host
                to be authenticated. An User-ID may be ASCII character
                strings or an e-mail address of an user.

                        specifies the period of the validity for the
                        authentication of an user on a receiving or sending
                        host in units of second. When a Success message is
                        sent, a multicast router specifies the validity
                        period for the authentication.

Appendix A.  Interaction with the RADIUS Server

   This appendix gives an outline of the interaction between a secure
   multicast router and a RADIUS server. The detailed specifications of the
   interaction between them are described in [6].

A.1 Interaction with the RADIUS Server for the Authentication of Sending
    and Receiving Hosts

A.1.1 Interaction with the RADIUS Server for the Authentication of Sending
      Hosts

   When a multicast router receives a Response message from a sending host,
   it sends an Access-Request message in RADIUS to a RADIUS server.

   When the multicast router receives an Access-Accept message in RADIUS
   from the RADIUS server, it sends a Success message to the sending host.
   When the multicast router receives an Access-Reject message in RADIUS,
   it sends a Failure message to the sending host.

A.1.2 Interaction with the RADIUS Server for the Authentication of Receiving
      Hosts

   When a multicast router receives a Response message from a receiving
   host, it sends an Access-Request message in RADIUS to a RADIUS server.

   When the multicast router receives an Access-Accept message in RADIUS
   from the RADIUS server, it sends a Success message to the receiving host.
   When the multicast router receives an Access-Reject message in RADIUS,
   it sends a Failure message to the receiving host.

A.2 Interaction with the RADIUS Accounting Server for the Group Membership
    Control of Receiving Hosts

   A RADIUS accounting server [9] may be used for the group membership
   control of receiving hosts.

   The interaction between a multicast router and a RADIUS accounting
   server is described below for the group membership control of receiving
   hosts.

   When the result of the authentication of a receiving host is successful,
   a multicast router may send an Accounting-Request (start) message to a
   RADIUS accounting server.

   When the multicast router receives a Leave message from the receiving
   host, it sends an Accounting-Request (stop) message to the RADIUS
   accounting server, if it sent the Accounting-Request (start) message to
   the RADIUS accounting server regarding the receiving host.

Appendix B. Issues

B.1 Receiving Hosts on Shared Media Networks

   Once one receiving host on a shred media network such as Ethernet is
   is authenticated, a multicast router starts to send IP multicast
   datagrams to the network. As a result, other receiving hosts on the
   network can receive IP multicast datagrams, even if they are not
   authenticated.

   The most straightforward solution on this issue is the use of
   encryption.

   Encryption mechanisms for IP multicast are under development at the
   IPsec WG. If Encryption mechanisms for IP multicast are standardized,
   they could be integrated with the authentication mechanism
   described in this document.

B.2 Granularity on Filtering of IP multicast Datagrams

   An ingress router drops IP multicast datagrams sent from unauthenticated
   sending hosts, based on only their source IP addresses, even if user-IDs
   are used for authenticating sending hosts.

B.3 Quick detection of Sender Leave

   When the reauthentication of a sending host fails, a multicast router
   detects the leave of the sending host.

   To detect the leave of a sending host more quickly, it is necessary to
   define a new message (i.e. Sender Stop message). When a sending host stops
   sending IP multicast datagrams, it sends a Sender Stop message to a
   multicast router. When a multicast router receives a Sender Stop message
   from a sending host, A multicast router detects the leave of a sending
   host. This mechanism allows a multicast router to detect the leave of
   a sending host more quickly.
