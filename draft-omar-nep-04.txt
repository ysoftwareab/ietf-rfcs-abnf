1.  Introduction

   The Numbering Exchange Protocol (NEP) is an Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) that delivers IP packets between routers in the same
   Autonomous System (AS).

   Many IETF routing protocols, such as RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and EIGRP,
   only use one metric each:

      a. RIP uses only the number of hops.
      b. OSPF uses only the cost (bandwidth).
      c. IS-IS uses only a default metric of 10 for all links.    
      d. EIGRP uses the least bandwidth and delay.

   NEP differs from other IGPs as it chooses its best path based on a
   composite metric of:

      a. Highest total bandwidth (for faster transmission).
      b. Number of hops (for less processing).
      c. Lowest total delay (for faster delivery).

   NEP builds a short IP routing table less than other IGPs.

   NEP uses a numbering method between routers that provides a fast
   topology exchange and learning process.

   Router 1's topology advertisements cannot be represented in the
   figure because of the 72-column limit.  Here they are:

   To router 3:  1: 11, 2000, 10
                 1: 22, 3000, 20
                 1: 52, 5000, 20

   To router 5:  1: 11, 3000, 10
                 1: 22, 4000, 20
                 1: 32, 5000, 20

                 1: 64, 11000, 110

   In the above diagram, links have two numeric values: the upper value
   represents the link delay, and the lower value represents the link
   bandwidth.
 
   Each NEP router advertises the topology information as follows:

Omar & Camara           Expires July 2, 2017                    [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    Numbering Exchange Protocol (NEP)        December 2017

     a: rh, b, d

     a - advertising router RID.
     r - destination router RID.
     h - number of hops.
     b - total bandwidth.
     d - total delay.

   Each router within an Autonomous System (AS) must be configured with
   a unique number called Router ID (RID).
   
   The RID is a 32-bit decimal number that uniquely identifies a router
   within an AS, and has the following format: Y.Y.Y.Y

   Each router advertises its RID first to its neighboring routers using
   Hello messages.

   Each router advertises all the interconnected RIDs, total bandwidth,
   number of hops, and total delay to the neighboring router.

   Each router calculates the best path to each router using the
   following values:

      a. Total bandwidth.
      b. Number of hops.
      c. Total delay.
   
   The best NEP path from the local router to every other router from
   the collected advertised information has the following:

      a. Highest total bandwidth.
      b. Lowest number of hops that corresponds to the highest
         total bandwidth.
      c. Lowest total delay.

   The NEP metric is calculated using the following formula:

           ****************************************************
           *             (No. of Hops * Total-Delay)          *
           *  Metric = [-----------------------------] x 10^7 * 
           *                    Total-BW                      *
           ****************************************************                  

   The best metric has the lowest value.

   Each NEP router sends an Echo message of each of its interface to the
   neighboring router, the time taken by the message to be sent and 
   received over the link divided by 2 determines the link delay.

   The Echo message is sent by every router every 10 seconds
   (by default).

Internet-Draft    Numbering Exchange Protocol (NEP)        December 2017

   The link delay value is updated every 10 seconds on every advertised
   message that contains the 3 values that can be used to determine the
   best path from the NEP router to other routers.

3. NEP Loop Prevention

   NEP uses a loop free mechanism by discarding the advertised topology
   information that has a higher metric than the existing stored entry
   for the same RID to prevent looping.

   When an NEP router receives an advertised topology information to a
   specific router, it checks its own topology table, if there is no
   entry listed for that RID contained in the advertised message, it
   adds it to its own topology table.

   If more than one message received to the same RID, the NEP router
   calculates the metric for each one of them and store the one with the
   lowest metric for that router.

   For example:

      a) Router 1 will have 3 messages to the destination router 4 as
      follows:

          2: 42, 4000, 50 ==> Metric = 250,000     (discarded)
          3: 42, 3000, 30 ==> Metric = 200,000     (added)
          5: 42, 3100, 210 ==> Metric = 1,354,839  (discarded)

      The message from router 3 has the lowest metric to the destination
      router 4 so this route through router 3 will be added to the
      routing table and other routes will be discarded.

      b) Router 1 will have 3 messages to the destination router 6 as
      follows:

          2: 63, 9000, 120 ==> Metric = 400,000    (discarded)
          3: 63, 8000, 100 ==> Metric = 375,000    (added)
          5: 63, 8100, 280 ==> Metric = 1,037,037  (discarded)

      The message from router 2 has the lowest metric to the destination
      router 6 so this route through router 2 will be added to the
      routing table and other routes will be discarded.

   ***************************************************************

   Note: In case of two or more equal metrics for the same destination,
   the routes are added to the routing table and traffic is balanced
   between these routes.

4. Subnet Advertisement:

    After learning the best routes from each router to other routers,
    every router advertises the directly connected subnet(s) to other
    routers.

    Then, each router adds the learned subnet to the IP routing table.

    Consider the following example:

    Three routers are connected and every router is connected directly
    to one subnet.
                                                          3: 10.1.3.0/24

   For router number 1, the following topology information are received:

     2: 21, 1000, 20 ==> Metric = 200,000    (Added)
     2: 32, 4000, 30 ==> Metric = 150,000    (Added)
     3: 31, 500, 50  ==> Metric = 1,000,000  (Discarded)
     3: 22, 3500, 60 ==> Metric = 342,857.1  (Discarded)

   Once every router learns the best route to every other router, each
   router learns the advertised subnets.

   The subnet information is advertised as follows:

     a: subnet-number/mask  (for IPv4)
     a: prefix/length       (for IPv6)

   Where "a" represents the advertised router RID that has the directly
   connected subnet or prefix.
 
   Then, each router builds its own IP routing table:

   For router number 1, the IP routing table will be as follows:

   ***************************************************************** 
   * Dest. Router * Destination Subnet *  Metric * Next-hop Router *
   *****************************************************************
   *      2       *    10.1.2.0/24     * 200,000 *        2        *    
   *****************************************************************
   *      3       *    10.1.3.0/24     * 150,000 *        2        *
   *****************************************************************

   If more than one subnet is directly connected to a router, another
   entry will be added to the IP routing table for that subnet with the
   same destination router, metric and next-hop router.

   For loop prevention, each received subnet information through a
   specific interface is not advertised again through this interface,
   but out of other interfaces.
