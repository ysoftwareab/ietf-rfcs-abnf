1. Introduction 

  GSMP messages are defined in [1] and may be encapsulated in 
  several different protocols for transport. This memo specifies 
  their encapsulation in ATM AAL-5, in Ethernet or in TCP. Other 
  encapsulations may be defined in future specifications. 


2. ATM Encapsulation 

  GSMP packets are variable length and for an ATM data link layer 
  they are encapsulated directly in an AAL-5 CPCS-PDU [3][4] with an 
  LLC/SNAP header as illustrated:

  (The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols [5] is 
  to express numbers in decimal. Numbers in hexadecimal format are 
  specified by prefacing them with the characters "0x". Numbers in 
  binary format are specified by prefacing them with the characters 
  "0b". Data is pictured in "big-endian" order. That is, fields are 
  described left to right, with the most significant byte on the 
  left and the least significant byte on the right. Whenever a 
  diagram shows a group of bytes, the order of transmission of 
  those bytes is the normal order in which they are read in 
  English. Whenever an byte represents a numeric quantity the left 
  most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit. 
  That is, the bit labelled 0 is the most significant bit. 
  Similarly, whenever a multi-byte field represents a numeric

  quantity the left most bit of the whole field is the most 
  significant bit. When a multi-byte quantity is transmitted, the 
  most significant byte is transmitted first. This is the same 
  coding convention as is used in the ATM layer [2] and AAL-5 
  [3][4].) 

  The LLC/SNAP header contains the bytes: 0xAA 0xAA 0x03 0x00 0x00 
  0x00 0x88 0x0C. (0x880C is the assigned Ethertype for GSMP.) 

  The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the GSMP Message field is 
  1492 bytes. 

  The virtual channel over which a GSMP session is established 
  between a controller and the switch it is controlling is called 
  the GSMP control channel. The default VPI and VCI of the GSMP 
  control channel for LLC/SNAP encapsulated GSMP messages on an ATM 
  data link layer is: 

     VPI = 0 
     VCI = 15. 


3. Ethernet Encapsulation 

  GSMP packets may be encapsulated on an Ethernet data link as 
  illustrated:

  Destination Address  
            For the SYN message of the adjacency protocol the 
            Destination Address is the broadcast address 
            0xFFFFFFFFFFFF. (Alternatively, it is also valid to 
            configure the node with the unicast 48-bit IEEE MAC 
            address of the destination. In this case the configured 
            unicast Destination Address is used in the SYN message.) 
            For all other messages the Destination Address is the 
            unicast 48- bit IEEE MAC address of the destination. 
            This address may be discovered from the Source Address 
            field of messages received during synchronisation of the 
            adjacency protocol. 

  Source Address  
            For all messages the Source Address is the 48-bit IEEE 
            MAC address of the sender. 

  Ethertype  
            The assigned Ethertype for GSMP is 0x880C. 

  GSMP Message  
            The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the GSMP Message 
            field is 1492 bytes.

  Sender Instance  
            The Sender Instance number for the link obtained from 
            the adjacency protocol. This field is already present in 
            the adjacency protocol message. It is appended to all 
            non-adjacency GSMP messages in the Ethernet 
            encapsulation to offer additional protection against the 
            introduction of corrupt state. 

  Receiver Instance  
            The Receiver Instance number is what the sender believes 
            is the current instance number for the link, allocated 
            by the entity at the far end of the link. This field is 
            already present in the adjacency protocol message. It is 
            appended to all non-adjacency GSMP messages in the 
            Ethernet encapsulation to offer additional protection 
            against the introduction of corrupt state. 

  Pad  
            After adjacency has been established the minimum length 
            of the data field of an Ethernet packet is 46 bytes. If 
            necessary, padding should be added such that it meets 
            the minimum Ethernet frame size. This padding should be 
            bytes of zero and it is not considered to be part of 
            the GSMP message. 

  Frame Check Sequence 
            The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is defined in IEEE 802.3 
            [6] as follows: 
            "A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is used by the transmit 
            and receive algorithms to generate a CRC value for the 
            FCS field. 
            The frame check sequence (FCS) field contains a 4-byte 
            (32-bit) cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value. 
            This value is computed as a function of the contents of 
            the source address, destination address, length, LLC 
            data and pad (that is, all fields except the preamble, 
            SFD, FCS and extension). 
            The encoding is defined by the following generating 
            polynomial. 
            G(x)=x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^7+x^5
            +x^4+x^2+x^1." 
            The procedure for the CRC calculation can be found in 
            [6].

  After the adjacency protocol has achieved synchronisation, for 
  every GSMP message received with an Ethernet encapsulation, the 
  receiver must check the Source Address from the Ethernet MAC 
  header, the Sender Instance, and the Receiver Instance. The 
  incoming GSMP message must be discarded if the Sender Instance and

  the Source Address do not match the values of Sender Instance and 
  Sender Name stored by the "Update Peer Verifier" operation of the 
  GSMP adjacency protocol. The incoming GSMP message must also be 
  discarded if it arrives over any port other than the port over 
  which the adjacency protocol has achieved synchronisation. In 
  addition, the incoming message must also be discarded if the 
  Receiver Instance field does not match the current value for the 
  Sender Instance of the GSMP adjacency protocol. 


4. TCP/IP Encapsulation 

  GSMP messages may be transported over an IP network using the TCP 
  encapsulation. TCP provides reliable transport, network flow 
  control, and end-system flow control suitable for networks that 
  may have high loss and variable or unpredictable delay. The GSMP 
  encapsulation in TCP/IP also provides sender authentication using 
  an MD5 digest. 

  For TCP encapsulations of GSMP messages, the controller runs the 
  client code and the switch runs the server code. Upon 
  initialisation, the server is listening on GSMP's TCP port number: 
  6068. The controller establishes a TCP connection with each switch 
  it manages. The switch under control must be a multi-connection 
  server (PORT 6068) to allow creation of multiple control sessions 
  from N GSMP controller instances. Adjacency protocol messages, 
  which are used to synchronise the controller and switch and 
  maintain handshakes, are sent by the controller to the switch 
  after the TCP connection is established. GSMP messages other than 
  adjacency protocol messages may be sent only after the adjacency 
  protocol has achieved synchronisation. The actual GSMP message 
  flow will occur on other ports. 

4.1 Message Formats 

  GSMP messages are sent over a TCP connection. A GSMP message is 
  processed only after it is entirely received. A four-byte TLV 
  header field is prepended to the GSMP message to provide 
  delineation of GSMP messages within the TCP stream.

  Type 
               This 2-byte field indicates the type code of the 
               following message. The type code for GSMP messages is 
               0x88-0C (i.e. the same as GSMP's Ethertype).  

  Length:  This 2-byte unsigned integer indicates the total length 
               of the GSMP message only. It does not including the
               4-byte TLV header. 

4.2 TCP/IP Security consideration 

  Security between the controller and client MUST be provided by IP 
  Security [IPSEC]. In this case, the IPSEC Authentication Header(AH) 
  SHOULD be used for the validation of the connection; additionally  
  IPSEC Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) MAY be used to provide 
  both validation and secrecy. 


5. Security Considerations 

  The security of GSMP's TCP/IP control channel has been addressed 
  in Section 4.2. Security over ATM and Ethernet must be provided at 
  the link layer.  Discussion of these methods is beyond the scope 
  of this specification.
