   Abstract 
    
   This document provides a description of Split Multi-Link Trunking 
   (SMLT) SMLT is an architecture for reliable and redundant Layer 2 
   networks, which allows the full usage of all provisioned links that 
   are dual-homing into a pair of aggregation devices in a MAC-bridged 
   network. Multi-Link Trunking (MLT) is a link-aggregation mechanism 
   similar to IEEE 802.3ad without the LACP(Link Aggregation Control 
   Protocol). Typical redundant Ethernet networks consist of wiring 
   closet (edge) switches dual-homed to network center aggregation 
   (core) switches in a building or campus.  Similarly, in carrier and 
   ISP environments, CPE devices may be dual-homed to two SMLT 
   aggregation switches at a Service Provider∆s point of presence 
   (POP).  Traditionally, when a loop is created in the Layer 2 network 
   by dual-homing devices, Spanning Tree Protocol must block one of the 
   redundant network paths. SMLT avoids this by allowing all aggregated 
   paths in a dual-homed switch configuration to be active and 
   forwarding traffic simultaneously as well as providing very fast 
   traffic fail-over in the event of a link failure.

   2. Introduction 
    
   This document provides a description of Split Multi-Link Trunking 
   (SMLT) SMLT is an architecture for reliable and redundant Layer 2 
   networks, which allows the full usage of all provisioned paths and 
   bandwidth in a MAC bridged network. Multi-Link Trunking (MLT) is a 
   link-aggregation mechanism similar to IEEE 802.3ad without the LACP 
   (Link Aggregation Control Protocol). Typical redundant Ethernet 
   networks consist of wiring closet (edge) switches dual-homed to 
   network center aggregation (core) switches in a building or campus.  
   Similarly, in carrier and ISP environments, CPE devices may be dual-
   homed to two SMLT aggregation switches at a Service Provider∆s point 
   of presence (POP).  Traditionally, when a loop is created in the 
   Layer 2 network by dual-homing devices, Spanning Tree Protocol must 
   block one of the redundant network paths. 
    
   SMLT avoids this by allowing all aggregation paths in a dual-homed 
   switch configuration to be active and forwarding traffic 
   simultaneously as well as providing very fast traffic fail-over in 
   the event of a link failure.  This is accomplished by implementing a 
   method that allows two SMLT aggregation switches appear as a single

   path aggregation end point device to dual-homed edge switches.  The 
   SMLT aggregation switches make use of an Inter-Switch Trunk (IST) 
   between them over which they exchange information, permitting rapid 
   fault detection and forwarding path modification. Although SMLT is 
   primarily designed for Layer 2 Ethernet networks, it also provides 
   benefits for Layer 3 networks as well.  
    
    
   2.1 Reasons to deploy SMLT 
    
   As networks grow ever more critical there is a demand for multiple 
   paths from all wiring closet switches into the core of the network 
   in order to eliminate all single points of failure, such that in 
   most failure cases there is no permanent loss of connectivity and 
   the recovery from most failures is in the sub second area.  
   Moreover, it is highly desirable that the elimination of single 
   points of failure does not result in unused capacity (often very 
   costly) and perhaps more importantly, that rerouting around failures 
   is as fast as possible. 
    
   Further requirements that the solution is simple to implement and as 
   transparent as possible and interoperable with the majority of 
   existing wiring closet/CPE/edge devices, are key advantage that SMLT 
   presents compared to previous attempts to solve this problem. 
    
    
   3. Definitions 
   Before describing how SMLT works in detail it is necessary to define 
   various terms. 
    
   SMLT Client Switch 
   A switch located at the edge of the network. End stations typically 
   connect directly (or indirectly through a repeater) to a wiring 
   closet switch.  
    
   SMLT Aggregation Switch 
   A switch that connects to multiple SMLT client switches, edge 
   switches or CPE devices. Such SMLT Aggregation Switches may be owned 
   by the customer in the customer∆s enterprise network or may be owned 
   by Service Provider. SMLT applies to these different deployment 
   scenarios. 
    
   IST (Inter Switch Trunk) 
   IST consists of one or more parallel point-to-point links that 
   connect two SMLT aggregation switches together.  The two SMLT 
   aggregation switches utilize this channel to share information so 
   that they may operate as a single logical switch.  
    
   MLT (Multi-Link Trunk) 
   MLT is a method of link aggregation that allows multiple Ethernet 
   trunks to be aggregated together in order to provide a single 
   logical trunk.  An MLT provides the combined bandwidth of the

   multiple links, as well as the physical layer protection against the 
   failure of any single link. 
    
   A Multi-Link Trunk can be any kind of link aggregation mechanism. 
   There are currently several methods used in the industry such as, 
   but not restricted to IEEE 802.3ad, etc. The current proposal is 
   interoperable with 802.3ad in static mode (Link aggregation control 
   protocol LACP disabled). There is however no restriction to SMLT 
   that would preclude it to be extended to support LACP of 802.3ad. 
   This is currently not part of this proposal. 
    
   SMLT (Split Multi-Link Trunk) 
   A multi-link trunk with connection across an aggregated set of 
   ports, where each link of the multi-link trunk connects a pair of 
   ports on different devices (e.g. SMLT client switch and SMLT 
   Aggregation Switch), such that one end of the trunk is split between 
   two SMLT aggregation switches. 
    
   SMLT Client 
   A switch located at the edge of the network, such as in a wiring 
   closet or CPE.  An SMLT Client switch must be able to perform link 
   aggregation (such as with MLT or some other compatible method) but 
   does not require any SMLT intelligence.

   Aggregation switches E and F, and four separate SMLT client switches

   A, B, C, and D. At least B and C are MLT-compatible devices. SMLT 
   client switches B and C are connected to the SMLT aggregation 
   switches via multi-link trunks that are split between the two SMLT 
   aggregation switches.  For example, SMLT client switch B may use two 
   parallel links for its connection to E, and two additional parallel 
   links for its connection to F. 
    
   SMLT client switch C may have only a single link to both E and F.  
   As shown in the illustration, Switch A is also configured for MLT, 
   but the MLT terminates on only one switch in the network core.  
   Switch D has a single connection to the core.  Although both switch 
   A and switch D could also be configured to terminate across both of 
   the SMLT aggregation switches using SMLT, neither switch will 
   benefit from the advantages of SMLT in the configuration shown. 
    
   As seen in this example, implementation of SMLT only requires two 
   SMLT capable aggregation switches. Those switches must be connected 
   via an IST (Inter Switch Trunk.)   
    
    
   The SMLT aggregation switches use IST for three purposes: 
    
   - Firstly, they use it to confirm that each switch is alive as well 
     as exchange learned MAC address information; therefore this link 
     must be reliable and not exhibit a single point of failure itself.  
    
   - Secondly, it is used for the forwarding of flooded packets or 
     packets destined for non-SMLT connected switches or servers 
     physically connected to the other SMLT aggregation switch. 
 
   - Thirdly it is used to forward traffic in case of a SMLT link 
     failure  
    
    
   If all devices that are connected to the SMLT aggregation switches 
   are dual-homed (like switches B and C) the traffic on the IST only 
   consists of the IST control packet exchanges in normal operation. If 
   devices are single homed like A and D in average 50% of the traffic 
   will use the IST link in normal operation. 
    
   In case of a SMLT link failure the IST link is used as a backup link 
   to forward traffic to the destinations. These requirements dictate 
   that the IST should preferably be but are not restricted to a multi-
   gigabit MLT with connections between both SMLT aggregation switches 
   in order to ensure that there is no single point of failure in the 
   IST. 
    
   In case of an IST failure and all devices are dual-homed no data 
   traffic will be lost and the network remains intact. 
    
   The SMLT client switches are dual-homed to the two SMLT aggregation 
   switches but they require no knowledge of whether they are connected

   to a single switch or to two switches.  SMLT Intelligence is 
   required only on the SMLT aggregation switches.  Logically, they 
   appear as a single switch to the edge switches. 
    
    
   Figure 1 also includes end stations connected to each of the 
   switches:  a, b1, b2, c1, c2, and d may be hosts; e and f may be 
   hosts, servers or routers. 
    
   SMLT client switches B and C may use any method for determining 
   which link of their multi-link trunk connections to use for 
   forwarding a packet, so long as the same link is used for a given 
   flow.  This requirement ensures that there will be no out-of-
   sequence packets between any pair of communicating devices.  SMLT 
   aggregation switches will always send traffic direct to a SMLT 
   client switch and only use the IST for traffic that they cannot 
   forward another more direct way. The examples below will explain the 
   process. 
    
   Traffic from a to b1 and/or b2 ˚ assuming a and b1/b2 are 
   communicating via layer 2 - goes from switch A to switch E and then 
   forwarded up its direct link to switch B. Traffic coming down from 
   b1 or b2 to a is sent by switch B on one of its MLT ports. Since it 
   does not know that the MLT is anything special it may send traffic 
   from b1 to a on the link to switch E and the traffic from b2 to a on 
   the link to switch F. In the case of traffic from b1, switch E just 
   forwards the traffic directly to switch A, while traffic from b2, 
   which arrived at switch F, is forwarded across the IST to switch E 
   and then to switch A. 
    
   Traffic from b1/b2 to c1/c2 will always be sent by switch B down its 
   MLT to the core. No matter which switch (E or F) it arrives at it 
   will be sent directly to switch C through the local link. This is 
   the reason why dual-homing all client switches to the SMLT 
   aggregation pair, will reduce the amount of possible traffic load on 
   the IST link. A single IST failure (all SMLT links active) in this 
   scenario will also not cause traffic interruption. This minimizes 
   the risk of network downtime even further. 
    
   Traffic from a to d and vice versa is forwarded across the IST 
   because it is the shortest path, but this is treated purely as a 
   standard link with no account taken of SMLT and the fact that it is 
   also an IST. 
    
   Finally traffic from f to c1/c2 will be sent out direct from switch 
   F. Return traffic from c1/c2 to f will be passed across the IST if 
   switch C sends it down the link to the switch E. 
    
    
   4.1 IST Protocol

   The IST link connecting two SMLT aggregation switches in Figure 1 
   runs a protocol that allows the following messages to be exchanged 
   between the two SMLT aggregation switches: 
    
   IST Hello 
   Each SMLT aggregation switch periodically transmits and listens for 
   IST Hello messages on its IST ports where IST ports are those ports 
   that connect IST link. These messages indicate the following: 
   - SMLT aggregation switch port from which the IST Hello message is 
     being sent is set to type IST 
   - Whether the sending port is receiving IST Hello messages from the 
     other end 
   - The expected time interval between IST Hello messages that are 
     received from the other end. 
    
   SMLT Status 
   Each SMLT aggregation switch periodically reports SMLT Status to the 
   other SMLT aggregation switch. This may include the following: 
   - SMLT ID ˚ this value is assigned to a SMLT by an SMLT aggregation 
     switch when the SMLT is configured on the SMLT aggregation switch. 
     It provides a reference to each SMLT client switch on an SMLT 
     aggregation switch. 
   - SMLT Status ˚ Status of SMLT can be either 1) in service (one or 
     more of the SMLT links on an SMLT aggregation switch are 
     operating), or 2) out of service (all members of the SMLT links on 
     an SMLT aggregation switch are not operating). 
    
   Learned or Migrated MAC addresses 
   When an SMLT aggregation switch learns a new MAC address on any of 
   its ports, it notifies the other SMLT aggregation switch about the 
   MAC address value and the port type of the port at which the address 
   was learned. When address is learned against a SMLT port, SMLT ID is 
   also passed.  
    
   MAC address aged out 
   When the age expires for a MAC address assigned to a non-SMLT port, 
   the SMLT aggregation switch deletes the MAC address record and sends 
   a message to the other SMLT aggregation switch to report the event. 
   The other SMLT aggregation switch deletes its record. 
    
   SMLT address aged out 
   When the age expires for a MAC address assigned to a SMLT port, the 
   SMLT aggregation switch does not delete the MAC address record. It 
   does mark the address as having expired locally, sends a message to 
   the other SMLT aggregation switch and waits to receive confirmation 
   from the other switch. When the other switch receives the message, 
   it marks the address as having expired remotely, but waits to delete 
   the MAC address record only after it expires locally. 
    
   Local Bridge ID 
   This message is sent by an SMLT aggregation switch to notify the 
   other switch of the value of its own Bridge Identifier. This permits

   each SMLT aggregation switch to compare its ID with the other 
   switch∆s Bridge ID, so they may determine who will be Root Bridge, 
   and the values of BPDU parameters used on the SMLTs. 
    
   The above messages can be mapped to any existing protocols e.g. 
   802.3ad∆s LACP etc.  
    
    
   5. Problems Solved 
    
   5.1 Layer-2 Traffic Load Sharing 
    
   Load Sharing from the SMLT client perspective, is achieved by the 
   MLT path selection algorithm used on the edge switch. Usually this 
   is done on a SRC/DST MAC address basis but other techniques can be 
   used. 
    
   Load sharing from the SMLT aggregation switch perspective, is 
   achieved by sending all traffic destined to the SMLT client switch 
   directly and not over the IST trunk. The IST trunk is normally not 
   used to send/receive traffic to/from a SMLT dual-homed SMLT client. 
   Traffic received on the IST by an SMLT aggregation switch is not 
   forwarded on SMLT links because the other SMLT aggregation switch 
   will have performed that job, thus eliminating the possibility of a 
   loop in the network. The only exception to this rule is, if the SMLT 
   links on the peer aggregation switch are down, then traffic received 
   over IST will be forwarded to the corresponding SMLT on this switch. 
 
 
   5.2 SMLT Configurations  
    
   SMLT may be used within the core of the network. It is also possible 
   to configure SMLT groups in a square or full mesh scenario, but in 
   this case both sides of the link are configured for SMLT.

   This is possible because there is no state information passed across 
   the MLT link and thus both ends believe that the other end is a 
   single switch. The result of this is that there has been no loop 
   introduced into that network and any of the core switches or any of 
   the connecting links between them may fail and the network will 
   rapidly recover. 
 
   It is furthermore possible to scale SMLT groups to achieve 
   hierarchical network designs by connecting SMLT groups together thus 
   allowing building redundant loop free L2 domains without Spanning 
   Tree and still fully using all network links. 
 
 
   5.3 No single point of failure 
    
   Any single link or either SMLT aggregation switch can fail and 
   recovery will take place in less than 1 second.   
    
   Note that this number is conservative depending on the 
   implementation and the link loss detection mechanisms network might 
   experience loss for less than 1 second.  See the analysis below for 
   further details. 
    
 
   6. Failure Scenarios 
    
   6.1 Loss of SMLT link 
    
   The SMLT client switch detects link failure and sends traffic on the 
   other SMLT link(s) just as is done with standard MLT. Detection and 
   fail-over is dependent on how quickly the device can detect link 
   failures.

   If the link is not the only one between the SMLT client and SMLT 
   aggregation switches in question then the SMLT aggregation switch 
   also just uses standard MLT detection and rerouting to move traffic 
   to the remaining links.  
   If the link is the only one to the SMLT aggregation switch then on 
   failure detection the switch informs the other SMLT aggregation 
   switch of SMLT trunk loss. The other SMLT aggregation switch then 
   treats the SMLT trunk as a regular MLT trunk.  If the link is 
   reestablished, the SMLT aggregation switches detect this and move 
   the trunk back to regular SMLT operation.   
    
    
   6.2 Loss of SMLT aggregation switch 
    
   The SMLT client switch detects link failure and sends traffic on the 
   other SMLT link(s) just as with standard MLT.  
   The operational SMLT aggregation switch detects loss of partner (IST 
   and keep alive packets lost) and changes all the SMLT trunks to 
   regular MLT trunks.  If the partner returns, the operational SMLT 
   aggregation switch detects this (IST becomes active) and moves the 
   trunks back to regular SMLT operation once full connectivity is 
   reestablished. 
    
    
   6.3 Loss of IST Link  
    
   The SMLT client switches do not detect a failure and communicate as 
   usual. 
    
   In normal use, there will be more than one link in the IST (as it 
   may itself be an aggregated link. Thus IST traffic resumes over the 
   remaining links in the IST.  
    
    
   6.4 Loss of multiple SMLT aggregation switches in different SMLT 
aggregation switch pairs 
    
   Note that in this case one may have exceeded the goal of providing 
   connectivity only after a single failure since for this to happen 
   multiple failures must occur.  
    
   The SMLT client switches do not detect a failure and communicate as 
   usual. 
    
   Since each SMLT aggregation switch pair is a separate entity, each 
   is unaffected by failures elsewhere. Thus connectivity is 
   unaffected, although, since available bandwidth is drastically 
   reduced, packet loss and increased latency may occur. 
    
    
   6.5 Loss of all IST Links between an SMLT aggregation switch pair

   Note that in this case one may have exceeded the goal of providing 
   connectivity only after a single failure since for this to happen 
   multiple failures must occur.  
    
   In the event that all links in the IST fail, the SMLT aggregation 
   switches do not see each other anymore (keep alive lost) and both 
   assume that their partner is dead. However for the most part there 
   are no ill effects in the network if all SMLT client switches are 
   dual homed to the SMLT aggregation switches.  
    
    
   7. SMLT∆s relation with Spanning Tree/ Rapid Spanning Tree 
    
   SMLT is an architecture that fits between the MAC control layer and 
   the 802.1D/w on top of 802.3ad. 
    
                         +------------------+ 
                         |    802.1D/w      | 
                         +------------------+ 
    
                         +------------------+ 
                         |      SMLT        | 
                         +------------------+ 
    
                         +------------------+ 
                         |     802.3ad      | 
                         +------------------+ 
    
    
   Therefore the (Rapid) Spanning Tree Protocol can be supported on top 
   of SMLT path aggregation architecture.  
    
   Link Failures will therefore not anymore trigger any STP 
   reconvergence because the logical link remains still intact as long 
   as one SMLT link out of a group is active. 
    
   SMLT as an underlying path aggregation architecture underneath a 
   (Rapid) Spanning Tree design has following advantages: 
    
   SMLT does not have any blocking links. Therefore all configured 
   bandwidth is available for traffic forwarding. 
     
   SMLT∆s IST protocol is used only on a set of two switches, the SMLT 
   aggregation pair. The protocol, therefore, does not have any 
   inherent delays because the two neighbors are directly connected. 
    
   SMLT convergence targets are sub-second in every failure scenario. 
   There is no root bridge election and therefore long re-election is 
   not an issue.

   SMLT link failures don∆t generate TCNs as long as one logical link 
   out of an SMLT group is still active ˚ therefore flooding is only 
   limited to the SMLT aggregation pair. 
 
 
   8. Security Considerations 
 
   This document does not introduce any new security issues. From a 
   customer point of view, the SMLT looks to be the same as IEEE 
   802.3ad link aggregation. From the Service Provider point of view, 
   no security issues are expected since the IST communication occurs 
   between SMLT aggregation switches located inside the same autonomous 
   SP network. When the two SMLT switches are located in two different 
   autonomous networks, there may be some security issues, e.g. sharing 
   of bridging information. However, it is not expected that the SMLT 
   aggregation switches will be deployed in two SP networks.
