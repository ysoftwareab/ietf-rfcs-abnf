             Framework for End-to-End IETF Network Slicing
               draft-li-teas-e2e-ietf-network-slicing-02

Abstract

   Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance
   requirement of different services or customers in a shared network.
   An IETF network slice may be used for 5G or other network scenarios.
   In the context of 5G, the 5G end-to-end network slices consist of
   three major types of network technology domains: Radio Access Network
   (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core Network (CN).  The transport
   network slice can be realized as IETF network slices.  In the
   transport network, the IETF network slice may span multiple network
   administrative domains.

   In order to facilitate the mapping between network slices in
   different network technology domains and administrative domains, it
   is beneficial to carry the identifiers related to the 5G end-to-end
   network slice, the multi-domain IETF network slice together with the
   intra-domain network slice related identifier in the data packet.

   This document describes the framework of end-to-end IETF network
   slicing, and introduces the identifiers related to 5G end-to-end
   network slice and the multi-domain IETF network slice.  These
   identifiers can be carried in the data packet.  The roles of the
   different identifiers in packet forwarding is also described.  The
   network slice identifiers may be instantiated with different data
   planes.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] defines the terminologies and the
   characteristics of IETF network slices.  It also discusses the
   general framework, the components and interfaces for requesting and
   operating IETF network slices.  A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is
   a collection of network resources in the underlay network that are
   available to carry traffic and meet the SLOs and SLEs.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] describes the framework and the
   candidate component technologies for providing enhanced VPN (VPN+)
   services based on existing VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE)
   technologies with enhanced characteristics that specific services
   require above traditional VPNs.  It also introduces the concept of
   Virtual Transport Network (VTN), which is a virtual underlay network
   consisting of a set of dedicated or shared network resources
   allocated from the physical underlay network, and is associated with
   a customized network topology.  VPN+ services can be delivered by
   mapping one or a group of overlay VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as the
   underlay, so as to provide the network characteristics required by
   the customers.  Enhanced VPN (VPN+) and VTN can be used for the
   realization of IETF network slices.  In the context of IETF network
   slicing, NRP can be seen as an instantiation of VTN.

   [I-D.dong-teas-nrp-scalability] describes the scalability
   considerations in the control plane and data plane of NRP, and
   proposed several suggestions to improve the scalability.  In the
   control plane, It proposes the approach of decoupling the topology
   and resource attributes of NRP, so that multiple NRPs may share the
   same topology attributes and the result of topology based path
   computation.  In the data plane, it proposes to carry a global NRP-ID
   of a network domain in the data packet to determine the set of
   resources reserved for the corresponding NRP.

   An IETF network slice may span multiple network administrative
   domains.  Further in the context of 5G, there are end-to-end network
   slices which consists of three major types of network technology
   domains: Radio Access Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core
   Network (CN).  In order to facilitate the mapping between network
   slices in different network technology domains and administrative
   domains, it may be beneficial to carry the identifiers related to the
   5G end-to-end network slice, the identifiers of the multi-domain IETF
   network slices together with the intra-domain network slices related
   identifiers in the data packet.

   This document describes the typical scenarios of end-to-end network
   slicing, and the framework of concatenating network slices in
   different network technology domains and administrative domains.

   Multiple network slice related identifiers are defined for network
   slices with different network scopes.  These network slice related
   identifiers can be instantiated using different data planes, such as
   IPv6 and MPLS.

Figure 1. 5G end-to-end network slicing scenario


   One typical scenario of 5G end-to-end network slicing is shown in
   figure 1.  The 5G end-to-end network slice is identified by the
   S-NSSAI (Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information).  In
   the transport network, the 5G network slice is mapped to an IETF
   network slice.  In a multi-domain transport network, an IETF network
   slice can be realized with a multi-domain VPN+ service.  In the
   underlay network, the multi-domain VPN+ service can be supported by a
   multi-domain VTN, which is the concatenation of multiple intra-domain
   NRPs in different domains.  In each domain, a domain-significant NRP-
   ID can be carried in the packet to identify the set of network
   resource reserved for the NRP in the corresponding domain.  Note this
   is similar to the Option C mode of inter-domain VPN service
   [RFC4364].  Using Option A or Option B mode of inter-domain VPN for
   5G end-to-end network slicing is also possible, which is out of the
   scope of the current version of this document.

   In order to concatenate multiple domain-wide NRPs into a multi-domain
   NRP, the global NRP-ID can be carried in the packet, which is used by
   the domain border nodes to map to the local NRP-IDs in each domain.
   And in order to facilitate the network slice mapping between RAN,
   Core network and transport network, the S-NSSAI may be carried in the
   packet sent to the transport network, which can be used by the
   transport network to map the 5G end-to-end network slice to the
   corresponding IETF network slice.

   According to the above end-to-end network slicing scenario, there can
   be three network slice related identifiers in the data packet:

   *  Domain NRP-ID: This is the NRP-ID as defined in
      [I-D.dong-teas-nrp-scalability].  It is used by the network nodes
      in a network domain to determine the set of local network
      resources reserved for an NRP.  It SHOULD be processed by each hop
      along the path in the domain.

   *  End-to-end NRP-ID: This is the identifier which uniquely
      identifies a multi-domain NRP.  In each network domain, the domain
      border nodes map the global NRP-ID to the domain NRP-ID for packet
      forwarding.

   *  5G end-to-end network slice ID (S-NSSAI): This is the identifier
      of the 5G end-to-end network slice.  When required, it may be used
      by the network nodes to provide traffic monitoring at the end-to-
      end network slice granularity.

   For the above network slice identifiers, the domain NRP-ID is
   mandatory, the global NRP-ID and the 5G S-NSSAI are optional.  The
   existence of the Global NRP-ID depends on whether the NRP spans
   multiple network domains in the transport network, and how the domain
   NRP-IDs are managed.  In some network scenarios, different network
   domains can have consistent NRP ID allocation, then the domain NRP-ID
   can has the same value as a global NRP-ID.  The existence of the 5G
   S-NSSAI depends on whether an IETF network slice is used as part of
   the 5G end-to-end network slice.

3.  Requirements on E2E IETF Network Slicing

   This section lists the requirements on E2E IETF network slicing.

3.1.  Data Plane

   To facilitate the mapping between 5G end-to-end network slice and
   IETF network slice, and the mapping between multi-domain IETF network
   slice and the intra-domain IETF network slice, different network
   slice related identifiers, including the S-NSSAI, the Global NRP-ID,
   domain NRP-ID need to be carried in the data packet.

   In a multi-domain IETF network slice, the domain border nodes should
   support to map the Global NRP-ID to the domain NRP-ID of the local
   domain.  In a 5G end-to-end network slicing scenario, the edge nodes
   of IETF network slice should support to map the S-NSSAI to the global
   NRP-ID and the domain NRP-ID.  When the correlation between S-NSSAI
   and the NRP-ID needs to be maintained, the edge nodes of IETF network
   slices should be able to derive the S-NSSAI from the data packet
   received from RAN and CN, and encapsulate both the S-NSSAI and the
   NRP-ID into an outer packet header when traversing the transport
   network domains.

3.2.  Management Plane/Control Plane

   For multi-domain IETF network slice, a centralized IETF network slice
   controller is responsible for the allocation of the Global NRP-ID and
   the domain NRP-IDs, and the provisioning of the mapping relationship
   between the Global NRP-ID and the domain NRP-IDs to the border nodes
   in different network domains.

   For 5G end-to-end network slice, when S-NSSAI is used for the mapping
   from RAN or CN network slices to IETF network slices, the IETF
   network slice controller is responsible for the provisioning of the
   mapping relationship between S-NSSAI and the Global and local NRP-IDs
   at the edge nodes of IETF network slices.
