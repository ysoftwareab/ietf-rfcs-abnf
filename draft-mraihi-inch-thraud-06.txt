                     Sharing Transaction Fraud Data          May 2008 
        
       1. Introduction 
        
       Financial institutions and merchants that offer online access to 
       their services frequently encounter fraud perpetrated against 
       their customers' accounts. In their attempts to combat these 
       frauds, the organizations and their law enforcement agencies 
       could benefit greatly by sharing intelligence about fraud 
       incidents and patterns with similar institutions and agencies. 
       This specification standardizes a document format by which they 
       can share such information. It is intended to facilitate multi-
       vendor interoperability between conformant components of an open 
       fraud reporting framework. 
        
       Information sharing can take place directly between financial 
       institutions and merchants. However, the power of shared 
       intelligence is multiplied many times if the information is 
       gathered from multiple sources by a shared network, consolidated 
       and redistributed to participants. 
        
       In this arrangement, incident reports submitted to the network 
       are called inbound reports, and reports issued by the network 
       are called outbound reports. 
        
       Inbound reports should be submitted using a push-style protocol 
       (such as email or SOAP). And outbound reports may either be 
       distributed using a push-style protocol or a request/response 
       protocol (such as HTTP). 
        
       While inbound reports commonly identify the contributor of the 
       report, as this may be useful in evaluating the quality of the 
       information it contains and in contacting the source for the 
       purpose of clarification, outbound reports commonly do not 
       identify the original sources, as those sources may not wish to 
       be identified to other subscribers. Such reports should, 
       instead, identify the consolidator as the source. 
        
       A report may describe a particular transaction that is known to 
       be, or believed to have been, fraudulent, or it may describe a 
       pattern of behavior that is believed to be indicative of fraud.  
       The former type of report is called an 'activity report' and the 
       latter a 'signature report'. 
        
       The schema defined herein extends the IODEF XML incident 
       reporting schema [IODEF]. 
        
       In section 3 we introduce the actors in a typical transaction 
       fraud. Fraud reporting by means of an IODEF-Document is 
       described in section 4. We define the elements of a Thraud 
       Report in section 5. In section 6 we describe the Activity

       Thraud Report profile of the IODEF specification. And in section 
       7 the profile for a Signature Thraud Report is described. In 
       section 8 we define new attribute values for the IODEF Incident 
       class. Security considerations are described in section 9. The 
       Appendices contain the complete XML schema and a sample Thraud 
       Report. 
        
       Data elements in this document are expressed in Unified Modeling 
       Language (UML) syntax [UML]. 
        
       2. Requirements Terminology  
        
       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
       NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
       in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
        
       3. Anatomy of a Transaction Fraud 
        
       The actors in a typical transaction fraud are shown in Figure 1.

              Figure 1. Transaction Fraud Elements 
        
       Transaction fraud activities normally involve the following 
       actors: 
        
           1. Fraudsters are individuals or organizations that collect 
       victims' login credentials using a variety of means, including 
       phishing and malware, and verify them (usually by attempting to 
       login to the victim's account). Then the Fraudsters may either 
       recruit Fraud Executors themselves or wholesale the victims' 
       credentials to other Fraudsters, who will, in turn, recruit 
       Fraud Executors. 
        
           2. Fraud Executors are individuals who attempt the 
       fraudulent funds transfer or payment. In the case of fraudulent 
       funds transfers, an account at the same financial organization 
       as that of the victim, or a different one, is opened, as the 
        
       M'RAIHI            Expires - November 2008            [Page 5] 
        
        
                     Sharing Transaction Fraud Data          May 2008 
        
       destination account for the fraudulent transfer. Alternatively, 
       a fraudulent payment is made using a check or electronic 
       transfer. 
        
           3. Victims of both credential theft and transaction fraud. 
        
           4. The Financial Organization that holds either the victim's 
       or the Fraud Executor's account. 
        
           5. Sensors at the Financial Organization that detect 
       fraudulent transaction attempts, either in real-time or after 
       the fact.  
        
       The intention of Thraud reporting is to enable any organization 
       that has detected fraud to share this information, either 
       internally or with other potential victim organizations. The 
       receiving organization can use this information, for example, to 
       institute manual review of transactions initiated from 
       suspicious IP addresses.  
        
       4. IODEF-Document Incident Class 
        
       A Thraud Report SHALL be an instance of the IODEF-Document 
       class, as defined in [IODEF]. The report SHALL contain at least 
       one Incident object. Each Incident object SHOULD contain 
       information about a single fraud strategy. One Incident object 
       MAY contain information about multiple fraudulent transactions 
       that are consistent with the same fraud strategy. Each 
       fraudulent transaction SHALL be described in a separate 
       EventData object. The data model for the Incident class is shown 
       in Figure 2.

       The AdditionalData abstract class is an extension point in the 
       schema of the EventData class. Implementers SHALL include 
       exactly one of the following objects in AddtionalData: 
       FraudEventPayment, FraudEventTransfer, FraudEventIdentity and 
       FraudEventOther. Collectively, these are known as Thraud 
       Records. The corresonding classes are defined in section 5, 
       below. 
        
       The Thraud profile of the Incident class is defined in sections

       The FraudEventPaymentType class is used to report payee 
       instructions for a fraudulent payment or fraudulent payment 
       attempt. Fraudsters sometimes use the same payee instructions 
       (including the amount) for multiple fraudulent payment attempts.

       The FraudEventTransferType class is used to report the payee 
       instructions for a fraudulent funds transfer or fraudulent funds 
       transfer attempt. Fraudsters sometimes use the same payee 
       instructions (including the amount) for multiple fraudulent 
       funds transfer attempts. By reporting the funds transfer

       5.3. FraudEventIdentityType Class 
        
       The FraudEventIdentityType class is used to report a fraudulent 
       impersonation or fraudulent impersonation attempt. By reporting 
       the impersonation event, other potential victims may be able to 
       detect similar fraudulent impersonation attempts. 
        
       The structure of the FraudEventIdentityType class SHALL be as 
       shown in Figure 10.

       The contents of the FraudEventIdentityType class are described 
       below. At least one component MUST be present. 
        
       5.3.1. IdentityComponent 
        
       Zero or more values of type iodef:ExtensionType. This 
       specification defines two extensions: EmailAddress and UserID. 
        
       5.3.1.1. EmailAddress 
        
       In reporting an identity fraud event, the reporting institution 
       MAY include the victim's email address. This SHALL be achieved 
       by placing an object of type iodef:Email in the 
       IdentityComponent object. It SHALL contain the email address of 
       the intended fraud victim. 
        
       The IdentityComponent.dtype attribute SHALL be set to the value 
       "string". 
        
       The IdentityComponent.meaning attribute SHALL be set to the 
       value "victim email address".  
        
       5.3.1.2. UserID 
        
       In reporting an identity fraud event, the reporting institution 
       MAY include the victim's user id. This SHALL be achieved by 
       placing an object of type iodef:ExtensionType in the 
       IdentityComponent object. The data type of the extension 
       contents SHALL be xs:string. It SHALL contain the user id of the 
       intended fraud victim.

       5.4. FraudEventOtherType Class 
        
       The FraudEventOtherType class SHALL be used to report fraudulent 
       events other than those detailed above, such as new event types 
       that may emerge at some time in the future. This class enables 
       such events to be reported, using this specification, even 
       though the specific characteristics of such events have not yet 
       been formally identified. By reporting the details of these 
       unspecified event types, other institutions may be able to 
       detect similar fraudulent activity. 
        
       The structure of the FraudEventOtherType class SHALL be as shown 
       in Figure 11.

       Many of the components of the FraudEventOtherType class are also 
       components of the FraudEventPaymentType or 
       FraudEventTransferType classes. Their use in the 
       FraudEventOtherType class is identical to their use in those 
       classes. Therefore, their descriptions are not duplicated here. 
       Only components that are unique to the FraudEventOtherType class 
       are described below.

       This profile provides no guidance to recipients on the proper 
       processing of the following components. Therefore, the 
       originator has no assurance that the recipient will handle them 
       in an appropriate manner and SHOULD NOT include them in a Thraud 
       Report.  However, recipients MUST NOT reject reports that 
       contain these components.

       7. IODEF profile for a Signature Thraud Report 
        
       A Signature Thraud Report SHALL convey information about the 
       behavior associated with fraudulent events, rather than 
       reporting the details of the specific events themselves.

       Sharing Signature Thraud Reports enables recipients to detect 
       suspicious behavior in their own systems. 
        
       A Signature Thraud Report SHALL conform to the profile described 
       in section 6, with the exception that the following additional 
       components MUST be included. Except where noted, these elements 
       SHALL be interpreted as described in [IODEF]. 
        
       Incident.Assessment.Impact.severity 
       Incident.Method.Reference.ReferenceName - A name that identifies 
       the Signature Thraud Report. 
       Incident.Method.URL - A URI that identifies the signature. It is 
       NOT REQUIRED that the URI be dereferenceable. 
       Incident.Method.Description - A brief description of the 
       behavior covered by the signature. 
        
       8. IODEF Additional Attribute Values 
        
       Additional IODEF attribute standard values are defined here. 
        
       8.1. Purpose Attribute 
        
       The following additional values are defined for the 
       Incident.purpose attribute. 
        
       Add - The enclosed Thraud Record values SHOULD be added to the 
       corpus by the recipient. 
        
       Delete - The enclosed Thraud Record types SHOULD be deleted from 
       the corpus by the recipient. 
        
       Modify - The enclosed Thraud Record values SHOULD replace the 
       corresponding values in the corpus. Where no corresponding types 
       currently exist in the corpus, the enclosed values SHOULD be 
       added to the corpus by the recipient. 
        
       9. Security Considerations 
        
       This document describes a data format for exchanging transaction 
       fraud data. The most critical security concerns are the validity 
       of inbound and outbound Thraud Reports, as well as the 
       protection of the contributors' anonymity when further sharing 
       the data. This requires the following security services: origin 
       authentication, data integrity, access control and transport 
       confidentiality.

       9.1. Origin Authentication and Data Integrity 
        
       Acceptance by the recipient of reports introduced by an 
       attacker, or modification of genuine reports by an attacker, may 
       impact the effectiveness of the recipient's fraud detection 
       program.  Therefore, Thraud Reports MUST be protected for origin 
       authentication and data integrity. These protections guarantee 
       the origin and integrity of the submitted information. Any 
       mechanism that is acceptable to both parties MAY be used.  
        
       9.2. Access Control 
        
       Contributors of Thraud Reports might not be willing to allow 
       further disclosure of fraudulent transaction data to be 
       associated with them. So, in order to prevent inadvertent 
       disclosure of that information, Thraud Reports SHOULD be 
       encrypted while in storage. 
        
       9.3. Transport Confidentiality 
        
       In addition to protecting the confidentiality of Thraud data 
       while in storage, the data SHOULD be protected during transit. 
       Any mechanism that is acceptable to both parties MAY be used. 
        
       10. IANA Considerations 
        
       IANA is requested to reserve an XML namespace identifier for the 
       Thraud schema.  The following value is suggested: 
        
       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:thraud-1.0 
        
       IANA is also requested to reserve a MIME media type for Thraud 
       Reports.  The following value is suggested: 
        
       application/thraud+xml 
        
       11. Conclusion 
        
       This specification introduces transaction fraud (Thraud) 
       reporting mechanisms that enable the sharing of fraud data. 
       Based on the IODEF-Document format, the proposed extension 
       facilitates interoperability to increase the security of online 
       applications.
