1.  Introduction

   This extension to the OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] protocol defines
   two additional parameters that a client can include in requests to
   the user authorization endpoint which can be used to identify an
   instance of a given client and distinguish it from other instances of
   the same client that a user may authorize.  These are intended to aid
   in the user experience and to be used in addition to the client
   identifier as defined in OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].

1.1.  Multiple Copies of One Client

   A given client identifier may represent more than one access grant
   for a given user within a system protected by OAuth.  For example, a
   user may authorize the same installed client on both a laptop and a
   desktop computer.  Each of these would have the same client
   identifier but be issued different tokens and will have been granted
   access separately.  This extension is intended to allow the two
   client instances to identify themselves to the authorization server
   in a way that the user could later differentiate which tokens
   belonged to which copy of the client.

1.2.  Proxied Client Access

   An OAuth client capable of using the web-server flow could allow the
   user to interact with it through another means such as email or SMS.
   In this case, the OAuth client is a single entity with a single
   client ID which in turn could have multiple distinct grants per user.
   For example, in an email-proxied system, a user could grant access to
   the email proxy using multiple separate email addresses.  In each of
   these, the client is the proxy itself, but the grant is being made on
   behalf of a particular email account.  This extension is intended to
   allow the proxy client to identify to the authorization server which
   address is being requested.

1.3.  Dynamic, Anonymous, or Unregistered Clients

   An authorization server can allow unregistered or anonymous clients
   to access its protected resources.  In these cases, the client
   credentials could act as a user-agent string, providing a machine-
   identifiable string claimed by the client itself.  This extension is
   intended to allow such clients to present identifying information to
   the end-user through the authorization endpoint.  See the security
   considerations (Section 4) section for more information.

2.  Parameters

   instance_name
         OPTIONAL A short, human-readable name that the server SHOULD
         display to the end-user along with the client name.

   instance_description
         OPTIONAL A longer, human-readable description that the server
         MAY display to the end-user along with the client name.  If a
         client presents the instance_description, it MUST also present
         an instance_name.

   The server MUST NOT assume any format or structure to either of the
   parameters.

   If present, the authorization server SHOULD store this information
   along with its associated access grant in order to present it to the
   user at a future time.  The authorization server MAY allow the end-
   user to edit or augment the client-presented information prior to
   storage.  The authorization server MAY impose size limitations on
   either or both parameters, and such limitations SHOULD be documented
   as part of the the authorization server's API.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   The instance_name and instance_description parameters MUST be treated
   as self-asserted information from the client and MUST NOT be treated
   as a replacement for a client credential as defined in OAuth 2
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  Instead, the instance parameters MUST be
   treated with a level of trust appropriate to the end client.

   When this information is displayed to the user, the authorization
   server MUST present it in such a way as to make clear to the end user
   that the instance information is self-asserted by the client and has
   not been validated.  The authorization server MUST NOT display the
   instance information in lieu of a pre-registered display name, if
   available, but SHOULD display the instance information in addition to
   a pre-registered display name, if available.

5.  History

   This extension is a continuation of the concepts proposed by the
   x_oauth_display_name [google_oauth] parameter as deployed by Google.
   Google has used this extension parameter to allow for unregistered
   clients using the consumer key and secret of anonymous/anonymous to
   identify themselves to the system.  In this deployment, as far as the
   Authorization Server is concerned, all unregistered apps are
   different instances of the anonymous/anonymous client.  As dicussed
   above (Section 1), this extension seeks to standardize use for
   unregistered, proxied, and multi-instance clients alike.
