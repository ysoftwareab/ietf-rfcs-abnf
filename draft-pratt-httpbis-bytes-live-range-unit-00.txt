              HTTP bytes-live Range Unit for Live Content
              draft-pratt-httpbis-bytes-live-range-unit-00

Abstract

   To accommodate byte range requests for content that has data appended
   over time, this document defines a new HTTP range unit named "bytes-
   live".  The "bytes-live" range unit provides the ability for a client
   to specify a byte range in a GET or HEAD request which starts at an
   arbitrary byte offset within the representation and ends at an
   indeterminate offset, represented by "*".

1.  Introduction

   Some Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) clients use Range requests
   for random access to large representations.  And in some cases these
   representations have content continuously or periodically appended -
   such as representations originating from live audio or video sources.
   These types of clients cannot easily access the appended/live content
   using a Range request with the bytes range unit.

   HTTP clients have the ability to access appended content by
   transfersferring the entire representation from the very beginning.
   For large representations, however, newly appended content may never
   be transferred due to bitrate limits.  And even when the appended
   content is reached, it will be at the cost of start-up latency and
   wasted network bandwidth.  HTTP clients can also attempt to access

   appended content by sending periodic bytes Range requests using the
   last-known end position.  Performing periodic bytes Range requests
   (polling) introduces latency since the client will necessarily be
   somewhat behind the aggregated content - mimicking the behavior of
   segmented content representations such as HLS or MPEG-DASH.  And
   performing these Range requests at higher frequency incurs more
   processing overhead and HTTP traffic as the requests often return no
   content - since content is usually aggregated in groups of bytes
   (e.g. a video frame or audio sample).

   To accommodate byte range requests on large representations which
   have data appended over time, this document defines a new HTTP range
   unit named "bytes-live".  The "bytes-live" range unit adds the
   ability for a client to specify a byte range in a GET or HEAD request
   which starts at an arbitrary byte offset within the representation
   and ends at an indeterminate offset, represented by "*".  A client
   can also specify a request that immediately starts transferring
   aggregated/live content.

   The server indicates supports for the "bytes-live" range unit via the
   Accept-Ranges header.  If a client performs a "bytes-live" Range
   request on a dynamic representation (a representation that has data
   appended over time), the server can provide a non-fixed-length
   payload in response to one of these requests.  For instance, a server
   can use chunked transfer mode to return currently available data and
   data that is appended to the representation as it becomes available.
   Normal TCP flow control ensures new chunks are received by the client
   as soon as they are added to the representation with very low latency
   and overhead for the HTTP client and server.

2.  The "bytes-live" Range Request

   As with the "bytes" range unit, a "bytes-live" Range request allows a
   client to designate a subset of bytes from the representation data to
   be transferred in payloads as a sequence of octets.  But the form of
   a "bytes-live" request is focused on accessing data that may be
   appended to the representation over time.

   The bytes-live range unit has the following syntax:

      bytes-live-range-specifier = "bytes-live=" bytes-live-range-spec

      bytes-live-range-spec = [ first-byte-pos "-" ] "*"

      first-byte-pos = 1*DIGIT

   The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset
   of the first byte in a range.  An asterisk character ("*") indicates



Pratt, et al.            Expires October 5, 2016                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         HTTP bytes-live Range Unit             April 2016


   that the end of requested range is indeterminate and will include
   appended data if/when available.

   Examples of bytes-live-ranges-specifier values:

      Bytes 50000 to the end of the representation (including appended
      data, potentially unbound):

         bytes-live=500000-*

      All bytes appended to the end of the representation after the
      request is processed:

         bytes-live=*

      All bytes currently in the representation and those appended to
      the end of the representation after the request is processed:

         bytes-live=0-*

   A bytes-live-range-specifier is considered unsatisfiable if the
   first-byte-pos is larger than the current length of the
   representation.

3.  Responses to a bytes-live Range Request

3.1.  The "bytes-live" Content-Range header field

   As with the "bytes" Content-Range response form, a "bytes-live"
   Content-Range response indicates the satisfyable or unsatisfyable
   range of a "bytes-live" range request.

   The "bytes-live" Content-Range header is compliant with the Content-
   Range header rules defined in Section 4.2 and has the following
   syntax:

      bytes-live-content-range = "bytes-live" SP bytes-live-range-resp

      bytes-live-range-resp = bytes-live-range "/" ( complete-length /
      "*" )

      bytes-live-range = "*" / ( first-byte-pos "-" ( last-byte-pos /
      "*" ) )

      last-byte-pos = 1*DIGIT

      complete-length = 1*DIGIT

Internet-Draft         HTTP bytes-live Range Unit             April 2016


   For bytes-live ranges, the sender MUST indicate the offset of the
   first available byte in the returned range using the first-byte-pos.
   The sender MUST indicate the complete length of the representation
   and the last byte position of the returned range if the
   representation is no longer having data appended to it.  Otherwise an
   asterisk character ("*") MUST be used in place of the last-byte-pos
   to indicate the returned range and any associated payload is not
   bounded.  As is the case with byte ranges, an asterisk character
   ("*") in place of the complete-length indicates that the
   representation length was unknown when the header field was
   generated.

   The following example illustrates when the last byte of the selected
   representation is known by the sender to be 50000 bytes and is no
   longer being appended to:

      Content-Range: bytes-live 40000-49999/50000

   This second example illustrates when the complete length of the
   selected representation is unknown:

      Content-Range: bytes 40000-*/*

   As is the case with a byte unit Content-Range field, the bytes-live
   Content-Range field value is invalid if it contains a bytes-live-
   range-resp that has a last-byte-pos value less than its first-byte-
   pos value or a complete-length value less than or equal to its last-
   byte-pos value.

3.2.  The "bytes-live" 206 (Partial Content) response

   The bytes-live 206 response MUST comply with section 4.1 of
   [RFC7233].

   Additionally, responses to bytes-live requests that include an
   asterisk character ("*") in place of the last-byte-pos of the bytes-
   live Content-Range header field and precede a payload MUST use a
   transfer encoding mode appropriate for transferring dynamically
   generated payload, such as chunked transfer encoding for HTTP/1.1
   clients.

   Dynamic representations may stop being aggregated at any point in
   time.  So the transfer mode used for bytes-live 206 responses MUST
   indicate when the end of a dynamic representation being transferred
   is reached.  For chunked mode transfer encoding in HTTP/1.1, this is
   signaled with a 0-length chunk.  For HTTP/1.0 clients, this can be
   signaled by the server closing the connection.

3.3.  The "bytes-live" 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) response

   For bytes-live ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means
   that the first-byte-pos of the byte-range-spec is greater than the
   current length of the selected representation.  When this status code
   is generated in response to a bytes-live-range request, the sender
   MUST generate a Content-Range header field specifying the currently
   available range of the selected representation (Section 4.2 of
   [RFC7233]).

   For example, if the representation is no longer being appended:

           HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable

           Date: Wed, 23 Mar 2015 11:21:12 GMT

           Content-Range: bytes-live 5000-97229/97230

   And if the representation is still being appended:

           HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable

           Date: Wed, 23 Mar 2015 11:21:12 GMT

           Content-Range: bytes-live 5000-97229/*

4.  Accept-Ranges

   The "Accept-Ranges" header field described in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC7233] allows a server to indicate that it supports range requests
   for the target resource.

   An origin server that supports bytes-live range requests for a given
   target resource MUST send

      Accept-Ranges: bytes-live

   to indicate it supports bytes-live range units.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Range Unit Registry

   The "HTTP Range Unit Registry" defines the namespace for the range
   unit names and refers to their corresponding specifications.  The
   registry has been created and is now maintained at
   [RANGE-UNIT-REGISTRY].
