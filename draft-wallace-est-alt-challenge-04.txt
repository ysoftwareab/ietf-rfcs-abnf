                   draft-wallace-est-alt-challenge-04

Abstract

   This document defines a set of new Certificate Signing Request
   attributes for use with the Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
   protocol.  These attributes provide disambiguation of the existing
   overloaded uses for the PKCS #9 challengePassword attribute.  Uses
   include the original certificate revocation password, common
   authentication password uses, and EST-defined linking of transport
   security identity.

1.  Introduction

   PKCS #9 [RFC2985] defined a challengePassword attribute that has been
   overloaded by modern protocol usage with the appropriate
   interpretation being provided by context rather than OID definition.
   PKCS #9 defines the challengePassword attribute as "a password by
   which an entity may request certificate revocation".  The parsing and
   embedding of this attribute within Certificate Signing Requests is
   well supported by common PKI tool sets, but many work-flows leverage
   this supported field as a One-Time Password for authentication.  For
   example this is codified in many SCEP implementations as indicated by
   [I-D.gutmann-scep].  Continuing this trend, Enrollment over Secure
   Transport [RFC7030] defines an additional semantic for the
   challengePassword attribute in Section 3.5, in order to provide a
   linking of the Certificate Signing Request to the secure transport.

   Where the context of the protocol operation fully defined the proper
   semantic, and when only one use was required at a time, the
   overloading of this field did not cause difficulties.  Implementation
   experience with EST has shown this to be a limitation though.  There
   are plausible use cases where it is valuable to use either of the
   existing methods separately or in concert.  For example an EST server
   might require the client to authenticate itself using the existing
   client X.509 certificate, the user's username and password and to

   include a One-Time Password within the Certificate Signing Request
   all while maintaining identity linking to bind the CSR to the secure
   transport.  The overloading of a single attribute type should not be
   the limiting factor for administrators attempting to meet their
   security requirements.

   This document defines the otpChallenge attribute for use when a one-
   time password (OTP) value within the CSR is a requirement.  The
   revocationChallenge attribute is defined to allow disambiguated usage
   of the original challenge password attribute semantics for
   certificate revocation.  The estIdentityLinking attribute is defined
   to reference existing EST challenge password semantics with no
   potential for confusion with legacy challenge password practices.

   The attributes defined in this specification supplement existing EST
   mechanisms and is not intended to displace current usage of any
   existing EST authentication mechanisms.  Conveying the authentication
   value itself as an attribute may be preferable to using an HTTP or
   TLS password or other TLS authentication mechanism in environments
   where the certificate request processing component is removed from
   the HTTP/TLS termination point, for example, when a web application
   firewall is used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Alternative Challenge Password Attributes

   The following sections describe three alternative challenge password
   attributes for use with EST [RFC7030].  Appendix A provides an ASN.1
   module containing the new definitions.

   Each attribute described below is defined as a DirectoryString, which
   features several possible encoding options.  Attribute values
   generated in accordance this document SHOULD use the PrintableString
   encoding whenever possible.  If internationalization issues make this
   impossible, the UTF8String alternative SHOULD be used.  Attribute
   processing systems MUST be able to recognize and process the
   PrintableString and UTF8String string types in DirectoryString
   values.  Support for other string types is OPTIONAL.

Internet-Draft    EST Alternative Challenge Attributes     November 2015


3.1.  OTP Challenge Attribute

   The otpChallenge attribute is defined as a DirectoryString with an
   upper bound of 255.  This is consistent with the challengePassword
   attribute as originally defined in PKCS#9.  The otpChallenge
   attribute is identified by the id-otpChallenge object identifier.
   This facilitates reuse of existing challengePassword code by
   associating the new object identifiers with the existing parsing and
   generation code.  This attribute provides a means of conveying a one-
   time password value as part of a CSR request.  Generation,
   verification, storage, etc. of the values is not addressed by this
   specification.

      ub-otpChallenge INTEGER ::= 255
      id-otpChallenge OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
          id-smime TBD1
      }
      otpChallenge ATTRIBUTE ::= {
          WITH SYNTAX DirectoryString {ub-otpChallenge}
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE caseExactMatch
          SINGLE VALUE TRUE
          ID id-otpChallenge
      }

3.2.  PKCS #9 Challenge Password Attribute

   The original PKCS#9 challengePassword field has been overloaded and
   the common use is unclear.  The revocationChallenge attribute defined
   here provides an unambiguous method of indicating the original PKCS#9
   intent for this attribute type.  The revocation Challenge attribute
   is identified by the id-revocationChallenge object identifier.
   [RFC2985] discusses the original semantics for the PKCS #9 challenge
   password attribute.

      ub-revocationChallenge INTEGER ::= 255
      id-revocationChallenge OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
          id-smime TBD2
      }
      revocationChallenge ATTRIBUTE ::= {
          WITH SYNTAX DirectoryString {ub-revocationChallenge}
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE caseExactMatch
          SINGLE VALUE TRUE
          ID id-revocationChallenge
      }

Internet-Draft    EST Alternative Challenge Attributes     November 2015


3.3.  EST Identity Linking Attribute

   EST defines a mechanism for associating identity information from an
   authenticated TLS session with proof-of-possession information in a
   certificate request.  The mechanism was labeled using the pkcs-9-at-
   challengePassword identifier from [RFC2985].  To avoid any confusion
   with the semantics described in [RFC2985] or any other specifications
   that similarly defined use of the PKCS #9 challenge password
   attribute for their own purposes, a new object identifier is defined
   here and associated with the semantics described in section 3.5 of
   [RFC7030].

      ub-est-identity-linking INTEGER ::= 255
      id-estIdentityLinking OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
          id-smime TBD3
      }
      estIdentityLinking ATTRIBUTE ::= {
          WITH SYNTAX DirectoryString {ub-est-identity-linking}
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE caseExactMatch
          SINGLE VALUE TRUE
          ID id-estIdentityLinking
      }

4.  Indicating Support for the Alternative Challenge Password Attributes

   The EST server MAY indicate any or all of these in the /csrattrs.
   The EST client SHOULD include the indicated attributes in the
   subsequent CSR.  The EST server can of course refuse enrollment
   requests that are not encoded according to the CA's policy.

   Note that the "estIdentityLinking" attribute is a disambiguated
   alternative to the overloading of the "challengePassword" in section
   3.5 of [RFC7030], therefore any EST server that requests
   "estIdentityLinking" MUST check the [RFC7030] "challengePassword" as
   specified in [RFC7030] as well as the "estIdentityLinking" requested
   in order to support legacy EST clients.  EST clients that include the
   "estIdentityLinking" attribute SHOULD NOT also include the
   "challengePassword" attribute.

5.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations expressed in the EST
   specification [RFC7030], additional security considerations may be
   associated with the mechanism used to generate and verify the
   otpChallenge value.  Where a one-time password is used, the security
   considerations expressed in the HOTP [RFC4226] or TOTP [RFC6238]
   specifications may be relevant.  Similarly, the security

Internet-Draft    EST Alternative Challenge Attributes     November 2015


   considerations from [RFC2985] that apply to the challenge attribute
   are relevant as well.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Section 3 defines three attributes that need object identifier
   assignments from the SMI Security for S/MIME Attributes
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2) registry.

            Value     Description                        Reference
            --------  ---------------------------------  ---------
            TBD1      id-otpChallenge                    [this docment]
            TBD2      id-revocationChallenge             [this document]
            TBD3      id-estIdentityLinking              [this document]

   Appendix A contains an ASN.1 module, and a module identifier needs to
   be assigned from the SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier
   registry.

            Value     Description                        Reference
