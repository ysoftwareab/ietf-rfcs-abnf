Internet-Draft                APP Feed Seek                 October 2005


1.  Introduction

   When Atom Publishing Protocol [APP-Basic] clients encounter an APP
   collection, they may require smaller or larger frames of entries than
   the server provides by default.  Most servers provide between 5 and
   25 entries per Atom Feed Document [AtomFormat].  This frame can be
   far too large for a bandwidth and resource-constrained device, which
   might only have room to display two or three titles at a time.  This
   frame can be far too small for a client attempting to sync up with a
   collection that contains many thousands of members.

2.  Parameters

   HTTP URIs [RFC3986] provide a useful mechanism for composing
   parameterized requests--the query string [RFC2616].  This document
   outlines four parameters that are generally useful to APP clients,
   but may not be useful for every APP collection.

   count:  The maximum number of Atom Entries to be included in the
      response.  The field is an integer.
   offset:  The offset at which to begin the sequence of entries that
      match a given request.  The field is an integer.
   begin:  Atom entries in the returned feed have an atom:updated date
      later in time than the 'begin' date.  The field matches the syntax
      of an Atom Date Construct [AtomFormat].
   end:  Atom entries in the returned feed have an atom:updated date
      equal or earlier in time than the 'end' date.  The field matches
      the syntax of an Atom Date Construct [AtomFormat].

   None of the parameters are required, and servers could add additional
   parameters.

   Example Selection URI (disregard line break)

        http://example.com/foo?begin=2003-12-13T18:30:02Z\
        &end=2003-12-25T18:30:02Z&offset=2&count=4

   Seek URIs are templated by surrounding the field names in brackets.
   For example, the 'count' field would appear as '{count}' in a
   template.

   An example seek template:

        http://example.com/app?b={begin}&e={end}&i={offset}&c={count}

   All parameters are optional, so servers interpret requests with
   missing parameters using the list below:

   If no 'end' field is present:  The 'end' date is considered to be the
      updated date of the collection's most recently updated member
      resource.
   If no 'begin' field is present:  The 'begin' date is considered to be
      the update date of the collection's least recently updated member
      resource.
   If no 'offset' field is present:  The 'offset' integer is considered
      to be 0.
   If no 'count' field is present:  The 'count' integer is determined by
      the server.

3.  The 'app:seek' Attribute

   The "app:seek" attribute can be added to an anchor element contained
   in a server's XOXO Service Outline [XOXO].  When present, this
   namespace-qualified attribute provides a template for the
   parameterized GET requests described by this document.  After
   substitution of the appropriate parameters, the resulting URI
   reference is interpreted relative to the in-scope base URI.  The APP
   namespace is "http://purl.org/atom/app#".  This document refers to it
   by using the prefix "app", but that prefix is arbitrary.

   An example Service Outline with an app:seek attribute:

   <ul class="xoxo" xmlns:app="http://purl.org/atom/app#">
    <li>
     <a href="/entries"
        app:select="/entries?b={begin}&e={end}&i={offset}&c={count}"
        rel="entry" type="application/atom+xml">Main Blog</a>
       <ul>
        <li><a href="/app/collection.py?id=2&amp;type=media"
               rel="media" type="application/atom+xml">Photos</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="/app/collection.py?id=14"
               rel="entry" type="application/atom+xml">Drafts</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="/app.py?id=3&amp;type=entries"
        app:select="/app.py?id=3&b={begin}&e={end}&i={offset}&c={count}"
        rel="entry" type="application/atom+xml">Side Bar Blog</a>
     <ul>
      <li><a href="/app/collection.py?id=4&amp;type=media"
             rel="media" type="application/atom+xml">Stuff</a>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>



4.  Security Considerations

   Malicious or buggy clients could mount a Denial-of-Service attack by
   sending large date ranges or integers as parameter values.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None
