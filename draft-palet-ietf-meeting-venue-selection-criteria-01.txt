Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria     October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The IETF meetings are an important part of the IETF process and their
   hosting and organization must be carefully planned.  The adequate
   planning will allow to ensure that the attendees take advantage of
   their time at the meeting with a minimum set of guarantees for
   maximizing their performance, which also avoids unexpected situations
   and expenses (for example in case of a meeting cancellation, lack of
   adequate working conditions, lack of reliable connectivity, etc.).

   This document describes elements for both, logistic and technical
   criteria for the venue selection, logistic and technical contingency
   measures, as well as details related to the planning and timing.

   The criteria depicted in this document is not a list of "must" items,
   but a list of what needs to be evaluated considering variations and
   alternative solutions, or combinations of them, that may be available
   and convenient.

   Previous experience shows that things could go wrong when there is a
   too strict dependence on specific people or equipment and no
   alternative points of contact or availability is provisioned.
   Overall contingency is consequently very important.


2.  Location and hosting criteria

   A general recommendation has been that the IETF should try to become
   nearer to the people that contribute.  However, the IETF is growing
   in terms of participants from many countries and although a large
   number of them are from North America, experience shows that when the
   meeting is organized somewhere else, fewer than half the participants
   come from North America.  Consequently, to ensure open international
   access, the IETF should meet outside North America at least one time
   in three.

   However, this is a very basic recommendation and the overall
   selection criteria from this document is the one that will finally
   qualify the location.

   When choosing the location, it is important to consider as well, that
   the surplus coming from the meetings is very important for the
   sustainment of the IETF.  Consequently, each particular meeting
   overall cost should be considered as part of a more global operation,
   not just each meeting as a standalone event.  For instance, a lower
   meeting cost (balance among food, facilities, network, meeting fees,
   host capabilities, sponsorship, attendees cost), may not necessarily
   mean a lower secretariat costs.

   Vacations destinations may seem difficult for some people, but this
   could also be true for other situations always for a few people.  At
   the same time, frequent contributors and/or participants of IETF will
   often not need to justify its participation regardless of the
   location.

   One consideration, specially relevant if a vacations location is
   chosen is to avoid places with a very heavy concentration of
   visitors, together with a very heavy airport overload, which could
   difficult and easy transit for IETF participants.

   The choice of continent and country depends not only on the
   logistical and technical criteria listed in this document, but also
   on offers of hosting and sponsorship.  The IETF also desires to meet
   in countries with significant actual or potential participation.
   Hosting and sponsorship have particular impact both financially and
   organizationally.  Experience shows that when IETF goes to a new
   country, an eager and committed local host organization is vital.
   Also, a local host willing to sponsor some facilities for the meeting
   (without marketing noise) may be of great assistance to the budget in
   any country.  Some of these matters may be subject to confidential
   negotiations, which should be in the hands of IASA and in particular
   the IAD [1].

   Regarding the sponsorship, the meetings are not directly rewarding as
   a marketing action as it may be the case for other type of events, at
   least not directly, because the IETF community is mainly compound by
   engineers, not customers, but in any case is a rewarding action in
   front of the community.  This "low level" rewarding is also one more
   reason to make sure that not all the sponsorship details are openly
   disseminated, unless clearly authorized by the hosts, and even do, it
   can be contra-productive for future meetings.

   However it may be interesting to have, after each meeting, a summary
   evaluation of all the issues and costs, overall figures, which will
   help to improve the criteria and the performance of the following
   meetings.

   One more important consideration is the avoidance of locations in
   countries where some attendees could be disallowed to come in.  IETF
   is an open organization and anyone from any region should always be
   able to participate, so the meeting place can't be a barrier.

   One open question is related to who is empowered to take the final
   decision on any candidate venue/location.  Currently it seems that
   the IASA will need to take the decision about who "takes the
   decision", being the IAD on this regards, just the official point of
   contact, consulting the IETF chair and the IASA itself, but probably

   also the secretariat and the volunteer team which has been around
   without a formal position on this.  Despite the need for a certain
   degree of confidentiality, the evaluation of the criteria should
   allow to be aware of the main issues why a venue/location is or not
   adequate, and consequently an open report should be produced after
   each venue evaluation.


3.  Logistic criteria for the venue selection

   The average attendance to an IETF meeting is about 1.300 people,
   however it may span up to 2.300 people in some circumstances (for
   instance, meeting location).

   Considering this, the suggested venue meeting room capacity is
   calculated for about 1.600 people, including meeting space of about
   60.000/5.500 square feets/meters.

   The following table shows the approximate needs for meeting rooms and

                        Meeting Rooms Requirements

                                  Table 1

   Obviously those figures could change from meeting to meeting and are
   only an orientation.

   Note that some of the meeting rooms can be used for several
   functions, according to the meeting schedule, for example the plenary
   meeting room is used only when the rest of the sessions aren't
   occurring, breaks and registration area in the foyer, etc.

   All the meeting rooms should be provided with sufficient number of
   power sockets and cords for connecting the laptops of about 80% of
   the expected attendees.

   The rooms generally are hold in a 24 hours basis, and is highly
   recommended the possibility to use them at any time w/o restrictions,
   except for the required timing of the cleaning service.  In certain
   places this could be a cost issue and it may be not convenient.

   This may be the case when using conference facilities instead of
   meeting rooms in hotels.  In those cases, it may be necessary to
   increase the security when there are too many entrances.  Some
   additional technical issues may also arise according to previous
   experience, such as access to wiring closets, AV facilities, etc.

   Not having the rooms hold in a 24 hours basis could also be a problem
   in case electrical or network cabling/equipment has been deployed in
   the meeting rooms.

   The NOC should provision to setup a router on-site before the
   meeting, in order to test everything well in advance.

   Furthermore, the approximate requirements for sleeping rooms will be
   a block of around 5.515 rooms/nights.

    The following table shows the needs for sleeping rooms including a
                       few days before the meeting.

     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+

                        Sleeping Rooms Requirements

                                  Table 2

   The location of the hotel should be such that allows a quick movement
   of the attendees between the sleeping and the meeting rooms.  Is
   strongly suggested that the meeting rooms are in fact located in the
   main hotel (which a minimum capacity of about 60% of the required
   sleeping rooms).

   If the meeting rooms are not located in the same place as the main
   block of sleeping rooms, the inexpensive public transport means
   should allow the movement of 100% of the attendees in less than 30
   minutes, considering the meeting timing and usual public transport
   utilization by the locals.

   The ideal situation is that a number of alternative hotels are at
   walking distance (10-15 minutes) from the event venue.

   Moreover, the attendees (1.600-2.000) should be able to get food for
   lunch and dinner, according to the meeting timing, in a maximum of
   60-90 minutes, including the transit time (back and forth).  In
   general, a requirement will be to have a variety of restaurants
   within walking distance, allowing reservation of small and medium
   tables.  Special requirements (such as vegetarian food, others
   choices) must be satisfied.  Meals must be available when IETF needs
   them.  If this is not possible, a combination of this with the
   delivering of good quality sandwiches (including vegetarian and
   alternative choices) on-site could be acceptable.

   Places for casual meetings such as BAR BoFs should also be available.

   Is expected that the nearby airport is located no more than 50
   Kilometers from the main hotels, and again inexpensive public
   transportation is available.

   The airport should be of such capacity to accommodate 60% of the
   attendees arriving and departing on the same day, in addition to the
   usual number of passengers.

Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria     October 2005


   The traveling to the venue location should be possible with a maximum
   of one flight hop from a major hub.  The airport must have a
   diversity of international carriers.

   The country hosting the event should not limit the attendance for any
   participant.  Places in the world were a significant number of
   contributors can't go or if they have to do a lot of work, should be
   rejected as a candidate to host the IETF.

   The host country should not have unreasonable visa regulations, i.e.,
   either visas are not required for the large majority of participants,
   or if they are required, they can be obtained at low cost and don't
   take any unnecessary overhead neither from the organization or the
   attendees itself.  Citizens of certain countries may have difficulty
   in obtaining visas for political reasons - the IASA should take all
   possible steps to ensure that official governmental support is
   available for such people.


4.  Technical criteria for the venue selection

   In order to accommodate the IETF meeting with technical guarantees of
   successful working capabilities for the attendees, the following
   technical issues should be considered:

   This is only a list, need some work.  TBD.

   o  Telecommunications room availability

   o  A mechanism to having access 24 hours a day, ahead of the meeting.

   o  Access to the wiring, what can be uses, what not.

   o  Some facilities have no wiring.

   o  Appropriate wiring plan.

   o  Some facilities have great network access, others nothing (no
      fiber links up to the venue).  How much can be provisioned and in
      what time.

   o  Need to know the existing infrastructure and what can be done.

   o  Roof access, in case a WLAN link is required.

   o  If there is already a WLAN in the building can be turned off ?.

Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria     October 2005


   o  Existing infrastructure: fiber, UTP/distances

   o  Feasibility/facility to setup new cables (fiber/UTP)

   o  Electrical power capacity

   o  24 hours power.  Capacity and special distribution issues.
      Evaluate the cost of extra.

   o  Highly reliable Internet link and BW

   o  20-25 Mbits, today, of symmetric is a minimum requirement.  Backup
      needed.

   o  Multihoming seems to be to strong requirement and will much depend
      on the hosts capabilities, however it can be stated: Multiple
      physical paths are recommended.

   o  Facilities for AV, room dimensions for screens (high/wide)

   o  IPv4 unicast

   o  DNS

   o  DHCP

   o  IPv4 multicast: is still needed today ?

   o  IPv6 unicast

   o  IDS, other security issues

   o  No content filtering or ACLs.

   o  Managed devices across the entire network ?

   o  Test the network under heavy load

   o  Printers

   o  NOC - primary and backup contacts for all the issues/topics

   o  Provide stats and info on network status

   o  WLAN expertise and debugging/monitoring

   o  Document what can be wrong with the WLAN in advance to inform
      users - FAQ to users

Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria     October 2005


   o  Make the wired network production quality, WLAN experimental ?

   o  Wires to all essential services (e.g. audiocast, chairs,
      presenter, jabber scribe)

   o  White board for the NOC, in visible place


5.  Logistic Risks/Contingencies

   Physical safety and security threats at the location must be
   evaluated, understanding that the attendees come from all over the
   world.  Any specific threats must be addressed in advance (hiring
   guards, etc.).

   Appropriate warnings (e.g. about local crime risks) must be given.

   An emergency response plan and risk analysis must be in place
   throughout the meeting, covering issues such as food intoxication,
   medical problems, indications when something is stolen, etc.

   A red colored paper should be included in the participants
   registration envelope with details about the evacuation plan.  It
   should also include a clear statement regarding the situation in case
   of cancelation (for instance, attendee costs versus committed costs
   with the host/hotel, retention of meeting fees, etc.).

   An evaluation of was and terrorism risk and measures is also
   required.  The location should have no exceptional security
   considerations on this regard.

   Appropriate insurance should be investigated for IETF meetings.

Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria     October 2005


8.  Venue Acceptance/Rejection Report

   Despite the information provided by the proponent of a given venue,
   the IAD should, before taking a final decision about the acceptance
   or rejection of a given proposed venue, make an on-site survey.

   The on-site survey report will compare the selection criteria against
   the proposal information and the actual on-site findings, describing
   possible discrepancies or issues which may need further
   considerations even if they aren't directly described as part of the
   criteria set out-coming from this document.


9.  Process and Openness

   In order to demonstrate the compliance with the IETF meeting venue
   selection criteria, all the information related to the proposal of a
   site will be made publicly available in the IETF web site,
   considering the negotiation confidential issues which could be
   subjected to the sponsor/hosts decision.

   A summary of the information need to be made public regardless of the
   site being finally selected or not, and should include all the
   options, such as a given city and several venues in the same city,
   and so on.

   This will not only help the openness of the process but also as
   collective knowledge helping into a better organization and solution
   of issues for future meetings.

   In principle there should not be hidden details to the community
   regarding the proponent and site options and that should be the
   overall rule for the publication of the details.  However, once a
   venue is selected, there may be contractual bindings which may not
   allow to disclose all the negotiation details, which obviously will
   be restricted to a minimum.

   The published information will describe what was offered by the
   proponent, as well as the report about the on-site survey which
   should be done by the IAD before the final acceptance/rejection of a
   given proposed venue.


10.  Other Issues

   Further elaboration is required (TBD) ?
