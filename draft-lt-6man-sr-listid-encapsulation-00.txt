Abstract

   Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an ordered
   list of instructions, called segments.  The ingress node prepends a
   SR header to a packet containing a set of "segments".  A segment can
   represent any instruction topological or service-based.  Segment
   Routing can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of
   routing extension header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.
   An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6
   addresses in the routing extension header.  The segment to process is
   indicated by a pointer in the routing extension header.  Upon
   completion of a segment, the pointer is incremented.  This document
   describes how to decrease the length of the IPv6 list with ListID
   carried.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the
   addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header as described in
   [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header].  A segment is encoded as
   an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an
   ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing extension header.
   There may be many specified nodes or links included in the path based
   on policy, each ipv6 address is 128 bits, this will greatly increase
   the length of header.  This document describes a method by mapping a
   segment list to a ListID and carrying the ListID in the header.  It
   will decrease the length of the segment routing header.

Internet-Draft      SPRING IPv6 ListID Encapsulation        October 2015


   SR:Segment Routing SID:Segment Identifier SLID: Segment List
   Identifier, a segment list is identified by a Segment list ID (SLID).

3.  Solution

   In this document, we define the Segment List Identifier (SLID).  The
   segment list is identified by a Segment list ID (SLID).  Segment list
   ID (SLID) is allocated by the controller.  The segment list and the
   SLID can be advertised to the related nodes.  When the node receives
   the mapping message, it generates a mapping table about the SLID to
   the Segment List.  The segment routing header could be a new type of
   Routing Extension Header, or be identified by the R-flags as defined
   in [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header].

   As shown in the figure 1.

                   Figure 1  Scenario 1

   In this example, we assumes that: o All nodes are SR capable.  o Each
   SR node has a global IPv6 address configured by operator to identify
   the node.  o The operator (likely via the SDN Controller) as
   provisioned the Node-SIDs 2001::1001, 2001::1002, 2001::1003,
   2001::1004, 2001::1005, 2001::1006, 2001::1007, 2001::1008,
   2001::1009,and 2001::1010 respectively at nodes R1, R2, R3, R4, R5,
   R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10.  o The controller computes a list for: {R1,
   R2, R4, R3, R5, R6, R8, R7, R9, and R10}, and allocates an unused ID
   2001::1100 to identify the segment list.  o The controller advertises
   the mapping Segment list ID (SLID) 2001::1100 for segment list {R1,
   R2, R4, R3, R5, R6, R8, R7, R9, and R10} to all the nodes in the
   list.  o Each node receives the mapping message, generates the
   mapping table of the SLID to the List.

   A new type of Routing Extension Headers is shown in the figure 2.
   The ingress node could encapsulate frames with SLID carried.

                     Figure 2  A new type of Routing Extension Header

   o Next Header: 8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
   immediately following the SRH.  o Hdr Ext Len: 8-bit unsigned
   integer, is the length of the SRH header in 8-octet units, not
   including the first 8 octets.  o Routing Type: TBD, to be assigned by
   IANA.  o Segments Left: It is optional, as defined in [RFC2460], it
   contains the index, in the Segment List, of the next segment to
   inspect.  Segments Left is decremented at each segment in the list.
   o RESV: Reserved and for future use.  o Segment List ID: 128 bit IPv6
   addresses identifying the Segment List.  Used to look up the next
   hop, and then the next hop exchanges the destination of the IPv6
   encapsulation.

3.1.1.2.  R-flags defined in draft-previdi-6man-segment-routing-header
          to identify

   As the R-flags have reserved and defined in
   [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header], such as one of R-flags
   set, it means the SLID instead of the Segment List[n] carrying in the
   encapsulation, there is no need to carry the segment
   list[0]...segment list[n] in this solution.

3.1.2.  SLID Forwarding

   As each node receives the mapping message, each node knows which one
   is the next node of itself.  Such as R1 receives the message of
   Segment list ID (SLID) 2001::1100 mapping to the segment list {R1,

   R2, R4, R3, R5, R6, R8, R7, R9, and R10}, R1 will know R2 is my next
   segment in the LIST, and when some packets need to forward on the
   path of this list, it encapsulates the packet with the SLID
   2001::1100 carried, the destination of the packet is the addresses of
   R2 which is the next segment of R1.

   When the packet transit to R2, with the next header is routing
   extension header, and the routing extension header is the type of
   SLID carried, or the SRH carried with the R-flags to identify the
   SLID carried.  R2 learns the SLID 2001::1100 mapping to the segment
   list {R1, R2, R4, R3, R5, R6, R8, R7, R9, and R10}, and the next
   segment of R2 in this list is R4.  R2 changes the destination of this
   packet with the address of R4, and then the packet transits to R4.

   R4 knows R3, changes the destination,and the packet transits to R3.
   ... and then R10 receives the packet, it knows itself is the last
   segment in the list, and decapsulates the IPv6 SR header.
