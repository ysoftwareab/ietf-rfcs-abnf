Abstract

   While using SIGComp [4] based compression in SIP/SDP [5] [6], it is 
   imperative to have access to a static dictionary to be used on the 
   first SIP message that the compressor sends out. The session set up
   time can be reduced significantly if the compression rate of the 
   first SIP message is considerably high.

   The existing static dictionary for SIP and SDP [2], however, does not
   include some wireless specific data elements. This document 
   introduces these new data elements that are specific to various

   first SIP message (i.e., originating SIP Invite) used to initiate a 
   session.

1. Introduction

   While using SIGComp [3] based compression in SIP/SDP [5] [6], it is 
   imperative to have access to a static dictionary to be used on the 
   first SIP message that the compressor sends out. The session set up
   time can be reduced significantly if the compression rate of the 
   first SIP message is considerably high.

   The existing static dictionary for SIP and SDP [2], however, does not
   include some wireless specific data elements. This document 
   introduces these new data elements that are specific to various 
   wireless access technologies. These new data elements are part of the 
   first SIP message (i.e., originating SIP Invite) used to initiate a 
   session.


2. Design considerations

   The static 3G SIP/SDP dictionary is a collection of well-known 
   strings related to 3rd generation wireless access technologies that 
   appear in most of the SIP and SDP messages. 

   The new data elements should be inclusive of the existing SIP/SDP 
   static data dictionary specified by [2].

3. 3G Data Elements

   The following SIP data elements have been introduced by this 
   proposal.
    - 'P-Preferred-Identity'
    - 'P-Access-Network-Info'
    - 'Require: sec-agree, precondition'
    - 'Max-Forwards: 70'
    - 'Supported: 100 rel'
    - 'Spi:s'
    - 'Port:c='
    - 'Port:s='

   The following SDP data elements have been introduced by this 
   proposal.
    - 'Content-Type: application/SDP'
    - 'a=des:qos mandatory, local sendrecv'
    - 'a=des:qos none, local sendrecv'
    - 'a=inactive'


4. Binary representation of the 3G dictionary

 This section lists the SIP and SDP input strings used in generating the 
 dictionary, as well as a priority value, the offset of the string in 
 the generated dictionary, the length of the string, and one or more 
 references into the referenced documents that motivate the presence of 
 this string. Note that the notation "[CRLF]" stands for a sequence of 
 two bytes with the values 0x0d and 0x0a, respectively. The priority 
 value is used for determining the position of the string in the 
 dictionary. Lower priority values (higher priorities) cause the string 
 to occur at a later position in the dictionary, making it more 
 efficient to reference the string in certain compression algorithms. 
 Hence, lower priority values were assigned to strings more likely to 
 occur.
