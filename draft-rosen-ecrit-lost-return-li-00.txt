 Returning a Location Information in a Location to Service Translation
                                 query
                  draft-rosen-ecrit-lost-return-li-00

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) to permit a
   location information to be returned in a findservice response.  When
   the validation is requested in the findservice request, the location
   information supplied in the request may have enough valid address
   components (CAtypes) to be considered valid, but the LoST server may
   wish to return address components CAtypes not found in the query.

1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

   This document describes an extension to LoST [RFC5222], to allow
   location information to be returned in a <findServiceResponse>.  When
   requesting validation, the location information in the <findService>
   request may contain enough CAtypes to be considered valid.  The LoST
   server may have all of the address components for the location.  As
   an example, the query may contain a PC, postal code, but may not
   contain A1, A2 or A3 CAtypes.  The street name and PC may be
   sufficient to locate the address specified in the request and thus be
   considered.  It may be helpful to downstream entities to have the
   A1-A3 components, and the LoST server could supply them.  However,
   [RFC5222] does not have a way for location information to be returned
   in the <findServiceResponse>.  This document adds the possibility to
   include a <location> element to the <findServiceResponse> message.

3.  responseLocation

   This document defines a new element <responseLocation> which MAY be
   included in a <findServiceResponse> when validation is requested.  It
   MUST NOT be used in any other request or response.  The Location
   Information in the response MUST contain all of the location
   information in the request and MAY contain any additional CAtypes
   that refer to the same location specified in the request.

4.  Relax NG Schema

   This section provides the Relax NG schema for an extension to include
   the <location> in the <findServiceResponse> in the compact form.  The
   verbose form is included in Appendix A.

   namespace a = "http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotations/1.0"
   default namespace ns1 = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lostRLI"

5.  Security Considerations

   Although the input to the LoST request may be valid, however the LoST
   server determines what valid is, the requester may not actually
   understand where that is.  This extension returns more location
   information that the requester may not have had which may reveal more
   about the location.  While this may be very desirable for, e.g. an
   emergency call, it may not be as desirable for other services.  The
   LoST server implementation should consider the risk of releasing more
   detail verses the value in doing so.  Generally, we do not believe
   this is a significant problem as the requester must have enough
   location information to be considered valid, which in most cases is
   enough to uniquely locate the address.  Providing more CAtypes
   generally doesn't actually reveal anything more.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema as per the procedures in
   [RFC3688].


    URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:lostRLI

    Registrant Contact:  IETF, ECRIT working group (ecrit@ietf.org),
       Brian Rosen (br@brianrosen.net).

       The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of Section 7
       of this document.
