1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]
   (along with its precursor, the so-called "Jabber protocol") has used
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (along with its precursor,
   Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) since 1999.  Both [RFC6120] and its
   predecessor [RFC3920] provided recommendations regarding the use of
   TLS in XMPP.  In order to address the evolving threat model on the
   Internet today, this document provides stronger recommendations.

   In particular, this document updates [RFC6120] by specifying that
   XMPP implementations and deployments MUST follow the best current
   practices documented in the "Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS
   and DTLS" [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp].  This includes stronger
   recommendations regarding SSL/TLS protocol versions, fallback to
   lower versions, TLS-layer compression, TLS session resumption, cipher
   suites, public key lengths, forward secrecy, and other aspects of
   using TLS with XMPP.

2.  Terminology

   Various security-related terms are to be understood in the sense
   defined in [RFC4949].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft                  XMPP TLS                      April 2015


3.  Recommendations

   The best current practices documented in the "Recommendations for
   Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp] are included here
   by reference.  Instead of repeating those recommendations here, this
   document mostly provides supplementary information regarding secure
   implementation and deployment of XMPP technologies.

3.1.  Support for TLS

   Support for TLS (specifically, the XMPP profile of STARTTLS) is
   mandatory for XMPP implementations, as already specified in [RFC6120]
   and its predecessor [RFC3920].

   The server (i.e., the XMPP receiving entity) to which a client or
   peer server (i.e., the XMPP initiating entity) connects might not
   offer a stream feature of <starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns
   :xmpp-tls'/>.  Although in general this stream feature indicates that
   the server supports XMPP 1.0 and therefore supports TLS, that this
   stream feature might be stripped out by an attacker (see Section 2.1
   of [RFC7457]).  Similarly, the <required/> child element of the
   <starttls/> stream feature is used to indicate that negotiation of
   TLS is mandatory, but could also be stripped out by an attacker.
   Therefore, the initiating entity MUST NOT be deterred from attempting
   TLS negotiation even if the receiving entity does not advertise
   support for TLS.  Instead, the initiating entity SHOULD (based on
   local policy) proceed with the stream negotiation and attempt to
   negotiate TLS.

3.2.  Compression

   XMPP supports an application-layer compression technology [XEP-0138].
   Although this XMPP extension might have slightly stronger security
   properties than TLS-layer compression (since it is enabled after SASL
   authentication, as described in [XEP-0170]), this document neither
   encourages nor discourages use of XMPP-layer compression.

3.3.  Session Resumption

   To improve the reliability of communications over XMPP, it is common
   practice for clients and servers to implement the stream management
   extension [XEP-0198].  Although that specification includes a method
   for resumption of XMPP streams at the application layer, also using
   session resumption at the TLS layer further optimizes the overall
   process of resuming an XMPP session (see [XEP-0198] for detailed
   information).  Whether or not XEP-0198 is used for application-layer
   session resumption, implementations MUST follow the recommendations

   provided in [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp] regarding TLS-layer session
   resumption.

3.4.  Authenticated Connections

   Both the core XMPP specification [RFC6120] and the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125] provide recommendations and requirements for
   certificate validation in the context of authenticated connections.
   This document does not supersede those specifications (e.g., it does
   not modify the recommendations in [RFC6120] regarding the Subject
   Alternative Names or other certificate details that need to be
   supported for authentication of XMPP connections using PKIX
   certificates).

   Wherever possible, it is best to prefer authenticated connections
   (along with SASL [RFC4422]), as already stated in the core XMPP
   specification [RFC6120].  In particular:

   o  Clients MUST authenticate servers.

   o  Servers MUST authenticate clients.

   o  Servers SHOULD authenticate other servers.

   This document does not mandate that servers need to authenticate peer
   servers, although such authentication is strongly preferred.
   Unfortunately, in multi-tenanted environments it can be extremely
   difficult to obtain and deploy PKIX certificates with the proper
   Subject Alternative Names (see [I-D.ietf-xmpp-dna] and
   [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh] for details).  To overcome that difficulty, the
   Domain Name Associations (DNA) specification [I-D.ietf-xmpp-dna]
   describes a framework for XMPP server authentication methods, which
   include not only PKIX but also DNS-Based Authentication of Named
   Entities (DANE) as defined in [I-D.ietf-dane-srv] and PKIX over
   Secure HTTP (POSH) as defined in [I-D.ietf-xmpp-posh].  These methods
   can provide a basis for server identity verification when appropriate
   PKIX certificates cannot be obtained and deployed.

   Given the pervasiveness of eavesdropping [RFC7258], even an encrypted
   but unauthenticated connection might be better than an unencrypted
   connection in these scenarios (this is similar to the "better than
   nothing security" approach for IPsec [RFC5386]).  Encrypted but
   unauthenticated connections include connections negotiated using
   anonymous Diffie-Hellman mechanisms or using self-signed
   certificates, among others.  In particular for XMPP server-to-server
   interactions, it can be reasonable for XMPP server implementations to
   accept encrypted but unauthenticated connections when Server Dialback
   keys [XEP-0220] are used; such keys on their own provide only weak

Internet-Draft                  XMPP TLS                      April 2015


   identity verification (made stronger through the use of DNSSEC
   [RFC4033]), but this at least enables encryption of server-to-server
   connections.  The DNA prooftypes described above are intended to
   mitigate the residual need for encrypted but unauthenticated
   connections in these scenarios.

3.5.  Server Name Indication

   Although there is no harm in supporting the TLS Server Name
   Indication (SNI) extension [RFC6066], this is not necessary since the
   same function is served in XMPP by the 'to' address of the initial
   stream header as explained in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC6120].

3.6.  Human Factors

   It is strongly encouraged that XMPP clients provide ways for end
   users (and that XMPP servers provide ways for administrators) to
   complete the following tasks:

   o  Determine if a given incoming or outgoing XML stream is encrypted
      using TLS.

   o  Determine the version of TLS used for encryption of a given
      stream.

   o  If authenticated encryption is used, determine how the connection
      was authenticated or verified (e.g., via PKI, DANE, POSH, or
      Server Dialback).

   o  Inspect the certificate offered by an XMPP server.

   o  Determine the cipher suite used to encrypt a connection.

   o  Be warned if the certificate changes for a given server.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no actions of the IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The use of TLS can help limit the information available for
   correlation between the XMPP application layer and the underlying
   network and transport layers.  As typically deployed, XMPP
   technologies do not leave application-layer routing data (such as
   XMPP 'to' and 'from' addresses) at rest on intermediate systems,
   since there is only one hop between any two given XMPP servers.  As a
   result, encrypting all hops (sender's client to sender's server,

Internet-Draft                  XMPP TLS                      April 2015


   sender's server to recipient's server, recipient's server to
   recipient's client) can help to limit the amount of "metadata" that
   might leak.

   It is possible that XMPP servers themselves might be compromised.  In
   that case, per-hop encryption would not protect XMPP communications,
   and even end-to-end encryption of (parts of) XMPP stanza payloads
   would leave addressing information and XMPP roster data in the clear.
   By the same token, it is possible that XMPP clients (or the end-user
   devices on which such clients are installed) could also be
   compromised, leaving users utterly at the mercy of an adversary.

   This document and related actions to strengthen the security of the
   XMPP network are based on the assumption that XMPP servers and
   clients have not been subject to widespread compromise.  If this
   assumption is valid, then ubiquitous use of per-hop TLS channel
   encryption and more significant deployment of end-to-end object
   encryption technologies will serve to protect XMPP communications to
   a measurable degree, compared to the alternatives.

   This document covers only communication over the XMPP network and
   does not take into account gateways to non-XMPP networks.  As an
   example, for security considerations related to gateways between XMPP
   and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) see [RFC7247] and
   [I-D.ietf-stox-im].
