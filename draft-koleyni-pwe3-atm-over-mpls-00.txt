1. Abstract 
    
   This contribution  specifies  requirements  for connecting  ATM  edge 
   networks through  a  core  packet  network  using  MPLS.  This  basic 
   application  of  ATM-MPLS   interworking  will   allow  ATM   service 
   providers to  take  advantage  of new  technologies  in the  core  to 
   provide ATM multiservices.   Furthermore,  this application  requires 
   only a basic interworking  function of ATM and  MPLS.  The ATM  Forum 
   has adopted these requirements  as a basis for further work  defining 
   ATM-MPLS network interworking.

2. Introduction 
    
   MPLS has the potential  to reduce the complexity of service  provider 
   infrastructures by allowing  virtually any  existing digital  service 
   to be  supported over  a single  networking infrastructure.  However, 
   many service providers  have legacy  network and Operational  Support 
   System  (OSS)  capabilities   to  support   these  existing   service 
   offerings. The benefit  of MPLS to this  type of network operator  is 
   as a  common core transport  for multiple  existing legacy  networks, 
   not as a unifying control plane architecture for all services. 
    
   MPLS as  a common transport  infrastructure provides  the ability  to 
   transparently carry existing networking systems and the evolution  to 
   a single networking  core. The benefit of  this model to the  service 
   provider is threefold: 
     - Leverage  of the  existing systems  and  services with  increased 
       capacity from an MPLS enabled core. 
     - Existing  network operational  processes and  procedures used  to 
       maintain the legacy services are preserved. 
     - The common  MPLS network infrastructure  is used to support  both 
       the  core  capacity  requirements  of  legacy  networks  and  the 
       requirements of  new services, which are supported natively  over 
       the MPLS, network. 
 
   This draft describes  a simple  application of ATM-MPLS  interworking 
   intended to allow  ATM service  providers to carry  their ATM  multi-
   services  transparently  over  a  MPLS  packet  core.    This   draft 
   specifies requirements and the  frame work which were adopted by  the 
   ATM-IP Collaboration (AIC) working group of the ATM Forum as a  basis 
   for further work on ATM-MPLS network interworking. 
    
   This  draft  is  proposed  for  consideration  in  the  Pseudo   Wire 
   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Working group.

3. Terminology 
    
   AAL    ATM Adaptation Layer. 
   OAM    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance. 
   PVC    Permanent Virtual Connection. An ATM connection that is 
          provisioning via a network management interface.  The 
          connection is not signalled.

   IWF    The Interworking Function (IWF) is a functional entity that 
          facilitates interworking between two dissimilar networks 
          (e.g., ATM and MPLS). 
 
    
   Network interworking: In  network interworking, the Protocol  Control 
   Information of  the protocol  used in  two similar  networks and  the 
   payload  information   are  transferred,   transparently  across   an 
   intermediate network by an IWF. 
    
    
4. Background of ATM-MPLS Network Interworking 
    
   Advances in  networking  technology  in recent  years  allow  service 
   providers more choice and flexibility in building their networks  and 
   deploying their  services.  Service  providers envision  the  use  of 
   multiple technologies in  their networks,  and ATM is  often not  the 
   sole technology  used  in  the  network  core.  There  exist  network 
   topologies that rely on packet transport in the core based on MPLS.  
    
   In these kinds of network topologies,  ATM is present on the edge  as 
   a protocol  that brings multi-services  into the  packet core.  Frame 
   relay services, voice  services, and  circuit emulation services  are 
   all currently carried  over ATM. ATM  is also the current  underlying 
   technology for DSL and  LMDS access applications. An example of  such 
   a  network  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  ATM  connections  are  carried 
   transparently over  MPLS LSPs  from one edge  of the  packet core  to 
   another one. The LSPs are primarily used as transparent tunnels.  The 
   role of the ATM-MPLS interworking  function at each edge of the  core 
   is to  multiplex a  number of ATM  connections (VCCs,  VPCs or  both) 
   into a LSP  and originate the LSP.  The pair of LSPs  (bi-directional

   connectivity) between  any two interworking  devices at  the edge  of 
   the core is either  established using a network management system  or 
   is initiated through MPLS signalling.

   Transparency in this context means that ATM multi-services should  be 
   carried  over  the  packet  core  unaffected.  In  other  words,  the 
   ATM/MPLS interworking function is characterized by: 
    
   a. ATM  layer  protocols  are  not  terminated  at  the  interworking 
      function. 
   b. ATM and MPLS user data planes are interworked. 
   c. ATM  control  plane   information  (signaling  channels,   routing 
      control  channels) and  layer  management plane  information  (OAM 
      cells) are  tunnelled through the  LSP from  one ATM/MPLS edge  to 
      the other edge. 
    
   The pair of associated  unidirectional LSPs between the IWFs is  seen 
   as a bi-directional link by the ATM edge networks. 
    
    
5. ATM-MPLS user plane interworking requirements 
    
   The following  is a  summary  of the  requirements for  the  ATM-MPLS 
   network interworking. 
    
  a.    The  ability to multiplex  multiple ATM connections, VPC  and/or 
        VCC, into a pair of associated MPLS LSP.

  b.    Support for  the traffic contracts and the QoS commitments  made 
        to  the ATM connections  (i.e., relationship to underlying  MPLS 
        Diffserv capabilities). 
  c.    The ability to transparently carry all AAL types. 
  d.    The ability to  transparently carry all OAM cells, including the 
        support  for proper operation of  OAM PM cells and OAM  security 
        cells. 
  e.    Transport of Resource Management (RM) cells. 
  f.    Transport  of   Cell  Loss  priority  (CLP)  and  Payload   Type 
        Indicator(PTI) information from the ATM cell header. 
  g.    The  ability to encapsulate  a single ATM  cell within a  single 
        MPLS frame with a reasonable overhead. 
  h.    The option to  concatenate multiple ATM cells into the same MPLS 
        frame 
  i.    The  option to  reassemble an  AAL5 PDU  into one  or more  MPLS 
        frames for bandwidth efficiency. 
    
 
6. ATM encapsulation format 
 
   Figure 2 provides a  general format for interworking between ATM  and 
   MPLS. The  interworking  Function (IWF)  uses  a unique  MPLS  label, 
   i.e., the interworking  label, to identify  each direction of an  ATM 
   connection. This label allows  the IWF to access context  information 
   for the  connection.  As  an example,  the  context may  contain  the 
   information regarding connection type  such as VCC or VPC or  VPI/VCI 
   value that need to be inserted into the ATM cell header in  the MPLS-
   to-ATM direction.

   MPLS transport label 
   --------------------  
    
   The 4-octet  MPLS transport  label identifies  a LSP  (TLSP) used  to 
   transport traffic between  two ATM-MPLS interworking functions.  This 
   label is used to switch the transport LSP between core LSRs.  
    
   Interworking label 
   ------------------ 
    
   The 4-octet interworking  label uniquely identifies one  interworking 
   LSP (ILSP),  carried inside a  MPLS transport  LSP. The  interworking 
   label has the  structure of  a standard MPLS  shim header. More  than 
   one interworking LSP may be supported by one MPLS transport LSP. 
    
   The interworking function  provides the  association between the  ATM 
   connection and  MPLS  LSP  by  means  of  the  20-bit  field  of  the 
   interworking LSP. In this  association, in the ATM-to-MPLS  direction 
   a translation of VCI/VPI to  the 20-bit label is performed, while  in 
   the MPLS-to-ATM direction the  20-bit label is translated to  VCI/VPI 
   of the ATM connection.  This association is signalled or  provisioned 
   between the two interworking functions.  
    
   Since MPLS LSP is unidirectional, for the case of bi-directional  ATM 
   VCCs, there will  be two  different interworking LSPs,  one for  each 
   direction of the connection. These may have different label values. 
    
   Setting of the EXP  and TTL is for further  study.  The S bit is  set 
   to 1 since this is the last label in the bottom of the MPLS stack.   
    
   The interworking label  is not  visible to the  LSRs within the  MPLS 
   core network.   
 
   ATM-MPLS interworking specific header 
   ------------------------------------- 
    
   The ATM-MPLS interworking  specific header  (ISH) is inserted  before 
   the payload and identifies  whether encapsulation is to be  performed 
   for ATM  cells or  AAL5 frames. In  addition, other  elements of  the 
   protocol control  information constitute  parts of  this header.  The 
   cell mode  and frame mode  encapsulation formats  and procedures  are 
   shown and explained in the following sections. 
    
   Payload 
   ------- 
    
   The payload octet group is the payload of the service that is being 
   encapsulated. 
    
7. Encapsulation modes 
 
   Two modes of encapsulation are considered, cell mode and frame mode.

7.1  Cell mode encapsulation  
    
   In this mode, a single ATM cell or many concatenated ATM cells are 
   encapsulated in a single MPLS frame.  
    
7.1.1  Single cell encapsulation 
    
   Figure 3  shows  structure  of  the  ATM-MPLS  interworking  specific 
   header for  single  cell  encapsulation.    Description  of  ATM-MPLS 
   interworking specific header fields for single cell encapsulation  is 
   given below: 
 
         0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7 
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
      | MODE | VCIP |    RES      |        PTI         | CLP  |  
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
      |                     VCI (2 octets)                    | 
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
      /               Payload (48 octets)                     / 
      /                                                       / 
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
    
   Note: bit 0 is the most significant bit 
     
   Figure 3:Structure of ATM-MPLS interworking specific header for 
   transport of a single ATM cell 
     
   MODE (bit 0) 
   ------------ 
    
   This field is set to 0 to indicate cell mode.   
    
   VCI Present (bit 1) 
   ------------------- 
    
   This bit is set to 1 when VCI field is present, set to 0 when no VCI 
   field is present. In the case of a VPC, the VCIP field in the 
   interworking header of the first cell of a MPLS frame must always be 
   set to 1.  
    
   REServed (bits 2 & 3) 
   --------------------- 
    
   These bits are reserved for future use. They must be set to 0 when 
   transmitting and must be ignored upon receipt. 
    
   PTI (bits 4-6) 
   -------------- 
    
   Payload Type Identifier, Incorporates ATM Layer PTI coding of the 
   cell. These bits are set to the value of the PTI of the ATM cell.

 Internet Draft   draft-koleyni-pwe3-atm-over-mpls-00.txt     May 2001  
 
    
   CLP (bit 7) 
   ----------- 
     
   Cell Loss Priority indicates CLP value of the cell.  For  ATM-to-MPLS 
   direction, the CLP  state of the cell  may optionally be mapped  into 
   the EXP field of the MPLS transport label.  
    
   VCI: The VCI value, if present, is the same as that of the cell.  
    
   Payload: The payload consists of one ATM cell, excluding the header 
   (i.e., 48 octets).  
    
    
7.1.2  Concatenated cells encapsulation  
 
   Concatenation is the  act of  encapsulating, one after  the other,  a 
   group of cells  belonging to the  same VCC or  VPC into a MPLS  frame 
   for  more  bandwidth   efficiency.  In  the   case  of  a  VPC,   the 
   concatenated cells may belong to different VCCs. 
    
   The interworking functions at  the edge of the ATM-MPLS network  need 
   to be configured via  the NMS or via  signalling in order to be  able 
   to transmit and  receive concatenated cells in  a MPLS frame. In  the 
   case of  misconfiguration,  a  receiver  that is  not  configured  to 
   support cell  concatenation may  discard a  received  payload with  a 
   size larger than 48 bytes (i.e., payload of a single cell).   
    
   Figure 4  shows structure  of ATM-MPLS  interworking specific  header 
   for  concatenated  cells   encapsulation.  Description  of   ATM-MPLS 
   interworking  specific   header   fields   for   concatenated   cells 
   encapsulation is given below:  
    
      0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7 
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
   | MODE | VCIP |     RES     |        PTI         | CLP  | 
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

   Figure 4 Structure of ATM-MPLS interworking specific header for 
   transport of concatenated cells 
 
   MODE (bit 0) 
   ------------ 
    
   This field is set to 0 to indicate cell mode.   
    
    
   VCI Present (bit 1) 
   ------------------- 
    
   This bit is set to 1 when VCI field is present, set  to 0 when no VCI 
   field is  present.  In the  case of  a  VPC, the  VCIP field  in  the 
   interworking header of the first cell of a MPLS frame must always  be 
   set to  1, which  means that  the  VCI field  is present.  When  cell 
   concatenation is  enabled,  the  value of  the  VCIP field  must  not 
   change (default)  within the same  MPLS frame.  Optionally, the  ATM-
   MPLS interworking functions  can be configured  via NMS or  signaling 
   to transmit  and receive  a MPLS  frame  with a  variable VCIP  field 
   value in the same MPLS frame.  Note that the value of the VCIP  field 
   is allowed to vary from MPLS frame to MPLS frame.  
    
   REServed (bits 2 & 3) 
   --------------------- 
    
   These bits are reserved  for future use. They  must be set to 0  when 
   transmitting and must be ignored upon receipt. 
 
   PTI (bits 4-6) 
   -------------- 
    
   Payload Type Identifier,  Incorporates ATM Layer  PTI coding of  each 
   cell. These bits are set to the value of the PTI of the ATM cell. 
    
   CLP (bit 7) 
   ----------- 
    
   Cell Loss Priority  indicates CLP  value of each  cell.  For  ATM-to-
   MPLS  direction,  the  CLP  state  of  the  concatenated  cells   may 
   optionally be mapped into the EXP field of the MPLS transport label.  
    
   VCI: The VCI value, if present, is the same as that of the cell.  
    
   Payload: The total payload consists of up to N (>1) contiguous  cells 
   payloads (i.e., Nx48 octets). The  value of N needs to be  configured 
   via the NMS or via signalling. The payload does not include the  cell 
   header. The value of N is  limited by the smallest link MTU  (Maximum 
   Transport Unit) in the LSP tunnel.

 7.2  Frame mode encapsulation  

   This mode  is used  for carrying  a whole AAL5  PDU in  the LSP.  The 
   whole AAL5  PDU  is  comprised of  its  payload, padding,  and  whole 
   trailer, which include  CPCS-UU (CPCS  User-to-User indication),  CPI 
   (Common  Part   Indicator),  Length   and  CRC   (Cyclic   Redundancy 
   Indicator). ATM  cells  of  an  AAL5  PDU are  re-assembled  and  the 
   resulting AAL5 PDU is encapsulated in a MPLS frame. 
    
   Figure 5  shows structure  of ATM-MPLS  interworking specific  header 
   for frame mode  encapsulation. Description  of ATM-MPLS  interworking 
   specific header fields for AAL5 frame encapsulation is given below:

   frame transport  
    
   MODE (bit 0) 
   ------------ 
    
   This field is set to 1 to indicate frame mode.   
    
    
   VCI Present (bit 1) 
   ------------------- 
    
   This bit is set to 1 when VCI field is present, set to 0 when no VCI 
   field is present. 
    
   REServed (bits 2 & 3) 
   --------------------- 
    
   These bits are reserved for future use. They must be set to 0 when 
   transmitting and must be ignored upon receipt. 
    
   FRAGmentation (bits 4-5) 
   ------------------------ 
    
   This field provides information about frame fragmentation. It is  set 
   to (10 for BOM, Beginning  Of Message), (00 for COM, Continuation  Of

   Message), (11 for SSM, Single  Segment Message) and (01 for EOM,  End 
   Of Message).  Fragmentation  is  a  function  that  may  be  used  to 
   subdivide the payload into a series of fragments and to reassemble  a 
   sequence of  such  fragments to  reconstitute the  original  payload. 
   Fragmentation may be  enabled by network  management system (NMS)  or 
   via signalling. If  fragmentation is  disabled, frames received  with 
   the FRAG bit set to any  value other than 11 (SSM) are not valid  and 
   may be discarded.  
    
   EFCI (bit 6) 
   ------------  
    
   ATM-to-MPLS direction: The EFCI state of the reassembled AAL5 PDU  is 
   conveyed in  the EFCI  field of  the  ATM-MPLS interworking  specific 
   header. The EFCI state of a  PDU is set to 1 if the last cell of  the 
   PDU has its EFCI bit set to 1, it is set to 0 otherwise. 
    
   MPLS-to-ATM direction: The EFCI bit of all constituent cells of a 
   segmented AAL5 PDU is set to the value of the EFCI field in the ATM-
   MPLS interworking specific header.  
    
   CLP (bit 7) 
   ----------- 
    
   ATM-to-MPLS direction: The CLP  state of the reassembled AAL5 PDU  is 
   conveyed in  the  CLP field  of  the ATM-MPLS  interworking  specific 
   header. The  CLP state  of the  PDU is  set to 1  if any  of the  PDU 
   constituent cells  has its  CLP bit  set  to 1.  Optionally, the  CLP 
   state may be mapped into the EXP field of the MPLS transport label.  
    
   MPLS-to-ATM direction:  The CLP  bit of  all constituent  cells of  a 
   segmented AAL5  PDU is  set to  the  value of  the CLP  field in  the 
   interworking label. 
    
   PAYLOAD:   The payload consists  of the  re-assembled AAL5  CPCS-PDU, 
   including the AAL5 padding and trailer.
