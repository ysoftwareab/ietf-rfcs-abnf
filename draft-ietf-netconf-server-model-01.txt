Abstract

   This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model.  This
   data model enables configuration of the NETCONF service itself,
   including which transports it supports, what ports they listen on,
   whether they support device-initiated connections, and associated
   parameters.

1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a NETCONF [RFC6241] server configuration data
   model.  This data model enables configuration of the NETCONF service
   itself, including which transports are supported, what ports does the
   server listen on, whether call-home is supported, and associated
   parameters.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of data models is used in this
   document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

2.  Objectives

   The primary purpose of the YANG module defined herein is to enable
   the configuration of the NETCONF service on the device.  This scope
   includes the following objectives:

2.1.  Support all NETCONF Transports

   The YANG module should support all current NETCONF transports, namely
   NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242] and NETCONF over TLS
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis], and be extensible to support future
   transports as necessary.

Internet-Draft     NETCONF Server Configuration Model          June 2014


   Since implementations may not support all transports, the module
   should use YANG "feature" statements so that implementation can
   accurately advertise which transports are supported.

2.2.  Align Transport-Specific Configurations

   While each transport is unique in its protocol and may have some
   distinct configurations, there remains a significant overlap between
   them.  Thus the YANG module should use "grouping" statements so that
   the common aspects can be configured similarly.

2.3.  Support both Listening for Connections and Call Home

   NETCONF has always supported the server opening a port to listen for
   client connections.  More recently the NETCONF working group defined
   support for call-home ([I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis] and
   [draft-ieft-netconf-reverse-ssh]).  The module should configure both
   listening for connections and call-home.

   Since implementations may not support both listening for connections
   and call home, YANG "feature" statements should be used so that
   implementation can accurately advertise the connection types it
   supports.

2.4.  For Call Home Connections

   The following objectives only pertain to call home connections.

2.4.1.  Support More than One Application

   A device may be managed by more than one northbound application.  For
   instance, a deployment may have one application for provisioning and
   another for fault monitoring.  Therefore, when it is desired for a
   device to initiate call home connections, it should be able to do so
   for more than one application.

2.4.2.  Support Applications Having More than One Server

   An application managing a device may implement a high-availability
   strategy employing a multiplicity of active and/or passive servers.
   Therefore, when it is desired for a device to initiate call home
   connections, it should be able to connect to any of the applications
   servers.

2.4.3.  Support a Reconnection Strategy

   Assuming an application has more than one server, then it becomes
   necessary to configure how a device should reconnect to the

Internet-Draft     NETCONF Server Configuration Model          June 2014


   application should it lose its connection to the application's
   servers.  Of primary interest is if the device should start with
   first server defined in a user-ordered list of servers or with the
   last server it was connected to.  Secondary settings might specify
   the frequency of attempts and number of attempts per server.
   Therefore, a reconnection strategy should be configurable.

2.4.4.  Support both Persistent and Periodic Connections

   Applications may vary greatly on how frequently they need to interact
   with a device, how responsive interactions with devices need to be,
   and how many simultaneous connections they can support.  Some
   applications may need a persistent connection to devices to optimize
   real-time interactions, while others are satisfied with periodic
   interactions and reduced resources required.  Therefore, when it is
   necessary for devices to initiate connections, the type of connection
   desired should be configured.

2.4.5.  Reconnection Strategy for Periodic Connections

   The reconnection strategy should apply to both persistent and
   periodic connections.  How it applies to periodic connections becomes
   clear when considering that a periodic "connection" is a logical
   connection to a single server.  That is, the periods of
   unconnectedness are intentional as opposed to due to external
   reasons.  A periodic "connection" should always reconnect to the same
   server until it is no longer able to, at which time the reconnection
   strategy guides how to connect to another server.

2.4.6.  Keep-Alives for Persistent Connections

   If a persistent connection is desired, it is the responsibility of
   the connection-initiator to actively test the aliveness of the
   connection.  The connection initiator must immediately work to
   reestablish a persistent connection as soon as the connection is
   lost.  How often the connection should be tested is driven by
   applications requirements, and therefore keep-alive settings should
   be configurable on a per-application basis.

2.4.7.  Customizations for Periodic Connections

   If a periodic connection is desired, it is necessary for the device
   to know how often it should connect.  This delay essentially
   determines how long the application might have to wait to send data
   to the device.  This setting does not constrain how often the device
   must wait to send data to the application, as the device should
   immediately connect to the application whenever it has data to send
   to it.

Internet-Draft     NETCONF Server Configuration Model          June 2014


   A common communication pattern is that one data transmission is many
   times closely followed by another.  For instance, if the device needs
   to send a notification message, there's a high probability that it
   will send another shortly thereafter.  Likewise, the application may
   have a sequence of pending messages to send.  Thus, it should be
   possible for a device to hold a connection open until some amount of
   time of no data being transmitted as transpired.

3.  Data Model

3.1.  Overview

   To enable transports to configure listening on one or more ports in a
   common way, this grouping is defined.  This grouping defines SSH and
   TLS specific containers, each of which refines the default listening
   port appropriately.  Further, each of these transport specific
   containers use a feature statement, enabling NETCONF servers to
   accurately advertise what they support.

   module: ietf-netconf-server
      +--rw netconf-server
         +--rw listen
            +--rw ssh {ssh-listen}?
            |  +--rw (one-or-many)?
            |     +--:(one-port)
            |     |  +--rw port?        inet:port-number
            |     +--:(many-ports)
            |        +--rw interface* [address]
            |           +--rw address    inet:host
            |           +--rw port?      inet:port-number
            +--rw tls {tls-listen}?
               +--rw (one-or-many)?
                  +--:(one-port)
                  |  +--rw port?        inet:port-number
                  +--:(many-ports)
                     +--rw interface* [address]
                        +--rw address    inet:host
                        +--rw port?      inet:port-number

   To enable transports to configure initiating connections to remote
   applications in a common way, this grouping is defined.  This
   grouping configures a list of network-managers, each with some
   transport-specific configuration augmented in.  Each of the transport
   specific containers use a feature statement, enabling NETCONF servers
   to accurately advertise what they support.

4.  Keep-Alives for SSH and TLS

   One the objectives listed above, Keep-Alives for Persistent
   Connections (Section 2.4.6) indicates a need for a "keep-alive"
   mechanism.  This section specifies how the NETCONF keep-alive
   mechanism is to be implemented.

   Both SSH and TLS have the ability to support keep-alives.  Using
   these mechanisms, the keep-alive messages are sent inside the
   encrypted tunnel, thus thwarting spoof attacks.

4.1.  SSH

   The SSH keep-alive solution that is expected to be used when
   configured using the data model defined in this document is
   ubiquitous in practice, though never being explicitly defined in an
   RFC.  The strategy used is to purposely send a malformed request
   message with a flag set to ensure a response.  More specifically, per
   section 4 of [RFC4253], either SSH peer can send a
   SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST message with "want reply" set to '1' and that,
   if there is an error, will get back a SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE
   response.  Similarly, section 5 of [RFC4253] says that either SSH



Watsen & Schoenwaelder  Expires December 03, 2014              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     NETCONF Server Configuration Model          June 2014


   peer can send a SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST message with "want reply" set
   to '1' and that, if there is an error, will get back a
   SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE response.

   To ensure that the request will fail, current implementations send an
   invalid "request name" or "request type", respectively.  Abiding to
   the extensibility guidelines specified in Section 6 of [RFC4251],
   these implementations use the "name@domain".  For instance, when
   configured to send keep-alives, OpenSSH sends the string
   "keepalive@openssh.com".  In order to remain compatible with existing
   implementations, this draft does not require a specific "request
   name" or "request type" string be used.

4.2.  TLS

   The TLS keep-alive solution is defined in [RFC6520].  This solution
   allows both peers to advertise if they can receive heartbeat request
   messages from its peer.  For standard NETCONF over TLS connections,
   devices SHOULD advertise "peer_allowed_to_send", as per [RFC6520].
   This advertisement is not a "MUST" in order to grandfather existing
   NETCONF over TLS implementations.  For NETCONF over TLS Call Home,
   the network management system MUST advertise "peer_allowed_to_send"
   per [RFC6520].  This is a "MUST" so as to ensure devices can depend
   in it always being there for call home connections, which is
   conveniently when keep-alives are needed the most.

5.  User Authentication for TLS

5.1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF Server Module defined in this draft focuses on the
   configuration the SSH and TLS transports.  This module does not
   define a means to configure User Authentication, as that is a stated
   focus for [draft-ietf-netmod-system-mgmt], however, that draft does
   not define configuration nodes for TLS client authentication.  Thus,
   this draft also includes the following YANG module to augment TLS
   client authentication into the "ietf-system" module defined in
   [draft-ietf-netmod-system-mgmt].

5.2.  Data Model Overview

   This data model augments the "ietf-system" module defined in
   [draft-ietf-netmod-system-mgmt] by adding some configuration nodes
   under its "/system/authentication" subtree.

   module: ietf-system-tls-auth

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this memo are designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  Authorization for access to specific
   portions of conceptual data and operations within this module is
   provided by the NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC6536].

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the "ietf-netconf-server"
   and "ietf-system-tls-auth" YANG modules which are writable/creatable/
   deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).  These data
   nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  Write and read operations to these data nodes can have
   a negative effect on network operations.  It is thus important to
   control write and read access to these data nodes.  Below are the
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability.

   ietf-netconf-server:

   o  None.

   ietf-system-tls-auth:

   o  /system/authentication/tls/psk-maps/psk-map/user-name: This leaf
      node contains a user name that some deployments may consider
      sensitive information.

   o  /system/authentication/tls/psk-maps/psk-map/key: This leaf node
      contains a shared key that remote clients use to authenticate
      themselves to the system.  This value should not be readable or
      writable by anyone by default.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC2119].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-server
         Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
         XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-tle-auth
         Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
         XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

      name:         ietf-netconf-server
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-server
      prefix:       ncserver
      reference:    RFC XXXX

      name:         ietf-system-tls-auth
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system-tls-auth
      prefix:       sys-tls-auth
      reference:    RFC XXXX

8.  Other Considerations

   The YANG module define herein does not itself support virtual routing
   and forwarding (VRF).  It is expected that external modules will
   augment in VRF designations when needed.

Appendix D.  Change Log

D.1.  I-D to 00

   o  Changed title to "NETCONF Server Configuration Model"

   o  Mapped inbound/outbound to listen/call-home

   o  Restructured YANG module to place transport selection deeper into
      the tree, providing a more intuitive data model

   o  Added section "Keep-Alives for SSH and TLS"

   o  Updated the Security Considerations section

   o  Added text for supporting VRFs via augments

   o  Factored the TLS-AUTH config into another module augmenting the
      "ietf-system" module

D.2.  00 to 01

   o  Restructured document so it flows better

   o  Added trusted-ca-certs and trusted-client-certs objects into the
      ietf-system-tls-auth module

Appendix E.  Open Issues

   o  NETCONF implementations typically have config parameters such as
      session timeouts or hello timeouts.  Shall they be included in
      this model?

   o  Do we need knobs to enable/disable call-home without the need to
      remove all the call-home client configuration?
