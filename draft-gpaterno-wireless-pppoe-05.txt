Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs  December 2002


1. Introduction

   Current wireless LANs technologies provide a feeble security
   architecture that can be broken by motivated malicious users.
   Moreover, these technologies are not able to uniquely identify the
   user that is accessing the network: as a result, corporations, ISPs,
   and mobile operators are unable to apply appropriate rights and/or
   services to the end-users.

   This document proposes the adoption of the Point-To-Point Protocol
   over Ethernet as an authentication methodology in wireless LANs and
   as an additional security component.  Furthermore, it explores how
   consumers, corporations, ISPs, and mobile operators will benefit of
   the adoption of PPPoE as an alternative solution to IEEE 802.1X.


2. Current Wireless LANs scenario

   The need for mobility and network coverage in open spaces or places
   where cabling is difficult (such as airports, hospitals, warehouses
   or old buildings) has accelerated the development of Wireless
   alternatives.  Different technologies exist for transmitting data
   "over-the-air", for example GSM Packet Radio Service (GPRS),
   Bluetooth, and IEEE 801.11, also known as Wireless Ethernet or
   Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi).

2.1. Wireless standard IEEE 802.11 and security concerns

   The most successful technology in wireless LANs is IEEE 802.11 [10]
   for its easy configuration, flexibility and performance with low
   costs. In particular, the extension named IEEE 802.11b [15] (also
   referred to as 802.11 High Rate or Wi-Fi), was a 1999 ratification to
   the original 802.11 standard, allowing wireless functionality
   comparable to Ethernet.

   IEEE 802.11 focus mainly on Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC)
   and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications, but it specifies also an
   optional security feature in the form of encryption, named the Wired
   Equivalent Privacy (WEP).  WEP was initially developed to give to the
   end user the same protection as the wired network. Recent studies,
   such as [9] and [11], demonstrated that a malicious user might gain
   access to the network by breaking the WEP keys and without supplying
   any credential. WEP is based on the RC4 [17] encryption algorithm, a
   function that generates a pseudo-random infinitive streaming cypher
   by suppling two arguments: the actual WEP keys (referred as K), that
   might be 40 or 128 bytes long, and the Initial Vector (IV), that is
   24 bytes long.  Each IEEE 802.11 frame payload contains both the IV
   in clear and the cyphertext: the cyphertext is obtained by applying



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs  December 2002


   XOR between the RC4(IV,K) resulting stream and the clear text.
   Moreover when a frame is transmitted a new IV is generated: as the IV
   has 16777216 of possible values (2^24), the number of IV would be
   repeated (i.e. collide) every 5 hours by constantly transmitting at
   11 Mb/s.  With about 1500 IV collisions, and with a probabilistic
   attack to the RC4 algorithm, it is possible to decrypt the
   transmission and derive the original WEP keys.  The document [12]
   help understanding the RC4 algorithm weaknesses, and [11] explains
   how can be applied to break WEP.

   The Wired Equivalent Privacy gives therefore a false security feeling
   to the end-user: sensitive data that is not encrypted in the
   presentation layer, through SSL for example, would be easily
   eavesdropped.

   Using layer 3 network addresses over the wireless LAN raises also
   some concerns. For example the use of DHCP might represent a
   disadvantage for those service providers that are unable to identify
   a specific user, typically for authorisation and accounting purposes.
   We must also consider that, once a malicious user gains access to the
   WEP keys, DHCP immediately gives an IP address and network
   information to the intruder (DNS, WINS, routing, etc.).

   Many manufacturers of APs introduced another security feature by
   providing the ability to identify the MAC addresses of network cards
   permitted to use the AP, also known as MAC filtering.  The use of MAC
   addresses introduces some issues, one of manageability: if a user
   changes the wireless adapter, for example to replace a broken one,
   he/she should contact the ISP and provide the new MAC address.
   Another issue is that MAC addresses can be changed easily and guessed
   by malicious users to gain access to the Wireless LAN.

2.2. Existing authentication methodologies

   The IEEE 802.1X standard [2], based on Extensive Authentication
   Protocol Over Lan (EAPOL), has been proposed to address the security
   concerns of Wireless LANs. The protocol has been designed to provide
   user authentication for both wireless and wireline LANs, giving to
   the corporations the opportunity to provide their users with
   personalised services such as grouping in specific Virtual LANs.

   While the enhancements proposed by both IEEE 802.1X and the work-in-
   progress IEEE 802.11i could improve the security of 802.11 networks,
   these solutions come out of the market too late, causing impatient
   vendors to implement proprietary solutions. These vendors may not be
   willing to replace these proprietary fixes with 802.11i as it becomes
   available.




G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs  December 2002


   Many of the high-end AP manufacturers anyway embraced the IEEE 802.1X
   standard, sometimes with proprietary extensions: although 802.1X
   provides flexibility and extended LAN support, purchasing compliant
   hardware is still an expensive solution for small businesses and
   consumers. In fact, as of today, many of the Wireless Access Points
   and hub/switches do not support EAPOL.  Furthermore, many 802.1X
   compliant hardware do not implement the dynamic WEP-key exchange
   feature [2] (EAPOL-Key), adding potential security issues.

   Most consumers, small ISPs and small corporations will not be able to
   afford such equipment, but are nevertheless in need of security and
   of being able to identify users that are accessing their resources:
   in fact, some malicious users today are gaining access to home users'
   equipment through WLANs in order to attack remote sites and preserve
   their anonymity.

   It is also to be considered that many of ISPs and mobile operators
   are not interested in implementing encryption to their customer, for
   example for public Internet access, nevertheless they are in need to
   identify the user for billing purposes.  The ideal solution for ISPs
   and mobile operators would be able to integrate with the existing
   dial-up infrastructure (modem, GPRS, etc) with little effort, and
   should bring the same subscrbed services (fixed IP address, Quality
   of Service, etc) to the end user.


3. Proposed solution

3.1. A layered approach

   As suggested by the OSI specifications, a good solution might be the
   adoption of a layered approach, focusing on specific aspects of a
   given layer.  By analysing physical/data link, authentication, and
   encryption separately the advantage is that the resulting framework
   would allow changes in one layer to occur without affecting the other
   layers. As Wireless LANs, including IEEE 802.11, will evolve and new
   standards become available, authentication and encryption will remain
   unchanged or vice versa.

   The schema below summaries the proposed authentication layer and the
   resulting framework:

3.2. The authentication layer: PPPoE

   With the introduction of cable and ADSL technologies, ISPs have
   adopted a methodology for resolving the authentication layer problem
   for the broadband world.

   In standard configuration, these technologies are able to emulate an
   ethernet network. Although DHCP is easy to deploy for a Service
   Provider, and to configure from an user perspective, it does not
   provide a way to authenticate the user, and therefore cannot be used
   for accounting or authorization.

   This need was solved with the introduction of the Point-To-Point over
   Ethernet protocol (PPPoE), described in [1].  Through the adoption of
   this protocol, access control, billing, and several type of services
   can be performed on a per-user, rather than a per-site or cell basis.

   The 802.11 technology, in a similar way to the previous broadband
   technologies, is able to emulate the ethernet network.  The idea then
   is to apply PPPoE technology to Wireless LANs. The advantage is
   clear: consumers, corporations, Internet Service Providers, and
   mobile operators can perform authentication, authorisation, and
   accounting easily on the wireless users without adding new components
   and, more importantly, with little effort.

   A practical aspect of this technology might be to provide, for
   example, fixed IP addresses to a roaming wireless user: wherever the
   user is located, he/she can have his/her IP address and subscribed
   class of services.



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs  December 2002


   Furthermore, the use of PPP will introduce another obstacle to
   malicious users, that would have to break both the WEP and the PPP
   layer to gain access to the IP-based network. It is envisaged that
   passwords must not be exchanged through the Password Authentication
   Protocol (PAP), since PAP transmit passwords in cleartext: a stronger
   protocol such as MS-CHAPv2 [4], EAP-TLS [5] or better should be used
   instead.

   From a traditional ISP and corporations perspective, there is no
   additional benefit in using PPPoE technology, if compared to IEEE
   802.1X: the concerns of using PPPoE are the PPP frame overhead and
   the MTU size.  However, one aspect must be considered when deploying
   IEEE 802.1X: current implementations are based on EAP-TLS [5].
   Although EAP-TLS is the perfect choice for corporations that already
   deployed X.509 certificates, it is not for ISPs, mobile operators and
   corporations that do not own or plan to have an X.509 infrastructure.
   Creating and maintaining a PKI infrastructure is expensive,
   expecially if a public Certification Authority is used, and requires
   expert human resources dedicated to the PKI.  Moreover, if the ISP or
   corporate already owns non 802.1X compliant Access Points, such
   hardware should be replaced.

   Another advantage of embracing PPPoE for Network Access Provider
   (NAP) or Network Service Provider (NSP) is that they can provide
   secure access to a corporate gateway, by using Layer 3 routing, Layer
   2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and/or IPSec tunnels in a similar way of
   existing dial-up scenarios (modem, ISDN, ADSL, etc..).  This makes
   the business model of selling wholesale services and Virtual Private
   Dial-up Networks (VPDNs) scalable.

   For consumers, small businesses, and local ISPs the PPPoE MTU
   limitation is not an issue, if compared to the cost of deploying both
   hardware and EAPOL compliant software to the client. The advantage is
   that, by preserving the existing access points and with a simple
   additional component (the PPPoE server), they are able to protect
   their LANs by identifying uniquely the user. As a result, adding a
   PPPoE server is easier than deploying EAPOL with EAP-TLS, that
   requires a more complex infrastructure. Moreover, most of today's
   operating systems include a PPPoE client, resulting in a low cost
   deployment for this technology.

   Finally, Access Point manufacturers can easily embed a PPPoE server
   in their products, that might be distributed as a firmware update,
   and provide an easy user configuration to the consumer, for example
   through a web interface.

   It has been mentioned in the former paragraphs that the use of PPPoE
   has an Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issue: as specified in [1],



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs  December 2002


   the Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) option must not be negotiated to a
   size larger than 1492; Ethernet has a maximum payload size of 1500
   octets. The PPPoE header is 6 octets and the PPP protocol ID is 2
   octets, so that the PPP MTU must not be greater than 1492.  However,
   based on the author's experience, some misbehaved VPN software
   packages add their own overhead to the MTU reported by the PPPoE
   interface, making the network packets too large to pass through a PPP
   over Ethernet connection: reducing the MTU by 32 bytes to 1460 should
   generally suffice.

3.3. The encryption layer

   A Wireless LAN, being over the air, might be considered a public
   switched network, in a similar way of the telephone network. For
   example, in the traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), a
   malicious user intercept PPP packets by tapping the phone wire. The
   Wireless LAN can be managed therefore as a dial-up connection and
   encryption and/or access policies should be applied, such as
   protecting the access through a firewall or a proxy, allowing only
   specific applications.

   It is recommended that users that need privacy should add an
   encryption layer on top of their connection, be a wireless LAN or a
   standard PPP over modem.  There can be different approaches for this
   layer: a simple, but efficient solution for companies, ISPs and
   mobile operators can be the Microsoft Point-To-Point Encryption
   Protocol [6] PPP extension.

   MPPE is an optional PPP extension that is negotiated within option 18
   [16] in the Compression Control Protocol, and uses the Rivest-Shamir-
   Adleman (RSA) RC4 [17] algorithm to provide data confidentiality.
   MPPE can use 40-bit, 56-bit, or 128-bit encryption keys: the 40-bit
   key provides backward compatibility with old clients. It was
   originally designed for encryption across a point-to-point link where
   packets arrive in the same order in which they were sent with little
   packet loss.

   For environments that requires stronger privacy, it is recommended to
   use other encryption methodologies to access  the corporate LAN, such
   as for example IPSec [7], the de-facto standard Point-to-Point
   Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) [8], or future encryption technologies.

4. An architecture example

   In the previous chapter, the Wireless LAN has been compared to a
   dial-up infrastructure from a security perspective. Using this
   similarity, a typical corporate scenario can be analysed as an
   example.

      |           |    +------------------+  +---------------+
      |           +----| Internal Proxy   |--| Radius Server |
      |                +------------------+  +---------------+
   +----------+
   | Intranet |
   +----------+


   We mentioned that remote access systems, such as modems, are subject
   to "wardialing", i.e. the attempt of a malicious user of guessing the
   modem telephone number and accessing the corporate network. Today,
   most of the corporate IT security policies do not allow to connect a
   modem and an analogue phone line to internally connected computers.
   In a security infrastructure, dial-up users are usually subject to an
   IP-based inspection (using a firewall or access lists for example) to
   limit access to corporate resources.  While creating a security
   policy, dial-up user are usually considered more "trusted" than
   global Internet users, since appropriate credentials should be
   required.




G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs  December 2002


   In the example above, a border firewall separates global Internet
   access from both externally visible services (DNS, Mail, Proxy,
   etc..)  and remote access users, creating two demilitarised zones,
   DMZ1 and DMZ2 respectively. DMZ2 should be more secure than the
   external services, that can be compromised by a malicious user: this
   zone is suitable for dial-up (be a RAS server or outsourcing through
   a Virtual Private Dial-up Network) and Wireless LANs user, that
   should supply credential to gain access to IP-based network.

   Once a dial-up/wireless user has obtained access, a second firewall
   connects the DMZ2 to a DMZ3 and the corporate Intranet. DMZ3 hosts a
   RADIUS server to authenticate users, an internal proxy and a VPN
   concentrator, if not included with the firewall. The VPN concentrator
   implements the encryption layer, offering a secure connection to the
   Intranet. An optional data flow, if encrypted, can be established
   from DMZ2 to the Intranet, for example IMAPS or HTTPS, so that VPN
   will be required only for specific unencrypted applications, such as
   TN3270E mainframe access.

5. Conclusions

   At the time of writing, it is extremely easy from a malicious users
   perspective to gain access to wireless networks, even if encrypted.
   Many Wireless LANs are unencrypted and their access points are
   configured to release dynamic IP address through the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol. In such a configuration, it is even easier
   for an intruder to gain access to the network. Moreover, this raises
   some legal concerns: in some countries it is not illegal to gain
   access to a network that is not protected in any way or limited
   through a warning statement, for example through the usual
   "restricted area" banner, because the user is not accessing the
   Wireless LAN by "forcing" the system.

   Public services, such as mobile operators, ISPs, and free wireless
   networks, will not take advantage of any evolution of the WEP
   protocol. Today the encryption keys are unique for the whole Wireless
   LAN segment, which means that keys should be made publically
   available, in turn making the WEP protection mechanism ineffective.

   For consumers and corporations, using WEP or future protocols to
   encrypt "over-the-air" transmission is still an advantage: although
   easy to decrypt, the intruder should be very motivated to enter the
   network because an observation of thousands of interesting packets is
   needed to gain access to the encryption keys.

   Through this paper the author analyses the advantages of using Point-
   To-Point over Ethernet protocol as a solution for a Wireless LAN
   authentication layer: it has been demonstrated that, through the

   reuse of existing elements of the network and without changing the
   existing infrastructure, consumers, corporations and Internet Service
   Providers can take advantage of PPPoE, resulting in a more secure
   environment with no or little additional cost.

   After a draft of this document was released to the public, some
   implementations of PPPoE authentication were deployed, demonstrating
   the willingness to implement this methodology: in fact, some premier
   universities, government institutions  and private users, including
   free access city wireless networks, implemented the PPPoE solutions
   for their Wireless LANs.
