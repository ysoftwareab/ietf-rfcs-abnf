Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism and a document format that
   enables Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers to
   send "mounting" information to a WebDAV client.  The protocol is
   designed to work on any platform and with any combination of browser
   and WebDAV client, relying solely on the well-understood dispatch of
   documents through their MIME type.

Internet-Draft           Mounting WebDAV servers             August 2005


1.  Introduction

   By definition, a WebDAV server ([RFC2518]) is an HTTP server as well
   ([RFC2616]).  Most WebDAV servers can be (at least partly) operated
   from an HTML-based user interface in a web browser.  However, it is
   frequently desirable to be able to switch from an HTML-based view to
   a presentation provided by a native WebDAV client, directly
   supporting the authoring features defined in WebDAV and related
   specifications.

   For completeness, Appendix A lists other approaches that have been
   implemented in existing clients.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used here follows and extends that in the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol specification [RFC2518].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([XML]) as a purely notational
   convention.  In particular:

   o  Element names use the namespace
      "http://purl.org/NET/webdav/mount".  When an XML element type in
      this namespace is referenced in this document outside of the
      context of an XML fragment, the string "dm:" will be prefixed to
      the element name.

   o  Element ordering is irrelevant.

   o  Extension elements/attributes (elements/attributes not already
      defined as valid child elements) may be added anywhere, except
      when explicitly stated otherwise.


3.  Format

   A WebDAV mount request is encoded in a specific XML format ([XML])
   with a well-defined MIME type (see Section 6.1).  The MIME type
   allows user agents to dispatch the content to a handler specific to
   the system's WebDAV client.

   The elements defined below use the namespace
   "http://purl.org/NET/webdav/mount".

   <!ELEMENT mount (url, open?, username?) >

   <!ELEMENT url (#PCDATA) >
   <!-- PCDATA value: scheme ":" hier-part, as defined in section 3 of
        [RFC3986] -->

   <!ELEMENT open (#PCDATA) >
   <!-- PCDATA value: path, as defined in section 3 of
        [RFC3986] -->

   <!ELEMENT username (#PCDATA) >


3.1  dm:mount

   The <dm:mount> element acts as container for all the remaining
   elements defined by this protocol.

3.2  dm:url

   The mandatory <dm:url> element provides the HTTP URL of the WebDAV
   collection that should be mounted by the client.

3.3  dm:open

   The optional <dm:open> element instructs the client to display the
   specified child collection; it's URL is computed by concatenating
   this element's value with the URL obtained from the <dm:url>
   (Section 3.2) element.

3.4  dm:username

   The server can use the optional <dm:username> element to specify the
   name of the authenticated principal.  A client can use this value to
   select a matching mount point (different users may have mounted the
   URL with different credentials under different local mount points) or
   to provide a meaningful default for a authentication dialogue.

4.  Example

   In the example below, the server instructs the user agent to mount
   the WebDAV URL "http://www.example.com/documents" in it's WebDAV
   client, and then to display the contents the child collection
   "/user42/inbox", identified by the URL
   ""http://www.example.com/documents/user42/inbox".

   >> Request:

   GET /Coll/&mount-me HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com

   >> Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/davmount+xml
   Content-Length: xxx

   <dm:mount xmlns:dm="http://purl.org/NET/webdav/mount">
     <dm:url>http://www.example.com/documents</dm:url>
     <dm:open>/user42/inbox</dm:open>
   </dm:mount>


5.  Internationalization Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new internationalization
   considerations beyond those discussed in [RFC2518], Section 16.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1  MIME type registration

   MIME media type name:

      application

   MIME subtype name:

      davmount+xml

   Mandatory parameters:

      none

   Optional parameters:

      "charset": This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
      parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in
      [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:

      Identical to those of "application/xml" as described in [RFC3023],
      section 3.2.

Internet-Draft           Mounting WebDAV servers             August 2005


   Security considerations:

      As defined in this specification.  In addition, as this media type
      uses the "+xml" convention, it shares the same security
      considerations as described in [RFC3023], section 10.

   Interoperability considerations:

      There are no known interoperability issues.

   Published specification:

      This specification.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):

         As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC3023], section 3.2.

      File extension:

         .davmount

      Fragment identifiers:

         As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC3023], section 5.

      Base URI:

         As specified in [RFC3023], section 6.

      Macintosh File Type code:

         TEXT

   Person and email address to contact for further information:

   Intended usage:

      COMMON

7.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations connected to HTTP/WebDAV and XML apply
   for this specification as well, namely [RFC2518] (Section 17) and
   [RFC3470] (Section 7).

   In addition, client implementors must be careful when implementing
   the <dm:open> element (see Section 3.3).  It MUST NOT be used to
   initiate any action beyond displaying the contents of a WebDAV
   collection.

Appendix A.  Alternative approaches

A.1  ...through HTML/CSS extensions

   Microsoft Internet Explorer implements a CSS extension that allows
   switching to it's own WebDAV client ("Webfolder", see <http://
   msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/behaviors/reference/behaviors/
   anchor.asp>).  However, at the time of this writing this extension
   was not implemented by any other user agent.

A.2  ...through custom URI schemes

   The "kio" library of the "K Desktop Enviroment"
   (<http://www.kde.org/>) uses the URI scheme "webdav" to dispatch to
   the system's WebDAV client.  This URI scheme is not registered, nor
   supported on other platforms.  Furthermore, W3C's "Architecture of
   the World Wide Web, Volume One" explicitly advises against defining
   new schemes when existing schemes can be used:

      "A specification SHOULD reuse an existing URI scheme (rather than
      create a new one) when it provides the desired properties of
      identifiers and their relation to resources."

   (see [WEBARCH], Section 2.4)
