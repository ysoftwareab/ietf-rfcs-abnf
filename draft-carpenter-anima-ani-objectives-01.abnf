   The parties will negotiate until one side proposes a single BRSKI
   method and the other side accepts.  In the simplest case of immediate
   acceptance, there will only be two messages (Request Negotiate and
   End Negotiate).  The locator (IP address, IP protocol number, port
   number) used for the negotiation will be available for the subsequent
   BRSKI operations, if required.
