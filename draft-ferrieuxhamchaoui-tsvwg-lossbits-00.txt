             Packet Loss Signaling for Encrypted Protocols
               draft-ferrieuxhamchaoui-tsvwg-lossbits-00

Abstract

   This document describes a protocol-independent method that employs
   two bits to allow endpoints to signal packet loss in a way that can
   be used by network devices to measure and locate the source of the
   loss.  The signaling method applies to all protocols with a protocol-
   specific way to identify packet loss.  The method is especially
   valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport header and
   do not allow an alternative method for loss detection.

1.  Introduction

   Packet loss is a pervasive problem of day-to-day network operation,
   and proactively detecting, measuring, and locating it is crucial to
   maintaining high QoS and timely resolution of crippling end-to-end
   throughput issues.  To this effect, in a TCP-dominated world, network
   operators have been heavily relying on information present in the
   clear in TCP headers: sequence and acknowledgment numbers, and SACK
   when enabled.  These allow for quantitative estimation of packet loss
   by passive on-path observation, and the lossy segment (upstream or
   downstream from the observation point) can be quickly identified by
   moving the passive observer around.

   With encrypted protocols, the equivalent transport headers are
   encrypted and passive packet loss observation is not possible, as
   described in [TRANSPORT-ENCRYPT].

   Since encrypted protocols could be routed by the network differently,
   and the fraction of Internet traffic delivered using encrypted
   protocols is increasing every year, it is imperative to measure

   packet loss experienced by encrypted protocol users directly instead
   of relying on measuring TCP loss between similar endpoints.

   Following the recommendation in [RFC8558] of making path signals
   explicit, this document proposes adding two explicit loss bits to the
   clear portion of the protocol headers to restore network operators'
   ability to maintain high QoS for users of encrypted protocols.  These
   bits can be added to an unencrypted portion of a header belonging to
   any protocol layer, e.g. two most significant its of the TTL field in
   IP (see [IP]) and IPv6 (see [IPv6]) headers or reserved bits in a
   QUIC v1 header (see [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Loss Bits

   The proposal introduces two bits that are to be present in every
   packet capable of loss reporting.  These are packets that include
   protocol headers with the loss bits.  Only loss of packets capable of
   loss reporting is reported using loss bits.

   Whenever this specification refers to packets, it is referring only
   to packets capable of loss reporting.

   -  Q: The "sQuare signal" bit is toggled every N outgoing packets as
      explained below in Section 3.1.

   -  L: The "Loss event" bit is set to 0 or 1 according to the
      Unreported Loss counter, as explained below in Section 3.2.

   Each endpoint maintains appropriate counters independently and
   separately for each connection (each subflow for multipath
   connections).

3.1.  Setting the sQuare Bit on Outgoing Packets

   The sQuare Value is initialized to the Initial Q Value (0 or 1) and
   is reflected in the Q bit of every outgoing packet.  The sQuare value
   is inverted after sending every N packets (Q Period is 2*N).

   The choice of the Initial Q Value and Q Period is determined by the
   protocol containing Q and L bits.  For example, the values can be
   protocol constants (e.g "Initial Q Value" is 0, and "Q Period" is
   128), or they can be set explicitly for each connection (e.g.

Internet-Draft                  loss-bits                      July 2019


   "Initial Q Value" is whatever value the initial packet has, and "Q
   Period" is set per a dedicated TCP option on SYN and SYN/ACK).

   Observation points can estimate the upstream losses by counting the
   number of packets during a half period of the square signal, as
   described in Section 4.

3.2.  Setting the Loss Event Bit on Outgoing Packets

   The Unreported Loss counter is initialized to 0, and L bit of every
   outgoing packet indicates whether the Unreported Loss counter is
   positive (L=1 if the counter is positive, and L=0 otherwise).

   The value of the Unreported Loss counter is decremented every time a
   packet with L=1 is sent.

   The value of the Unreported Loss counter is incremented for every
   packet that the protocol declares lost, using whatever loss detection
   machinery the protocol employs.  If the protocol is able to rescind
   the loss determination later, the Unreported Loss counter SHOULD NOT
   be decremented due to the rescission.

   Observation points can estimate the end-to-end loss, as determined by
   the upstream endpoint's loss detection machinery, by counting packets
   in this direction with a L bit equal to 1, as described in Section 4.

4.  Using the Loss Bits for Passive Loss Measurement

   There are three sources of observable loss:

   -  _upstream loss_ - loss between the sender and the observation
      point (Section 4.2)

   -  _downstream loss_ - loss between the observation point and the
      destination (Section 4.4)

   -  _observer loss_ - loss by the observer itself that does not cause
      downstream loss (Section 4.5)

   The upstream and downstream loss together constitute _end-to-end
   loss_ (Section 4.1).

   The Q and L bits allow detection and measurement of the types of loss
   listed above.

4.1.  End-To-End Loss

   The Loss Event bit allows an observer to calculate the end-to-end
   loss rate by counting packets with L bit value of 0 and 1 for a given
   connection.  The end-to-end loss rate is the fraction of packets with
   L=1.

   The simplifying assumption here is that upstream loss affects packets
   with L=0 and L=1 equally.  This may be a simplification, if some loss
   is caused by tail-drop in a network device.  If the sender congestion
   controller reduces the packet send rate after loss, there may be a
   sufficient delay before sending packets with L=1 that they have a
   greater chance of arriving at the observer.

4.2.  Upstream Loss

   Blocks of N (half of Q Period) consecutive packets are sent with the
   same value of the Q bit, followed by another block of N packets with
   inverted value of the Q bit.  Hence, knowing the value of N, an on-
   path observer can estimate the amount of loss after observing at
   least N packets.  The upstream loss rate is an average number of
   packets in a block of packets with the same Q value divided by N.

   The observer needs to be able to tolerate packet reordering that can
   blur the edges of the square signal.

   The Q Period needs to be chosen carefully, since the observation
   could become too unreliable in case of packet reordering and loss if
   Q Period is too small.  However, when Q Period is too large, short
   connections may not yield a useful upstream loss measurement.

   The observer needs to differentiate packets as belonging to different
   connections, since they use independent counters.

4.3.  Correlating End-to-End and Upstream Loss

   Upstream loss is calculated by observing the actual packets that did
   not suffer the upstream loss.  End-to-end loss, however, is
   calculated by observing subsequent packets after the sender's
   protocol detected the loss.  Hence, end-to-end loss is generally
   observed with a delay of between 1 RTT (loss declared due to multiple
   duplicate acknowledgments) and 1 RTO (loss declared due to a timeout)
   relative to the upstream loss.

   The connection RTT can sometimes be estimated by timing protocol
   handshake messages.  This RTT estimate can be greatly improved by
   observing a dedicated protocol mechanism for conveying RTT
   information, such as the Latency Spin bit of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

Internet-Draft                  loss-bits                      July 2019


   Whenever the observer needs to perform a computation that uses both
   upstream and end-to-end loss rate measurements, it SHOULD use
   upstream loss rate leading the end-to-end loss rate by approximately
   1 RTT.  If the observer is unable to estimate RTT of the connection,
   it should accumulate loss measurements over time periods of at least
   4 times the typical RTT for the observed connections.

   If the calculated upstream loss rate exceeds the end-to-end loss rate
   calculated in Section 4.1, then either the Q Period is too short for
   the amount of packet reordering or there is observer loss, described
   in Section 4.5.  If this happens, the observer SHOULD adjust the
   calculated upstream loss rate to match end-to-end loss rate.

4.4.  Downstream Loss

   Because downstream loss affects only those packets that did not
   suffer upstream loss, the end-to-end loss rate ("e") relates to the
   upstream loss rate ("u") and downstream loss rate ("d") as
   "(1-u)(1-d)=1-e".  Hence, "d=(e-u)/(1-u)".

4.5.  Observer Loss

   A typical deployment of a passive observation system includes a
   network tap device that mirrors network packets of interest to a
   device that performs analysis and measurement on the mirrored
   packets.  The observer loss is the loss that occurs on the mirror
   path.

   Observer loss affects upstream loss rate measurement since it causes
   the observer to account for fewer packets in a block of identical Q
   bit values (see {{upstreamloss)}).  The end-to-end loss rate
   measurement, however, is unaffected by the observer loss, since it is
   a measurement of the fraction of packets with the set L bit value,
   and the observer loss would affect all packets equally (see
   Section 4.1).

   The need to adjust the upstream loss rate down to match end-to-end
   loss rate as described in Section 4.3 is a strong indication of the
   observer loss, whose magnitude is between the amount of such
   adjustment and the entirety of the upstream loss measured in
   Section 4.2.

5.  Ossification Considerations

   Accurate loss information is not critical to the operation of any
   protocol, though its presence for a sufficient number of connections
   is important for the operation of the networks.




Ferrieux, et al.         Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  loss-bits                      July 2019


   The loss bits are amenable to "greasing" described in [GREASE], if
   the protocol designers are not ready to dedicate (and ossify) bits
   used for loss reporting to this function.  The greasing could be
   accomplished similarly to the Latency Spin bit greasing in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Namely, implementations could decide that a
   fraction of connections should not encode loss information in the
   loss bits and, instead, the bits would be set to arbitrary values.
   The observers would need to be ready to ignore connections with loss
   information more resembling noise than the expected signal.

6.  Security Considerations

   Passive loss observation has been a part of the network operations
   for a long time, so exposing loss information to the network does not
   add new security concerns.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Guarding user's privacy is an important goal for modern protocols and
   protocol extensions per [RFC7285].  While an explicit loss signal - a
   preferred way to share loss information per [RFC8558] - helps to
   minimize unintentional exposure of additional information,
   implementations of loss reporting must ensure that loss information
   does not compromise protocol's privacy goals.

   For example, [QUIC-TRANSPORT] allows changing Connection IDs in the
   middle of a connection to reduce the likelihood of a passive observer
   linking old and new subflows to the same device.  A QUIC
   implementation would need to reset all counters when it changes
   Connection ID used for outgoing packets.  It would also need to avoid
   incrementing Unreported Loss counter for loss of packets sent with a
   different Connection ID.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   proposals for loss measurement.
