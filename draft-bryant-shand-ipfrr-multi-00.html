<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>IP Fast Reroute (IPFRR) work in the IETF has focused on the single
      failure case, where the failure could be a link, a node or a shared risk
      link group. This draft describes possible extensions to not-via IPFRR
      that under some circumstances allow the repair of multiple simultaneous
      failures.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Work on IP fast reroute (IPFRR) in the IETF<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-framework'>Framework<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shand, M. and S.

Previdi, &ldquo;IP Fast Reroute Using Not-via Addresses,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [2] has so far
      been restricted to the case of repair of a single failure. The single
      failure cases considere are a single link, a single node or a shared
      risk link group (SRLG). IPFRR repair of multiple simultaneous failures
      which are not members of a known SRLG have not been addressed because of
      concerns that the use of multiple concurrent repairs may result in
      looping repair paths. In order to prevent such loops, the current
      definition of IPFRR using not-via requires that packets addressed to a
      not-via address are not repaired but instead are dropped.
</p>
<p>It is possible that a network may experience multiple simultaneous
      failures. This may be due to simple statistical effects, but the more
      likely cause is unanticipated SRLGs. When multiple failures which are
      not part of an anticipated group are detected, repairs are abandoned and
      the network reverts to normal convergence. Although safe, this approach
      is somewhat draconian, since there are many circumstances were multiple
      repairs do not induce loops.
</p>
<p>This Internet draft explores the properties of multiple unrelated
      failures and proposes some methods that may be used to address this
      problem using not-via techniques.

      LFA or downstream routes may be incorporated, and will be dealt with

<p>Figure 2: Concatenated Repairs
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There are three cases to consider:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>1) Consider the general case of a pair of protected links A-B and
          X-Y as shown in the network fragment shown Figure 1. If the repair
          path for A-B does not traverse X-Y and the repair path for X-Y does
          not traverse A-B, this case is completely safe and will not cause
          looping or packet loss.
</p>
<p>A more common variation of this case is shown in Figure 2, which
          shows two failures in different parts of the network in which a
          packet from A to D traverses two concatenated repairs.
</p>
<p>2) In Figure 1, the repair for A-B traverses X-Y, but the repair
          for X-Y does not traverse A-B. This case occurs when the not-via
          path from A to B traverses link X-Y, but the not-via path from X to
          Y traverses some path not shown in Figure 1. In standard not-via the
          repaired packet for A-B would be dropped when it reached X-Y, since
          the repair of repaired packets is currently forbidden. However, if
          this packet were allowed to be repaired, the path to D would be
          complete and no harm would be done, although two levels of
          encapsulation would be required.
</p>
<p>3) The repair for A-B traverses X-Y AND the repair for X-Y
          traverses A-B. In this case unrestricted repair would result in
          looping packets and increasing levels of encapsulation.
</p>
</blockquote><p> The challenge in applying IPFRR to a network that is
      undergoing multiple failures is, therefore, to identify which of these
      cases exist in the network and react accordingly.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Outline Solution</h3>

<p>When A is computing the not-via repair path for A-B (i.e. the path
      for packets addressed to Ba, read as "B not-via A") it is aware of the
      list of nodes which this path traverses. This can be recorded by a
      simple addition to the SPF process, and the not-via addresses associated
      with each forward link can be determined. If the path were A, F, X, Y,
      G, B, (Figure 1) the list of not-via addresses would be: Fa, Xf, Yx, Gy,
      Bg. Under standard not-via operation, A would populate its FIB such that
      all normal addresses normally reachable via A-B would be encapsulated to
      Ba when A-B fails, but traffic addressed to any not-via address arriving
      at A would be dropped. The new procedure modifies this such that any
      traffic for a not-via address normally reachable over A-B is also
      encapsulated to Ba unless the not-via address is one of those previously
      identified as being on the path to Ba, for example Yx, in which case the
      packet is dropped.
</p>
<p>The above procedure allows cases 1 and 2 above to be repaired, while
      preventing the loop which would result from case 3.
</p>
<p>Note that this is accomplished by pre-computing the required FIB
      entries, and does not require any detailed packet inspection. The same
      result could be achieved by checking for multiple levels of
      encapsulation and dropping any attempt to triple encapsulate. However,
      this would require more detailed inspection of the packet, and causes
      difficulties when more than 2 &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; failures are
      contemplated.
</p>
<p>So far we have permitted benign repairs to coexist, albeit sometimes
      requiring multiple encapsulation. Note that in many cases there will be
      no performance impact since unless both failures are on the same node,
      the two encapsulations or two decapsulations will be performed at
      different nodes. There is however the issue of the MTU impact of
      multiple encapsulations.
</p>
<p>In the following section we consider the various strategies that may
      be applied to case 3 - mutual repairs that would loop.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Looping Repairs</h3>

<p>In case 3, the simplest approach is to simply not install repairs for
      repair paths that might loop. In this case, although the potentially
      looping traffic is dropped, the traffic is not repaired. If we assume
      that a hold-down is applied before reconvergence in case the link
      failure was just a short glitch, and if a loop free convergence
      mechanism further delays convergence, then the traffic will be dropped
      for an extended period. In these circumstances it would be better to
      &ldquo;abandon all hope&rdquo; (AAH)
      [&lt;draft-bryant-francois-shand-ipfrr-aah-00.txt&gt;] and immediately
      invoke normal re-convergence.
</p>
<p>Note that it is not sufficient to expedite the issuance of an LSP
      reporting the failure, since this may be treated as a permitted
      simultaneous failure by the oFIB algorithm. It is therefore necessary to
      explicitly trigger an oFIB AAH.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Dropping Looping Packets</h3>

<p>One approach to case 3 is to allow the repair, and to
        experimentally discover the incompatibility of the repairs if and when
        they occur. With this method we permit the repair in case 3 and
        trigger AAH when a packet drop count on the not-via address has been
        incremented. Alternatively, it is possible to wait until the LSP
        describing the change is issued normally (i.e. when X announces the
        failure of X-Y). When the repairing node A, which has precomputed that
        X-Y failures are mutually incompatible with its own repairs receives
        this LSP it can then issue the AAH. This has the disadvantage that it
        doesn&rsquo;t overcome the hold-down delay, but it requires no
        &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; operation, and it still has the required
        effect of abandoning the oFIB which is probably the longer of the
        delays (although with signalled oFIB this should be sub-second).
</p>
<p>Whilst both of the experimental approaches described above are
        feasible, they tend to induce AAH in the presence of otherwise
        feasible repairs, and they are contrary to the philosophy of repair
        pre-determination that has been applied to existing IPFRR
        solutions.

Computing non-looping Repairs of Repairs</h3>

<p>An alternative approach to simply dropping the looping packets, or
        to detecting the loop after it has occurred, is to use secondary
        SRLGs. With a link state routing protocol it is possible to precompute
        the incompatibility of the repairs in advance and to compute an
        alternative SRLG repair path. Although this does considerably increase
        the computational complexity it may be possible to compute repair
        paths that avoid the need to simply drop the offending packets.
</p>
<p>This approach requires us to identify the mutually incompatible
        failures, and advertise them as &ldquo;secondary SRLGs&rdquo;. When
        computing the repair paths for the affected not-via addresses these
        links are simultaneously failed. Note that the assumed simultaneous
        failure and resulting repair path only applies to the repair path
        computed for the conflicting not-via addresses, and is not used for
        normal addresses. Note that this implies that although there will be a
        longer repair path when there is more than one failure, if there is a
        single failure the repair path length will be "normal".
</p>
<p>Ideally we would wish to only invoke secondary SRLG computation
        when we are sure that the repair paths are mutually incompatible.
        Consider the case of node A in figure 1. A first identifies that the
        repair path for A-B is via F-X-Y-G-B. It then explores this path
        determining the repair path for each link in the path. Thus, for
        example, it performs a check at X by running an SPF rooted at X with
        the X-Y link removed to determine whether A-B is indeed on X's repair
        path for packets addressed to Yx.
</p>
<p>Some optimizations are possible in this calculation, which appears
        at first sight to be order hk (where h is the average hop length of
        repair paths and k is the average number of neighbours of a router).
        When A is computing its set of repair paths, it does so for all its k
        neighbours. In each case it identifies a list of node pairs traversed
        by each repair. These lists may often have one or more node pairs in
        common, so the actual number of link failures which require
        investigation is the union of these sets. It is then necessary to run
        an SPF rooted at the first node of each pair (the first node because
        the pairings are ordered representing the direction of the path), with
        the link to the second node removed. This SPF, while not an
        incremental, can be terminated as soon as the not-via address is
        reached. For example, when running the SPF rooted at X, with the link
        X-Y removed, the SPF can be terminated when Yx is reached. Once the
        path has been found, the path is checked to determine if it traverses
        any of A&rsquo;s links in the direction away from A. Note that,
        because the node pair XY may exist in the list for more than one of
        A&rsquo;s links (i.e. it lies on more than one repair path), it is
        necessary to identify the correct list, and hence link which has a
        mutually looping repair path. That link of A is then advertised by A
        as a secondary SRLG paired with the link X-Y. Also note that X will be
        running this algorithm as well, and will identify that XY is paired
        with A-B and so advertise it. This could perhaps be used as a further
        check.
</p>
<p>The ordering of the pairs in the lists is important. i.e. X-Y and
        Y-X are dealt with separately. If and only if the repairs are mutually
        incompatible, we need to advertise the pair of links as a secondary
        SRLG, and then ALL nodes compute repair paths around both failures
        using an additional not-via address with the semantics not-via A-B AND
        not-via X-Y.
</p>
<p>A further possibility is that because we are going to the trouble
        of advertising these SRLG sets, we could also advertise the new repair
        path and only get the nodes on that path to perform the necessary
        computation. Note also that once we have reached Q space <a class='info' href='#I-D.bryant-ipfrr-tunnels'>tunnels<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryant, S., Filsfils, C., Previdi, S., and M. Shand, &ldquo;IP Fast Reroute using tunnels,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [5] with respect to the
        two failures we need no longer continue the computation, so we only
        need to notify the nodes on the path that are not in Q-space.
</p>
<p>One cause of mutually looping repair paths is the existence of
        nodes with only two links, or sections of the network which are only
        bi-connected. In these cases, repair is clearly impossible &ndash; the
        failure of both links partitions the network. It would be advantageous
        to be able to identify these cases, and inhibit the fruitless
        advertisement of the secondary SRLG information. This could be
        achieved by the node detecting the requirement for a secondary SRLG,
        first running the not-via computation with both links removed. If this
        does not result in a path, it is clear that the network would be
        partitioned by such a failure, and so no advertisement is
        required.

N-level Mutual Loops</h3>

<p>It is tempting to conclude that the mechanism described above can
        be applied to the general case of N failures. If we use the approach
        of assuming that repairs are not mutual, and catching the loops and
        executing AAH when they occur, then we can attempt repairs in the case
        of N failures.
</p>
<p>If we use the approach of avoiding potentially mutual repairs and
        creating secondary SRLG, then we have to explore N levels of repair,
        where N is the number of simultaneous failures we wish to repair.

Mixing LFAs and Not-via</h3>

<p>So far in this draft we have assumed that all repairs use not-via
      tunnels. However, in practise we may wish to use loop free alternates
      (LFAs) or downstream routes where available. This complicates the issue,
      because their use results in packets which are being repaired, but NOT
      addressed to not-via addresses. If BOTH links are using downstream
      routes there is no possibility of looping, since it is impossible to
      have a pair of nodes which are both downstream of each other <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-spec-base'>Basic<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zinin, A., Torvi, R., Choudhury, G., Martin, C., Imhoff, B., and D. Fedyk, &ldquo;Basic Specification for IP Fast-Reroute: Loop-free Alternates,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [4].
</p>
<p>Loops can however occur when LFAs are used. An obvious example is the
      well known node repair problem with LFAs <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-spec-base'>Basic<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zinin, A., Torvi, R., Choudhury, G., Martin, C., Imhoff, B., and D. Fedyk, &ldquo;Basic Specification for IP Fast-Reroute: Loop-free Alternates,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [4]. If one link is
      using a downstream route, while the other is using a not-via tunnel, the
      potential mechanism described above would work provided it were possible
      to determine the nodes on the path of the downstream route. Some methods
      of computing downstream routes do not provide this path information. If
      the path information is however available, the link using a downstream
      route will have a discard FIB entry for the not-via address of the other
      link. The consequence is that potentially looping packets will be
      discarded when they attempt to cross this link.
</p>
<p>In the case where the mutual repairs are both using not-via repairs,
      the loop will be broken when the packet arrives at the second failure.
      However packets are unconditionally repaired at downstream routes, and
      thus when the mutual pair consists of a downstream route and a not-via
      repair, the looping packet will only be dropped when it gets back to the
      first failure. i.e. it will execute a single turn of the loop before
      being dropped.
</p>
<p>There is a further complication with downstream routes, since
      although the path may be computed to the far side of the failure, the
      packet may &ldquo;peel off&rdquo; to its destination before reaching the
      far side of the failure. In this case it may traverse some other link
      which has failed and was not accounted for on the computed path. If the
      A-B repair (Figure 1) is a downstream route and the X-Y repair is a
      not-via repair, we can have the situation where the X-Y repair packets
      encapsulated to Yx follow a path which attempts to traverse A-B. If the
      A-B repair path for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; addresses is a downstream
      route, it cannot be assumed that the repair path for packets addressed
      to Yx can be sent to the same neighbour. This is because the validity of
      a downstream route must be ascertained in the topology represented by
      Yx, i.e. that with the link X-Y failed. This is not the same topology
      that was used for the normal downstream calculation, and use of the
      normal downstream route for the encapsulated packets may result in an
      undetected loop. If it is computationally feasible to check the
      downstream route in this topology (i.e. for any not-via address Qp which
      traverses A-B we must perform the downstream calculation for that
      not-via address in the topology with link Q-P failed.), then the
      downstream repair for Yx can safely be used. These packets cannot
      re-visit X-Y, since by definition they will avoid that link.
      Alternatively, the packet could be always repaired in a not-via tunnel.
      i.e. even though the normal repair for traffic traversing A-B would be
      to use a downstream route, we could insist that such traffic addressed
      to a not-via address MUST use a tunnel to Ba. Such a tunnel would only
      be installed for an address Qp if it were established that it did not
      traverse Q-P (using the rules described above).
