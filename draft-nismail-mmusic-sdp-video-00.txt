Abstract

   This document defines new SDP parameters using general purpose media
   descriptors to describe video codecs used in interactive multimedia
   applications. Currently this document covers H.261 and H.263 but more
   codecs are expected to leverage the SDP syntax defined by this
   document. These parameters aid in negotiating parameters for video
   sessions. Examples of using the SDP video syntax to setup a video
   call using the SDP offer answer model are included.

1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

2. Introduction

   IP-based real time interactive communication in the form of IP
   telephony and audio conferencing are already in common use. As the
   industry moves forward video is being used more frequently. IETF
   protocols such as SIP [2] are used by these applications to initiate
   media sessions. SDP [3] is the IETF's chosen mechanism through which
   media sessions are described. SDP already has the flexibility to
   describe multiple media lines per session, one or more of which can
   be video. SDP in conjunction with the RTP audiovisual profile [4] and
   the SDP offer answer mechanism [5] provide enough syntax and
   semantics for negotiating the video encoding types (video codecs) and
   the network transport information between the sender and receiver.
   This is sufficient to provide basic video sessions where senders and
   receivers limit themselves to the use of default video options that
   are commonly supported. However to support extra video options
   applications need to negotiate more video parameters between the
   sender and the receiver. Some of these parameters are generic and
   apply to several codecs commonly used in interactive real time video
   communication such as H.261, H.263 and H.264. Other parameters are
   specific to a particular video codec. This document defines new gpmd
   [6] parameters. Examples of using these parameters and the video
   attributes in the SDP offer answer model are given. As with the SDP
   specification, the syntax is described in an augmented Backus-Naur
   form (ABNF) described in detail in [7].

3. Requirements

   1- It must be possible for applications to associate multiple
   standard video picture formats with each of the H.263 and H.261 video
   encodings included in the video media line.

   2- It must be possible for applications to associate custom picture
   formats with H.263 video encodings.

   3- It must be possible for applications to associate the Minimum
   Picture Interval with each pair of video encoding and video picture
   format.

   4- It should be possible for applications to associate a maximum
   sustainable video bitrate with each pair of video encoding and video
   picture format.

Internet-Draft    SDP General Purpose Media Descriptors for H.261 and H.263                      Oct 2003


   5- It must be possible for applications to declare support for H.261
   and H.263 annexes. It should be possible for applications to declare
   this per video picture format.

4. SDP syntax

4.1 The Video Format gpmd Parameter

   This section defines a new gpmd parameter called Video Format ("vf").
   It is a bilateral parameter used to detail support for a given video
   picture format and its associated minimum picture interval and
   maximum bitrate.

   No SDP attributes or parameters are currently defined to specify
   video picture formats or minimum picture interval. SDP has a media
   line bandwidth attribute. SDP also has a frame rate attribute which
   is similar in purpose to MPI. However these attributes are associated
   with a media line rather than a specific encoding and a specific
   video picture format.

   The Video Format (vf) parameter has the following syntax:

   vf=id/format/mpi/bitrate

   Editor Note: Formal BNF specifications will be added later

   Where:

   - id is a two digit sequence number that uniquely identify this video
   format within the SDP session.

   - format is the video picture format

   For H.261 payload types the valid values are:

   QCIF | CIF

   For H.263 payload types the valid values are:

   X:Y | SQCIF | QCIF | CIF | 4CIF | 16CIF

   Where X and Y are a 4 digit number each that define the maximum
   custom picture resolution. The X and Y values should follow the rules
   defined in the H.263 standard.

   - mpi is a 1 digit number that has a value between 1 and 4
   representing the minimum picture interval. When using the default
   29.97 picture clock value an mpi value of 1 specifies a maximum of 30

   frames per second whereas a value of 2 specifies a maximum of 15
   frames per second.

   - bitrate is a number that specifies the maximum sustainable video
   bitrate in kbps. This number does not include any protocol overhead.

   Open Issue: Should the H261 and H263 RTP headers be excluded or
   included?.

   Each gpmd attribute can have multiple "vf" parameters. This defines
   the ability to support each of the included video formats when using
   the specified video encoding.

   The below SDP syntax specifies the ability to support the H.263 codec
   with QCIF format at 30 frames per second at up to 320 kbps as well as
   with CIF format at 15 frames per second at up to 320 kbps.

   m=video 4002 RTP/AVP 98

   a=rtpmap:98 H263/90000

   a=gpmd:98 vf=1/QCIF/1/320; vf=2/CIF/2/320

4.2 Custom picture clock gpmd parameter

   This section defines a new gpmd parameter called Custom Picture Clock
   (cpc). This parameter has a float number value that specifies the
   custom picture clock. If this parameter is not present applications
   MUST use the default value of 30000/1001 (29.97). Optionally the
   parameter value MAY contain a list of video format ids to which this
   cpc applies. If no video format id is present then the cpc value
   applies to all vf parameters defined for that gpmd format. If no
   other gpmd parameters are defined for this gpmd line then the cpc
   parameter applies to the default vf parameters the application
   decides to use.

   cpc=float number *(SP id)

   Below is an example where the application specifies a picture clock
   value of 25 for QCIF while using the standard 29.97 clock for CIF.

   m=video 4002 RTP/AVP 31 a=gpmd:vf=1/QCIF/1/320; vf=2/CIF/2/320;
   cpc=25 1

4.3 H.261 annex gpmd parameter

   This section defines a new gpmd parameter for H.261 annexes called
   "261Annex". This parameter applies to the H.261 encoding. The only



Ismail & Restrick        Expires March 31, 2004                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SDP General Purpose Media Descriptors for H.261 and H.263                      Oct 2003


   current value defined for this parameter is D which specifies the
   ability of the application to support H.261 annex D. The parameter
   value MAY contain a list of video format ids in which case annex D
   can only be supported when these formats are used. If no video format
   ids are present then annex D is supported by all H.261 video formats
   specified in the gpmd line. If no other parameters are present on the
   gpmd line then the parameter specifies support for annex D for the
   default video formats the application decides to use.

   261Annex=D *(SP id)

   Below is an example of an SDP syntax for which the application will
   only support H.261 annex D when using the CIF format.

   m=video 4002 RTP/AVP 31 a=gpmd:31 vf=1/QCIF/1/320; vf=2/CIF/2/320;
   261Annex=D 2

4.4 H.263 simple annex gpmd parameter

   This section defines a new gpmd parameter for simple to declare H.263
   annexes called "simple263Annex". The attribute value is a list of
   alphabetic characters each specifying the ability of the application
   to support the H.263 annex corresponding to that character. The
   attribute value MAY contain a list of video format ids, in which case
   the specified H.263 annex(es) can only be supported when these
   formats are used. If no video format ids are present as part of the
   simple263annex parameter then the annex is supported by all H.263
   video formats specified in the gpmd line. If no video format
   parameters are present on the gpmd line then the parameter specifies
   support for the annex by the default video formats the application
   decides to use.

   simple261Annex=1*(annex) *(SP id) annex= E | F | G | I | J | M | P |
   Q | R | S | T

   Below is an example of an SDP syntax for which the application will
   only support annex I and J when using CIF at 128 Kbps while T is
   supported with all video formats

   m= video 4002 RTP/AVP 98

   a=rtpmap:98 H261/90000

   a=gpmd:98 vf=1/CIF/1/128; vf=2/CIF/2/320; simple263Annex=I J 1;
   simple263Annex=T

4.5 H.263 parameterized annex parameters

   This section defines new gpmd parameters used to specify H.263
   annexes that take parameters. Each parameter value specifies one or
   more parameters needed by the annex. The parameter value MAY contain
   a list of video format ids, specified by the gpmd vf attribute, in
   which case the specified H.263 annex can only be supported when these
   formats are used. If no video format ids are present then the annex
   is supported by all H.263 video formats specified by the gpmd
   parameter. If no video format parameters are present on the gpmd line
   then the parameter specifies support for the annex by the default
   video formats the application decides to use.

   263AnnexD= 1 | 2 / *(SP id)

   263AnnexK=

   263AnnexL=

   263AnnexN=

   263AnnexO=

   Editor Note: The rest of the 263 annexes specifications will be
   provided in the next draft.

   Editor Note: Need to deal with the H.263 levels and profiles in the
   next draft

5. Support in SDP offer answer

5.1 Video format gpmd parameter

   An offer containing a video m line MAY or MAY NOT include a gpmd
   attribute with "vf" parameters.

   - If the answerer receives an offer without a vf parameter specified
   in any of the gpmd attributes (or with no gpmd attributes) it SHOULD
   assume that the offerer only support default video format parameters.
   Defining such defaults is outside the scope of this document. The
   answerer MUST NOT include a gpmd attribute with vf parameters in its
   answer.

   - An answerer that does not support the gpmd attribute or the vf
   parameter should ignore them if received in an offer and MUST behave
   as specified in above.

   - An answerer receiving an offer that contains one more gpmd



Ismail & Restrick        Expires March 31, 2004                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    SDP General Purpose Media Descriptors for H.261 and H.263                      Oct 2003


   attributes with one or more vf parameters should:

   1- Examine each of the vf parameters and determine the ones it
   supports. The VF is supported if the answerer supports the video
   picture format specified in the vf parameter.

   2- If the answerer wants to use ANY of the supported vf parameters
   included in the offer, the answerer MUST return a gpmd attribute that
   includes these vf parameters with their id and video picture format
   intact. The answerer MAY use a higher mpi or a lower bit rate value
   to the one specified in the vf parameter. The answerer MUST NOT
   return a lower mpi or a higher bit rate value.

   - An offerer receiving an answer with no gpmd attribute in the video
   media line specifying vf parameters SHOULD assume that the answerer
   support default video format parameters. Defining such defaults is
   outside the scope of this document.

   - Both offerer and answerer MUST be prepared to receive video streams
   with any of the video format parameters they specified in the offer
   or the answer respectively.

   - If an answerer excludes a specific video encoding from the media
   line it MUST exclude its gpmd attribute as well.

   Offer:

   m=video 4002 rtp/avp 98 31

   rtpmap: 98 h263/90000

   a=gpmd:98 vf=1/QCIF/2/128 vf=2/QCIF/1/320 vf=3/CIF/1/768

   a=gpmd:31 vf=4/CIF/1/768

   Answer:

   m=video 4003 rtp/avp 98

   rtpmap: 98 h263/avp 98

   a=gpmd:98 vf=3/CIF/2/768

5.2 Custom clock picture gpmd parameter

   - If the offer does not include a cpc parameter in the gpmd attribute
   the answerer MUST use the default cpc for all vf parameters specified
   with the gpmd attribute or with the default vf parameters.

   - If the offerer does not include a valid cpc value or a value that
   is not supported by the answerer, the answerer MUST NOT return the
   cpc parameter in its answer.

   - If an answer is received with no cpc parameter while the offer
   contained one the offerer MUST use the default cpc value.

   - If the offer contains a cpc parameter associated with a video
   format ID that the answerer does not support the answerer MUST NOT
   associate the video format id with the cpc parameter in its answer.
   Other associated and supported video format ID MAY be included.

7. Security Considerations

   Though applications should work without the existence of the gpmd
   parameters specified in this document, an attacker altering, deleting

   or creating one of these parameter could cause erroneous application
   behavior.

   It is possible to protect against such attacks by employing integrity
   protection mechanism on the protocol(s) used to exchange the session
   description or by use of integrity protection mechanism on the
   session description itself.

   Editor Note: More work is needed on this Section

8. IANA Considerations

   There are 5 IANA actions in this draft:

   1- Registration of the "vf" gpmd parameter

   2- Registration the "cpc" gpmd parameter

   3- Registration of the "261simpleAnnex" gpmd parameter

   4- Registration of the "263simpleAnnex" parameter.

   5- Registration of the 263AnnexD, 263AnnexK,....

   Editor Note: More work is needed in this section
