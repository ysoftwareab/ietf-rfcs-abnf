Abstract

   This document extends the procedures and Connectivity Verification
   (CV) types already defined for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (BFD) for Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) to define
   Seamless BFD (S-BFD) for VCCV.  This document updates RFC 5885,
   extending the CV Values and the Capability Selection.

1.  Background

   BFD for VCCV [RFC5885] defines the CV types for BFD using VCCV,
   protocol operation and the required packet encapsulation formats.
   This document extends those procedures, CV type values to enable
   S-BFD [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base] operation for VCCV.

   The new S-BFD CV Types are Pseudowire (PW) demultiplexer-agnostic,
   and hence applicable for both MPLS and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
   version 3 (L2TPv3) pseudowire demultiplexers.  This document concerns
   itself with the S-BFD VCCV operation over single-segment pseudowires
   (SS-PWs).  The scope of this document is as follows:

      This specification describes procedures only for S-BFD
      asynchronous mode.

Internet-Draft            Seamless BFD for VCCV               April 2016


      S-BFD Echo mode is outside the scope of this specification.

      S-BFD operation for fault detection and status signaling is
      outside the scope of this specification.

   This document specifies the use of a single S-BFD discriminator per
   Pseudowire.  There are cases where multiple S-BFD discriminators per
   PW can be useful.  One such cases is using different S-BFD
   discriminators per Flow within a FAT PW [RFC6391]; however, the
   mapping between Flows and discriminators is a prerequisite.  FAT PWs
   can be supported as described in Section 7 of [RFC6391].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  S-BFD Connectivity Verification

   S-BFD protocol provides continuity check services by monitoring the
   S-BFD control packets sent and received over the VCCV channel of the
   PW.  The term "Connectivity Verification" is used throughout this
   document to be consistent with [RFC5885].

   This section defines the CV types to be used for S-BFD.  It also
   defines the procedures for the S-BFD reflector and S-BFD Initiator
   operation.

   Two CV Types are defined for S-BFD.  Table 1 summarizes the S-BFD CV
   Types, grouping them by encapsulation (i.e., with versus without IP/
   UDP headers) for fault detection only.  S-BFD for fault detection and
   status signaling is outside the scope of this specification.

                 Table 1: Bitmask Values for BFD CV Types

   Two new bits are requested from IANA to indicate S-BFD operation.

2.1.  Co-existence of S-BFD and BFD Capabilites

   Since the CV types for S-BFD and BFD are unique, BFD and S-BFD
   capabilities can be advertised concurrently.

2.2.  S-BFD CV Operation

2.2.1.  S-BFD Initiator Operation

   The S-BFD Initiator SHOULD bootstrap S-BFD sessions after it learns
   the discriminator of the remote target identifier.  This can be
   achieved, for example but not limited to, through one or more of the
   following methods:

   1.  Advertisements of S-BFD discriminators made through a PW
       signaling protocol, for example AVP/TLVs defined in L2TP/LDP.

   2.  Provisioning of S-BFD discriminators by manual configuration of
       the PE/LCCEs.

   3.  Assignment of S-BFD discriminators by a controller.

   4.  Probing remote S-BFD discriminators through a mechanism such as
       S-BFD Alert discriminators [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-alert-discrim]

   S-BFD Initiator operation MUST be according to the specifications in
   Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].

2.2.2.  S-BFD Reflector Operation

      When a pseudowire signaling protocol such as LDP or L2TPv3 is in
      use, the S-BFD Reflector can advertise its target discriminators
      using that signaling protocol.  When static PWs are in use the
      target discriminator of S-BFD needs to be provisioned on the S-BFD
      Initiator nodes.

      All point to point pseudowires are bidirectional, the S-BFD
      Reflector therefore reflects the S-BFD packet back to the
      Initiator using the VCCV channel of the reverse direction of the
      PW on which it was received.

      It is observed that the reflector has enough information to
      reflect the S-BFD Async packet received by it back to the S-BFD
      initiator using the PW context (e.g., fields of the L2TPv3
      headers).

      S-BFD Reflector operation for BFD protocol fields MUST be
      according to the specifications of [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].

2.2.2.1.  Demultiplexing

   Demultiplexing of S-BFD is achieved using the PW context, following
   the procedures in Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].

2.2.2.2.  Transmission of Control Packets

   The procedures of S-BFD Reflector described in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base] apply for S-BFD using VCCV.

2.2.2.3.  Advertisement of Target Discriminators Using LDP

   The advertisement of the target discriminator using LDP is left for
   further study.  It should be noted that S-BFD can still be used with
   signaled PWs over an MPLS PSN, by provisioning of the S-BFD
   discriminators or by learning the S-BFD discriminators by other
   means.

2.2.2.4.  Advertisement of Target Discriminators Using L2TP

   The S-BFD Reflector MUST use the AVP
   [I-D.ietf-l2tpext-sbfd-discriminator] defined for advertising its
   target discriminators using L2TP.

Internet-Draft            Seamless BFD for VCCV               April 2016


2.2.2.5.  Provisioning of Target Discriminators

   S-BFD target discriminators MAY be provisioned when static PWs are
   used.

2.3.  S-BFD Encapsulation

   Unless specified differently below, the encapsulation of S-BFD
   packets is identical to the method specified in Section 3.2 [RFC5885]
   and in [RFC5880] for the encapsulation of BFD packets.

   o  IP/UDP BFD Encapsulation (BFD with IP/UDP Headers)

      *  The destination UDP port for the IP encapsulated S-BFD packet
         MUST be 7784 [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-ip].

      *  The encapsulation of the S-BFD header fields MUST be according
         to Section 7.3.2 of [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].

      *  The Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) is set to
         255.

   o  PW-ACH/ L2SS BFD Encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP Headers)

      *  The encapsulation of S-BFD packets using this format MUST be
         according to Section 3.2 of [RFC5885] with the exception of the
         value for the PW-ACH/L2SS type.

      *  When VCCV carries PW-ACH/ L2SS-encapsulated S-BFD (i.e., "raw"
         S-BFD), the PW-ACH (pseudowire CW's) or L2SS' Channel Type MUST
         be set to TBD3 to indicate "S-BFD Control, PW-ACH/ L2SS-
         encapsulated" (i.e., S-BFD without IP/UDP headers; see
         Section 5.3).  This is to allow the identification of the
         encased S-BFD payload when demultiplexing the VCCV control
         channel.

2.4.  S-BFD CV Types

3.  Capability Selection

   When multiple S-BFD CV Types are advertised, and after applying the
   rules in [RFC5885], the set that both ends of the pseudowire have in
   common is determined.  If the two ends have more than one S-BFD CV
   Type in common, the following list of S-BFD CV Types is considered in
   the order of the lowest list number CV Type to the highest list
   number CV Type, and the CV Type with the lowest list number is used:

   1.  TBD1 - S-BFD IP/UDP-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection only.

Internet-Draft            Seamless BFD for VCCV               April 2016


   2.  TBD2 - S-BFD PW-ACH/ L2SS-encapsulated (without IP/UDP headers),
       for PW Fault Detection only.

   The order of capability selection between S-BFD and BFD is defined as
   follows:

   +----------------------------+---------+----------+-----------------+
   | Advertised capabilities of |   BFD   |   SBFD   |  Both S-BFD and |
   |          PE1/ PE2          |   Only  |   Only   |       BFD       |
   +----------------------------+---------+----------+-----------------+
   |          BFD Only          |   BFD   |   None   |     BFD Only    |
   |                            |         |          |                 |
   |         S-BFD Only         |   None  |  S-BFD   |    S-BFD only   |
   |                            |         |          |                 |
   |     Both S-BFD and BFD     |   BFD   |  S-BFD   |  Both SBFD and  |
   |                            |   only  |   only   |       BFD       |
   +----------------------------+---------+----------+-----------------+

          Table 2: Capability Selection Matrix for BFD and S-BFD

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for VCCV are addressed in Section 10 of
   [RFC5085].  The introduction of the S-BFD Connectivity Verification
   (CV) Types introduces no new security risks for VCCV.
   Implementations of the additional CV Types defined herein are subject
   to the same security considerations as defined in [RFC5085] as well
   as [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].

   The IP/UDP encasulation of S-BFD makes use of the TTL/Hop Limit
   procedures described in the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
   [RFC5082]) as a security mechanism.

   This specification does not raise any additional security issues
   beyond these.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  MPLS CV Types for the VCCV Interface Parameters Sub-TLV

   The VCCV Interface Parameters Sub-TLV codepoint is defined in
   [RFC4446], and the VCCV CV Types registry is defined in [RFC5085].

   This section lists the new BFD CV Types.

   IANA has augmented the "MPLS VCCV Connectivity Verification (CV)
   Types" registry in the Pseudowire Name Spaces reachable from

                   for PW Fault Detection only

5.2.  L2TPv3 CV Types for the VCCV Capability AVP

   This section lists the new requests for S-BFD "L2TPv3 Connectivity
   Verification (CV) Types" to be added to the existing "VCCV Capability
   AVP" registry in the L2TP name spaces.  The Layer Two Tunneling
   Protocol "L2TP" Name Spaces are reachable from [IANA-L2TP].  IANA is
   requested to assign the following L2TPv3 Connectivity Verification
   (CV) Types in the VCCV Capability AVP Values registry.
