RFC              KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP)        April 25, 2017


1.  Introduction


    - KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP) is an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) that
      introduces a new way of routing IP packets from the source to the destination
      through different Autonomous Systems (ASs).
    - The Internet will be subdivided into logical regions or by the physical
      location of continents.
    - The routing process that KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP) uses is based on the
      KRP Region Number (RN), the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN), Best Path Algorithm
      (AS Path) and the efforts made by the IGP within each AS.
    - The major difference between KRP and BGP is that KRP does not uses a large table
      with hundreds of thousands of entries (BGP Table) stored within each Internet router,
      instead of that, it uses a smarter way of routing based on the KRP RN,  KRP ASN
      stored within each IP address, Best Path Algorithm (AS Path) and the efforts already
      being done by each IGP within an AS.




2. KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP)


    - KRP uses new terms that can be defined as follows:


    * Region Number (RN):

   - 3-bits represented in one decimal digit.
   - 8 RNs can be used to represent 8 different Regions (from 0 to 7).
   - The 1st hex digit of the 1st group of an IPv6 address determines on which RN this IPv6
     address is located..
   - The 1st octet of an IPv4 address determines on which RN this IPv4 address is located.
   - The table that will be used listing the Region Number (RN), the corresponding IPv6
     1st hex digits and the IPv4 1st octet pool of numbers is called the Region Number Table
     (RNT) and is stored on every KRP router and is as follows:


           **************************************************************
           *  Region Number  *  1st IPv6 hex digits  *  1st IPv4 Octets * 
           **************************************************************  
           *        1        *       1 - 6 - B       *     ARIN Pool    *        
           **************************************************************  
           *        2        *       2 - 7 - C       *   RIPE NCC Pool  *        
           **************************************************************  
           *        3        *       3 - 8 - D       *   AFRINIC Pool   *        
           **************************************************************  
           *        4        *       4 - 9 - E       *    APNIC Pool    *        
           **************************************************************  
           *        5        *       5 - A           *   LACNIC Pool    *        
           **************************************************************



    * Regional Boarder Router (RBR) ==> A router in a region that has
                                        at least one interface connected
                                        to a router's interface in another
                                        region.


    * Regional Router (RR) ==> A router in a region and has all interfaces
                               connected to other routers in the same
                               region.


   - Each RBR and RR is configured with a Region Number (RN) that identifies
     in which region that router is located. 
   - All RBRs and RRs interfaces will be assigned by default to the configured
     Region Number (RN).
   - The two connected KRP routers exchange their RNs: 

       1) If they are the same, the two KRP routers are RRs.
       2) If they are different, the two KRP routers are RBRs.

3. KRP Forwarding Mechanism



   - KRP requires the IPv6 and IPv4 assignment must follow these requirements:

     a) The 1st two groups of an IPv6 address is represented as follows:

                   yyyy|yyyy|yyyy|yyyy:yyyy|yyyy|yyyy|yyyy
                                  
                                  YYYY:YYYY

       where YYYY:YYYY hex digits represents the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN).



     b) The 1st two octets of an IPv4 address is represented as follows:

                             yyyyyyyy.yyyyyyyy

                                   YY.YY

      where YY.YY hex digits represents the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN).

     Note:- - The KRP ASN must be unique for every AS.



    - There are 3 types of tables and 1 RBR message that the KRP uses for forwarding a packet:


     a) KRP router Regional Table (RT):


     **********************************************************************
     * Local RN * Remote RN * Traffic Class * Local KRP ASN * RBR KRP ASN * 
     **********************************************************************  
     *          *           *               *               *             *
     **********************************************************************


    - Each RBR and RR creates its own Regional Table (RT).
    - The Regional Table (RT) is as follows:


      Note:- - Each RBR broadcasts the full learned RT first, then the new learned 
               Remote RN.
             - Each RBR broadcasts the RT out of all its interfaces except the interface
               where it learned about the remote RN.



    b) KRP router Forwarding Table (FT):


     ***************************************************************************
     *   Local  *   Remote  *    RBR    *    Best   *   Output   *   Next-hop  *
     *  KRP ASN *  KRP ASN  *  KRP ASN  *  AS Path  *  Interface *  IP Address *
     ***************************************************************************  
     *          *           *           *           *            *             *
     ***************************************************************************



    c) KRP router IGP Routing Table (IRT):


     *************************************************************
     * Prefix (Subnet) * Metric * Output Interface * Next-hop IP * 
     ************************************************************* 
     *                 *        *                  *             *      
     *************************************************************
   


   - RBR Advertised Message Information for the local region is as follows:


     *******************************************************
     * Remote RN * Metric * Output Interface * Next-hop IP * 
     ******************************************************* 
     *           *        *                  *             *      
     *******************************************************



   - RBR Advertised Message Information for the remote region is as follows:


     ***********************************************************
     * Local * Remote * Traffic * Number  * Time-out *   RBR   *
     *  RN   *   RN   *  Class  * of Hops *  Value   * KRP ASN *
     *********************************************************** 
     *          *           *                  *               *      
     ***********************************************************



    d) RBR Regional Table (RRT):


     ******************************************************
     * Local RN * Remote RN * Traffic Class * RBR KRP ASN * 
     ******************************************************  
     *          *           *               *             *
     ******************************************************
