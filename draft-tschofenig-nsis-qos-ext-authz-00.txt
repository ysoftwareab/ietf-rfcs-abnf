Abstract

   Proper authorization is essential for a Quality of Service signaling
   protocol.  Three authorization models have been identified: a
   two-party model, a token-based three-party model, and a generic
   three-party model

   This document discusses two possible solution for the generic
   three-party model: a challenge/response based and an EAP-based
   approach.

Internet-Draft      Extended QoS NSLP Authorization            July 2004


1.  Introduction

   Three authorization models are described in Section 3.6 of
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp]:

   o  Two party approach

   o  Token based three party approach

   o  Generic three party approach

   The two party approach is sketched in Section 3.6.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp], the token based three party approach is
   described in Section 3.6.2 of [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] (based on
   [RFC3520] and [RFC3521]), and an overview of the generic three party
   approach is provided with Section 3.6.3 of [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].

   It is obvious that these authorization approaches offer different
   security and address different deployment scenarios.

   This document focuses on a more detailed discussion of the generic
   three party approach.  Section 3 provides an overview of the generic
   three party approach.  Section 4 lists two possible solution
   approaches.  For completeness, object payloads are described in
   Section 5.  A short conclusion is given in Section 6.

3.  Overview

   This section offers message flows and protocol-specific details about
   authorization for QoS reservations for the generic three party
   approach.

   Figure 1 illustrates a case where an entity A (e.g., an end host)
   sends an NSIS QoS signaling message towards an entity B (e.g, a NSIS
   aware router).  This request cannot be authorized by entity B itself
   but is rather forwarded to another entity C.  The protocol used
   between entity A and entity B is based on NSIS whereas the protocol
   used between entity B and entity C is, for example, Diameter.  A
   proposal for a Diameter QoS application is provided with
   [I-D.alfano-aaa-qosprot].

                     Figure 1: Three party approach

   In the following, two alternative solution proposals for this model
   are shown:

   o  Challenge/Response-based Authentication and Authorization

   o  EAP-based Authentication and Authorization

4.  Protocol Alternatives

4.1  Challenge/Response-based Authentication/Authorization

   Figure 2 shows a message flow for the generic three party approach
   with a challenge-response mechanism.  In this case, after entity B
   asked entity C for authorization of a QoS request, entity C issues a
   challenge to entity A, which is passed on by entity B.  Entity A
   resubmits its QoS request, including a response to the challenge.
   This is again forwarded to entity C, which verifies whether entity A
   is the one it claims to be, and if so, and after checking for entity
   A's authorization to use the resources it requests, either grants or
   denies the request.

        Figure 2: Three party challenge-response based approach

   Please note that the QoS NSLP does not explicitly send a successful
   response message for the challenge/response protocol after a QoS
   reservation request.  Instead the successful outcome of the protocol

   run is implicated by the successul commitment of the entire QoS
   reservation.  An unsuccessful outcome of the challenge/response
   protocol, however, would be indicated explicitly by a reject message
   returned immediately - the error codes still need to be defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].

   The properties of this approach are intentionally similar to the
   digest-authentication used with SIP (see [RFC3261]).  This approach
   provides better security properties than a token-based authorization
   approach since a stronger liveness check needs to be provided.  The
   QoS request and the result of the challenge/response authentication
   and authorization need to be associated with each other.
   Furthermore, it is necessary to bind subsequent refresh messages to
   the initial authentication and authorization protocol step.  This is
   typically accomplished with the establishment of session keys and the
   protection of signaling messages between entity A and B.

   The necessary steps for the QoS NSLP are the following:

   o  A challenge/response protocol needs to be defined or selected.  A
      number of protocols can be reused, including the
      digest-authentication approach listed in [RFC3261].  This
      authentication and key exchange protocol needs to provide mutual
      authentication, replay protection and session key establishment.
      It seems to be reasonable to investigate some of the requirements
      raised in [I-D.walker-ieee802-req] regarding the selection of such
      a protocol.

   o  Integrity protection needs to be applied to signaling messages
      exchanged between the entity A and entity B once a session key is
      available.

   o  Since the authentication and key establishment is executed betwen
      entity A and entity C, it is necessary to forward the established
      keying material from entity C to entity B (using AAA protocols).

   o  In some circumstances it might be necessary to combine the
      security protection at the NTLP with the security protection at
      the NSLP.  This can, for example, be accomplished by combining the
      session keys of both security protocols as suggested in
      [I-D.puthenkulam-eap-binding].  Such a binding is necessary if the
      reused challenge/response protocol is also used in other
      protocols.


4.2  EAP-based Authentication/Authorization

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) serves as a container

Internet-Draft      Extended QoS NSLP Authorization            July 2004


   for EAP methods.  EAP methods themselves are authentication and key
   exchange protocols.  EAP is agnostic with regard to the underlying
   protocol carrying the EAP payloads.

   The main difference between the EAP-based approach discussed in this
   section, and the challenge/response based approach discussed in
   Section 4.1 is related to the flexible choice of authentication and
   key exchange protocols with EAP on the one hand, and some degree of
   inefficiency introduced with EAP (such as the EAP-Request/Identity,
   EAP-Response/Identity and EAP-Success messages) on the other hand.

   Due to the usage of EAP in IEEE 802.1X and also in PANA, the security
   properties have been studied extensively.  The discussions in the EAP
   keying framework (see [I-D.ietf-eap-keying]) are also applicable.
   Please note that EAP is not necessarily a three party protocol - EAP
   also supports the two party scenario.

   An example message flow is shown in Figure 3 which uses the EAP-AKA
   method [I-D.arkko-pppext-eap-aka] for authentication and session key
   establishment.  Please note that the AAA messages triggered by this
   exchange are not shown for editorial reasons.

         Figure 3: EAP based Auth/Authz exchange using EAP-AKA

   The message exchange shown in Figure 3 starts with the optional
   discovery of the next QoS NSLP aware node (messages (a)).  The first
   QoS NSLP message with a resource request is sent with the Network
   Access Identity and a request to perform EAP-based authentication
   (message (b)).  Note that this exchange assumes that the EAP-Request/
   Identity and the EAP-Response/Identity exchange is omitted.  This
   exchange is optional in EAP if the identity can be provided by other
   means.  Router 1 contacts the AAA infrastructure, and the EAP server
   starts the message exchange.  The AAA message communication is not
   shown.  Subsequently, two messages (messages (c) and (d)) are
   exchanged between the EAP peer and the EAP server which contain
   EAP-AKA specific information.  After successful authentication and
   authorization, session keys are derived and provided to R1 via AAA
   mechanisms (see [I-D.ietf-aaa-eap] and [RFC3579]).  These session
   keys can then be used to protect subsequent NSLP messages as
   indicated by (e).  The EAP-Success message can already experience
   such a protection (see message (f)).  Furthermore, it is useful to
   repeat the previously sent objects.  Subsequent refresh messages (g)

Internet-Draft      Extended QoS NSLP Authorization            July 2004


5.  Payload Formats

5.1  Challenge/Response-based Authentication/Authorization

   For carrying the credentials for the challenge/response-based
   authentication and authorization approach within the QoS NSLP, it is
   proposed to use a new Policy Element, called CR policy element.  Its
   format is shown in Figure 4.


         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
         |  Length                   |   P-Type = AUTHZ_CR       |
         +---------------------------+---------------------------+
         |                                                       |
         // CR Packet          (Opaque to QoS NSLP)             //
         |                                                       |
         +-------------------------------------------------------+

                 Figure 4: Format of CR Policy Element

   CR Packet: The CR Packet contains the information required for the
   Challenge/Response handshake.  Further details will be described in a
   future version of this document.

5.2  EAP-based Authentication/Authorization

   Figure 3 illustrates an example message flow for EAP-based
   authentication and authorization.  This section proposes how to
   integrate the data required for the EAP exchange into the QoS NSLP
   message format.

   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] describes the generic format for Policy
   Elements.  It is proposed that the EAP data is carried within a new
   Policy Element, called EAP Policy Element.  It follows the generic
   format of Policy elements as defined in Appendix A.7.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].  Figure 5 illustrates the specific format.

6.  Conclusion

   The QoS NSLP has to be provided for the generic three party case in
   order to be complete.  This document discusses two possible
   solutions: the challenge/response and the EAP-based approach

   The working group needs to make the following two decisions:

   o  Should a challenge/response or an EAP-based scheme be developed?

   o  Should this work be included in the main QoS NSLP
      [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] document?

   There are some technical aspects that need to be addressed, as
   explained throughout the text.  Hence, the enhancement is more
   complex than just adding one new payload to the NSLP.  Some security
   issues and also non-security issues need to be solved.  For example,
   EAP itself is only a container and does not provide fragmentation and
   reliable transmission of EAP payloads.  Carrying EAP within the QoS
   NSLP requires further investigations since different transport
   protocols have to be supported by GIMPS (see
   [I-D.schulzrinne-nsis-ntlp]).  These issues have already been
   discussed in, for example, PANA [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

7.  Security considerations

   Selected security aspects with the challenge/response based approach
   have been mentioned in Section 4.1 and with respect to EAP in Section
   4.2.

   If security protection is provided by GIMPS (which is an
   instantiation of the NTLP) and also at the NSLP with the mechanisms
   discussed in this document, then the two phases should be combined
   since security vulnerabilities are introduced otherwise.  For
   example, running EAP over TLS for client-side authentication could be
   one possibility but it raises issues with the discovered
   man-in-the-middle attack problems for tunneled authentication (see
   [I-D.puthenkulam-eap-binding]).

   There is certainly a tradeoff between the flexibility of EAP and the
   simplicity of a challenge/response protocol.

   In some scenarios, it is necessary to cope with the 'lying NAS'
   problem.  With the usage of EAP, it is necessary to provide the EAP
   server with enough information to perform the authorization steps.
   However, EAP methods themselves are independent of the environment in
   which they are executed.  Hence, an adversary (acting as an NSIS NSLP
   node) could misuse an EAP exchange to create the illusion for the EAP
   server that the context is different (e.g., wireless LAN access).
   The work in the area [I-D.arkko-eap-service-identity-auth] and
   [I-D.mariblanca-aaa-eap-lla] is applicable in this context.  The goal
   is to give both, the EAP peer and the EAP server, enough assurance
   that the Authenticator (i.e., QoS NSLP in this context) is not lying.

   It might be worth mentioning that the introduction of COPS in RSVP
   (see [RFC2749]) and the usage of POLICY_OBJECT [RFC3182] already
   provided a first attempt in offering a generic three party
   authorization model.  Hence, the problem is not artifical.
   Unfortunately, the multiple-roundtrip communication and the AAA
   infrastructure was not fully worked out at that time.  The
   deficiencies in a roaming environment have first been mentioned with
   [I-D.thomas-nsis-rsvp-analysis].  A more detailed treatment of the
   security properties are provided with
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-rsvp-sec-properties].
