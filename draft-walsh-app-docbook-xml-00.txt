Abstract

   This document defines the 'application/docbook+xml' MIME media type
   for DocBook-based markup languages.

1.  Introduction

   The DocBook specification has for many years included an appendix
   which defines a MIME media type for DocBook.  This document makes
   that media type official.

2.  Registration of MIME media type application/docbook+xml

   MIME media type name:  application

   MIME subtype name:  docbook+xml

   Required parameters:  None

   Optional parameters:  charset

      This parameter has identical semantics to the 'charset' parameter
      of the 'application/xml' media type as specified in RFC 3023[1] or
      its successors.

   Encoding considerations:

      By virtue of DocBook XML content being XML, it has the same
      considerations when sent as 'application/docbook+xml' as does XML.
      See RFC 3023[1], Section 3.2.

   Security considerations:

      Several DocBook elements may refer to arbitrary URIs.  In this
      case, the security issues of RFC 3986[2], section 7, should be
      considered.

   Interoperability considerations:

      None.

   Published specification:

      This media type registration is for DocBook documents as described
      by DocBook: The Definitive Guide[3] or its successors.

   Applications which use this media type:

      There is no experimental, vendor specific, or personal tree
      predecessor to 'application/docbook+xml', reflecting the fact that
      no applications currently recognize it.  This new type is being
      registered in order to allow for the deployment of DocBook on the
      World Wide Web, as a first class XML application.

      Magic number(s):

         There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
         present in DocBook documents.

      file extension(s):

         DocBook documents are most often identified with the extension
         '.xml'.

      Macintosh File Type Code(s):

         TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

      Norman Walsh, Norman.Walsh@Sun.COM

   Intended usage:

      COMMON

   Author/Change controller:

      DocBook is a work product of the DocBook Technical Committee at
      OASIS.

3.  Fragment identifiers

   For documents labeled as 'application/docbook+xml', the fragment
   identifier notation is exactly that for 'application/xml', as
   specified in [1] or its successors.

4.  Security Considerations

   An XML Resource Identifier does not in itself pose a security threat.
   However, XML Resource Identifers are often converted to IRIs or URIs
   and subsequently used to provide a compact set of instructions for
   access to network resources, care must be taken to properly interpret
   the data within an XML Resource Identifier, to prevent that data from
   causing unintended access, and to avoid including data that should
   not be revealed in plain text.
