Abstract

   This memo specifies the Simple Middlebox Configuration (SIMCO)
   protocol for configuring Network Address Translators (NATs) and
   firewalls dynamically to create address bindings and open pinholes.
   NATs and firewalls are a problem for applications using voice and
   video streaming, such as IP telephony, because they need to establish
   voice or video channels dynamically. The SIMCO protocol allows
   clients to send requests for this purpose to serving NATs and/or
   firewalls.  The protocol is designed to provide a simple and basic
   solution that can easily be implemented and used.

1.  Introduction

   In today's network environments the use of firewalls and Network
   Address Translators (NATs) is widespread. Firewalls and NATs improve
   network security and in times of IPv4 address depletion NATs are
   keeping the Internet growing. However, NATs and firewalls also are an
   obstacle to many applications, because in order to traverse them,
   application specific and session specific configuration is required.

   A good example (and the main driver for developing SIMCO) is IP
   telephony. For a connection two voice channels - one for each
   direction - need to be established. Typically, UDP is used to carry
   voice data, but for most NATs and firewalls it is a problem to
   provide the required address mapping and to open corresponding
   pinholes for UDP traffic without manual configuration. Possible

   solutions are application level gateways linked to the NAT/firewall
   or signaling between the application and the NAT/firewall.

   Providing a signaling-based solution is the main goal of the midcom
   working group [2,3]. The SIMCO protocol described in this document
   provides a simple and straight forward approach to such a protocol
   while meeting all requirements specified in [4]. The SIMCO protocol
   is a client/server protocol with the NAT/firewall (middlebox) serving
   application-level clients (midcom agents) requesting address bindings
   and firewall configurations. It contains six different request types
   and simple state machines that are completely specified below. A
   complete NAT/firewall configuration is out of scope of this protocol.

   This memo describes the architectural background for the SIMCO
   protocol. Section 2 defines the terminology used throughout this memo
   and section 3 explains the basic concept of the protocol.  Section 4
   defines all SIMCO messages, and section 5 specifies processing of the
   messages at a NAT/firewall including the complete specification of
   state machines. Section 6 explains how a client can open and close a
   SIMCO session, section 7 shows how it deals with a binding-group and
   section 8 explains how it can request address bindings and pinhole
   configurations. Both sections include example message sequences for
   these actions. Most of the security issues are discussed in section
   9. They are very important, because many network security concepts
   strongly depend on proper firewall configuration.


2.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology that is used throughout this
   document.

2.1.  General

   NAT                             Network Address Translation,
                                   according to [1]: Network Address
                                   Translation is a method by which IP
                                   addresses are mapped from one address
                                   realm to another, providing
                                   transparent routing to end hosts

   Firewall                        A general firewall contains two
                                   components: a packet filter examining
                                   information of Layer 2-4 and an
                                   Application Level Gateway (ALG). In
                                   this document we restrict the use of
                                   the term `firewall' to packet
                                   filters, unless metioned explicitly

   NAT/firewall                    A NAT or a firewall or a combination
                                   of both

   Internal side                   The private network of a NAT (see
                                   [1], Section 2.8) and/or the
                                   protected network of a firewall

   External side                   The public network of a NAT (see [1],
                                   Section 2.7) and/or firewall.

   Internal IP Address             An IP address which is located at the
                                   internal side of a NAT/firewall

   External IP Address             An IP address which is located at the
                                   external side of a NAT/firewall.

   NAT Address binding             For a NAT, the address binding is the
                                   phase in which an internal IP address
                                   is associated with an external IP
                                   address or vice versa, for purpose of
                                   translation (see [1], Section 3.2.1)

   Pinhole                         A configuration of the firewall
                                   allowing packets matching a pinhole
                                   to pass the firewall. Like bindings,
                                   a pinhole may be uni-directional, bi-
                                   directional or a wildcarded

   Address set                     A set consisting of three items: an
                                   IP address, a port number and a
                                   sequence of consecutive ports.

   Protocol type                   The IP protocol type as defined in
                                   [9,10,11]

   Address binding or binding      An address binding consists of four
                                   address sets. For the exact
                                   definition of an address binding see
                                   section 2.2

   Full binding                    A set of four address sets, see
                                   section 2.2

   Partial binding                 A set of two address sets, see
                                   section 2.2

   Internal partial binding        A binding of an internal located
                                   address set to an external valid
                                   address set

   External partial binding        A binding  of an external located
                                   address set to an internal valid
                                   address set

   Binding parameter set           A set consisting of a protocol type
                                   and an address set.


   SIMCO server                    A node which accepts SIMCO requests
                                   from SIMCO clients and requests
                                   pinholes or NAT address bindings on
                                   behalf of the SIMCO clients.

   SIMCO client                    A node which requests pinholes or NAT
                                   address bindings at the SIMCO server.

   SIMCO session or session        A session including a SIMCO client
                                   and a SIMCO server using the SIMCO
                                   protocol for communication


   TCP connection                  A TCP connection as defined in [12]


   Binding-group                   A binding-group consists of zero or
                                   more address bindings


2.2.  Address Bindings

   SIMCO is dealing with two different types of middle boxes: NATs and
   firewalls. To clarify the meaning of address bindings in the SIMCO
   protocol we discuss the address bindings in the  cases of NAT and
   firewall.  Figure 1 shows a working scenario for the SIMCO protocol,
   whereas two hosts, host A and host B, communicate with each other via
   the NAT/firewall. The SIMCO signalling is omitted for the sake of
   simplicity. Host A uses the internal address set ADS0 and Host B uses
   the external address set ADS3.


2.2.1.  NAT

   After an appropriate configuration of the NAT, the NAT maintains an
   internal address set ADS1 and an external address set ADS2. Please
   note that depending on the NAT type, ADS1 may  not be required. The
   NAT translates address sets located in the internal network to valid
   address sets in the external networks and vice versa. Due to this the
   relationship between the address sets is ADS0 != ADS2 and ADS3 !=
   ADS1.

                       Figure 1: SIMCO bindings

   Figure 1 shows two partial bindings. The bound address sets are
   connected by  %-lines. (ADS0/ADS2) is one partial binding and
   (ADS3/ADS1) is another partial binding. These two partial bindings
   together, constitute a full binding [(ADS0/ADS2)/(ADS1/ADS3)]. The
   partial binding (ADS0/ADS2) is called an internal partial binding,
   because the corresponding host is located inside the internal
   network. The partial binding (ADS3/ADS1) is called an external
   partial binding, because the corresponding host is located inside the
   external network.

   Note: The definition of the NAT address binding can be found in [1],
   Section 3.2.1.


2.2.2.  Firewall

   After an appropriate configuration of the firewall in figure 1, the
   firewall maintains an pinhole for the address sets ADS0 and ADS3. The
   other address sets are ADS2=ADS0 and ADS3=ADS1. The meaning of the
   partial and full binding remain the same as in the section 2.2.1.


3.  SIMCO Protocol Overview

   The SIMCO protocol is intended to comply with the midcom architecture
   specified in [2] and fulfill the requirements specified in [4]. The
   protocol allows a client (midcom agent) to establish a SIMCO session
   with a server.  An important component of session establishment is


Stiemerling & Quittek                                           [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


   the authentication and authorization of the client, as well as of the
   server, because configuring a NAT/firewall is a very sensitive issue
   of security concepts.

   For the transmission between client and server TCP is used, this
   avoids dealing with flow control issues and gives the opportunity of
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS [5]) mechanism. Instead of TLS,
   IPSEC [6,7] may be used as well.  The protocol uses ASCII encodings,
   because this simplifies documentation, implementation and debugging.
   This encoding is not considered to reduce scalability significantly.

   Once a SIMCO session is established, the client can request the
   establishments of address bindings at a NAT controlled by the server
   and the opening of pinholes at a firewall controlled by the server.
   Should the request include the allocation of port numbers, the SIMCO
   server will take care about the oddity of the ports. Therefore the
   oddity of the new allocated ports will remain the same as in the
   request. The address bindings are organized in groups, so that a
   complete group can be modified or deleted with a single message.

   The approach of SIMCO is to use the same requests for requesting NAT
   translation, as well as IPv6 to IPv4 translation, and firewall
   pinholes. For example a `bind_in' request (described in sections 4
   and 5) sends an internal address set to the server and requests the
   allocation of an external address set at the NAT/Firewall and a
   binding between both sets:

    - In case of a pure NAT, the external address set is allocated and a
      binding is established providing proper address translation.

    - In case of a pure firewall, the allocated external address set is
      identical with the internal one sent with the request, and just a
      pinhole is configured allowing packets matching the transport
      parameter set to pass.

    - In case of a combined NAT/firewall, the external address set is
      allocated, a binding is established providing proper address
      translation, and a pinhole is configured for allowing the packets
      matching the binding to pass.

   This integration of requests for address binding and for pinhole
   configuration leads to a very simple protocol with just three
   requests for binding and pinhole control and one for group control.


4.  SIMCO Messages

   The message formats described below are defined using the Augmented
   BNF (ABNF) defined in RFC 2234 [8]. The definitions for `DIGIT',
   `HEXDIG', `WSP', `CRLF', `CR', `VCHAR' and `LF' are imported from


Stiemerling & Quittek                                           [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


   appendix A of RFC 2234 and not repeated here.

4.1.  Common Definitions

   The following definitions are used in the subsequent chapters to
   define the SIMCO protocol messages.

      IPAddress      = IPv4Address / IPv6Address / "0"
      IPv4Address    = 1*3DIGIT 3("." 1*3DIGIT)
      IPv6Address    = 1*4HEXDIG 7( ":" 1*4HEXDIG)
      Port           = 1*DIGIT
      NOSP           = 1*DIGIT            ; Number Of Subsequent Ports
      RID            = 1*DIGIT            ; Request ID number

   The RID is an identifier for the client, to recognize which reply
   belongs to which request, i.e. the RID in the reply is allways the
   same as in the request.

      GID            = 1*DIGIT            ; Group ID number
      BID            = 1*DIGIT            ; Binding ID number

   The GID is used for grouping different bindings into one group, for
   the purpose of handling a group of bindings with a single request. A
   GID of zero in a group request means not allocated GID.  The BID is
   the handle for the firewall/NAT to identify the correct pinhole and
   it may correlate with the corresponding pin-hole number in the
   firewall/NAT. A BID of zero means not allocated BID.


     PT             = "UDP" / "TCP" / "ICMP" / "IP" ; IP protocol type
     Authentication = 1*VCHAR
     Challenge      = 1*VCHAR
     Message        = 1*VCHAR
     Timeout        = 1*DIGIT             ; timeout in seconds
     ADR            = IPAddress WSP Port  ; addresses
     SBPS           = PT WSP NOSP WSP ADR
                                          ; single binding parameter set
     DBPS           = PT WSP NOSP WSP ADR_int WSP ADR_ext
                                          ; double binding parameter set

4.2.  Message Definitions

   The following ABNF definitions define the set of SIMCO requests which
   can be sent from a client to a server.

     request =  "open"     WSP RID WSP Version
                           WSP Challenge WSP Authentication CRLF

     request =/ "close"    WSP RID CRLF
     request =/ "bind_int" WSP RID WSP GID WSP BID
                           WSP SBPS WSP Timeout CRLF
     request =/ "bind_ext" WSP RID WSP GID WSP BID
                           WSP SBPS WSP Timeout CRLF
     request =/ "bind_full" WSP RID WSP GID WSP BID
                           WSP DBPS WSP Timeout CRLF
     request =/ "group"    WSP RID WSP GID WSP Timeout CRLF

   The requests are grouped into three catgeories: Session control,
   binding control and binding-group control.  The `open' and the
   `close' request are exclusively used for session control. The
   `bind_in', `bind_ext' and `bind_full' requests are exclusively used
   for address binding control. The 'group' request is used for group
   control.


4.3.  Replies

   Every reply message starts with a three digit reply code and ends
   with `CRLF'. The three digits in a reply code have a special meaning.
   The first digit identifies the class of a reply message. The
   following classes exist:

     1yz   transient positive response
     2yz   permanent positive response
     3yz   transient negative response
     4yz   permanent negative response
     5yz   asynchronous notification

   The classes 1yz and 3yz are currently not used by SIMCO version 1.0.
   They are defined only for future SIMCO extensions.

   The second digit encodes the specific category. The following
   categories exist:

     x1z   syntax errors that don't fit any other category
     x2z   replies for requests concerning session control
     x3z   replies for requests concerning group control
     x4z   replies for requests concerning address binding control

   The third digit gives a finer gradation of meaning in each category
   specified by the second digit. Below is the ABNF definition of all
   reply messages and codes:

     Reply =  "410" WSP RID CRLF          ; syntax Error
     Reply =/ "411" WSP RID CRLF          ; unknown or illegal request
     Reply =/ "510" WSP Message CRLF      ; illegal message

     Reply =/ "220" WSP RID CRLF          ; OK

     Reply =/ "540" WSP BID CRLF          ; binding timed out

   The SIMCO server advertises his capabilites in the `221' reply to the
   client. Therefore the following fields are defined:
     CAP      = MAX_TO WSP BOX_TYPE WSP WC
     MAX_TO   = 1*DIGIT         ; maximal timeout granted by the server
     BOX_TYPE = "NAT" / "FW" / "NATFW"   ; types of the middle box
     WC       = "YES" / "NO"    ; Wildcarding supported

5.  Message Processing in Server

   This section describes the processing steps performed by a SIMCO
   server after receiving a message. The incoming messages are processed
   in "first come, first served" manner, i.e. an incoming request has to
   be entirely processed before the next request can be processed.
   Common to all incoming messages is that first the syntax is checked.
   Then we distinguish messages concerning session control ,messages
   concerning the control of address bindings and messages concerning
   the control of groups.  For all kinds, we define a state machine and
   discuss states and transitions.

5.1.  Syntax Checking

   When the server receives a message, it first tries to recognize a
   request consisting of the command string and a request identifier
   (RID). Messages generated by syntax checking are:

      - `410' reply
      - `411' reply
      - `510' reply

   If the server is not able to extract both the command string and the
   request identifier, then the message is discarded. An asynchronous
   `510' reply may be generated in this case. In the case that the
   request identifier is not valid, an asychronous '510' reply may be
   generated.  Otherwise, the command string is checked to be valid,
   i.e. to be one of the strings `open', `close', `bind_int',
   `bind_ext', `bind_full' or `group'.  If the string is invalid, a
   `411' reply is sent and processing of the message stops. If a syntax
   error is detected, a `410' reply is sent and processing of the
   message stops. Otherwise, the message is further processed as
   described below.

5.2.  Session State Machine

   The SIMCO session state machine has just two states: CLOSED and OPEN.
   Transisions between these states only appear in conjunction with one
   or two of the following messages:

      - `open' request
      - `close' request
      - `220' reply
      - `221' reply
      - `420' reply
      - `421' reply
      - `520' reply

   Additionally, a `510' reply may be generated in the CLOSED state as
   described below.

   Figure 2 shows the state machine of a single session with all
   possible transitions. Please note that a server may serve several
   clients at a time by running several concurrent sessions.


                      open 42X
                      close 220

                    |           v
                +-------------------+
                |      CLOSED       |
                +-------------------+
                    |           ^ close 220
           open 221 |           | open 42X
                    v           | 520
                +-------------------+
                |       OPEN        |
                +-------------------+
                    |           ^
                    +-----------+
                      open 221

          Figure 2: Session state machine


   The initial state of all sessions is CLOSED.  The SIMCO server
   listens on port 6666 for incoming connections. If a client
   establishes a TCP connection to the server by successfully creating a
   socket, then a session in state CLOSED is assigned to this TCP
   connection. For closed sessions only two requests are accepted:
   `open' and `close'. All other requests received in this state are
   discarded. An asynchronous `510' reply may be generated in this case.
   In the OPEN state, all SIMCO messages are accepted. However, only
   `open' and `close' messages have an impact on the session state.

5.2.1.  Transistions from State CLOSED

   If an `open' request is received, then first the contained `Version'
   string is checked. If the version indicated by the string is not
   compatible to one of the versions supported by the server, then a
   `420' reply is generated, the TCP connection is closed, and the state
   machine remains in state CLOSED. Otherwise, the contained
   `Authentication' string is analysed. If the authentcation check is
   successful, a `221' reply is generated and the session enters state
   OPEN. Otherwise, a `421' reply is generated and the session remains
   in state CLOSED with the TCP connection still established.  The `221'
   reply contains:

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


     - the authentication string of the SIMCO server,

     - the MAX_TO  set to the maximum granted binding timeout,

     - the BOX_TYPE set to the kind of middle box

     - the WC value set to `YES' if wildcarding is supported and `NO` if
       wildcarding is not supported.

   The SIMCO client checks the authentication string of the `221' reply
   and close the TCP connection immediately if the authentication string
   is not valid.

   At any time the server may generate an asynchronous `520' reply
   followed by closing the TCP connection. In this case the session will
   remain in state CLOSED. Particularly, the server may generate a `520'
   reply, if a TCP connection is established and the time the session
   remains in state CLOSED exceeds a given timeout value.

5.2.2.  Transistions from State OPEN

   If a `close' request is received, then the server generates a `220'
   reply and the session enters state CLOSED with the TCP connection
   being closed. The same transition occurs if the server decides to
   close the session. Then it generates a `520' reply, closes the TCP
   connection, and enters session state CLOSED.

   If an `open' request is received, it is processed as in the CLOSED
   state. First the contained `Version' string is checked.  If the
   version indicated by the string is not compatible to one of the
   versions supported by the server, then a `420' reply is generated,
   the TCP connection is closed, and the state machine enters state
   CLOSED. Otherwise, the contained `Authentication' string is analysed.
   If the authentcation check is successful, a `221' reply is generated
   and the session remains in state OPEN. Otherwise, a `421' reply is
   generated and the session enters state CLOSED with the TCP connection
   kept established.  The `221' reply contains:

     - the authentication string of the SIMCO server,

     - the MAX_TO  set to the maximum granted binding timeout,

     - the BOX_TYPE set to the kind of middle box

     - the WC value set to `YES' if wildcarding is supported and `NO` if
       wildcarding is not supported.

   The SIMCO client checks the authentication string of the `221' reply
   and close the TCP connection immediately if the authentication string
   is not valid.

   At any time the server may generate an asynchronous `520' reply
   followed by closing the TCP connection. In this case the session will
   enter state CLOSED.

5.3.  Binding-Group State Machine

   A binding-group consists of zero or more bindings, whereas address
   bindings have to belong to a binding-group. Address bindings can be
   added to a binding-group or can be removed from a binding-group.

   When the session state machine is in state OPEN, the server accepts
   further requests regarding binding-groups. The state machine of a
   binding-group contains two states: GID_UNUSED and GID_USED.
   Transistions between the states occur in conjunction with the
   following messages:

      - `group' request
      - 23X replies
      - 43X replies
      - 530 reply

   All of these requests and replies refer to exactly one binding-group
   which is indicated by the GID field of the message. The GID uniquely
   identifies a binding-group. GIDs are allocated and assigned to
   binding-groups by the server. If a request contains a GID which is
   unused, because it is not assigned to any binding-group, then the
   server will discard the request and generates a `430' reply. GID 0 is
   an exception, it is reserved for a special purpose and it is never
   assigend to an existing binding-group.

   For GIDs other than 0 a state machine exists as shown in Figure 3. If
   the server receives a `group' request containing GID 0 then a new GID
   is allocated. Before the request can be executed, a new binding-group
   state machine is instantiated for this GID with the inital state
   GID_UNUSED.

                              group 231


                Figure 3: Binding-Group state machine

   When a binding-group state machine makes a transistion to the state
   GID_UNUSED (including transistions from state GID_UNUSED), then the
   GID is considered to be unused. The client should not use this GID
   any further, because it may be used re-used by the server when
   allocating a new GID.

5.3.1.  Transitions from State GID_UNUSED

   In state GID_UNUSED only `group' requests with GID 0 can have an
   effect on the state machine.

   If the timeout specified by the request is 0, then the server
   generates a `233' reply and the binding-group state machine remains
   in state GID_UNUSED.

   If the timeout specified by the request is not 0, then the server
   allocates a new binding-group with a new GID and the binding-group
   state machine enters the state GID_USED. The server generates a `231'
   reply on successfully allocating a new binding-group. The timeout
   choosen by the server is less than or equal to the value specified by
   the client in the `group' request.

   Should the allocation of the binding-group fail, a '431' response is
   generated and the state remains in the state GID_UNUSED.

   The binding-group can now be filled with address bindings or remain
   empty.

5.3.2.  Transitions from State GID_USED

   In the state GID_USED the binding-group timeout can be modified or
   the binding-group can be removed.

   If a `group` request is received with a timeout value of non-zero,
   the timeout of the binding-group is modified and a '231' message is
   generated. The timeout choosen by the server is less than or equal to
   the value specified by the client in the `group' request.  The
   timeout of all address bindings in this binding-group is set to the
   choosen timeout value.

   If a 'group' request is received with a timeout value of zero, the
   server removes immediately all address bindings in this binding-group
   and removes the binding-group as well. A '233' reply is generated.

   After exceeding the timeout of the binding-group the server removes
   immediately  all address bindings in this binding-group and removes
   the binding-group as well. The server may generate an asynchronous
   `530' reply.


5.4.  Binding State Machine

   All requested bindings have to belong to an already allocated
   binding-group (see section 5.3). It is not necessary to allocate a
   new group for each new binding, instead of this one group can be used
   as a default group. To continue the processing of bindings, an
   already allocated group identifier (GID) must be provided with the
   `bind_int', `bind_ext' or `bind_full' request, otherwise a `430'
   reply is generated and the message is discarded.

   When the session state machine is in state OPEN, the server accepts
   further requests regarding bindings. The state machine of a binding
   contains four states: BID_UNUSED, BIND_IN_ONLY, BIND_EXT_ONLY,
   FULL_BINDING.  Transistion between the states occur in conjunction
   with the following messages:

      - `bind_int' request
      - `bind_ext' request
      - `bind_full' request
      - `24X' replies
      - `44X' replies
      - `540' reply

   All of these requests and replies refer to exactly one binding which
   is indicated by the BID field of the message. The BID uniquely
   identifies a binding. BIDs are allocated and assigned to bindings by
   the server. If a request contains a BID which is unused, because it
   is not assigned to any binding, then the server will discard the

   request and generate a `440' reply.  BID 0 is an exception, it is
   reserved for a special purpose and it is never assigned to an
   existing binding.

   For all BIDs other than 0 a state machine exists as shown in Figure
   4. If the server receives a `bind_int`, a `bind_ext' or a `bind_full'
   request containing BID 0 then a new BID is allocated. Before the
   request can be executed, a new binding state machine is instantiated
   for this BID with the initial state BID_UNUSED.

   When a binding state machines makes a transition to the state
   BID_UNUSED (including transitions from state BID_UNUSED), then the
   BID is considered to be unused. The client should not use this BID
   any further, because it may be re-used by the server when allocating
   a new BID.

   Please note that every `bind_int`, `bind_ext' and `bind_full' request
   keeps the port oddity as given in the request message.

5.4.1.  Binding Parameter Set Checking

   When a `bind_int`, a `bind_ext' or a `bind_full' request is
   processed, the binding parameter set contained in the message is
   checked. The checking procedure is common for all states:



Stiemerling & Quittek                                          [Page 17]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


     - The IP address is checked whether it is an internal IP address in
       case of a `bind_int' request or an external address in case of a
       `bind_ext' request or internal and external IP addresses in case
       of a `bind_full', respectively. If the check fails or if the IP
       address is considered invalid for some other reason, then the
       server generates a `442' reply.

     - The protocol type is checked, whether it is valid and supported.
       If the check fails, a `443' reply is generated.

     - The port number is checked whether it is valid.  If the check
       fails, a `444' reply is generated.

     - The NOSP parameter is checked whether it is valid.  If the check
       fails, a `446' reply is generated.

   If the checks are successful the server may perform further checks on
   the combination of the elements of the binding parameter set, for
   example it may check available resource or it may consult a policy-
   based access control system checking whether the client is allowed to
   make the current request. If one of these checks fails, then the
   server generates a `441' reply. Otherwise the server will continue
   with establishing the requested binding.

5.4.2.  Transitions from State BID_UNUSED

   In state BID_UNUSED, only `bind_int`, `bind_ext' or `bind_full`
   requests with BID 0 can have an effect on the state machine.  The
   server first performs the parameter checks described above.  If one
   of them fails, the binding state machine remains in state BID_UNUSED.

   If the timeout specified by the request message is 0, then the server
   generates a `243' reply and the binding state machine remains in
   state BID_UNUSED.

   If a `bind_int' request passes all checks described above, then the
   server allocates an external address set provided by the firewall/NAT
   and it establishes a partial binding of the requested binding
   parameter set with the new allocated address. Then the state machine
   for this BID enters the state BIND_INT_ONLY and the server generates
   a `241' reply reporting

     - the BID allocated for this binding,

     - the binding parameter set of the bound external address set,

     - the timeout in seconds after which the binding will automatically
       be removed by the server. The timeout chosen by the server is
       less than or equal to the value specified by the client in the
       `bind_int' request message, but not greater than the binding-

       group timeout of the corresponding binding-group

   If a `bind_ext' request passes the checks, the server allocates an
   internal address set provided by the firewall/NAT and it establishes
   a partial binding of the requested binding parameter set to the new
   allocated address.  Then the state machine for this BID enters the
   state BIND_EXT_ONLY and the server generates a `241' reply reporting

     - the BID allocated for this binding,

     - the binding parameter set of the bound internal address set,

     - the timeout in seconds after which the binding will automatically
       be removed by the server. The timeout chosen by the server is
       less than or equal to the value specified by the client in the
       `bind_ext' request message, but not greater than the binding-
       group timeout of the corresponding binding-group

   If a `bind_full' request passes all checks described above, then the
   server allocates an external address set and internal address set,
   provided by the firewall/NAT and it establishes a binding of the
   requested binding parameter sets with the new allocated addresses.
   Then the state machine for this BID enters the state FULL_BINDING and
   the server generates a `242' reply reporting

     - the BID allocated for this binding,

     - the first binding parameter set with the internal address set and
       the second binding parameter set with the external address set,

     - the timeout in seconds after which the binding will automatically
       be removed by the server. The timeout chosen by the server is
       less than or equal to the value specified by the client in the
       `bind_full' request message, but not greater than the binding-
       group timeout of the corresponding binding-group


5.4.3.  Transitions from BIND_INT_ONLY and BIND_EXT_ONLY

   In state BIND_INT_ONLY and BIND_EXT_ONLY a partial address binding is
   established.  In these states the client can request to extend the
   binding to a full binding one by sending a `bind_ext' request in
   state BIND_INT_ONLY, by sending a `bind_int' request in state
   BIND_EXT_ONLY or by sending a `bind_full' in both states,
   respectively. The request must contain the BID of the already
   existing partial binding.

   If the request fails the transport parameter set checking, then the
   server generates the according `44X' reply and also it removes the
   already established partial binding. The binding state machine then


Stiemerling & Quittek                                          [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


   enters state BID_UNUSED.  If the timeout specified by the request
   message is 0, then the server generates a `243' reply and removes the
   already established partial binding. The binding state machine then
   enters the state BID_UNUSED.

   Otherwise, if the request passes the checks of the binding parameter
   set, the server creates a full binding to the already known BID and
   chooses a timeout less than or equal to the value specified by the
   request, but not greater than the binding-group timeout of the
   corresponding binding-group. The server generates a `242' reply
   reporting the chosen timeout and the internal and the external
   address set allocated at the NAT/firewall. The BID state machine
   enters state FULL_BINDING.

   Other options for the client are requests for

     - updating the timeout,

     - removing the binding.

   For timeout update and for binding removal the client must use
   exactly the binding parameter set already contained in the previous
   requests for this BID. Should the binding parameter set differ from
   the previous request, the server generates a `445' and the already
   established partial binding is removed.

   If the timeout specified in the request message is 0, the server will
   remove the binding and generate a `243' reply, and the binding state
   machine enters state BID_UNUSED.

   If the timeout specified in the `bind_int' or `bind_ext' request is
   larger than 0, the server must process an update of the binding's
   timeout without any interruption of the NAT/firewall operation for
   this binding.  The server chooses a timeout less than or equal to the
   value, but not greater than the binding-group timeout of the
   corresponding group, in the request message and reports it by
   generating `241' reply.  The binding state machine remains in its
   state.

   At any time, the server may remove the binding. It must do so at
   latest if the timeout expires. But also at any earlier time it may do
   so, for example if the policy for granting binding requests has
   changed, if a mis-use of the binding was detected, or if the server
   cannot continue the operation of the binding for technical reasons.
   In such a case the server generates an asynchronous `540' message
   indicating the removal of the binding and the binding state machine
   enters state BID_UNUSED.

5.4.4.  Transitions from State FULL_BINDING

   In state FULL_BINDING the client can request to

     - update the timeout,

     - remove the binding.

   For timeout update and for binding removal the client can use a
   `bind_int' request, a `bind_ext' request or `bind_full' request.  The
   request must use exactly the binding parameter set already contained
   in the previous `bind_int' request, `bind_ext' request or
   `bind_full', respectively. The server must ensure that such unchanged
   transport parameters pass the transport parameter check.

   If the timeout specified in the request message is 0, the server will
   remove the binding and generate a `243' reply, and the binding state
   machine enters state BID_UNUSED.

   If the timeout specified in the message is larger than 0, the server
   must process an update of the binding's timeout without any
   interruption of the NAT/firewall operation for this binding.  The
   server chooses a timeout less than or equal to the value in the
   request message, but no greater than the binding-group timeout of the
   corresponding group, and reports it by generating `241' reply.  The
   binding state machine remains in its state.

   If the binding parameter set specified in the request message differs
   from ones used in the previous message, the server generates a `445'
   and the already established partial binding is removed.

   At any time, the server may remove the binding. It must do so at
   latest if the timeout expires. But also at any earlier time it may do
   so, for example if the policy for granting binding requests has
   changed, if a mis-use of the binding was detected, or if the server
   cannot continue the operation of the binding for technical reasons.
   In such a case the server generates an asynchronous `540' message
   indicating the removal of the binding and the binding state machine
   enters state BID_UNUSED.


6.  Controlling SIMCO Sessions

   After a secure TCP connection has been established between client and
   server (for example by using TLS [5] or IPSEC [6,7]), the SIMCO
   session requires an initial authentication of the client and the
   server.  This might be technically superfluous, for example if the
   client already authenticated itself when establishing the connection,
   but it is an inevitable step of establishing a SIMCO session. The
   client authenticates itself by sending an `open' request containing


Stiemerling & Quittek                                          [Page 21]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


   an authentication string. The server respectively authenticates
   itself by sending an authentication string in the `221` reply. These
   might be shared secrets (cookies) in simple authentication systems.

   The client closes immediately the SIMCO session abd TCP connection
   when he receives an invalid authentication string from the server.

   For more secure challenge-reply authentication, the client first
   sends an `open' request with an arbitrary authentication string.
   When - as expected - the authentication failed, the server the server
   returns a challengestring in the following `421' reply. Then the
   client sends a second `open' request now containing the correct
   authentication string derived from the challenge string. This
   procedure is illustrated by the following Example (a).

   For message flow examples in this memo we use the following
   indication of the direction of a message:

      C->S: from the client to the server
      C<-S: from the server to the client
      --: comment line
      . . .: some unspecified messages

   Example (a): successful authentication
      -- TCP connection establishment and TLS or IPSEC establishment
      -- client sends dummy authentication string: 0
      C->S: open 1300 SIMCO/1.0 F1EFE 0
      -- server returns challenge string
      C<-S: 421 1300 13e66f34b7416ab9389ccc5b441290aa
      -- client sends correct authentication
      C->S: open 1301 SIMCO/1.0 F1EFE ab54346de6933ff4556a1b23efd70082
      -- server sends the reply with his authentication and capabilities
      C<-S: 221 1301 fe43ec43aa3ff4e789 1800 FW YES
      -- session now in state OPEN
      . . .
      -- SIMCO message exchange
      . . .
      -- client closes session
      C->S: close 40163
      C<-S: 220 Ok
      -- session now in state CLOSED
      -- connection terminated

   If the client fails to authenticate itself after a number of invalid
   `open' requests, the server may disconnect itself from the client.
   The server in Example (b) disconnects after two invalid `open'
   requests.

   Example (b): failed authentication
      -- TCP connection establishment and TLS or IPSEC establishment


Stiemerling & Quittek                                          [Page 22]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


      -- client sends invalid authentication string
      C->S: open 55000 SIMCO/1.0 F1EFE 34EFA
      -- server returns challenge string
      C<-S: 421 55000 13e66f34b7416ab9389ccc5b441290aa
      -- client sends invalid authentication string
      C->S: open 55333 SIMCO/1.0 F1EFE 125d5
      C->S: 421 55333 13e66f34b7416ab9389ccc5b441290aa
      -- server in state CLOSED, client disconnected

   The client closes a session by sending a `close' request.  All
   established bindings configured by this client will remain
   established until their timeout expires. Also the server may
   terminate an open session by sending an asynchronous `520' reply.


7.  Controlling Binding-Groups

   The client can request to establish, extend, and remove binding-
   groups. The request `group` is the only request that is needed to
   perform all of the above mentioned actions. With the requests
   `bind_int', `bind_ext' and `bind_full' bindings can be added to a
   binding-group or removed from a binding-group.

   Each binding-group has a timeout value, which determines when a
   binding-group is automatically removed by the SIMCO server. But
   before removing the binding-group, all bindings in the binding-group
   are removed at first. The timeout value of the binding-group is the
   upper limit of the single binding timeouts, i.e. a single binding can
   never have a timeout value greater than the binding-group timeout.

   Control of binding-group is illustrated by the next Example:
     -- server is in state OPEN
     -- request a new binding-group with a timeout of 2000 seconds
     C->S: group 32345 0 2000
     -- server allocates a new group identifier (GID) of 1 and grants a
     -- binding-group timeout of 1800 seconds
     C<-S: 231 32345 1 1800
     .  .  .
     -- The client removes the binding-group after 1000 seconds
     C->S: group 32345 1 0
     -- binding-group removed
     C<-S: 231 32345 1


8.  Controlling Bindings

   The client can request to establish, extend, modify and remove
   bindings. All of these requests, are variants of a `bind_int', a
   `bind_ext' or a `bind_full' request. The `bind_int' request name is
   derived from `establish a binding of the binding parameter set of an


Stiemerling & Quittek                                          [Page 23]

Internet-Draft       Simple Middlebox Configuration         January 2002


   external address of the NAT/firewall to the parameter set of an
   internal address'. A successful `bind_int' request allows a data
   stream matching the corresponding parameter set to pass the
   NAT/firewall from the external network to the internal one. The
   `bind_ext' request is defined analogously. The `bind_full' request
   name is derived from `establishing a full binding with required
   binding parameter sets`.

   Each binding has a timeout value, which determines when a binding is
   automatically removed by the SIMCO server. The client makes a timeout
   proposal in his `bind_int', `bind_ext' or `bind_full' request and the
   server may accept this proposal or choose a smaller timeout value.
   The upper limit of the for the timeout is the timeout of the
   corresponding binding-group.  For example the server may be
   configured to accept all timeout values up to a predefined maximum
   value. The server informs the client about the chosen timeout in by
   the next reply.

   Control of bindings nad pinholes is illustrated by Example (c)
   showing the establishment and removal of a uni-directional UDP
   binding and pinhole.

   Example (c): NAT control of UDP address binding
      -- server is in state OPEN.
      -- request with GID=1, BID=0 for binding inner IP address
   10.11.1.45
      --   and UDP port 16175 for 180 seconds
      C->S: bind_int 2044 1 0 UDP 1 10.11.1.45 16175 180
      -- server allocates external IP address 195.37.70.5 and UDP port
      --   13222 and binds it to the internal binding parameter set
      --   for 180 seconds. BID=1248.
      C<-S: 241 2044 1248 UDP 1 195.37.70.5 13222 180
      -- binding established
      -- no more messages concerning this BID for 160 seconds
      . . .
      -- binding and pinhole not needed anymore
      -- request to remove by setting timeout to 0
      C->S: bind_int 2067 1 1248 UDP 1 10.11.1.45 16175 0
      -- binding and pinhole removed
      C<-S: 243 2067 1 1248

   Example (d) shows the message flow of a similar request, but in this
   case the server is a pure firewall without any NAT function.
   Therefore the allocated binding parameter set is equal to the one in
   the request.

   Example (d): Firewall control of UDP address binding
      -- server is in state OPEN.
      -- request with GID=1,BID=0 for binding inner IP address
   195.37.70.163

      --   and UDP port 16175 for 180 seconds
      C->S: bind_int 2144 1 0 UDP 1 195.37.70.163 180
      -- server does not allocate its own address, but it opens
      -- a pinhole for the requested binding parameter set.
      C<-S: 241 2144 1249 UDP 1 195.37.70.163 16175 180
      -- pinhole open
      -- no more messages concerning this BID for 160 seconds

      -- request to remove by setting timeout to 0
      C->S: bind_int 2164 1 1249 UDP 1 195.37.70.163 16175 0
      -- pinhole removed
      C<-S: 243 2164 1 1249

   The message flow for controling a full binding at a NAT is
   illustrated by Example (e). It also shows the extension of the
   timeout.

   Example (e): NAT control of TCP full binding
      -- server is in state OPEN.
      -- request with GID=1,BID=0 for binding inner IP address
   10.11.1.50
      --   and TCP port 4524 for 540 seconds
      C->S: bind_int 8888 1 0 TCP 1 10.11.1.50 4524 540
      -- server allocates external IP address 195.37.70.5 and TCP port
      --   17250 and binds it to the internal binding parameter set
      --   for 300 seconds. BID=1250.
      C<-S: 241 8888 1 1250 TCP 1 195.37.70.5 17250 300
      -- request with BID=1250 for binding outer IP address

   The message flow for setting up a partial binding with multiple ports
   at a NAT is illustrated by Example (f).

   Example (f): NAT control of UDP partial binding with multiple ports
      -- server is in state OPEN.
      -- request with GID=1,BID=0 for binding inner IP address
   10.11.1.50
      --   and UDP ports  4000/4001 for 540 seconds
      C->S: bind_int 2432 1 0 UDP 2 10.11.1.50 4000 540
      -- server allocates external IP address 195.37.70.5 and UDP ports
      -- 30100/30101 and binds it to the internal binding parameter set
      --   for 300 seconds. BID=1251.
      S->C: 241 2432 1 1251 UDP 2 195.37.70.5 30100 300

   The last Example (g) shows the rejection of a request, because an
   illegal internal IP address is used.

   Example (g): Rejection of illegal internal IP address
      -- server is in state OPEN
      C->S: BIND_INT 458 1 0 UDP 1 102.12.12.251 1254 300
      C<-S: 442 458
      -- no new binding or pinhole established


9.  Security Considerations

   By their nature firewalls and NATs are a very sensitive points
   concerning network security. In general it appears to be
   contradictive to open a port at a firewall for configuring pinholes,
   because this might make the firewall vulnerable.  Therefore,
   effective means are required for inhibiting mis-use of the SIMCO
   service.

   A SIMCO server should use a restricted list of clients that are
   allowed to use the service. Beyond checking the clients IP address
   and requiring authentication when building up a secure TCP connection
   with TLS or IPSEC, the server should expect the client to
   authenticate itself by using a shared secret or based on a public key
   infrastructure.

   The TCP connection also needs to be protected for ensuring integrity
   of the requests made by the client. Finally, confidentiality of the
   data exchang between client and server is required to hide
   information about the participants of communication services that are
   enabled by SIMCO.
