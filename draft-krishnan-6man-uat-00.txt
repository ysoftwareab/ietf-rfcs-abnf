     Uplink access technology indications in Router Advertisements
                       draft-krishnan-6man-uat-00

Abstract

   In IPv6 networks Router Advertisements can be used for providing
   common configuration information to nodes that are attached.  There
   are some scenarios where it is advantageous for routers to provide
   their uplink access technology information to attached hosts.  This
   document describes a neighbor discovery option that will allow the
   routers to do so.

1.  Introduction

   In several IPv6 networks, the access technology used by routers on
   their uplinks is different from that used on their downlinks.  There
   are some scenarios where it is advantageous for routers to provide
   their uplink access technology information to the hosts attached on
   the downlinks.  One such example is a tethering scenario where a
   mobile phone that uses a cellular uplink such as LTE, shares its
   internet connection to hosts that connect over a local WiFi link.  In
   this case it would be beneficial for hosts to know that the uplink
   connection is a cellular link and potentially modify their behavior
   based on their knowledge. e.g. Application and software updates (and
   similar bulk transfers) could be rescheduled based on administrative
   configuration.

   This document describes an IPv6 Neighbor discovery option [RFC4861]
   for routers to advertise their uplink access technology(ies) in a
   router advertisement message.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Uplink Access Technology option

   This option is to be carried in RA messages sent out by a router on a
   given link.  It specifies the uplink type(s) that the router uses.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     Type      |   Length      |    Uplink Access Technology   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                     reserved (set to 0)                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Type

        8-bit identifier of the type of option. The option identifier
        for the UAT option will be allocated by the IANA.

     Length

        8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including
        the type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.  It MUST be
        set to 1.

     Uplink Access Technology

        A 16-bit field that specifies the uplink access technology used
        by the router sending the Router Avertisement carrying this
        option.

          Figure 1: Uplink Access Technology (UAT) Option Layout

   Multiple UAT options MAY be present in a single Router Advertisement
   message to allow for routers that use multiple uplinks.  This
   document defines the following initial values for the UAT field that
   can be extended by adding new values to the IANA registry.

   UAT   Access Technology
   0x01  3GPP
   0x02  DSL
   0x03  Cable
   0x04  802.3

4.  Router Behavior

   The value of the UAT(s) provided in this option can either be
   administratively configured or implicitly derived from the access
   technology type on the uplink interfaces.

5.  Host Behavior

   The value of the UAT(s) provided in this option is purely
   informational.  It helps the hosts gleam additional information about
   the router's uplink and perform different actions.  Legacy hosts that
   do not recognize this option will simply ignore it.

6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to modify the information provided inside
   this option to make hosts . These attacks can easily be prevented by
   using SeND [RFC3971]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 neighbor discovery option for
   carrying the uplink access technology type(s).  IANA is requested to
   create a new registry for storing uplink access technology types and
   populate it with the following initial values.

   UAT   Access Technology      Reference
   0x01  3GPP                   [RFC-krishnan-6man-uat-00.txt]
   0x02  DSL                    [RFC-krishnan-6man-uat-00.txt]
   0x03  Cable                  [RFC-krishnan-6man-uat-00.txt]
   0x04  802.3                  [RFC-krishnan-6man-uat-00.txt]
