Internet-Draft               PCP NAT-PMP IWF                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp])
   provides LAN based NAT control features which are a subset of the new
   Port Control Protocol (PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]).

   This document is about an Interworking Function (IWF) between NAT-PMP
   clients on internal hosts and a PCP server running on a ISP Carrier-
   Grade NAT.

   Two kinds of IWFs are described:
      Link IWF which serves only clients attached to a LAN
      Home IWF which serves directly or indirectly through Link IWFs all
      the clients of the Home domain
   The Home IWF can be integrated with a UPnP IGD IWF
   [I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking] and/or a PCP Proxy
   [I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy].  Because NAT-PMP does not work through routers,
   an IWF is REQUIRED to serve any LAN where a NAT-PMP client is
   attached.  A Home IWF is REQUIRED per Home domain where a NAT-PMP
   client is to be served.

   Note the NAT-PMP IWF architecture is closed to the PCP Proxy one so a
   knowledge of [I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy] is assumed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  TODO

   To be filled (imports from UPnP IGD IWF / PCP Proxy)


3.  Link IWF

   A Link IWF is used to cross routers, i.e., it allows a NAT-PMP client
   attached to a link where the Home IWF is not connected to get the
   service.

   The Link IWF keeps:
      the IP address of the Home IWF
      a service socket per link where it offers the service
      the source address and port of pending requests
      the operation code of pending requests
   Pending requests are expired after a reasonable timeout, e.g., 30
   seconds.

Internet-Draft               PCP NAT-PMP IWF                  March 2011


   NAT-PMP port requests and responses are mapped to PCP MAP4 requests
   and responses.  A THIRD_PARTY option is used to carry the client
   address.

   public address requests and responses are not mapped to PCP messages
   but are sent to and received from the Home IWF.


4.  Result code mapping

   PCP result codes and error conditions are mapped to NAT-PMP result
   codes following this table:
      a bad version in NAT-PMP request is mapped to code 1 "Unsupported
      Version"
      a bad opcode in NAT-PMP request is mapped to code 5 "Unsupported
      Opcode"
      to have no external address and similar conditions are mapped to
      code 3 "Network Failure"
      NO_RESOURCES and USER_EX_QUOTA are mapped to code 4 "Out of
      resources"
      NOT_AUTHORIZED is mapped to code 2 "Not Authorized/Refused"
      SUCCESS is mapped to code 0 "Success"

5.  Home IWF

   At the exception of public address request handling, a Home IWF works
   as a Smart PCP Proxy.  In particular the Epoch handling is a REQUIRED
   service.

   When the Epoch value is reset, a multicast public address announce
   SHOULD be sent on served links with a multicast capability.

   A Home IWF MUST deal with public address request and response
   internally, i.e., it gets the Epoch value and the external address
   from its internal state.

   The request/response caching and retransmission services SHOULD be
   supported as the IWF adapts retransmission scheduling between
   protocols.


6.  multicast announces

   To be filled.
