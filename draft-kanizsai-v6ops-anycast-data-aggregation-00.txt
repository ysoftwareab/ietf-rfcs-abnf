Abstract

   This document describes how to use anycast addresses for collecting
   feedback information on the reverse link in case of multicast forward
   transmission. The application for anycast addressing in the case of
   multicast transmission is the novelty. The draft describes the
   fundamentals and requirements about how to collect and aggregate
   feedback information if anycasting is applied.

Internet-Draft    Anycast based feedback aggregation        March 2011


1. Introduction

   Cross-optimized communication architectures deeply rely on collection
   and evaluation of different feedback information provided by network
   nodes periodically or on-demand. However, information is often
   represented in a redundant way (e.g., series of measurement data with
   same values can be shortly represented by a single value together
   with zero standard deviation). As a technique to remove redundancy
   and achieve efficient communication, data aggregation has been
   introduced and widely investigated in the literature. The aim of data
   aggregation is to cut back the amount of data to be transmitted while
   still distributing the required information about events of interest.
   An adequate aggregation scheme can reduce the usage of
   bandwidth/energy/computational power of all architectural components
   and nodes in the network. Data aggregation considers two main
   aspects. On one hand, data-centric aggregation schemes are designed
   to address the encoding, calculation, and compression of aggregatable
   data coming from multiple sources (using aggregation functions such
   as MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, or the probabilistic aggregation). On the other
   hand, routing-centric aggregation mechanisms are supposed to cover
   routing problems: how (e.g., when and where) information pieces
   (i.e., datagrams) can meet each other in order to be aggregated. In
   the sections below we provide a general solution for the latter issue
   by introducing a feedback data aggregation architecture deploying
   designated entities inside the network (called aggregation servers)
   that collect individual feedback information pieces and relay the
   newly composed aggregated data towards further processing in an
   optimal way, all based on IPv6 anycasting.

2. IPv6 anycast based feedback data aggregation

   In this section anycast based feedback aggregation is introduced
   according to different points of view, such as the typical scenario
   where this technique can be used, the required new entities
   introduced in the network and the newly proposed addressing
   architecture for efficient operation.

2.1. Application and usage scenarios

   The typical scenario where the application of IPv6 anycast based
   feedback aggregation can be beneficial is depicted in Figure 1.

   This scenario includes one single Server or Source of a general
   service (S), i.e. content(s), which requires feedback information
   from the subscribers called User Entities (UE). The UEs' connection
   type can be fixed or mobile as well. The feedback information helps
   the server to provide the best service given the current network

         Figure 1 A typical scenario for anycast based aggregation

   A feedback message is usually composed of several small numeric
   values which provide information about the actual quality of the
   service (QoS), network parameters, etc. These values are more often
   generated with high frequency and are only a few bits or bytes long,
   so sending each one to the server separately in an IP packet is a
   critical waste of bandwidth [FeedAgg]. To avoid this, a good solution
   is using IPv6 anycasting [RFC1546] and feedback aggregation in
   combination.

2.2. Terminology

   o Server or Source (S): A node in the network which provides for
      example adaptive multimedia streaming to the User Entities. This
      service is identified with a service anycast address which is
      practically identical and indistinguishable from the IPv6 unicast
      address of the server [RFC4291].

   o User Entity (UE): A user terminal which is able to subscribe to
      the service provided by the Server or Source. It measures some
      parameters of the received service data (e.g. multimedia stream)
      continuously and sends this information back to the adaptive
      Server to keep the QoS of the service as high as possible despite
      the constantly changing network conditions.

Internet-Draft    Anycast based feedback aggregation        March 2011


   o Anycast Capable Router (ACR): An IP packet router which is capable
      of handling anycast addresses and services in the network. The
      anycast service providers (i.e. the Feedback Aggregation Servers)
      are registering themselves in the closest ACR. They send their
      unicast address and the ID of the anycast service they are
      intended to participate in. During the operation of the ACR the
      packets that are addressed to the service's anycast address are
      forwarded to "at least one and preferably only one" service
      provider according to a parameter like hop count, the load of the
      servers, etc [RFC1546] [RFC4786].

   o Anycast routing protocol: A routing protocol running on the ACRs
      besides the normal routing process. This protocol maintains the
      anycast group information which is updated by the service
      providers periodically. A packet addressed to an anycast address
      is routed according to the current group state information to "at
      least one and preferably only one" service provider [RFC1546].

   o Feedback Aggregation Server (FAS): A server node which processes
      the incoming IP messages addressed to the anycast address of the
      service. The individual feedback messages are decapsulated and the
      FAS, which is aware of the feedback types of the given service,
      stores them in separate queues. Every feedback type has a
      lifetime, so the various types of feedback messages must be sent
      within different time constraints. When the timer expires for the
      first message in a queue, the complete content of this queue is
      placed in a new IP packet and sent to the server of the service.

   o Feedback Aggregation Address (FAA): This is the address the IPv6
      packets, containing individual feedback messages, are addressed
      to. The FAA identifies the anycast group of the FASs and the
      Source. In practice, this address should be one of the Source's
      unicast addresses. This provides feedback delivery also in the
      cases when no ACR is present in the path from the UE back to the
      Source.

2.3. Protocol Operation Overview and Addressing

   The service Source and the Feedback Aggregation Servers are in the
   same anycast group, addressable with the same anycast address, which
   should be one of the unicast addresses of the server [RFC4291]. The
   Source and the Feedback Aggregation Server are marked in the same way
   in Figure 2 according to the above reason. The Server should have
   assigned at least two unicast addresses, one used as the anycast
   group address and the other used by the aggregated IP packets sent by
   the FASs. The unicast packet forwarding between the FASs and the
   Source prevents packet looping between ACRs and FASs (Figure 2).

              Figure 2 Possible paths for a feedback message

   Using one of the unicast addresses of the service Source as anycast
   group address ensures that a packet is delivered to the proper
   destination even if it crosses only unicast capable routers along the
   path back to the source (Figure 3).

                Figure 3 Feedback message path without ACRs

   IPv6 anycasting helps reaching the aggregation servers in an optimal
   way: a UE addresses the feedback packets to the anycast address (FAA)
   of the aggregation servers (FAS), ensuring packets are delivered to
   the "closest" aggregation server (or directly to the service Source
   if this is the closest member of the anycast group (Figure 2 upper
   arrow)) using anycast routing protocol which is implemented in the
   intermediate Anycast Capable Routers (ACR). Note, that it is not
   necessary that all the routers be anycast capable: however, in this
   case, only sub-optimal transmission of feedback data is achievable.
   Furthermore, in this network scenario the stateless property of
   anycast communication [RFC1546] does not raise any problem, since the
   UEs send individual feedback packets and it makes no difference which
   aggregation server they are delivered to.

   Aggregation servers supported by anycast communication provide
   Network-level (or System-level) aggregation in a (sub-)optimal way.
   After receiving feedback data from individual UEs the FASs aggregate
   the information and relay this newly composed aggregated data towards
   the adaptive service Source.

3. Benefits of using anycast based aggregation

   In accordance with the literature, the aggregation ratio at network-
   level is determined by the length of the tracking history and the MTU
   size on the aggregation server's uplink. On average an aggregation
   ratio between 2 and 10 can be achieved. By applying this solution the
   overhead in the core network can be significantly reduced allowing
   also for an increased number of servable UEs for a given uplink
   transmission capacity of the Source.

4. Security Considerations

   The above introduced solution does not raise new security issues or
   requirements, thus the considerations from [RFC1546] and [RFC4786]
   apply as well to this document.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document has no new IANA considerations.
