                 IPv6 ND PIO Flags IANA considerations
                     draft-troan-6man-ndpioiana-00

Abstract

   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router
   Advertisement defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags defined and
   the remaining 6 bits reservered (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has defined a
   new flag from this field without creating a IANA registry or updating
   RFC 4861.  The purpose of this document is to request IANA to create
   a new registry for the PIO flags to avoid potential conflict in the
   use of these flags.

1.  Introduction

   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router
   Advertisement defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags defined and
   the remaining 6 bits reservered (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has defined a
   new flag from this field without creating a IANA registry or updating
   RFC 4861.  The purpose of this document is to request IANA to create
   a new registry for the PIO flags to avoid potential conflict in the
   use of these flags.

2.  Current Prefix Information Option flags

   Currently, the NDP Prefix Information Option contains the following
   one-bit flags defined in published RFCs:


                               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                              |L|A|R|Reserved1|
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.  Updates to RFC4861

   This document updates RFC4861 with the new IANA Considerations
   section specified below.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to create a new registry for IPv6 ND Prefix
   Information Option flags.  This should include the current flags in
   the PIO option.  The format for the registry is:



       +---------------+---------------------------------+-----------+
       | RA Option Bit | Description                     | Reference |
       +---------------+---------------------------------+-----------+
       | 0             | L - On-link Flag                | [RFC4861] |
       | 1             | A - Autonomous Address          | [RFC4861] |
       |               |     Configuration Flag          |           |
       | 2             | R - Router Address Flag         | [RFC6275] |
       +---------------+---------------------------------+-----------+


                                 Figure 2

   The assignment of new flags in the PIO option header require
   standards action or IESG approval.

   The registry for these flags should be added to:
