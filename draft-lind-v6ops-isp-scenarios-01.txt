   Abstract 
    
      This document describes different scenarios for the introduction of 
      IPv6 into an existing IPv4 ISP network without disrupting the IPv4 
      service. During the IPv6 introduction can the network go through 
      different stages. The first one is the initial stage of an IPv4-only 
      infrastructure, and the final one corresponds to a whole dual-stack 
      infrastructure enabling full coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic 
      and services. In between, typical intermediate stages involving

   1. Introduction 
       
      An ISP offering an IPv4 service will find that there are different 
      ways to add IPv6 to this service.  During the introduction of IPv6 
      the network will go through different stages of IPv6 maturity.  In 
      addition to this there has to be a transition between these stages 
      to make them feasible to implement.  The main goal of this document 
      is to provide possible scenarios to the ISP when introducing IPv6 
      connectivity in the existing ISP IPv4 legacy network.   
       
      In this document different transition scenarios and situations 
      during the introduction of IPv6 are covered in a broader perspective 
      and deals only with a generic view of how an ISP network is built.  
      This should be seen as the starting point for further documentation

      in an ISP network. 
       
       
   2. Scope of the document 
       
      The scope of the document is to describe different cases for the 
      introduction of an IPv6 service in a generic IPv4 ISP network. This 
      means that the document will be limited to services that include 
      both IPv6 and IPv4 and will not cover issues surrounding an IPv6 
      only service. Therefore, the ISP network should be able to carry 
      IPv4 and IPv6 traffic without any distinction related to the version 
      of the protocol.  
       
      The different building blocks that will be considered are the 
      customer network, the access networks, the core network and exchange 
      points.  
       
      The network can be at a different stage relating to, either how far 
      it has adopted IPv6, or to how likely it may be upgraded to IPv6. We 
      will consider these stages, as well as the transition scenarios 
      between the different stages. 
       
      It is outside the scope of this document to describe different types 
      of access or network technologies. It is also outside of the scope 
      to propose different solutions. Solutions will be covered in a 
      separate document. 
       
       
   3. Terminology used 
       
      This section defines and clarifies the terminology used in this 
      document: 
       
      "CPE"         : Customer Premise Equipment 
       
      "PE"          : Provider Edge equipment 
          
      "Access"      : This is the part of the network which is used by a  
                      customer when connecting to an ISP network. It  
                      includes the CPEs, the last hop links and the parts  
                      of the PE interfacing to the last hop links. 
       
      "Core"        : This is the rest of the ISP network infrastructure.

                      It includes the parts of the PE interfacing to the  
                      core backbone, the core routers of the ISP and the  
                      border routers used in order to exchange routing  
                      information with other ISPs (or other administrative 
                      entities). 
       
      "IT infrastructure" :  
                      This is the part of the ISP network which hosts the  
                      services required for the correct operation of the 
                      ISP network. It usually includes DNS servers,Radius  
                      servers, monitoring and configuration  
                      applications... 
       
      "Dual network": A network which supports natively both IPv4 and  
                      IPv6. 
       
       
   4. Brief description of a generic ISP network 
       
      A generic ISP network topology can be divided into two main parts; 
      the core network and the access networks connecting the customers.  
       
      The core network or the backbone is the part of the network that 
      interconnects the different access networks and provides transport 
      to the rest of the Internet via exchange points or other means. The 
      core network can be built on different technologies but in this 
      document the only interest is whether it is capable of carrying IPv6 
      traffic natively or not. Since there is no clear definition of core, 
      it is defined in this document as being all routers that are a part 
      of the same routed domain in the transport network. This means that 
      all routers up to the PE router are a part of the core. The PE 
      router can also be partially part of the core if it exchanges 
      routing information and transports traffic to and from the core.   
       
      The access networks provide connectivity to enterprise and private 
      customers. Other ISPs might as well be customers and connected to 
      the ISP's access network. As with the core the absence or presence 
      of native IPv6 capability is the only thing of real interest in the 
      access network technology.  
       
      It is noticeable that, in some cases (e.g. European legacy 
      operators), a given access network may have to be shared between 
      different ISPs. According to the type of the access network used 
      (e.g. involving only layer 2 devices, or involving non-IP 

    
    
    
   Lind, et al.             Expires - April 2004                 [Page 4] 
    
   Internet-Draft      IPv6 Scenarios in ISP networks        October 2003 
    
    
    
      technology), this constraint result into architectural 
      considerations that may be relevant in the analysis document. 
          
      "IT infrastructure" building blocks refer to the basic main 
      functions needed for a regular backbone operation. This building 
      block is dealing with: network management, customers' authentication 
      and accounting, address assignment and naming. It represents the 
      minimum functions needed to provide a customer service, referring to 
      both network infrastructure operation, and administrative management 
      of customers. 
       
      It doesn't matter if these customer networks have a single node or a 
      large routed network. What is of interest is if routing information 
      is exchanged or not since it will affect the ISP's network. The 
      existence of customer placed equipment will also affect how a 
      service can be delivered. In addition to the ISP's actual network 
      components there are a lot of support and backend systems that have 
      to be considered.

   Internet-Draft      IPv6 Scenarios in ISP networks        October 2003 
    
    
    
    
   5. Scenarios 
       
      The scenarios section describes different stages an ISP might 
      consider when introducing IPv6 connectivity in the existing IPv4 
      network and the different scenarios that might occur in the 
      respective stages.  
       
      The stages here are snapshots of an ISP's network with respect to 
      IPv6 maturity.  Since an ISP's network is constantly evolving, a 
      stage is a measure of how far an ISP has come in turn of 
      implementing necessary functionality to offer IPv6 to the customers. 
       
      It is possible to freely transition between different stages.  
      However, a network segment can only be in one stage at a time but an 
      ISP network as a whole can be in different stages.  There are 
      different transition paths between the first and final stage.  The 
      transition between two stages does not have to be immediate but can 
      occur gradually. 
       
      Each stage has different IPv6 properties.  An ISP can therefore, 
      based on the requirements it has, decide into which stage it will 
      transform its network. 
       
       
   5.1 Assumptions 
       
      The stages are derived from the generic description of an ISP 
      network in section 3.  A combination of different building blocks 
      that constitute an ISP environment will lead to a number of 
      scenarios, which an ISP can choose from.  The scenarios of most 
      relevance to this document are considered to be the ones that in the 
      most efficient and feasible way maximize the ability for an ISP to 
      offer IPv6 to its customers. 
       
      The most predominant case today is considered to be an operator with 
      a core and access IPv4 network delivering IPv4 service to a customer 
      that is running IPv4 as well.  At some point in the future, it is 
      expected that the customer will want to have an IPv6 service, in 
      addition to the already existing IPv4 service. This IPv6 service may 
      be offered by the same ISP, or by a different one. Anyway the 
      challenge for the ISP is to deliver the requested IPv6 service over 
      the existing infrastructure and at the same time keep the IPv4 
      service intact.

   Internet-Draft      IPv6 Scenarios in ISP networks        October 2003 
    
    
    
       
       
   5.2 Customer requirements and ISP offerings 
       
      Looking at the scenarios from the end customer's perspective there 
      might be a demand for three different services; the customer might 
      demand IPv4 service, IPv6 service or both services.  This can lead 
      to two scenarios depending on the stage the ISP's network is in. 
       
      If an ISP only offers IPv4 or IPv6 service and a customer wants to 
      connect a device or network that only supports one service and if 
      that service is not offered, it will lead to a dead-end.  If the 
      customer or ISP instead connects a dual stack device it is possible 
      to circumvent the lack of the missing service in the access network 
      by using some kind of coexistence mechanism.  This scenario will 
      only be considered in the perspective of the ISP offering a 
      mechanism to bridge the access and reach the IPv6 core. 
       
      In the case where the customer connects a single stack device to a 
      corresponding single stack access network or when the customer 
      connects a single stack device to a dual stack access network is 
      covered by the all over dual stack case. Therefore, neither of these 
      cases need further be explored separately in this document but can 
      be seen as a part of a full dual stack case. 
       
      After eliminating a number of cases explained above, there are four 
      stages that are most probable and where an ISP will find its network 
      in.  Which stage a network is in; depends on whether or not some 
      part of the network previously has been upgraded to support IPv6 or 
      if it is easier to enable IPv6 in one part or another.  For 
      instance, routers in the core might have IPv6 support or might be 
      easily upgradeable, while the hardware in the access might have to 
      be completely replaced in order to handle IPv6 traffic. 
       
      Note that in every stage except Stage 1, the ISP can offer both IPv4 
      and IPv6 services to the customer. 
       
      The four most probable stages are: 
       
            o Stage 1      Launch 
            o Stage 2a     Core 
            o Stage 2b     Access 
            o Stage 3      Complete 
       

    
    
    
   Lind, et al.             Expires - April 2004                 [Page 7] 
    
   Internet-Draft      IPv6 Scenarios in ISP networks        October 2003 
    
    
    
      Generally the ISP is able to upgrade current IPv4 network to 
      IPv4/IPv6 dual network via Stage 2b but the IPv6 service can also be 
      implemented at a small cost with simple tunnel mechanisms on the 
      existing system.  When designing a new network Stage 3 might be the 
      first and last step since there is no legacy concerns. Absence of 
      IPv6 capability in the network equipment can still be a limiting 
      factor nevertheless.  
       
       
   5.3 Stage 1 Scenarios: Launch 
       
      The first stage is an IPv4 only ISP with an IPv4 customer. This is 
      the most common case today and has to be the starting point for the 
      introduction of IPv6.  From this stage, an ISP can move (transition) 
      to any other stage with the goal to offer IPv6 to its customer. 
        
      The scenario and the immediate first step is to get a prefix 
      allocation (typically a /32) from the appropriate RIR according to 
      allocation process. For the IPv6 migration scenarios described in 
      this document, an ISP has to be able to exchange IPv6 traffic, e.g. 
      by connecting to an exchange, through a direct peering/transit or a 
      tunnel, prior to introducing customers in Stage2 and Stage 3.

   5.4 Stage 2a Scenarios: Core 
       
      Stage 2a is an ISP with access networks that are IPv4 only and a 
      core that is IPv4 and IPv6.  In particular, the ISP considers it 
      possible to make the core IPv6 capable either through software or 
      hardware upgrades. In this stage the customer should have support 
      for both IPv4 and IPv6 and use a tunneling mechanism to be able to 
      run the IPv6 service. To offer the IPv6 service, the ISP also has to 
      exchange IPv6 traffic with other ISPs e.g. by connecting to an IPv6 
      exchange point. In particular, An ISP has to provide IPv6 
      connectivity through its IPv4 access networks.   
       
      An ISP can consider two kinds of scenarios such as automatic tunnels 
      (e.g. provided by the 6to4 mechanism) and configured tunnels to 
      bring IPv6 connectivity on top of an IPv4 only service.  Both 
      methods have advantages and limitations which are out of scope in 
      this document and will be covered in the analysis document. The 
      existence of NATs and firewalls in the path is also to be 
      considered.

   5.5 Stage 2b Scenarios: Access 
        
      Stage 2b is an ISP with a core network that is IPv4 and an access 
      network that is IPv4 and IPv6. Since the service to the customer is 
      native IPv6 there is no requirement for the customer to support both 
      IPv4 and IPv6. This is the biggest difference in comparison to the 
      previous stage.  The need to exchange IPv6 traffic or similar still 
      exists but might be more complicated than in the previous case since 
      the core isn't IPv6 enabled. After completing stage 2b the original

      IPv4 core still is unchanged. This doesn't imply that there is no 
      IPv6 core just that the IPv6 core is an overlay to or partially 
      separated from the IPv4 core.  
       
      Like in section 5.4 tunnels is a possible scenario and can be used 
      for IPv6 connectivity over the IPv4 network parts. Other forms of 
      transport over for example an MPLS enabled core are also possible 
      scenarios.  
       
      Generally, the ISP will continue providing IPv4 connectivity; in 
      many cases private addresses and NATs will continue to be used.  
      Access networks should make use of a mechanism to delegate a global 
      IPv6 address prefix from the ISP to the customer.

   5.6 Stage 2a and 2b combination scenarios 
       
      Some ISPs may use different access technologies of varying IPv6 
      maturity. This may results in a combination of the former stages. 
       
      The case depicted in the figure 5 below, has no impact on stage 2a 
      since it results in interconnection a dual access network to a dual 
      core network.

   5.7 Stage 3 scenarios: Complete 
       
      Stage 3 can be said to be the final step in introducing IPv6, at 
      least in the scope of this document.  This is an all over IPv6 
      service with native support for IPv6 and IPv4 in both core and 
      access networks.  This stage is identical to the previous stage in 
      the customer's perspective since the access network hasn't changed.  
      The requirement for exchanging IPv6 traffic is identical to stage 2.

   5.8 Impact on the "IT infrastructure" 
    
      The different stages above are dealing with fundamental issues such 
      as IPv6 connectivity and IPv6 traffic forwarding. 
       
      Some other background tasks must be realized in parallel to complete 
      the new IPv6 service. The main tasks identified are: 
      - Customer authentication and accounting 
      - Address assignment 
      - Network management 
      - Naming service 
       
      Customer authentication and accounting and address assignment are 
      relevant to the access network, and address assignment may have an 
      impact on the core network. 
       
      Network management is relevant to both access and core networks. 
       
      Naming service intends to address minimum DNS facilities an ISP may 
      have to provide. 
       
      From a general point of view these functions may be realized based 
      on an IPv4 transport layer, an IPv6 transport layer, or both. 
       
      A service, such as a web server, advertised by an IPv6 address must 
      be reachable from any IPv6 node.

   6. Transition Scenarios 
       
      Given the different stages it is clear that the ISP has to be able 
      to transition from one stage to another.  The initial stage, in this 
      document, is the IPv4 only service and network.  The end stage is 
      the dual IPv4/IPv6 service and network.  As mentioned in the scope, 
      this document does not cover the IPv6 only service and network and 
      its implications on IPv4 customers.  This has nothing to do with the 
      usability of an IPv6 only service.  
       
      The transition starts out with the IPv4 ISP and then moves to one of 
      three choices.  These choices are the different transition 
      scenarios. One way would be to upgrade the core first which leads to 
      stage 2a. Another way to go could be to upgrade the access network 
      which leads to stage 2b.  The final possibility is to introduce IPv6 
      in the whole network at once which would lead to stage 3.  
       
      The choice is dependent on many different issues.  For example it 
      might not be possible to upgrade the core or the access network 
      without large investments in new equipment which could lead to any 
      of the two first choices.  In another case it might be easier to 
      take the direct step to a complete IPv6/IPv4 network due to routing 
      protocol issues or similar.  
       
      If a partially upgraded network (stage 2a or 2b) was chosen as the 
      first step, a second step remains before the network is all over 
      native IPv6/IPv4.  This is the transition to an all over dual stack 
      network.  This step is perhaps not necessary for stage 2b with an 
      already native IPv6 service to the customer but might still occur 
      when the timing is right.  For stage 2a it is more obvious that a 
      transition to a dual stack network is necessary since it has to be 
      done to offer a native IPv6 service.  
       
      As most of the ISPs keep evolving continuously their core IPv4 
      networks (new firmware versions in the routers, new routers), they 
      will be able to get them IPv6 ready, without additional investment, 
      except the staff training. It may be a slower transition path, but 
      useful since it allows an IPv6 introduction without any actual 
      customer demand. This will probably be better than making everything 
      at the last minute with a higher investment.

   7. Future Stages 
       
      After a while the ISP might want to transition to a service that is 
      IPv6 only, at least in certain parts of the network.  This 
      transition creates a lot of new cases in which to factor in how to 
      maintain the IPv4 service.  Providing an IPv6 only service is not 
      much different than the dual IPv4/IPv6 service described in stage 3 
      except from the need to phase out the IPv4 service.  The delivery of 
      IPv4 services over an IPv6 network and the phase out is left for a 
      future document.  
       
       
   8. Example networks 
       
      In this section, a number of different network examples are 
      presented. They are only example networks and will not necessary 
      match to any existing networks. Nevertheless, the examples will 
      hopefully be useful even in the cases when they do not match the 
      target networks. The purpose of the example networks is to exemplify 
      the applicability of the transition mechanisms described in this 
      document on a number of different example networks with different 
      prerequisites. 
       
      The example network layout will be the same in all network examples. 
      The networks examples are to be seen as a specific representation of 
      the generic network with a limited number of network devices. An 
      arbitrary number (in this case 7) of routers have been selected to 
      represent the network examples. However, since the network examples 
      follow the implementation strategies recommended for the generic 
      network scenario, it should be possible to scale the example to fit 
      a network with an arbitrary number, e.g. several hundreds or 
      thousands, of routers. 
       
      The routers in the example are interconnected with each other as 
      well as with another ISP. The connection to another ISP can either 
      be a direct connection or through an exchange point. In addition to 
      these connections, there are also a number of access networks 
      connected to the routers. Access networks are normally connected to 
      the core via access routers, but can in some cases be directly 
      connected to the core routers. As described earlier in the generic 
      network scenarios, the access networks are used to connect the 
      customers. Access networks can, for example, be xDSL or cable 
      network equipment.

   8.1 Example 1 
    
      In example 1 a network built according to the example topology is 
      present with a native IPv4 core, the routers. The core is running 
      IS-IS and IBGP as routing protocol for internal and external routes

      respectively. In the connection to ISP2 and the exchange point MBGP 
      is used to exchange routes. Multicast is present and is using PIM-SM 
      routing. QoS is present and is using DiffServ. 
       
      Access 1 is xDSL, connected to the core through an access router. 
      The xDSL equipment, except for the access router, is considered to 
      be layer 2 only, e.g. Ethernet or ATM. IPv4 addresses are 
      dynamically assigned to the customer using DHCP. No routing 
      information is exchanged with the customer. Access control and 
      traceability is done in the access router. Customers are separated 
      in VLANs or separate ATM PVCs up to the access router. 
       
      Access 2 is Fiber to the building/home connected directly to the 
      core router. The FTTB/H is considered to be layer 3 aware and 
      performs access control and traceability through its layer 3 
      awareness. IPv4 addresses are dynamically assigned to the customers 
      using DHCP. No routing information is exchanged with the customer. 
       
       
   8.2 Example 2 
       
      In example 2 the core is running IPv4 with MPLS. Routing protocols 
      used are OSPF and IBGP for internal and external routes. In the 
      connection to ISP2 and the exchange point BGP is used to exchange 
      routes. Multicast and QoS are not present.  
       
      Access 1 is a fixed line access, e.g. fiber, connected directly to 
      the core. CPE is present at the customer and routing information is 
      in some cases exchanged otherwise static routing is used. Access 1 
      can also be connected to BGP/MPLS-VPN running in the core.  
       
      Access 2 is xDSL connected directly to the core router. The xDSL is 
      layer 3 aware. Addresses are dynamically assigned using DHCP. Access 
      control is achieved on the physical layer and traceability is 
      achieved using DHCP snooping. No routing information is exchanged 
      with the customer.    
    
    
   8.3 Example 3 
       
      A transit provider offers IP connectivity to other providers, but 
      not to end users or enterprises. IS-IS and IBGP is used internally 
      and BGP externally. Its accesses connect Tier-2 provider cores. No 
      multicast or QoS is used.
