             draft-hyun-i2nsf-registration-interface-dm-00

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG data model for the Registration
   Interface between Security Controller and Developer's Management
   System in the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF)
   framework.  The data model is required for the instance registration
   of Network Security Functions (NSFs) and the dynamic life cycle
   management of NSF instances.

Internet-Draft      Registration Interface Data Model         March 2017


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG [RFC6020] data model that defines the
   required data for the Registration Interface between Security
   Controller and Developer's Management System in the Interface to
   Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework [i2nsf-framework].  This
   Registration Interface can be used to dynamically manage a pool of
   the instances of Network Security Functions (NSFs).  This document
   defines a YANG data model based on the [i2nsf-reg-inf-im].  The terms
   used in this document are defined in [i2nsf-terminology].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [i2nsf-terminology],
   [capability-im], [i2nsf-framework], [nsf-triggered-steering],
   [supa-policy-data-model], and [supa-policy-info-model].

   o  Network Security Function (NSF): A function that is responsible
      for specific treatment of received packets.  A Network Security
      Function can act at various layers of a protocol stack (e.g., at
      the network layer or other OSI layers).  Sample Network Security
      Service Functions are as follows: Firewall, Intrusion Prevention/
      Detection System (IPS/IDS), Deep Packet Inspection (DPI),
      Application Visibility and Control (AVC), network virus and
      malware scanning, sandbox, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Distributed
      Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation and TLS proxy.
      [nsf-triggered-steering]

   o  Advanced Inspection/Action: As like the I2NSF information model
      for NSF facing interface [capability-im], Advanced Inspection/
      Action means that a security function calls another security
      function for further inspection based on its own inspection
      result. [nsf-triggered-steering]

   o  Network Security Function Profile (NSF Profile): NSF Profile
      specifies the inspection capabilities of the associated NSF
      instance.  Each NSF instance has its own NSF Profile to specify
      the type of security service it provides and its resource capacity
      etc. [nsf-triggered-steering]

   o  Data Model: A data model is a representation of concepts of
      interest to an environment in a form that is dependent on data

Internet-Draft      Registration Interface Data Model         March 2017


      repository, data definition language, query language,
      implementation language, and protocol. [supa-policy-info-model]

   o  Information Model: An information model is a representation of
      concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is
      independent of data repository, data definition language, query
      language, implementation language, and protocol.
      [supa-policy-info-model]

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams
   [i2rs-rib-data-model] is as follows:

      Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

      Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

      Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

      Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

      Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

4.  High-Level YANG

   This section provides an overview of the high level YANG.

4.1.  Registraion Interface

   module : ietf-i2nsf-regs-interface-model
     +--rw regs-req
     |  uses i2nsf-regs-req
     +--rw life-cycle-mgnt-req
     |  uses i2nsf-life-cycle-mgnt-req


         Figure 1: High-Level YANG of I2NSF Registration Interface

   Each of these sections mirror sections of [i2nsf-reg-inf-im].

Internet-Draft      Registration Interface Data Model         March 2017


4.2.  Registration Request

   This section expands the i2nsf-regs-req in Figure 1.

   Registration Request
     +--rw i2nsf-regs-req
       +--rw nsf-profile
       |  uses i2nsf-nsf-profile
       +--rw nsf-access-info
       |  uses i2nsf-nsf-access-info


          Figure 2: High-Level YANG of I2NSF Registration Request

   Registration Request contains the capability information of newly
   created NSF to notify its capability to Security Controller.  The
   request also contains Network Access Information so that the Security
   Controller can access the NSF.

4.3.  Life-Cycle Management Request

   This section expands the i2nsf-life-cycle-mgnt-req in Figure 1.

   Life-Cycle Management Request
     +--rw i2nsf-life-cycle-mgnt-req
       +--rw req-level uint16
       +--rw req-id uint64
       +--rw (req-type)?
         +--rw (req-creation-type)
           +--rw nsf-profile
           |  uses i2nsf-nsf-profile
         +--rw (req-elimination-type)
           +--rw nsf-access-info
           |  uses i2nsf-nsf-access-info

        Figure 3: High-Level YANG of I2NSF Life Cycle Mgnt Request

   Life-cycle managment request consists of two types: req-creation-type
   and req-elimination-type.  The creation type is used to request
   generation of a new NSF instance with NSF Profile which specifies
   required NSF capability information.  The elimination type is used to
   remove an existing NSF with NSF Access Information.

4.4.  NSF Profile

   This section expands the i2nsf-nsf-profile in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Internet-Draft      Registration Interface Data Model         March 2017


   NSF Profile
     +--rw i2nsf-nsf-profile
       +--rw i2nsf-capability
       |  uses ietf-i2nsf-capability
       +--rw performance-capability
       |  uses i2nsf-nsf-performance-caps

              Figure 4: High-Level YANG of I2NSF NSF Profile

   In Figure 4, ietf-i2nsf-capability refers module ietf-i2nsf-
   capability in [i2nsf-capability-dm]. we add the performance
   capability because it is absent in [i2nsf-capability-dm].

4.5.  NSF Access Information

   This section expands the i2nsf-nsf-access-info in Figure 2 and
   Figure 3.

   NSF Access Information
     +--rw i2nsf-nsf-access-info
       +--rw nsf-address  inet:ipv4-address
       +--rw nsf-port-number inet:port-number

        Figure 5: High-Level YANG of I2NSF NSF Access Informantion

   This information is used by other components to access an NSF.

4.6.  NSF Performance Capability

   This section expands the i2nsf-nsf-performance-caps in Figure 4.

   NSF Performance Capability
     +--rw i2nsf-nsf-performance-caps
       +--rw cpu-num uint16
       +--rw disk-size uint16
       +--rw ram-size uint16

       Figure 6: High-Level YANG of I2NSF NSF Performance Capability

   When the Security Controller asks the Developer Mgnt System to create
   a new NSF instance, the performance capability is used to specify the
   spec of the new instance.

5.  YANG Modules

   This section introduces a YANG module for the information model of
   the required data for the registration interface between Security
   Controller and Developer's Management System, as defined in the

6.  Security Considerations

   The information model of the registration interface is based on the
   I2NSF framework without any architectural changes.  Thus, this
   document shares the security considerations of the I2NSF framwork
   architecture that are specified in [i2nsf-framework] for the purpose
   of achieving secure communication among components in the proposed
   architecture.
