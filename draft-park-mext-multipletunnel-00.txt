Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   for multiple tunnel support by adopting an IP mobility management
   scheme in which multiple wireless network interfaces are assigned
   active IPv6 care-of addresses and are used simultaneously to enable
   fast handover.  The mechanism of this document not only enhances the
   handover latency, but also drastically reduces the packet loss and
   improves throughput.

Internet-Draft  Extension of Hierarchical Mobile (E-HMIPv6) for
Multiple Tunnel Support                                  November 2010


1. Introduction

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) allows the mobile nodes (MNs) to
   move within the local Internet topology while maintaining fast
   connections between MNs and correspondent nodes.  This document
   introduces an extension to HMIPv6 for multiple tunnel support
   between an MN and the mobility anchor point (MAP) of HMIPv6. The aim
   of introducing the multiple tunnel support in HMIPv6 is to enhance
   the performance of the handover, and to help MNs achieve fast
   seamless mobility.

   The objective of this document is to develop an IP mobility
   management scheme in which either negligible or no performance
   degradation in both handover latency and packet loss occurs when the
   MN moves between different wireless cells.  We have extended the
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), named E-HMIPv6, such that while
   the MN is moving, parallel distribution packet tunnels between an
   access router and the MN are dynamically constructed using multiple
   wireless network interfaces.  More specifically, the HMIPv6 MAP has
   been extended to instrument parallelism in the packet transmission
   through multiple tunnels with a modification in binding and address
   management.

       An E-MAP is a router located in a network visited by the MN. The
       E-MAP is used by the MN as a local home agent (HA). One or more
       MAPs can exist within a visited network. the E-MAP manages the
       traffic and routing table for the MN to support the multiple
       tunnels.  The structure and function of E-HMIPv6 MAP is described
       in Section 4.1.

   Previous Access Router (PAR)

       The PAR is the MN's default router. The PAR aggregates the
       outbound traffic of MNs. It is the MN's default router prior to
       its handover.

   Next Access Router (NAR)

       The NAR is the MN's default router. The NAR aggregates the
       outbound traffic of MNs. It is the MN's default router subsequent
       to its handover.

   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA)

       An RCoA is an address allocated by the MAP to the MN.

   On-link Care-of Address (LCoA)

       The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on An MN's interface based
       on the prefix advertised by its default router.

   Local Binding Update

       The MN sends a local binding update to the E-MAP in order to
       establish a binding between the RCoA and LCoA.

   On-link Care-of Address interface number (LCoA i)

       The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on An MN's interface based
       on the prefix advertised by its default router. In [RFC 3775],
       this is simply referred to as the care-of address. The letter 'i'
       is depicted as an integer number of network interface.

   Local Unbinding Update (LUU)

       LUU message is used by the MN to unbind the LCoA {number} of the
       MN when An MN needs to delete a binding RCoA and LCoA {number} in
       binding cache table entry at the E-MAP.

3. Overview and Limitations of HMIPv6

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 [RFC 5380] is a localized mobility
   management protocol to reduce the signaling load between the MN and
   its correspondent node or its home agent due to user mobility.  The
   mobility management inside the local domain is handled by a mobility
   anchor point.  The mobility anchor point basically acts as a local
   home agent for the local mobility domain.  As the MN enters into a
   new local mobility domain, called mobility anchor point domain, it
   registers two IP addresses in the binding cache entry: on-link care-
   of address and regional care-of address.  An on-link care-of address
   is a temporary IP address obtained from the next access router in
   the new mobility anchor point domain.  It is same as that of care-of
   address for MIPv6.  A regional care-of address is another temporary
   IP address scheme provided by the new mobility anchor point.  A
   regional care-of address is used by the mobility anchor point to
   inform a home agent and correspondent node of the MN's current
   location.  For the MN in its domain, the mobility anchor point
   maintains a mapping table called the binding cache entry to bind a
   regional care-of address with an on-link care-of address.

   As the MN performs a handover between two access routers within the
   same mobility anchor point domain, only the mobility anchor point
   needs to be informed.  An on-link care-of address can change but a
   regional care-of address does not change.  The packets sent from the
   home agent or correspondent node are intercepted by the mobility
   anchor point and routed to the new on-link care-of address of the MN.
   Therefore, the MN does not have to inform either home agent or
   correspondent node of its new location, i.e., new on-link care-of
   address.  These operations of the mobility anchor point reduce
   direct binding update signaling traffic between the MN and home
   agent/correspondent node.  This results in a reduction of handover
   latency and packet loss.  However, there could be significant
   handover latency and packet loss as the MN moves quickly between
   different access points.  This is because it MAY still have large
   delay and packet loss in getting new on-link care-of address during
   handover.  These large delay and packet loss MAY not be allowable to
   delay-sensitive real-time IP services, such as mobile VoIP and
   mobile IPTV.  The design of the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 does not
   take the "ping-pong" effect into consideration, which further
   degrades the performance while an MN moves back and forth around the
   handover boundary.

4. E-HMIPv6 overview & operation

   Extended Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (E-HMIPv6) scheme introduces a new
   function; the extended MAP and minor extensions to the MN operation.
   The correspondent node and home agent operations will not be
   affected.  Just like Mobile IPv6, this solution is independent of
   the underlying access technology, allowing mobility within or
   between different types of access networks. The hierarchical Mobile
   IPv6 has been extended to support multiple tunnels.

   Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of E-HMIPv6.  The extension of
   HMIPv6 mainly comes with three parts: Simultaneous binding,
   Extension of MAP, i.e., E-MAP and Binding Update Protocol Extension.
   The details of the simultaneous binding and structure of E-MAP are
   described in Section 4.1. Binding Update protocol extension is
   described in subsection 4.2.

   The MN is assumed to be equipped with multiple wireless network
   interfaces, i.e., 3G, Wi-Fi, WiBro network interface, etc. An MN
   entering an E-MAP domain will receive Router Advertisement (RA)
   message containing information about an E-MAP. The MN can bind its
   current address (LCoA) with an address on the E-MAP's subnet (RCoA).
   Acting as a local HA, the E-MAP will receive all packets on behalf
   of the MN it is serving, and will encapsulate and forward them
   directly to the MN's current address. Each network interface of an
   MN is assigned address by access router. If a network interface of
   an MN changes its current address within an E-MAP domain (LCoA
   Number), it only needs to register the new address to the E-MAP. The
   structure of the E-MAP is described in subsection 4.2.

   In Figure 1, an MN is connected through LCoA1 to a previous access
   router (PAR) through interface 1 (IF1). The MN constructs IP tunnel
   with end-points of LCoA1 and RCoA to the E-MAP to exchange packets
   with HA/CN. Interface 1 and interface 2 (IF2) represent two wireless
   network interfaces which are chosen to be activated for data
   transmission from multiple wireless network interfaces. It is
   assumed that the MN selects two wireless network interfaces from
   multiple wireless network interfaces which have the best radio
   signal strengths.

   As the MN moves away from PAR and enters into the overlapping area
   between domains of the PAR and new access router (NAR), the radio
   signal strength from the PAR decreases and it starts to get LCoA2
   and connects to NAR by activating the network interface 2 (IF2).
   As the MN successfully connects to NAR, it requests to the E-MAP for
   binding the LCoA2 with RCoA. In this case, the E-MAP simultaneously
   binds both LCoA1 and LCoA2 with RCoA. In simultaneous binding, the

   packets from HA/CN can be transmitted through bi-directional tunnels.
   In packet transmission, the packets can be transmitted in either
   duplicate or alternate mode. By extending MAP of HMIPv6 and
   utilizing simultaneous binding, the packets from the MN can be sent
   to both PAR and NAR simultaneously and received in a similar way for
   a certain period of time. These can drastically and/or completely
   eliminate the handover delay and packet loss due to link-layer delay
   effect, duplicate address detection (DAD) for getting new LCoA, and
   others such as ping-pong effect.  When the MN moves away from the
   PAR coverage, the MN sends the unbinding update message to E-MAP.
   Unbinding update message is described in more detail in Subsection
   4.2.

   In the MN, the packets from multiple simultaneous tunnels can be
   directed to the home IP address (HoA) using IPv6 home address option.
   In this way, the fast IP handover in E-HMIPv6 can be achieved
   without performance degradation in the handover delay, packet loss
   and throughput. It SHOULD be noted that during handover operation,
   there is no service disruption since the MN is always connected to
   at least one access router during handover operation.

 4.1. Structure of E-MAP

   In this subsection, the structure of the E-MAP, i.e., the extension
   of the mobility anchor point in HMIPv6, is described.
   The MAP in [RFC 5280] of HMIPv6 acts as an HA; it intercepts all
   packets addressed to registered MNs and tunnels them to the
   corresponding LCoA, which is stored in its binding cache entry.
   Figure 2 shows the extended binding cache table entry of the E-MAP.
   Entry components in binding cache table are created by local binding
   update message sent by an MN. The binding cache table entry
   components are composed of the MN's home address, the MN's regional
   care-of address, the MN's on-link care-of address and lifetime.

   An E-MAP has no knowledge of the MN's home address (HoA). The MN
   will send a local binding update to the E-MAP. The aim of this
   binding update is to bind the RCoA (contained in the binding update
   as a home address (HoA)) to the MN's LCoA. If successful, the E-MAP
   returns a binding acknowledgement to the MN, indicating a successful
   registration. The E-MAP SHOULD be able to accept packets tunneled
   from the MN with the MN being the tunnel entry point and the E-MAP
   being the tunnel exit point.

   In order to support multiple tunnels, the binding cache table entry
   of HMIPv6 is extended. More specifically, the LCoA {number} in
   extended binding cache table entry has been newly defined to support
   registration of multiple care-of addresses. LCoA1 is an on-link
   address configured by one interface of multiple interfaces on the MN.
   The MN can acquire its care-of address through conventional IPv6
   mechanisms, such as stateless or stateful auto-configuration [RFC
   3775]. The LCoA {number} field can be renewed through local binding
   update message or local unbinding update message.

   If there exist an on-link care-of address1 and on-link care-of
   address2 on the extended binding cache table entry, the E-MAP
   encapsulates the packets from home agent/correspondent node with the
   on-link care-of address1 or on-link care-of address2 and transmits
   them using two bi-directional tunnels.  The lifetime defines the
   entry duration.  Once the binding lifetime expires, the binding
   entry is deleted.

  4.2. Extension of Binding Update Message

   In order to register and de-register multiple wireless network
   interfaces of an MN to the E-MAP, the local binding update message
   of HMIPv6 is extended by defining new flags.

   Figure 3 shows the extended local binding update message format of
   HMIPv6, the format of which is specified in [RFC 5380].

   The local binding update message is used by an MN to notify other
   node (HA/CN/MAP) of a new care-of address for itself within a MAP
   domain. In [RFC 5380] [RFC 3775], the single flag bits in local
   binding update message format are defined as A, H, L, K and M.  The
   registration location is different from a single flag bit set.

   The extension is comprised of two messages: Local Binding Update and
   Local Unbinding Update. The "U" flag is used to distinguish the
   Local Binding Update from the Local Unbinding Update. The "O" flag
   is used to distinguish the two wireless interfaces: interface1 and
   interface2. The functions of all the other flags are the same as
   described in [RFC 5380].

   The "O" flag and "U" flag set indicate the E-MAP registration for
   interface2's on-link care-of address2 and de-registration for
   interface1's on-line care-of address1, respectively.

   The MN will send a local binding update message to the E-MAP with
   setting of the M and A flags.  If the flags M and A are set, it
   indicates that the binding update request has been sent to network
   interface1.  If the flags M, A and O are set, it indicates that the
   binding update request has been sent to interface2.

 4.3. Signal Flow Diagram for E-HMIPv6 Operation

   Figure 5 shows the exchanges of signaling for the local mobility
   management of E-HMIPv6. The detailed description of the signaling
   operation is below.

   It is assumed that the MN have equipped with extensions of
   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 protocol [RFC 5380]. Assume that MN had
   already acquired an RCoA and LCoA1 by the E-MAP and PAR, and an MN
   is receiving the packet through the PAR.

   Each wireless interface can be assigned with LCoA which is given by
   an access router.  Here, the LCoA1 is the care-of address assigned
   by PAR in the IF1, and the LCoA2 is the on-link CoA assigned by NAR
   in the IF2. The detailed signaling operation is as follows:

      - A MN is exchanging packets with HA/CN using the interface one
      through tunnels which are constructed between the MN and the E-MAP
      with assigned end-points addresses of RCoA and LCoA1.
      - If the MN moves to an overlapping of PAR and NAR domains, the
      IF2 will be activated. The IF2 receives and identifies the RA
      message from NAR. If the prefix information is different from the
      prefix information having the wireless network interface 1, the
      wireless network interface 2 configures the LCoA2.

      - In order to perform neighbor unreachability detection (NUD) for
      the newly generated LCoA2, the MN sends the neighbor solicitation
      message (NS) to the NAR. In response to this message, the NAR
      performs DAD process for LCoA2, and sends the DAD result message
      to the MN using neighbor acknowledgement message (NA). Afterwards,
      the MN sends the LBU message by setting A, M, O flag to the E-MAP.
      The E-MAP updates the extended binding cache Table entry. The MN
      receives the LBAck from the E-MAP through the NAR. In this case,
      the MN does not need to send BU message to its HA and CN.

      - There are two tunnels created: one between E-MAP and PAR, and
      the other between E-MAP and NAR. The E-MAP sends the packet
      simultaneously through the two tunnels using either bi-casting or
      alternate packet distribution mode.

      - As the MN moves far away from the PAR, it sends Local Unbinding
      Update (LUU) to the E-MAP to remove the tunnel between the E-MAP
      and PAR. As soon as the E-MAP receives the LUU message, it deletes
      the LCoA1 from the extended binding cache Table entry, and sends
      back the local unbinding acknowledge to the MN.

5. Security Considerations

   This specification allows An MN to establish multiple tunnels with
   the home agent by assigning active care-of addresses with multiple
   wireless network interfaces.  This essentially allows the MNs home
   address to be reachable through its active interfaces.  This new
   capability has no impact on protocol security; however, it certainly
   improves the MN reachability.


6. IANA Considerations

   Section 4.3 introduces two flags "U" and "O" to the binding  update
   specified in [RFC 5380].


7. Conclusions
   This document proposes a new fast IP mobility management scheme in
   which bi-casting multiple tunnels between mobile node and E-MAP of
   HMIPv6 using multiple wireless network interfaces are dynamically
   constructed during handover operation. The proposed scheme can
   reduce handover latency and packet loss.
