1.  Introduction

   MSR6(Multicast Source Routing over IPv6) is an IPv6 based multicast
   source routing (MSR6) solution, defined in
   [I-D.cheng-spring-ipv6-msr-design-consideration], which leverages the
   benefits of source routing over IPv6 data plane to provide simplified
   multicast TE and BE service in an IPv6 network without unnecessary
   multicast tree status and complex control plane protocols.  MSR6
   needs to reuse the advantages of SRv6 and BIER to implement source
   routing.

   MSR6 has two basic modes of forwarding: one is based on Shortest Path
   First(SPF), which is called MSR6 BE mode; the other is based on
   traffic engineered, which is called MSR6 TE mode.
   [I-D.geng-msr6-traffic-engineering], [I-D.chen-pim-srv6-p2mp-path]
   and [I-D.geng-msr6-rlb-segment] have introduced structured segment
   list by defining arguments in each segment.

   This document defines IPv6 based RBS [I-D.eckert-bier-cgm2-rbs] which
   provides an optional solution for MSR6 TE.  A new type of segment
   End.RBS and the corresponding RBS type sub-TLV in MRH defined in
   [I-D.geng-msr6-traffic-engineering], which could indicate multicast
   tree in the a recuisive bitstring and save the header overhead.

2.  Terminologies

   MSR6: Multicast Source Routing over IPv6, defined in .

   MRH: Multicast Routing Header, a new type of Routing Header which is
   used for MSR6 [I-D.cheng-spring-ipv6-msr-design-consideration].

   Replication Endpoint: the intermediate node of a multicast tree,
   which replicates packet and forwards the packet to the downstream
   nodes.  For MSR6, the Replication Node is called Replication Endpoint
   which can be indicated by the MSR6 Segment and replicate packets
   according to the multicast source routing information encapsulation
   in the MSR6 header of the packet.

   BFR: Bit-Forwarding Router, a router support RBS.

   BIFT: Bit Index Forwarding Table, locally to BFR.

   RU: RecursiveUnit, a Bit String is to be parsed by BFR along the
   multicast tree of the packet, defined in [I-D.eckert-bier-cgm2-rbs]

3.  Explicit Multicast Path with RBS

   This section describes the encoding of explictit multicast path with
   RecursiveUnit BitString Structure (RBS) .

3.1.  RBS Architecture

   An explicit muliticast path is encapsulated with RBS as shown in
   Figure 1.

      +----------+---------------------+---------+
      | TotalLen |     RecursiveUnit   | Padding |
      +----------+---------------------+---------+
                 .                     .
                 ...... TotalLen .......
         Figure 1: Architecture of RBS Address

   For the reference encoding, TotalLen is an 16-bit field that counts
   the size of the RecursiveUnit in bits, permitting for up to 65535 Bit
   long RBS addresses.

   The Rsv filed,which is defined in [I-D.eckert-bier-cgm2-rbs] , is
   omitted in this scenario.

   Padding is used to align the RBS address as required by the IPv6
   encapsulation.

3.2.  Recursive encoding in packet

   This section uses a hierarchical multicast tree as an example to
   describe the RecursiveUnit coding format.

                                   +---+
                                   | R |

   | B1|      | B2|      | B3|  ... | BN|
   +---+      +---+      +---+      +---+
                 Figure 2: Hierarchical multicast tree

   As Shown in Figure 2, the whole explicit multicast path should be
   encapsulated (See Section 3.1) in-packet, which will be parsed by
   each Router along the delivery tree.

   The RecursiveUnit filed is structured as shown in Figure 3.  To
   abbreviate the size of the figure, we use AF for AddressingFiled, and
   RU for RecursiveUnit In the following figures.

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  | TotalLen| BitString | AF 1 | AF 2 | ...| AF M-1 | RU 1 | RU 2 | ...| RU M | Padding |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                                   /         \
                                                /                \
                                            /                        \
                                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+
                                          |BitString|AF 1...N-1|RU 1 ...N|
                                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+
                            Figure 3: RecursiveUnit Filed Structure

   The BitString field guides the first-hop node 'R' to locally
   duplicate packets and forwarding.  The length of BitString matches
   the Maxnumber of adjacencies in node 'R' (See Section 3.3).

Internet-Draft            draft-xu-msr6-rbs-00                March 2022


   The AddressingField consists M-1 fields.  Each filed is an 8-bits
   filed and the value of it is the length of relative RecursiveUnit,
   and may be the offset in some scenario . The length of last
   RecursiveUnit M could be caculated by TotalLen.

   And each RecursiveUnit is structured in same mechnism as shown in
   Figurse 3.

3.3.  RBS BIFT

   RBS BIFT as shown in Figure 4 are containing for each BP an
   adjacency.

      +--+---------+-------------+
      |BP|RecuFlag |    Adjacency|
      +--+---------+-------------+
      | 1|        1|adjacenct BFR|
      +--+---------+-------------+
      | 2|        0|    punt/host|
      +--+---------+-------------+
      |     .....    ...         |
      +--+---------+-------------+
      | N|      ...|         ... |
      +--+---------+-------------+

           Figure 4: RBS BIFT

   The BP of the BIFT are all local to the BFR.  When a BFR receives a
   packet encapuslated with RBS, it expects that the BitString filed
   length must be matched with N, which is configured by BFR.

4.  End.RBS Segment Definition

   When the packet is received by an Replication Endpoint and the DA of
   this packet is a local SID with the function of End.RBS, the packet
   will be replicated based on the RBS sub-TLV defined in section 5.
   The DA of the replicated packets is replaced by the End.RBS for the
   next Replication Endpoinds.

   The behavior of End.RBS is defined in section 5 of
   [I-D.eckert-bier-cgm2-rbs].

5.  RBS Sub-TLV

   MRH defined in [I-D.geng-msr6-traffic-engineering] is as follows:

   Since there is only one RecursiveUnit, the AddressingField is omitted
   at BFR-B.

   BFR-B rewrites the RBS by replacing the RecursiveUnit with
   RecursiveUnit 1 and adjusts the TotalLen and Padding fileds.

   Because there are two recursive BP set in the BitString for R, one
   AddressingFiled is required to indicate the length of RecursiveUnit
   1.

   BFR-E would impose or rewrite a unicast encapsulation to make the
   packet become a unicast packet directed to Client 4.


   The procedures for processing of the packet on BFR-S are very much
   the same as on BFR-R.

   BFR-C receives from BFR-R the packet as shown in Figure 13.  And it
   will make the packet become a unicast packet directed to Client 2.
