Abstract

   As has been noticed, there is exists a huge deployment problem with
   global, interdomain IPv6 multicast: PIM Renzesvous Points (RPs) have
   no way of communicating the information about multicast sources to
   other multicast domains, as there is no MSDP, and the whole
   interdomain Any Source Multicast model is rendered unusable; SSM
   avoids these problems.  This memo outlines a way to embed the address
   of the RP in the multicast address, solving the interdomain multicast
   problem. The problem is three-fold: specify an address format, adjust
   the operational procedures and configuration if necessary, and modify
   PIM implementations of those who want to join or send to a group
   (Designated Routers) or provide one (Rendezvous Points).  In
   consequence, there would be no need for interdomain MSDP.

1. Introduction

   As has been noticed [V6MISSUES], there is exists a huge deployment
   problem with global, interdomain IPv6 multicast: PIM [PIM] RPs have
   no way of communicating the information about multicast sources to
   other multicast domains, as there is no MSDP [MSDP], and the whole
   interdomain Any Source Multicast model is rendered unusable; SSM
   [SSM] avoids there problems.

   This memo outlines a way to embed the address of the RP in the
   multicast address, solving the interdomain multicast problem.  The
   problem is three-fold: specify an address format, adjust the
   operational procedures and configuration if necessary, and modify PIM
   implementations of DR's where receivers/senders are expected use the
   multicast addressing as described in this memo.  In consequence,
   there would be no need for interdomain MSDP.

   The solution is founded upon unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast
   addressing [UNIPRFXM] and making some assumptions about IPv6 address
   assignment for the RPs in the PIM domain.

Internet Draft   draft-savola-mboned-mcast-rpaddr-02.txt      March 2003


   Further, a change in how interdomain PIM operates with these
   addresses is presented: multicast receivers' and senders' DR's join
   or send to (respectively) the RP embedded in the address -- not their
   locally configured RP.

   It is self-evident that one can't embed, in the general case, two
   128-bit addresses in one 128-bit address.  In this memo, some
   assumptions on how this could be done are made.  If these assumptions
   can't be followed, either operational procedures and configuration
   must be slightly changed or this mechanism not be used.

   The assignment of multicast addresses is outside the scope of this
   document; however, the mechanisms are very probably similar to ones
   used with [UNIPRFXM].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Unicast-Prefix-based Address Format

   As described in [UNIPRFXM], the multicast address format is as
   follows:

        |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |
        +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+
        |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  | network prefix | group ID |
        +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+

   Where flgs are "0011".  (The first two bits are yet undefined and
   thus zero.)

3. Modified Unicast-Prefix-based Address Format

   This memo proposes a modification to the unicast-prefix-based address
   format:

      1. If the second high-order bit in "flgs" is set to 1, the address
         of the RP is embedded in the multicast address, as described in
         this memo.

      2. If the second high-order bit in "flgs" was set to 1, interpret
         the last low-order 4 bits of "reserved" field as signifying the
         RP interface ID, as described in this memo.

   In consequence, the address format becomes:

        |   8    |  4 |  4 |  4 |  4 |    8   |       64       |    32    |
        +--------+----+----+----+----+--------+----------------+----------+
        |11111111|flgs|scop|rsvd|RPad|  plen  | network prefix | group ID |
        +--------+----+----+----+----+--------+----------------+----------+
                                        +-+-+-+-+
        flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |0|R|P|T|
                                        +-+-+-+-+

   R = 1 indicates a multicast address that embeds the address of the
   PIM RP.  Then P MUST BE set to 1, and consequently T MUST be set to
   1, as specified in [UNIPRFXM].

   In the case that R = 1, the last 4 bits of previously reserved field
   ("RPad") are interpreted as embedding the interface ID of the RP, as
   specified in this memo.

   R = 0 indicates a multicast address that does not embed the address
   of the PIM RP and follows the semantics defined in [ADDRARCH] and
   [UNIPRFXM].  In this context, the value of "RPad" has no meaning.

4. Embedding the Address of the RP in the Multicast Address

   The address of the RP can only be embedded in unicast-prefix -based
   addresses, but the scheme could be extended to other forms of
   multicast addresses as well.  Further, the mechanism cannot be
   combined with SSM, as SSM has no RP's.

   To identify whether an address is a multicast address as specified in
   this memo and to be processed any further, it must satisfy all of the
   below:

     o it MUST be a multicast address and have R, P, and T flag bits set
       to 1 (that is, be part of the prefix FF7::/12 or FFF::/12)

     o "plen" MUST NOT be 0 (ie. not SSM)

     o "plen" MUST NOT be greater than 96

   The address of the RP can be obtained from a multicast address
   satisfying the above criteria by taking the following steps:

      1. take the last 96 bits of the multicast address add 32 zero bits
         at the end,

      2. zero the last 128-"plen" bits, and

Internet Draft   draft-savola-mboned-mcast-rpaddr-02.txt      March 2003


      3. replace the last 4 bits with the contents of "RPad".

   One should note that there are several operational scenarios when
   [UNIPRFXM] statement "All non-significant bits of the network prefix
   field SHOULD be zero" is ignored.  This is to allow multicast address
   assignments to third parties which still use your RP; see example 2
   below.

   "Plen" higher than 64 SHOULD NOT be used as that would overlap with
   the upper bits of multicast group-id.

   The implementation MUST perform at least the same address validity
   checks to the calculated RP address as to one received via other
   means (like MSDP), to avoid e.g. the address being "::" or "::1".

   One should note that the 4 bits reserved for "RPad" set the upper
   bound for RP's per multicast group address; not the number of RP's in
   a subnet, PIM domain or large-scale network.

5. Examples

5.1. Example 1

   The network administrator of 3FFE:FFFF::/32 wants to set up an RP for
   the network and all of his customers.  He chooses network
   prefix=3FFE:FFFF and plen=32, and wants to use this addressing
   mechanism.  The multicast addresses he will be able to use are of the
   form:

        FF7x:y20:3FFE:FFFF:zzzz:zzzz:<group-id>

   Where "x" is the multicast scope, "y" the interface ID of the RP
   address, and "zzzz:zzzz" will be freely assignable within the PIM
   domain. In this case, the address of the PIM RP would be:

        3FFE:FFFF::y

   (and "y" could be anything from 0 to F); the address 3FFE:FFFF::y/128
   is added as a Loopback address and injected to the routing system.

5.2. Example 2

   As above, the network administrator can also allocate multicast
   addresses like "FF7x:y20:3FFE:FFFF:DEAD::/80" to some of his
   customers within the PIM domain.  In this case the RP address would
   still be "3FFE:FFFF::y" (note the prefix length rule: "plen" does not
   need to have anything to do with real unicast/multicast address
   prefix lengths).

Internet Draft   draft-savola-mboned-mcast-rpaddr-02.txt      March 2003


5.3. Example 3

   In the above network, the network admin sets up addresses as above,
   but an organization wants to have their own PIM domain; that's
   reasonable.  The organization can pick multicast addresses like
   "FF7x:y30:3FFE:FFFF:BEEF::/80", and then their RP address would be
   "3FFE:FFFF:BEEF::y".

5.4. Example 4

   In the above networks, if the admin wants to specify the RP to be in
   a non-zero /64 subnet, he could always use something like
   "FF7x:y40:3FFE:FFFF:BEEF:FEED::/96", and then their RP address would
   be "3FFE:FFFF:BEEF:FEED::y".  There are still 32 bits of multicast
   group-id's to assign to customers and self.

6. Operational Requirements

6.1. Anycast-RP

   One should note that MSDP is also used, in addition to interdomain
   connections between RPs, in anycast-RP [ANYCASTRP] -technique, for
   sharing the state information between different RPs in one PIM
   domain.  However, there are other propositions, like [ANYPIMRP].

   Anycast-RP mechanism is incompatible with this addressing method
   unless MSDP is specified and implemented.  Alternatively, another
   method for sharing state information could be used.

   Anycast-RP and other possible RP failover mechanisms are outside of
   the scope of this memo.

6.2. Guidelines for Assigning IPv6 Addresses to RPs

   With this mechanism, the RP can be given basically any network prefix
   up to /64 (and even beyond, by using the upper bits of multicast
   group-id).  The interface identifier will have to be manually
   configured to match "RPad".

   If an administrator wishes to use an RP address that does not conform
   to the addressing topology, that address can be injected into the
   routing system via a host route.  This RP address SHOULD be assigned
   out of the network's prefix in order to ensure aggregation at the
   border.

7. Required PIM Modifications

   The use of multicast addresses with embedded RP addresses requires
   additional PIM processing.  Namely, a PIM router will need to be able
   to recognize the encoding and derive the RP address from the address
   using the rules in section 4 and to be able to use the embedded RP,
   instead of its own for multicast addresses in this specified range.

   The two key places where these modifications are used are the
   Designated Routers (DRs) on the receiver/sender networks and the RPs
   in the domain where the embdedded address has been derived from (see
   figure below).

   For the foreign DR's (rtrR1, rtrR23, and rtrR4), this means sending
   PIM Join/Prune/Register messages towards the foreign RP (rtrRP_S).
   Naturally, PIM Register-Stop and other messages must also be allowed
   from the foreign RP.  DR's in the local PIM domain (rtrS) do the
   same, but the RP used should the same as with regular Any-Source
   Multicast (ASM); however, see the appendix for more.

   For the RP (rtrRP_S), this means being able to recognize and validate
   PIM messages which use RP-embedded addressing originated from any DR
   at all.

   In particular, there is no need to have all routers (like rtrBB) on
   the path modified: this is a major benefit for quick deployment.

        nodeS - rtrS - rtrRP_S - rtrBB -----+--- rtrR1 - node1
                         |         |        |
        node2_S ---------+         |        +-- rtrR23 - node2
                                   |               |
                                   |               +---- node3
                                   |
                                   +------------ rtrR4 - node4

   In addition, the administration of the PIM domain will require a
   policy decision on where the PIM messages to the encoded RP be sent;
   this is typically assumed to everywhere unless explicitly configured
   otherwise.

   The extraction of the RP information from the multicast address
   should be done during forwarding state creation.  That is, if no
   state exists for the multicast address, PIM must take the embedded RP
   information into account when creating forwarding state.  Depending
   on administrative policy, this would result in a receiver's DR
   initiating a PIM Join towards the foreign RP or a source's DR sending
   PIM Register messages towards the foreign RP.




Savola & Haberman       [Expires September 2003]                [Page 7]

Internet Draft   draft-savola-mboned-mcast-rpaddr-02.txt      March 2003


   It should be noted that this approach removes the need to run inter-
   domain MSDP.  Multicast distribution trees in foreign networks can be
   joined by issuing a PIM Join/Prune/Register to the RP address encoded
   in the multicast address.

7.1. Overview of the Model

   The steps when a receiver wishes to join a group are:

      1. A receiver finds out a group address from some means (e.g. SDR
         or a web page).
      2. The receiver issues an MLD Report, joining the group.
      3. The receiver's DR will initiate the PIM Join process towards
         the RP embedded in the multicast address.

   The steps when a sender wishes to send to a group are:

      1. A sender finds out a group address from some means, whether in
         an existing group (e.g. SDR, web page) or in a new group (e.g.
         a call to the administrator for group assignment, use of a
         multicast address assignment protocol).
      2. The sender sends to the group.
      3. The sender's DR will send the packets unicast-encapsulated in
         PIM unicast-encapsulated in PIM Register-messages to the RP
         address encoded in the multicast address (in the special case
         that DR is the RP, such sending is only conceptual).

   In both cases, the messages then go on as specified in [PIM] and
   other specifications (e.g.  Register-Stop and/or SPT Join); there is
   no difference in them except for the fact that the RP address is
   derived from the multicast address.

   When sending or receiving, there is a special case when the DR is in
   local domain, and information about RP to be used with the group is
   available with conventional mechanisms, and that differs from the RP
   embedded in the address; see the appendix for more information.

8. Scalability/Usability Analysis

   Interdomain MSDP model for connecting PIM domains is mostly
   hierarchical.  The "embedded RP address" changes this to a mostly
   flat, sender-centered, full-mesh virtual topology.

   This may or may not cause some effects; it may or may not be
   desirable.  At the very least, it makes many things much more robust
   as the number of third parties is minimized.  A good scalability
   analysis is needed.




Savola & Haberman       [Expires September 2003]                [Page 8]

Internet Draft   draft-savola-mboned-mcast-rpaddr-02.txt      March 2003


   In some cases (especially if e.g. every home user is employing site-
   local multicast), some degree of hierarchy would be highly desirable,
   for scalability (e.g. take the advantage of shared multicast state)
   and administrative point-of-view.

   Being able to join/send to remote RP's has security considerations
   that are considered below, but it has an advantage too: every group
   has a "home RP" which is able to control (to some extent) who are
   able to send to the group.

   One should note that the model presented here simplifies the PIM
   multicast routing model slightly by removing the RP for senders and
   receivers in foreign domains.  One scalability consideration should
   be noted: previously foreign sources sent the unicast-encapsulated
   data to their local RP, now they do so to the foreign RP responsible
   for the specific group.  This is especially important with large
   multicast groups where there are a lot of heavy senders --
   particularly if implementations do not handle unicast-decapsulation
   well.

   This model increases the amount of Internet-wide multicast state
   slightly: the backbone routers might end up with at least temporary
   (*, G) and (S, G, rpt) state in addition to (S, G) states between the
   receivers and senders.  Certainly, the amount of inter-domain
   multicast traffic between sources and the embedded-RP will increase
   compared to the ASM model with MSDP; however, the domain responsible
   for the RP is expected to be able to handle this.

   As the address of the RP is tied to the multicast address, in the
   case of RP failure, PIM BSR mechanisms cannot pick a new RP; the
   failover mechanisms, if used, for backup RP's are different, and
   typically would depend on sharing one address.  The failover
   techniques are outside of the scope of this memo.

10. Security Considerations

   The address of the PIM RP is embedded in the multicast address.  RPs
   may be a good target for Denial of Service attacks -- as they are a
   single point of failure (excluding failover techniques) for a group.
   In this way, the target would be clearly visible.  However, it could
   be argued that if interdomain multicast was to be made work e.g. with
   MSDP, the address would have to be visible anyway (through via other
   channels, which may be more easily securable).

   As any RP will have to accept PIM Join/Prune/Register messages from
   any DR's, this might cause a potential DoS attack scenario.  However,
   this can be mitigated by the fact that the RP can discard all such
   messages for all multicast addresses that do not embed the address of
   the RP, and if deemed important, the implementation could also allow
   manual configuration of which multicast addresses or prefixes
   embedding the RP could be used; however, at least with addresses,
   this would increase the need for coordination between multicast
   sources and administration.

   In a similar fashion, DR's must accept similar PIM messages back from
   the foreign RP's for which a receiver in DR's network has joined.

   One consequence of the usage model is that it allows Internet-wide
   multicast state creation (from receiver(s) in another domain to the
   RP in another domain) compared to the domain wide state creation in
   the MSDP model.

   RPs may become a bit more single points of failure as anycast-RP
   mechanism is not (at least immediately) available.  This can be
   partially mitigated by the fact that some other forms of failover are
   still possible, and there should be less need to store state as with
   MSDP.

   The implementation MUST perform at least the same address validity
   checks to the embedded RP address as to one received via other means
   (like MSDP), to avoid the address being e.g. "::" or "::1".

   TBD: the implications (if any) with regard to embedding the RP
   address in the packets (e.g. packet laundering and DoS do not seem
   possible due to the way multicast works, but more analysis is
   needed).

A. Open Issues/Discussion

   The initial thought was to use only SPT join from local RP/DR to
   foreign RP, rather than a full PIM Join to foreign RP.  However, this
   turned out to be problematic, as this kind of SPT joins where
   disregarded because the path had not been set up before sending them.
   A full join to foreign PIM domain is a much clearer approach.

   One could argue that there can be more RPs than the 4-bit "RPad"
   allows for, especially if anycast-RP cannot be used.  In that light,
   extending "RPad" to take full advantage of whole 8 bits would seem
   reasonable.  However, this would use up all of the reserved bits, and
   leave no room for future flexibility.  In case of large number of
   RPs, an operational workaround could be to split the PIM domain: for
   example, using two /33's instead of one /32 would gain another 16 RP
   addresses.

   Some hierarchy (e.g. two-level, "ISP/customer") for RPs could
   possibly be added if necessary, but that would be torturing one 128
   bits even more.

   One particular case with a sender in the local domain is where
   regular ASM RP would be X, and the embedded RP address would be Y.
   This would typically be due to a misconfiguration, but the DR SHOULD
   be conservative and use the configured address X.  However, the
   simplest approach, and one which would typically be least surprising,
   would be the one where one would always use the embedded RP address
   by default. Any other thoughts on that?
