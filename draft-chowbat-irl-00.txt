                          draft-chowbat-irl-00


Abstract

   Many people learn technical concepts best in a hands-on environment,
   and Internet protocols and standards are no exception. Internet
   Research Labs (IRL) will facilitate a platform and encourage the
   technical community (seasoned professionals and newcomers alike) to
   discuss, collaborate, design and develop utilities, ideas, sample
   code and solutions that show practical implementations (Proof of
   Concept) of existing IETF standards. These labs may also be used by
   the IETF Mentoring Program and/or EDU teams for hands-on training to
   mentees or newcomers. This base draft intends to provide a high-level
   overview of the concept of Internet Research Labs in terms of
   objectives, requirements, challenges and deliverables without going
   into details of a specific lab, technology or an IETF Working Group
   (WG). After this draft matures and gains traction within the IETF
   community, we foresee more and more Internet drafts for the specific
   labs.


Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-chowbat-irl-00         February 15, 2017


   For a deep understanding of Internet standards, protocols,
   technologies and concepts (as well as latest issues and trends around
   them), the available learning tools, resources, information base,
   events and meetups at the disposal of the technical Internet
   community are currently scattered in many places. Some tools /
   resources even require payment. 

   Some of these resources are the IETF and IRTF websites, the IETF blog
   [IETF blog], the IETF Journal [IETF Journal], videos on content
   sharing websites like YouTube [Youtube], self-paced free and paid
   courses on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) like Coursera
   [Coursera], Udemy [Udemy], Udacity [Udacity] and edX [edX], and last
   but not the least: hundreds of thousands of discussion threads in the
   IETF, IAB and IRTF mailing lists. 

   Another challenge is that IETF RFCs, whether Standards, Best Current
   Practices (BCPs), Informational or Experimental, are often far too
   technical and not easily digestible for novices (and sometimes even
   for experienced professionals). Combine that with the fact that many
   people learn technical concepts best in a hands- on environment,
   there is a clear gap as well as opportunity for a lab environment.
   This is where we see that Internet Research Labs (IRL) will bridge
   the gap.

   Internet Research Labs will facilitate a free and open source
   platform, and encourage the technical community (seasoned
   professionals and newcomers alike) to discuss, collaborate, design
   and develop utilities, tools, ideas, sample code and solutions that
   show practical implementations (Proof of Concept) of IETF standards.
   Future IRL work may involve Internet-related standards produced by
   other standards bodies such as IEEE [IEEE], ISO [ISO], ITU [ITU], W3C
   [W3C], OASIA [OASIS].

   IRL labs are intended to be utilized by the technical Internet
   community across the globe for hands-on learning of IETF protocols
   either as RFCs or drafts. They will also in turn act as an enabler
   and a playground to perform research, experimentation or prototyping
   of "new" ideas. Such new ideas will in turn lead to new Internet
   drafts.

   A sample scenario for this may be hands-on implementation / testing
   of the Internet draft for TLS [Upcoming-TLS] version (1.3) in
   something called TLS Internet Research Lab, along with parallel
   implementations of previous TLS versions (1.1, 1.2); testing of new
   (1.3) protocol features, noting and documenting (e.g. in WIKI pages
   for TLS IRL) the deviations from previous protocol versions etc.

   To start with, each IRL lab may work under the guidance of one IETF

   WG chair. These labs may also be used by the IETF Mentoring Program
   and/or EDU teams for hands-on learning or training for mentees or
   newcomers.

1.2  Objectives of IRL

   1. To facilitate a free, open source and hands-on learning platform
   at the disposal of the Internet community in order to explore
   "existing" Internet standards, protocols and technologies.

   2. To facilitate a hands-on platform for research, experimentation
   and innovation on "new" ideas or Internet Protocols; or on "improved"

   versions of existing Internet Protocols / Standards. These labs may
   be termed as "Next Generation IRL Labs", and may or may not be tied
   to IETF Working Group(s).

   3. To facilitate an environment where parallel implementations of
   upcoming (e.g. a proposed Internet Draft) and existing protocol
   versions can be simulated / deployed; thereby enabling the Internet
   community to analyze similarities and differences, test new version
   features, "report" (see section 3.4) and "document" (see section 3.5)
   improvements, design / implementation defects, and so on.

   4. To complement the work and mandate of the IETF Hackathon [IETF
   Hackathon] by extending the activity "Encouraging developers to
   discuss, collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and
   solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards" to
   24 x 7 and 365.

   5. To facilitate testbeds for researching and developing Proof-of-
   Concepts (POCs) for IETF "Best Current Practices" series RFCs (both
   existing and future BCPs); as well as taking protocol best practices
   (BCPs) to a new level. POCs may be in form of sample code.

   6. To facilitate testbeds for researching and developing POCs for
   IETF "Experimental" series RFCs, where they can be tested, validated,
   and used for designing new ideas or protocols.

   7. As there are many projects and tools in the IETF, IRLs may
   facilitate an environment to develop utilities and automate various
   IETF activities.  For example, mailing lists search, IETF datatracker
   related activities (e.g. uploading an Internet Draft / RFC, Searching
   an RFC, co-relating RFCs, author search etc.), perform analytics on
   RFCs / IDs / authors and many more.

2 IRL Considerations

   The devil is in the details.   Here we attempt to provide a 360-
   degree view of considerations for transforming the idea of Internet
   Research Labs to a successful reality.  

2.1 Possible Composition

   We expect that each individual lab will use the items in this section
   as a template to describe their own lab.

2.1.1 Hardware requirements

   There are no specific "One size fits all" hardware requirements for
   each of the IRL labs. Hardware will vary from lab to lab.

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-chowbat-irl-00         February 15, 2017


2.1.2 Software requirements

   There are no specific "One size fits all" software requirements for
   each of the IRL labs. Software will vary from lab to lab.

2.1.3 IRL portal with WIKI pages

   A web portal (website) needs to be in place that caters to all
   aspects of IRL labs including but not limited to topics and
   considerations as mentioned in this Internet draft. It should be
   decided beforehand as to whose will be responsible for operating and
   maintaining the IRL web portal, helping and authorizing volunteer
   organizations to start running IRL labs, moderating access to
   requests to IRL labs, and housekeeping activities. One candidate that
   naturally comes to mind is the ISOC [Internet Society] but other
   options are also open.

   The IRL web portal should also have a detailed documentation for its
   prospective users and the Internet community at large. Further, as
   specific IRL labs are established in due course of time, they should
   place their respective documentation at this portal.

2.2 Location

   Labs may be located at academic and/or research institutions who may
   volunteer to run it. They may also be at and run by private
   companies. Further, the labs may be hosted on physically
   infrastructure (datacenter, servers, routers, switches etc.) or
   located in the public or private clouds. For example, an IoT Internet
   Research Lab may be hosted on Amazon Web Services IoT [AWS IoT].

2.3 Mode of operation

   To start with, each IRL lab may work under the guidance of one IETF
   WG chair. In due course of time, when a specific lab matures with
   regard to features, scope and users, it may be utilized by more than
   one IETF WG (within same or possibly across IETF areas with cross-
   functional requirements). However, the primary guide of the lab may
   still be the original IETF WG chair. As an example, a TLS IRL lab may
   start operating under the guidance of TLS WG chair. Later, when TLS
   IRL lab matures, it may also be utilized by related UTA WG (under ART
   area) via one of its chairs.

   In a nutshell, the IETF WGs involved will be the leadership of the
   lab via their respective chairs.  The teams from IETF EDU and
   Mentoring may be involved in overall coordination.

2.4 High Availability

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-chowbat-irl-00         February 15, 2017


   A specific IRL may initially take some time in transforming from a
   concept to reality. Hence, we expect that a specific pilot IRL will
   be set up at a single location / single cloud volunteered by an
   academic / research institution, or a private company. In due course
   of time, depending upon its success and popularity, a specific IRL
   lab dedicated to an area (e.g. TLS) may be replicated to more than
   one physical location or even multiple clouds (e.g. AWS [AWS] or
   Microsoft Azure [MS-Azure]). This may provide a form of High
   Availability.  But, this is a topic for a later discussion.

2.5  Access to IRL

   Labs may be made available to its intended users (Internet community)
   as a web application (website), or via software programs on popular
   Operating Systems like Windows, Mac OS etc. Due to the ubiquitous
   nature of web browsers and non-dependence on any particular Operating
   System, they are also a strong and natural candidate for accessing
   IRLs. Labs may also be made available via command line interface (for
   Unix based systems) or via Remote Desktop (for Windows based
   systems). A combination of above methods may also be utilized. The
   decision is left to the designer or implementor of individual labs,
   as well as to to the leadership of the IETF WG tied to the individual
   labs.

   Please see the Security considerations(section 7) on security aspects
   of the IRLs.

2.6 Advantages

   1. Deeper understanding of "existing" IETF standards and protocols in
   a hands-on, self-paced learning and training environment.

   2. Ready-to-use platform to research, experiment and collaborate on
   the development, design, implementation etc. of new ideas, protocols,
   "use-cases", utilities, Proof-of-concepts (POC) of "new / future"
   Internet standards and protocols (Next Generation IRL Labs).

   3. Ready-to-use platform for technical Internet community to perform
   hawk-eye analysis, testing, "measurements", performance analysis and
   review of proposed or under development IETF Internet drafts.

   4. Ready-to-use platform to perform various types of testing on
   Internet drafts proposed or under development. The types of testing
   include but are not limited to Performance testing, Security testing,
   Measurements testing etc.

   5. A hands-on and practical platform to augment / complement / test
   the discussion threads going on in specific IETF WGs.

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-chowbat-irl-00         February 15, 2017


   6. A platform to simulate IETF Hackathon work objectives round the
   clock throughout a year

   7. Facilitator to develop and/or improve protocol Best Current
   Practices or BCPs.

2.7 Disadvantages or Challenges

   1.  Resources need to be devoted to this effort to jump start it.

   2.  Little economic incentive or business case in volunteering for or
   setting up an IRL by an academic / research institution or a private
   company. For example, if IRL labs are setup in a public cloud, the
   real challenge is "Who will pay for cloud services?"

2.8 Tools used

   Many tools can be used for the IRL labs at design, development and
   implementation levels. A non-exhaustive list is attempted below:

2.8.1 Design Tools

   NS3 [NS3] or GNS3 [GNS3] tools may be used to design an IRL Routing
   lab for some Working Group under IETF Routing area, which may be
   utilized by the Internet community to simulate or test existing or
   upcoming version or routing protocols like OSPF, IS-IS etc.

2.8.2 Network Analysis tools

   An open source packet capture and analysis tool such as Wireshark
   [Wireshark] may be used.   The Wireshark core developers may
   collaborate on the development and testing of new protocol dissectors
   as was done successfully for many protocols including the TLS 1.3
   while still in draft stage.

2.8.3 Software development / POC tools

   Internet community members may collaborate on the development of open
   source Software or POC tools, which may be hosted on distributed
   version control and source code management (SCM) systems like
   [Github] , [BitBucket] etc.

   Standalone scripts or programs developed in languages like Unix
   Shell, Python, Perl, Ruby etc. may also be used for POC of existing
   Internet standards or Internet drafts.

2.8.4 Cloud / Virtualization Tools

 


Chowbat                 Expires August 19, 2017                 [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-chowbat-irl-00         February 15, 2017


   In cases where IRL labs are hosted on a public cloud platform, a raw
   Virtual Machine Instance may be continuously customized until it is
   ready to become a template for an IRL lab. At this point, a template
   may be created from the customized Virtual Machine instance. An
   example of customization for a TLS 1.3 IRL lab hosted on cloud would
   be installing Wireshark, loading custom developed protocol
   dissectors, generating sample traces / packets etc., and then
   creating a template. Later, as many number of VM (Virtual Machine)
   instances can be launched from the Virtual Machine template.

   Similarly private clouds may also be used.

2.8.5 MOOC tools

   MOOC tools such as Coursera [Coursera] or eDX [eDX] may be utilized
   by the Internet community to complement the IRL labs by facilitating
   step-by-step self-paced videos for learning. Obviously, voluntary
   effort needs to be put-in to develop videos that show IRL usage.

2.9 How to own and operate an IRL

   A detailed step-by-step tutorial for prospective academic, research
   or private organizations on "How to own and operate an IRL" needs be
   made available at IRL portal WIKI as mentioned in section 2.1.3

2.10 How to obtain access to an IRL

   The minimal high-level sequence of steps involved may be:

   1. Open IRL portal
   2. Create user profile
   3. Choose particular IRL(s) of interest
   4. Wait for moderator approval
   5. Agree to IRL "terms of use"
   6. Start using IRL(s)

   A detailed step-by-step tutorial for technical Internet community on
   "How to obtain access to an IRL" needs to be made available at IRL
   portal WIKI as mentioned in section 2.1.3

2.11 Next Steps for an IRL

2.11.1 Mailing list

   A new IETF mailing list may be created (or an existing one reused) to
   share experiences and refine IRL labs.

2.11.2 Community feedback
 


Chowbat                 Expires August 19, 2017                [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-chowbat-irl-00         February 15, 2017


   Community feedback is also very important to improve the IRL lab
   experience for its users. Feedback may be provided on IRL mailing
   list or via feedback link on the IRL web portal.

2.12 Which specific IRLs to start with

   There are many IETF WGs that may benefit from an IRL. So it all
   depends on who (e.g. IETF WG and/or an Academic / Research institute)
   takes on the initiative first.

3  IRL Deliverables

   A non-exhaustive list of envisaged IRL deliverables is attempted
   below. Further, the final deliverables may vary depending upon the
   specific IRL in question.

3.1  Prototypes

   A new idea or Internet protocol may be proposed / designed using
   "Next Generation IRL labs". This may be in form of a prototype and/or
   POCs.

3.2  New / Improved I-D's

   New ideas / Internet protocols or enhancements to existing Internet
   protocols / RFCs may be proposed as new Internet Drafts (I-D's) by
   Internet community.

3.3  Highly skilled Protocol Engineers

   Needless to say, an important deliverable for IRL labs would be
   highly skilled protocol engineers on specific Internet protocols and
   technologies.

3.4  Bug reporting and tracking system

   An important envisaged feature of IRL labs would be a Bug reporting
   and tracking system (like [Bugzilla]) similar to the ones utilized in
   commercial software products.

   Software / design bugs in an RFC / I-D as well as proposed request
   for enhancements may be logged under this system.This model is also
   bound to take some load off the IETF mailing lists, as well as
   improve quality of existing (RFCs) and new (I-D) documents.

3.5  New tools and softwares

   Tools are a critical mechanism through which IETF work can be done

   with less amount of effort.  Some IETF tools (e.g. datatracker,
   xml2rfc, etc.) are at a high level of maturity and deployment.  Many
   other tools have either not yet reached a maturity suitable for wide-
   spread use or struggle to spread knowledge of their existence and
   use. Still other potential tools are merely partially brainstormed
   ideas looking for others motivated to discuss, implement and try. IRL
   aims to overcome these limitations and facilitate a platform to
   produce new as well as refined versions of existing tools. Another
   IRL aim is to provide a mechanism via its web portal to spread
   knowledge of experimental tools to those interested and get feedback
   on those tools.  It also provides time and focus for finding others
   interested in particular tool ideas and discussing how to progress
   them.

3.6 Documentation

   Finally, each IRL will document its specific working model, ways to
   operate IRL, ways to acquire access to IRL, terms of use,  related
   IETF Working Groups and so on. This may be done under IRL portal with
   WIKI pages (see section 2.1.3)

4  IRL Future Work

   1. As mentioned in Section 1 :Introduction, IRLs will mainly focus on
   IETF Internet standards to start with. However, future work may
   incorporate the work of other standards bodies such as IEEE [IEEE],
   ISO [ISO], ITU [ITU], W3C [W3C], or OASIS [OASIS].

   2. As mentioned in Section 2.3: IRL mode of operation, When an IRL
   lab becomes mature with regard to features and scope, it may be
   utilized by more than one IETF WG (possibly across IETF areas).
   However, the primary leadership of lab may still be the starting IETF
   WG chair. Again, in a few years, assuming success of the IRL concept,
   an Area Director might also pitch-in for the work of IRLs.

   3. As mentioned in section 2.4 High Availability, depending upon
   success of pilot IRL labs, an IRL lab dedicated to an area or
   protocol (e.g. TLS) may be replicated to more than one physical
   location / cloud. This will provide a form of High Availability (HA).

   4. Another possibility is to rather than implementing, testing,
   simulating or discussing the work of an existing IETF WG, but create
   an advanced general purpose Next Generation IRL Labs on which
   research on almost any IETF area or WG topic or protocol can be done.
   Obviously, creating such a big and advanced lab is a herculean effort
   and solicits voluntary effort from a large academic, research or
   private organization.

   5. Initially, access to IRL labs may be via CLI. In due course of
   time, depending on the success and popularity of the labs, access to
   IRL labs may be provided via GUI, API / Web Services, and Mobile Apps
   (Android, iOS, Windows, Blackberry etc.).

5 Protection of lab IPR

   Legal issues around IRLs should also be taken care of and a Legal
   framework should also be put in place to protect IRL IPR, mainly
   copyrights. Although IRLs are intended to be open source and free of
   cost to the Internet community, their abuse and misuse MUST be
   protected. The IRL licensing terms may be set either using GPL or BSD
   open licensing terms. A "terms of use" document should be created
   that every intended user of IRL must adhere to before being provided
   access to an IRL lab. It may be decided whether "terms of use" is
   common for all IRL labs, or separate for each of IRL labs.

6 Relation between IRL and IETF Hackathon

   IRL aims to complement the work of [IETF Hackathon] rather than
   competing with it or duplicating it. In fact IRL builds on the
   objective of IETF Hackathon: "To encourage developers to discuss,
   collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions
   that show practical implementations of IETF standards."

   This makes sense as IETF Hackathons are organized only three times
   per year as are IETF meetings. The IRL concept goes a step further
   because once fully implemented IRLs are "IETF hackathon 365 days a
   year."

7  Security Considerations

   The labs are specialized tools with an intended user base (technical
   Internet community), access to whom should be moderated instead of
   being available to anyone on Internet. Rather, a potential user
   should be able to fill-up a form on IRL web portal (see section 2.11)
   furnishing his/her details and affiliation to an organization /
   institution, and justification/motivation for requesting access to
   specific IRL lab(s). Based on the user's request, IRL moderator may
   or may not provide access to the lab(s).

   Access to IRL labs may be directly via the Internet or via a VPN.
   However, if no VPN is employed, strong security controls
   (authentication / authorization / accounting) must be in place to use
   IRL, and cryptographic protocols e.g. SSH may be used to access IRL
   resources. A firewall may be in place to control access to IRL
   resources and should implement access control lists, DOS / DDOS
   protection etc. 2-factor authentication may also be employed to

   further secure access to the IRL labs after user registration.

   All access to IRLs must be logged. A RADIUS / TACACS server may be
   employed for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
   purposes.

   Another important security consideration for IRLs is that if the IRL
   access portal and/or specific IRLs are implemented as Web
   Applications, their web pages should not be indexable by search
   engines. This may effectively make the IRL web portal available to
   only its intended user community.

8  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
