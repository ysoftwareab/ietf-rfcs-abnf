1. Introduction

   Currently the IETF requires that authors of contributions to the IETF
   grant to the IETF a limited set of non-exclusive rights and
   permissions to a document as part of the process of submitting the
   contribution.  These rights and permissions are detailed in Section

   3.3 of "IETF Rights in Contributions" (RFC 3978 - BCP 78) [RFC3978].
   This current memo proposes a replacement for a paragraph in this
   section to add the right for the IETF to permit the creation of
   derivative works in any venue, not limited to within the IETF
   Standards Process.  This proposal is a result of the discussion in
   the IPR Working Group session during IETF 62 in Minneapolis, MN.

2.  Current Section 3.3 (a) (C)

   (C) unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained in a
      Contribution [as per Section 5.2 below], to prepare derivative
      works (other than translations) that are based on or incorporate
      all or part of the Contribution, or comment upon it, within the
      IETF Standards Process.  The license to such derivative works not
      granting the ISOC and the IETF any more rights than the license to
      the original Contribution,

3.  Revised Section 3.3 (a) (C)

   (C) unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained in a
      Contribution [as per Section 5.2 below], to prepare derivative
      works (in addition to translations) that are based on or
      incorporate all or part of the Contribution, or comment upon it,
      within the IETF Standards Process or to authorize preparation of
      such derivative works outside of the IETF Standards Process.  The
      license to such derivative works not granting any more rights than
      the license to the original Contribution,

   This proposed revision of RFC 39978 has no direct security
   implications.
