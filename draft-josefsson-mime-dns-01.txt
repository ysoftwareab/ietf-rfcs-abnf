Abstract

   This draft describe the registration of MIME media types
   application/dns and text/dns.  They are used to identify data on the
   detached DNS format described in RFC 2540 [5], and zone text data as
   described in RFC 1035 [2], respectively.

Internet-Draft       MIME Registration of DNS data          January 2001


1. Introduction

   DNS [1][2] is a widely deployed protocol used to, among other
   things, translate domain names into IP addresses.

   DNS information are usually stored in text files, so called "zone
   files".  The format is described in RFC 1035 [2].

   DNS data can also be stored in a format described in RFC 2540 [5]. 
   It's intended to be used when archiving DNS data (the format add
   timestamps to DNS data).

   This document describe the registration of a MIME type for these two
   formats.

2. Open Issues

   [[[The issues discussed in this section should be resolved, as this
   document matures.  Remove the section when no further issues
   exist.]]]

   Issues with the text/dns format:

   . need to forbid $INCLUDE?

   . does it have to be complete zone files?

   . need to do anything if no TTL and no SOA?

   . zone transfer format?

   . MIME parameter to replace $ORIGIN?

3. MIME type registration of application/dns

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/dns

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: dns

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: 7bit, 8bit or binary

   Security considerations: This definition only identifies the content
   as being detached DNS information, as documented in RFC 2540 [5]. 
   This data may be security relevant according to RFC 2538 [4], or
   secured information according to RFC 2535 [3].

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: the format of data that could be tagged
   with this MIME type is documented in RFC 2540 [5].

   Applications which use this media type: DNS related software,
   including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.

   Additional information:

     Magic number(s): none
     File extension(s): none
     Macintosh File Type Code(s): unknown

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
