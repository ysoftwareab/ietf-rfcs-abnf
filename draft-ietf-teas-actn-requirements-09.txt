   abstraction and control of Traffic Engineering networks to
   facilitate virtual network operation via the creation of a single
   virtualized network or a seamless service. This supports operators
   in viewing and controlling different domains (at any dimension:
   applied technology, administrative zones, or vendor-specific
   technology islands) as a single virtualized network.

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                  March 2018


1. Introduction

   This document provides a set of functional requirements for
   Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineering (TE) Networks (ACTN)
   identified in various use-cases specified by the operators. [ACTN-
   Frame] defines the base reference architecture and terminology.

   ACTN refers to the set of virtual network service operations needed
   to coordinate, control and manage large-scale multi-domain TE
   networks so as to facilitate network programmability, automation,
   efficient resource sharing, and end-to-end virtual service aware
   connectivity.

   These operations are summarized as follows:

     - Abstraction and coordination of underlying network resources
        independent of how these resources are managed or controlled,
        so that higher-layer entities can dynamically control virtual
        networks based on those resources. Control includes creating,
        modifying, monitoring, and deleting virtual networks.

     - Collation of the identifiers and other attributes of the
        resources from multiple TE networks (multiple technologies,
        equipment from multiple vendors, under the control of multiple
        administrations) through a process of recursive abstraction to
        present a customer with a single virtual network. This is
        achieved by presenting the network domain as an abstracted
        topology to the customer via open and programmable interfaces.
        Recursive abstraction allows for the recursion of abstracted
        data in a hierarchy of controllers.. It is expected that the
        recursion levels should be at least three levels: customer
        level, multi-domain network level, and domain network level.

     - Coordination of end-to-end virtual network services and
        applications via allocation of network resources to meet
        specific service, application and customer requirements. Refer
        to [ACTN-Frame] for the definition of coordination.

     - Adaptation of customer requests (to control virtual resources)
        to the physical network resources performing the necessary
        mapping, translation, isolation and, policy that allows
        conveying, managing and enforcing customer policies with
        respect to the services and the network of the customer.

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                  March 2018


     - Provision via a data model and virtual control capability to
        customers who request virtual network services. Note that these
        customers could, themselves, be service providers.

   ACTN solutions will build on, and extend, existing TE constructs and
   TE mechanisms wherever possible and appropriate.  Support for
   controller-based approaches is specifically included in the possible
   solution set.

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2. High-level ACTN requirements


   This section provides a summary of use-cases in terms of two
   categories: (i) service-specific requirements; (ii) network-related
   requirements. All these requirements are specified by operators that
   are interested in implementing ACTN.

   Service-specific requirements listed below are uniquely applied to
   the work scope of ACTN. Service-specific requirements are related to
   the virtual service coordination function. These requirements are
   related to customer's Virtual Networks (VN) in terms of service
   policy associated with VNs such as service performance objectives,
   VN endpoint location information for certain required service
   specific functions (e.g., security and others), VN survivability
   requirement, or dynamic service control policy, etc.

   Network-related requirements are related to and necessary for
   coherent/seamless for the virtual network operation function. These
   requirements are related to multi-domain and multi-layer signaling,
   routing, protection/restoration and re-optimization/re-grooming,
   etc.

   Each requirement specified in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 is derived from
   ACTN use-cases: [CHENG], [DHODY], [FANG], [KLEE], [KUMAKI], [LOPEZ],
   [SHIN], [XU], [XU2], and [SUZUKI].

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                  March 2018


2.1. Service-Specific Requirements



     1. Requirement 1: Virtual Network Service (VNS) creation

   Customer MUST be able to request/instantiate the VNS to the network
   within the confines of mutual agreement between customer and network
   operator and network operator's capability. A VNS is the service
   agreement between a customer and provider to provide a VN [ACTN-
   Frame]. There are different types of VNS in terms of the VN types
   the customer is allowed to operate (e.g., a VN type can be simply a
   set of edge-to-edge links, or it can comprise of virtual nodes and
   virtual links, etc.). The customer MUST be able to express VNS
   preference that captures Service Level Agreements (SLA) associated
   with virtual network service (e.g., Endpoint selection preference,
   routing preference, time-related preference, etc.)

      Reference: [KLEE], [LOPEZ], [SHIN], [DHODY], [FANG].



     2. Requirement 2: Virtual Network Service Query

   Customer SHOULD be able to request VNS Query ("Can you give me these
   VN(s)?") that include the following parameters:

        - VN type: various VN types defined by the customer (e.g.,
          path, graph, etc.)
        - VN end-points (Customer Edge interface information)
        - VN Topology Service-specific Objective Functions (e.g., a
           set of objective functions as defined in [RFC5541] to be
           supported on the paths, but not limited to).
        - VN constraints requirement (e.g., Maximum Latency threshold,
          Minimum Bandwidth, etc.)

   Reference: [KUMAKI], [FANG], [CHENG].



     3. Requirement 3: VNS Instantiation ("Please create a VNS for me")

   Customer MUST be able to instantiate VNS that includes various VNS
   related parameters:

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                  March 2018


        - VN type: various VN types defined by the customer (e.g.,
           Type 1, Type 2, etc. See [ACTN-Frame] for the definition of
           VN Type 1 and Type 2).
        - VN end-points (Customer Edge interface information)
        - VN Topology Service-specific Objective Functions (e.g., a
           set of objective functions as defined in [RFC5541] to be
           supported on the paths, but not limited to).
        - VN constraints requirement (e.g., Maximum Latency threshold,
           Minimum Bandwidth, etc.)
        - VN Topology diversity when there are multiple instances of
           VNS (e.g., VN1 and VN2 must be disjoint; Node/link disjoint
           from other VNs)

   Note that Requirement 3 provides specific details of Requirement 1.

   Reference: [KUMAKI], [FANG], [CHENG].



     4. Requirement 4: VNS Lifecycle Management & Operation (M&O)

   Customer MUST be able to perform the following VNS operations:

        - VNS Delete: Customer MUST be able to delete VNS.
        - VNS Modify: Customer MUST be able to modify VNS related
           parameters during the lifecycle of the instantiated VNS.

   Reference: [FANG], [KUMAKI], [LOPEZ], [DHODY], [FANG], [KLEE].



     5. Requirement 5: VNS Isolation

   Customer's VN should be able to use arbitrary network topology,
   routing, or forwarding functions as well as customized control
   mechanisms independent of the underlying physical network and of
   other coexisting virtual networks. Other customers' VNS operation
   MUST NOT impact a particular customer's VNS network operation.

   Reference: [KUMAKI], [FANG], [LOPEZ]



     6. Requirement 6: Multi-Destination Coordination

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                  March 2018


   Customer MUST be able to define and convey service/preference
   requirements for multi-destination applications (e.g., set of
   candidate sources/destinations, thresholds for load balancing,
   disaster recovery preference, etc.)

   Reference: [FANG], [LOPEZ], [SHIN].



     7. Requirement 7: VNS Performance Monitoring

   The customer MUST be able to define performance monitoring
   parameters and its associated preference such as frequency of
   report, abstraction/aggregation level of performance data (e.g., VN
   level, tunnel level, etc.) with dynamic feedback loop from the
   network.

   Reference: [XU], [XU2], [DHODY], [CHENG]



     8. Requirement 8: VNS Confidentiality and Security Requirements

   The following confidentiality/security requirements MUST be
   supported in all interfaces:

      - Securing the request and control of resources, confidentially
        of the information, and availability of function.
      - Trust domain verification between a customer entity and a
        network entity. It verifies if a trust relationship has been
        established between these entities.
      - Encrypting data that flow between components, especially when
        they are implemented at remote nodes, regardless if these are
        external or internal network interfaces.


   Reference: [KUMAKI], [FANG], [LOPEZ]



2.2. Network-Related Requirements

     1. Requirement 1: Virtual Network Service Coordination

   Network MUST be able to support the following VNS operations:

           MUST be able to create VNS within the confines of network
           resource availability.
        - VNS Delete: Upon customer's VNS deletion request, network
           MUST be able to delete VNS.
        - VNS Modify: Upon customer's VNS modification request,
           network MUST be able to modify VNS related parameters during
           the lifecycle of the instantiated VNS.
        - VNS Monitor: Upon customer's VNS performance monitoring
           setup, the network MUST be able to support VNS level
           Operations, Administration and Management (OAM) Monitoring
           under service agreement.

   Reference: [FANG], [KUMAKI], [LOPEZ], [DHODY], [FANG], [KLEE].




     2. Requirement 2: Topology Abstraction Capability

   The network MUST be capable of managing its networks based on the
   principle of topology abstraction to be able to scale multi-layer,
   multi-domain networks.

   Reference: [KLEE], [LOPEZ], [DHODY], [CHENG].



     3. Requirement 3: Multi-Domain & Multi-layer Coordination

   Network coordination for multi-domain and multi-layer path
   computation and path setup operation MUST be provided:

        - End-to-end path computation across multi-domain networks
           (based on abstract topology from each domain)
        - Domain sequence determination
        - Request for path signaling to each domain controller
        - Alternative TE path computation if any of the domain
           controllers cannot find its domain path

   Reference: [CHENG], [DHODY], [KLEE], [LOPEZ], [SHIN], [SUZUKI].



     4. Requirement 4: End-to-End Path Protection

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                  March 2018


   End-to-end Path Protection Operations MUST be provided with seamless
   coordination between domain-level protection schemes and cross-
   domain protection schemes.

   Reference: [CHENG], [KLEE], [DHODY], [LOPEZ], [SHIN].



     5. Requirement 5: Dynamicity of virtual network control operations

   Dynamic virtual network control operations MUST be supported. This
   includes, but is not limited to, the following:

        - Real-time VNS control (e.g., fast recovery/reroute upon
           network failure).
        - Fast convergence of abstracted topologies upon changes due
           to failure or reconfiguration across the network domain
           view, the multi-domain network view and the customer view.
        - Large-scale VNS operation (e.g., the ability to process tens
           of thousands of connectivity requests) for time-sensitive
           applications.

   Reference: [SHIN], [XU], [XU2], [KLEE], [KUMAKI], [SUZUKI].



3. Security Considerations

   The ACTN requirements described in this document do not directly
   bear specific security concerns. When these requirements are
   implemented in specific interfaces, securing the request and control
   of resources, confidentially of the information, and availability of
   function, should all be critical security considerations.



4. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
