Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   This is first drafty Internet-draft of the Security Advisory Format.
   A lot of work still to be done in clarifying, removing mistakes and
   work on the specification of unique names for components impacted by
   vulnerabilities.  Internet-Drafts are working documents of the
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working
   groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute working documents
   as Internet-Drafts.

Abstract

   This memo describes a format for security advisories. An advisory is
   a document describing a vulnerability of a program, an operating
   system or, more generally, a software or hardware component of the
   information system.

   This specification tries to minimize changes in issuer and readers
   current practices (messages style), and by trying to help a program
   re-read the advisory tries also to keep advisories easily and

   friendly readable by humans.  It focuses on structure of documents.

   This specification is primarily useful for advisories issuers such as
   CSIRTs [RFC2350] and users and is linked with intrusion detection.

3.  Introduction

   We face different information issuers :
    - CSIRTs
    - Vendors
    - Groups of people studying vulnerabilities

    Different needs :
    - Advisory submitters will find in this format a more efficient way
    to inform the or their community. Internally to the Advisory submit¡
    ter organisation, this format can also be used to ease the handling
    of advisories.

    - IT security officers : within organizations, IT security officers
    need to know know what are the vulnerabilities of a specific

Debeaupuis                                              [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT          Security Advisory Format             18 May 1999

    operating system or software, and in a more general way, a software
    or hardware component.

    - Numerous categories of people (intrusion detection people,
    researchers, vendors, security consulting firms) are commonly work¡
    ing on advisories as a building block of their work : investiga¡
    tions, auditing softwares (on system or network). A common format
    will help them entering datas in the databases without spending time
    to re-organized and formalized advisories.  This format aim will
    also be useful for management tools (IDS frameworks, network secu¡
    rity management) to correlate alarms and advisories.

    The problem that we are facing today is a lake of standardization
    between the different formats used to report vulnerabilities.

4.  Design goals

   The design goals of SAF are as follows :

      (1) SAF must suit to security advisory issuers as of users of
      those advisories,

      (2) SAF must be parsable by a program,

      (3) SAF should not modify too much current practices and ways of
      working. SAF should not modify too much advisories looks-and-feel.

      (4) SAF must not impose content or order of informations in advi¡
      sories.

5.  Security Advisory Format

5.1.  Definitions

   Advisory :
      A text document announcing to a community a vulnerability in a
      component of an information system. For example, a software appli¡
      cation, a packaging of an application, an operating system, a
      router hardware.

   Vulnerability :
      An intrinsic or external provocted fail of a component of the
      information system leading to decrease the security protection
      level of a resource.

Debeaupuis                                              [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT          Security Advisory Format             18 May 1999

   Impact :
      the damage provoked if the vulnerability is exploited.

   Patch :
      a peace of software replacing the misfunctioning parts of the com¡
      ponent to eradicate the vulnerability.

   Workaround :
      a procedure describing a change in the configuration that can pro¡
      tect the component from being corrupted by a the exploit of a vul¡
      nerability without applying patches.

5.2.  Advisory encoding

   SAF is a token based labeling language. A SAF advisory is a 7 bit US-
   ASCII document or 8 bit ISO 8859-1 text document. Implementations
   MUST support both encodings.

5.3.  Sections

   Advisories are composed of sections. Sections order is NOT enforced.

5.4.  SAF grammar

   A SAF document can be encoded intro two formats : an XML document
   conforming the DTD provided in this document, or a readable and
   parsable text format (to be defined).

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a format which aim is not to improve security
   of advisories (transmission, trust, archiving).  It can help security
   officers having a better view of the vulnerabilities impacts on their
   systems by facilitating advisories re-treatment by automatic or semi-
   automatic programs.

8.  APPENDIX 1 - Current advisories semantics

   Note : the annexes are only for information. They are helpful and
   will be deleted in the future because we are not trying to standard¡
   ize CSIRTs current formats, but to propose an evolution and a merge
   of those formats.

   This section uses ABNF but is not a lexical definition of advisories
   but rather a semantical grammar description of advisories.
