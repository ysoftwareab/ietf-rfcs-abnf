               draft-boucadair-tcpm-capability-option-00

Abstract

   This document defines an experimental TCP option that can be used to
   negotiate a set of options that are supported by two TCP endpoints.
   The main motivation for designing this option is the optimization of
   the option space for SYN segments.

1.  Introduction

   TCP ([RFC0793]) can be extended by defining new options.  Because of
   the presence of NATs, firewalls, and other types of flow-aware
   service functions between two TCP endpoints, means to ensure that
   both endpoints support a given option, and that the paths used to
   forward traffic between them do not involve nodes that strip or alter
   the content of the options.  This is actually achieved by negotiating
   the support of a given option during the 3WHS stage.

   Typically, an option is included in the SYN message to inform the
   remote TCP peer that the originating TCP peer is "X"-capable (that
   is, it supports feature "X").  Upon receipt of the SYN message, and
   if no intermediary node has stripped that option, the remote peer
   will echo that option in a SYN/ACK if and only if it is also "X"-
   capable.  Feature "X" can then be used if the SYN/ACK message that is
   received by the originating peer still carries the "X"-capable; the
   option must then be included in the ACK.

   For example, several TCP extensions have been designed with this
   design rationale in mind, e.g., SYN-EOS
   [I-D.touch-tcpm-tcp-syn-ext-opt], EDO [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-edo], SACK
   Permitted [RFC2018], MP_CAPABLE [RFC6824], etc.  In the meantime, and
   given the limited TCP option space, it becomes more challenging to
   include all options in a single SYN message.

   Several solutions have been proposed to solve that problem (e.g.,
   [I-D.touch-tcpm-tcp-syn-ext-opt]) by means of generating a companion
   TCP message.  This document proposes a solution that aims to optimize
   the required option space to facilitate the insertion of several "X"-
   capable options.

Internet-Draft            TCP Capability Option               March 2016


1.1.  Applicability

   The option is primarily designed for network configurations where the
   path between the TCP endpoints is managed (e.g., an MPTCP endpoint
   embedded in the CPE and the remote MPTCP endpoint is located in the
   network side; the paths between these endpoints are managed by the
   same administrative entity such as in
   [I-D.boucadair-mptcp-natfwfree-profile]).

   A flow-aware device that removes the option will disable all the
   options that were included in the TCP Capability option.  This is not
   supposed in the target deployment context for this option.

   Some middleboxes may allow the TCP Capability option to pass through,
   but the individual options may be blocked.  This is not supposed in
   the target deployment context for this option as those flow-aware
   functions are managed.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  TCP Capability Option

   The format of the TCP Capability option is shown in Figure 1.  The
   option follows the format defined in [RFC0793].

    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
    |  Kind  | Length |  Kind 1| Kind 2 |
    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
    :       ....      |Kind n-1| Kind n |
    +-------....------+--------+--------+

                                 Figure 1

   "Kind" is to be assigned by IANA (see Section 5).

      [[Note: the format can follow [RFC6994]; An ExID can be defined.]]

   "Kindi" carries the code point of an option that a TCP endpoint
   supports and which it would like to negotiate with the remote peer.
   One or multiple "Kindi" fields may be included.

   An endpoint that wishes to enable the capabilities associated with
   one or multiple TCP options must include the corresponding "Kind"
   codes in a TCP Capability option, which is included in the initial

   SYN.  If the remote peer supports at least one of the options carried
   in the TCP Capability option, it replies with a SYN/ACK that includes
   the TCP Capability option and which only carries the code points of
   the options it supports.  These values are then echoed in the ACK
   message the originating peer sends back to the remote peer.

   When replying to a SYN message that includes a TCP Capability option,
   the remote peer should preserve the same order of the "Kindi" fields
   (of course, those that are not supported won't be included).

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are to be completed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Authors of this document request IANA to assign a new TCP "kind" for
   the TCP Capability option.
