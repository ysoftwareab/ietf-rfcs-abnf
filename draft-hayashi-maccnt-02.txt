   This Internet Draft (I-D) describes problems in the area of 
   accounting and access control for multicasting.  General requirements 
   for accounting capabilities including quality-of-service (QoS) 
   related issues are listed.  This I-D assumes that these capabilities 
   can be realized by functions implemented at edges of a network based 
   on IGMP or MLD.  Such functions would log in dedicated database 
   information obtained from edge routers.  Finally, cases for Content 
   Delivery Services (CDS) are described as application examples which 
   could benefit from multicasting accounting and access control 
   capabilities as described in the I-D.  It is proposed that this I-D 
   be used as a starting point for further discussion on these issues.

1. Introduction 
    
   The intention of this Internet Draft (I-D) is to initiate a 
   discussion focused on accounting, authentication and authorization 
   issues for well-managed IP multicasting services (ôwell-managedö 
   defined at the end of this introduction).  The I-D proposes for the 
   identified requirements to be taken on as a working item within the 
   mboned WG.  This I-D also intends to develop an informational RFC on 
   requirements for well managed IP multicasting. 
    
   IP multicasting is becoming widely used as a method to save network 
   resources such as bandwidth or CPU processing power of the sender's 
   server for cases where a large volume of information needs to be 
   distributed to a large number of receivers.  This trend can be 
   observed both in enterprise use and in broadband services provided by 
   network operator/service providers. 
    
   Distance learning within a university and in-house (in-company) 
   sharing of multimedia information are examples of enterprise use.  In 
   these examples, sources generate high-bit rate (e.g., 6Mbit/s) 
   streaming information.  When the number of receivers becomes large, 
   such systems do not scale well without multicasting. 
    
   On the other hand, a Content Delivery Service (CDS) is an example of 
   a broadband service provided by network operators/service providers.  
   Distribution of movies and other video programs to each user are 
   typical services.  Each channel requires large bandwidth (e.g., 
   6Mbit/s) and operator/service providers need to provide many channels 
   to make their service attractive.  In addition, the number of 
   receivers is large (e.g., more than a few thousands).  The system to 
   provide this service does not scale well without multicasting. 
    
   As such, multicasting can be useful to make the network more scalable 
   when a large volume of information needs to be distributed to a large 
   number of receivers.  However, multicasting according to current 
   standards (e.g., IGMPv3[1] and MLDv2[2]) has drawbacks compared to 
   unicasting when one applies it to commercial services.  Accounting of 
   each user's actions is not possible with multicasting as it is with 
   unicasting.  Accounting consists of grasping each user's behavior, 
   when she/he starts/stops to receive a channel, which channel she/he 
   receives, etc. 
    
   IP multicasting can be used to distribute free material efficiently, 
   but there are limitations to multicasting in usage models where usage 
   accounting is necessary, such as many commercial applications.  
   Although multicasting has already been used in several applications, 
   in many cases it is used in such a way that accounting is not 
   necessary.  Alternatively, one could develop and use a proprietary

   solution to address this issue.  However, non-standard solutions have 
   drawbacks in terms of interoperability or cost of development and 
   maintenance.   
    
   Without accounting capability in multicasting, information providers 
   desiring accounting capability are forced to use unicasting even when 
   multicasting would otherwise be desirable from a bandwidth/server 
   resource perspective.  If multicasting could be used with user-based 
   accounting capabilities, its applicability would be greatly widened. 
    
   This I-D first describes problems on accounting issues in 
   multicasting.  Then the general requirements for this capability 
   including QoS related issues are listed.  This I-D assumes that these 
   capabilities can be realized by functions implemented at edges of a 
   network based on IGMP or MLD.  Such functions would record into 
   dedicated database information obtained from edge routers.  Finally, 
   application examples which could benefit from multicasting with 
   accounting capabilities are shown.  It is proposed that this I-D be 
   used as a starting point for a discussion on these issues. 
    
   This I-D will present general functional requirements related to 
   accounting, authentication and authorization issues in IP 
   multicasting networks, and a multicast network which fulfills these 
   requirements will be called a ôwell managedö IP multicasting network.

3. Problem statement 
    
3.1  Accounting issues 
   In unicast communications, the server (information source) can 
   identify the client (information receiver) and only permits 
   connection by an eligible client when this type of access control is 
   necessary.  In addition, when necessary, the server can grasp what 
   the client is doing (e.g., connecting to the server, starting 
   reception, what information the client is receiving, terminating 
   reception, disconnecting from the server). 
    
   On the other hand, in multicast communication as in Fig.1, the server 
   just feeds its information to the multicast router.  Then, the 
   multicast router replicates the information to distribute to the 
   clients.  According to current standards (e.g., IGMPv3[1] or 
   MLDv2[2]), the multicast router feeds the replicated information to 
   any link which has at least one client requesting the information.  
   In this process, no eligibility check is conducted.  Any client can 
   receive the information just by requesting.  In other words, the 
   current standards do not provide multicasting with authorization or 
   access control capabilities sufficient to meet the requirements of 
   accounting.

             Fig.1 Example network for multicast communication 
    
   This is the major reason why multicasting is only used for cases 
   where no user-based accounting capabilities are necessary.  However, 
   since more and more information is transferred over IP-based networks

   and some of these applications may require accounting capabilities, 
   it is easy to envision the requirement of supporting such cases.  For 
   example, accounting is needed if one wants to charge for distributed 
   information on a non-flat-fee basis.  If the volume of information 
   and number of clients are large, it is beneficial to use multicasting 
   from the network resource efficiency point of view. 
    
   As such, the same level of user-based accounting capabilities as 
   provided in unicast networks should be provided in multicast networks. 
    
    
3.2  Relationship with secure multicasting (MSEC) 
    
   In many cases, content encryption (e.g. MSEC) is an effective method 
   for preventing unauthorized access to original content (in other 
   words, the ability to decode data to return it to its generally 
   useable form.)  This I-D presents requirements for multicasting 
   networks in the areas of 1) access control to prevent unauthorized 
   access to the network, and 2) accounting to grasp user activity.  It 
   is not the intention of this I-D to propose alternatives to 
   encryption.   Access control, accounting and encryption are separate 
   technologies.  The implementation of any of these technologies does 
   not preclude the use of the others. 
    
    
4. Functional general requirements for well managed IP multicasting 
    
   It seems beneficial to use IGMP or MLD for access controlling in 
   multicast networks.  However, from the considerations presented in 
   section 3, there are issues in the following areas: 
    
    
   (1) User identification 
    
   The network should be able to identify each user when they attempt to 
   access the service so that necessary access controlling actions can 
   be applied.  Also, it is necessary to identify the source (user) of 
   each request (e.g., join/leave). 
    
    
   (2) Access control 
    
   The network should be able to apply necessary access controlling 
   actions when an eligible user requests.  The network should be able 
   to reject any action requested from an ineligible user.  
    
    
   (3) User authentication 
    
   The network should be able to authenticate a user.

   Internet Draft        draft-hayashi-maccnt-02         February, 2005 
    
    
    
    
   (4) User authorization 
    
   The network should be able to authorize a userÆs access to content or 
   a multicast group, so as to meet any demands by a CP to prevent 
   content access by ineligible users.  Also, the NSP does not want to 
   waste their network resources on ineligible users.  Eligibility can 
   be defined in several ways.  The definition of an "eligible user" 
   should be discussed further. 
    
    
   (5) Accounting and billing 
    
   Networks need to be able to grasp each user's behavior so that 
   accounting and billing are possible.  When the network is built based 
   on IGMP, a user's behavior is represented by join/leave actions.  As 
   such, it is necessary to detect each user's join/leave actions 
   precisely enough for the application used.  Accounting and billing 
   should be associated with these join/leave actions. 
    
   Networks need database functions to realize user-based accounting 
   through the accumulation of logs from edge routers.  
    
    
   (6) Service and terminal portability 
    
   Networks should allow for a user to receive a service from different 
   places and/or with a different terminal device. 
    
    
   (7) Support of ASM and SSM 
    
   Both ASM (G), and SSM (S,G) should be supported as multicast models. 
    
    
   (8)  Admission control for join action 
    
   In order to maintain a predefined QoS level, an edge router should 
   not accept a consequent "join" after a "leave" until the termination 
   of the stream of the multicast group which was "left".  This is 
   essential to protect against e.g., multicast denial of service (DoS) 
   attacks. 
    
    
   (9)  Quick reaction 
    
   When a user sends a request, it should be responded to as quickly as 
   possible.  For example, when a user changes the channel they are 
   receiving, the reaction should be as quick as possible.  Quick 
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta, Vaidya                           [Page 7] 
    
   Internet Draft        draft-hayashi-maccnt-02         February, 2005 
    
    
   reactions are essential to provide attractive and easy-to-use 
   services. 
    
    
   (10)  Scalability 
    
   Solutions that are used for well managed IP multicasting should scale 
   enough to support the needs of content providers and network 
   operators. 
    
    
   (11) Small impact on the existing products 
    
   Impact on the existing products (e.g., protocols, software, etc.) 
   should be as minimal as possible. 
    
    
   (12) Multicast replication 
   The above requirements should also apply if multicast replication is 
   being done on an access-node (e.g. DSLAMs or OLTs). 
    
    
   Specific functional requirements for each application can be derived 
   from the above general requirements.  An example is shown in the 
   section 5. 
    
    
5. Application example and its specific requirements 
    
   This section shows an application example which could benefit from 
   multicasting.  Then, specific functional requirements related to 
   user-based accounting capabilities are derived. 
    
    
5.1 IP Multicast-based Content Delivery Service (CDS): CP and NSP are 
   different entities (companies) 
 
   Broadband access networks such as ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber 
   Line) or FTTH (Fiber to the Home) have been deployed widely in recent 
   years. Content Delivery Service (CDS) is expected to be a major 
   application provided through broadband access networks. Because many 
   services such as television broadcasting require huge bandwidth (e.g., 
   6Mbit/s) and processing power at content server, IP multicast is used 
   as an efficient delivery mechanism for CDS.  
    
   One way to provide high quality CDS is to use closed networks 
   ("walled-garden" model). 
    
   This subsection shows an example where CP and NSP are different 
   entities (companies).

5.1.1 Network model for Multicast Content Delivery Service 
    
   As shown in Fig.2, networks for CDS contain three different types of 
   entities: Content Provider (CP), Network Service Provider (NSP), and 
   end user clients. An NSP owns the network resources (infrastructure). 
   It accommodates content providers on one side and accommodates end 
   user clients on the other side. NSP provides the network for CDS to 
   two other entities (i.e., CPs and end user clients). A CP provides 
   content to each end-user client through the network of NSPs. NSPs are 
   responsible for delivering the content to end user clients, and for 
   controlling the network resources.

   The NSP provides the information server for all multicast channels, 
   and a CP gives detailed channel information (e.g., Time table of each

   channel) to the information server. An end-user client gets the 
   information from the information server. In this model, multicast is 
   used in the NSP's CDS network, and there are two different contracts. 
   One is the contract between the NSP and the end user which permits 
   the user to access the basic network resources of the NSP.  Another 
   contract is between the CP and end user to permit the user to 
   subscribe multicast content. Because the CP and NSP are different 
   entities, and the NSP generally does not allow a CP to control 
   (operate) the network resources of the NSP, user authorization needs 
   to be done by the CP and NSP independently. Since there is no direct 
   connection to the user/network interface, the CP cannot control the 
   user/network interface. An end user may want to move to another place, 
   or may want to change her/his device (client) anytime without 
   interrupting her/his receiving services.  As such, IP Multicast 
   network should support portability capabilities. 
    
    
5.1.2 Content Delivery Service Requirements 
 
   To have a successful business providing multicast, there are some 
   specific requirements for the IP Multicast-based Content Delivery 
   Service. 
 
 
5.1.2.1 Accounting Requirements 
    
   Since the CP and NSP are different business entities, they need to 
   share the profit. Such a profit sharing business relationship 
   requires accurate and near real-time accounting information about the 
   end user clients' activity on accessing the content services. The 
   accounting information should be per content/usage-base to enable 
   varied billing and charging methods. 
    
   The user accessing a particular content is represented by the user's 
   activities of joining or leaving the corresponding multicast 
   group/channel (<g> or <s,g>). In multicast networks, only NSPs can 
   collect group joining or leaving activities through their last-hop 
   multicast access edge devices in real-time. The NSPs can transfer the 
   accounting information to related CPs for them to generate final end 
   user billing information. The normal AAA technology can be used to 
   transfer the accounting information. 
    
   To match the accounting information with a particular end-user client, 
   the end-user client has to be authenticated. Usually the account 
   information of an end-user client for content access is maintained by 
   the CP. An end user client may have different user accounts for 
   different CPs. The account is usually in the format of (username, 
   password) so an end user client can access the content services from 
   anywhere. For example, an end user client can access the CP from 
   different NSPs. It should be noted that the user account used for

   content access can be different from the one used for network access 
   maintained by NSPs. 
    
   The NSP-CP model represents a multi-domain AAA environment. There are 
   plural cases of the model depending on the trust relationship between 
   the NSP and CP, and additional service requirements such as a certain 
   QoS level guarantee or service/terminal portability. 
    
   A mechanism is necessary to allow a CP and NSP to grasp each user's 
   behavior independently. 
    
   Another requirement related to accounting is the ability to notify a 
   user when accounting really starts.  When a "free preview" capability 
   is supported, accounting may not start at the same time as the userÆs 
   joining of the stream. 
    
    
5.1.2.2 Authorization Requirements 
    
  The NSPs are responsible for delivering content and are required to 
  meet certain QoS levels or SLA (service level agreements). For 
  example, video quality is very sensitive to packet loss. So if an NSP 
  cannot meet the quality requirements due to limited network resources 
  if it accepts an additional user request, the NSP should reject that 
  end user's access request to avoid charging the existing (i.e., 
  already joined) user for bad services.  For example, if an access 
  line is shared by several users, an additional user's join may cause 
  a performance degradation for other users.  If the incoming user is 
  the first user on an edge node, this will initiate the transmission 
  of data between the multicast router and the edge node and this extra 
  network traffic may cause performance degradation.  There may also be 
  policies that do not necessarily give highest priority to the ôfirst-
  comeö users, and these should also be considered.  
  In order to protect network resources against misuse/malicious access 
  and maintain a QoS level, appropriate admission control function for 
  traffic policing purposes is necessary so that the NSP can accept or 
  reject the request without degrading the QoS beyond the specified 
  level. 
   
   
5.1.2.3 Authentication Requirements 
    
   There are two different aims of authentication.  One is 
   authentication for network access, and another one is for content 
   access. For the first case of authentication, NSP has a AAA server, 
   and for the second case, each CP has a AAA server. In some cases, CPs 
   delegate (outsource) the operation of user authentication to NSPs. 
    
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta, Vaidya                          [Page 11] 
    
   Internet Draft        draft-hayashi-maccnt-02         February, 2005 
    
    
   As such, in addition to network access, multicast group access by a  
   user also needs to be authenticated.  Content authentication should 
   support the models where: 
        - authentication for multicast content is outsourced to the NSP. 
        - authentication for multicast content access is operated by 
          the content provider 
    
    
5.2 IP Multicast-based Content Delivery Service (CDS): CP and NSP are 
   the same entities (companies) 
    
   Another application example is the case where the content provider 
   (CP) and network service provider (NSP) are the same entity (company) 
   as shown in Fig. 3.  In the case that the CP and NSP are the same 
   entity, some of the requirements indicated in 4.1 are not required. 
    
   This model does not require the following items: 
    
        - Communication method between sender (server) and user (end 
          host).  Since they belong to the same company, they can use 
          all the available information. 
         
        - Methods to share user-related information between network 
          providers and content providers.

6. IANA considerations 
    
   This I-D does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
    
7. Security considerations 
    
   Accounting capabilities can be used to enhance the security of 
   multicast networks by excluding ineligible clients from the networks. 
    
    
8. Conclusion 
    
   This I-D describes general requirements for providing "well managed" 
   IP multicasting services. It lists issues related to accounting, 
   authentication, authorization and admission control for multicast 
   content delivery, with the goal of finding a solution implemented at 
   edges of the network based on IGMP or MLD. This solution likely would 
   assume the existence of a database in the network dedicated to 
   accumulating logs obtained from edge routers.  Content Delivery 
   Services with different business models is cited as an application 
   which could benefit from the capabilities of "well managed" IP 
   multicasting described in this document. 
   It is proposed that this document be used as a starting point for 
   discussing requirements for "well managed" IP multicasting services.
