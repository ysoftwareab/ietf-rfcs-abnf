1. Introduction 

   This document describes requirements for, and use of, the Generalized 
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane in conjunction 
   with the Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) layer 1 inverse multiplexing 
   mechanism and its companion Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS) 
   which can be used for hitless dynamic resizing of the inverse 
   multiplex group.  The reader is directed to Appendix A that presents 
   an overview of the capabilities of VCAT and LCAS in transport 
   networks.  Further, Appendix B describes a carrier perspective on the 
   application areas for these technologies.  We develop a set of 
   scenarios and specific requirements to support these scenarios in 
   GMPLS-enabled networks.  We then describe the RSVP-TE mechanisms 
   needed to set up co-routed as well as diversely routed circuits that 
   are members of the same VCAT group and to resize those using LCAS.

   o  Dropped section 3.3 about advertising VCAT and LCAS capability.  
      This change is due to the amount of information that would need to 
      be advertised.  VCAT capability at the interface comprises a lot 
      of information, which make advertising not very scalable.  For 
      example, a node could perform an adaptation using two interfaces 
      lying on different line cards but that's not necessarily always 
      the case.  This update to the draft expects the use of the NMS in 
      selecting the right destinations. 

   o  Removed references to OSPF-TE 

3. VCAT/LCAS Scenarios and Specific Requirements 

   From the carrier application areas discussed in Appendix B, we can 
   derive a number of specific requirements for the support of VCAT/LCAS 
   in GMPLS.  A number of requirements can additionally be derived from 
   the flexible nature of VCAT/LCAS. 

3.1. Multiple VCAT Groups per GMPLS Endpoint  

   In general, an LSR can be ingress/egress of one or more VCAT groups.  
   VCAT and LCAS are interface capabilities.  An LSR may have, for 
   example, VCAT-capable interfaces that are not LCAS-capable.  It may 
   at the same time have interfaces that are neither VCAT nor LCAS-
   capable. 

3.2. Component Signal Configuration Requirements 

   We list in this section the different scenarios that SHOULD be 
   supported.  Here we use the term "VCG" to refer to the entire VCAT 
   group and the terminology "set" and "subset" to refer to the 
   collection of potential VCAT group member signals. 

   o  Fixed, co-routed: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over a co-
      routed set of member signals.  This is the case where the intended 
      bandwidth of the VCG does not change and all member signals follow 
      the same route and minimize differential delay.  The intent here 
      is the capability to allocate an amount of bandwidth close to that 
      required at the client layer. 

   o  Fixed, diversely routed: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over 
      at least two diversely routed subsets of member signals.  In this 
      case, the subsets are link-disjoint over at least one link of the 
      route.  The intent here is more efficient use of network resources 
      (no unique route has the required bandwidth), and additional 
      resilience and graceful degradation in the case of failure (note 
      that differential delay may be a limiting factor).

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2006 
    

   o  Dynamic, co-routed: A dynamic VCG (bandwidth can be increased or 
      decreased via the addition or removal of member signals), 
      transported over a co-routed set of members.  Intent here is 
      dynamic sizing of bandwidth. 

   o  Dynamic, diversely routed: A dynamic VCAT group, transported over 
      at least two diversely routed subsets of member signals.  The 
      intent here is dynamic resizing and resilience (but differential 
      delay may be a limiting factor). 

3.3. VCAT Operation With or Without LCAS 

   VCAT capabilities may be present with or without the presence of 
   LCAS.  The use of LCAS is beneficial to the provision of services, 
   but in the absence of LCAS, VCAT is still a valid technique.  
   Therefore GMPLS mechanisms for the operation of VCAT are REQUIRED for 
   both the case where LCAS is available and the case where it is not 
   available.  The GMPLS procedures for the two cases SHOULD be 
   identical. 

4. GMPLS Mechanisms for Signaling VCAT/LCAS 

   We describe in this section the signaling mechanisms that already 
   exist in GMPLS using RSVP-TE [RFC3473] and the extensions needed, for 
   diversely routed paths and in support of the LCAS procedure. 

   Section 4.1 is included for informational purposes only.  It 
   describes existing procedures and makes not changes. 

   Section 4.2 describes new procedures proposed to support diversely 
   routed VCAT groups.  Where possible it reuses applicable existing 
   procedures from section 4.1.  

4.1. Co-Routed Signals 

   Note that this section is for informational purposes only. 

   The existing signaling protocols support co-routed signal setup using 
   the NVC field as explained in section 2.1 of RFC 3946 [RFC3946bis].  
   In this case, one single LSP is set up in support of the VCAT group. 

   There are two options for setting up the VCAT group, depending on 
   hardware capability, or management preferences: one-shot setup and 
   incremental setup.

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2006 
    

   The following sections explain the procedure based on an example of 
   setting up a VC4-7v SDH VCAT group (corresponding to an STS-3c-7v 
   SONET VCAT group). 

4.1.1. One-shot Setup of Co-Routed Signal 

   An RSVP-TE Path message is used with the following parameters. 

   With regards to the traffic parameters, the elementary signal is 
   chosen (6 for VC-4/STS-3c_SPE).  The value of NVC is then set to 7. 

   A Multiplier Transform greater than 1 (say N>1) is used if the 
   operator wants to set up N VCAT groups that will belong to and be 
   assigned to one LSP. 

   SDH or SONET labels in turn have to be assigned for each member of 
   the VCG and concatenated to form a single Generalized Label 
   constructed as an ordered list of 32-bit timeslot identifiers of the 
   same format as TDM labels.  RFC 3946 requires that the order of the 
   labels reflect the order of the payloads to concatenate and not the 
   physical order of time-slots. 

   When the MT field is larger than 1, the list includes labels for the 
   components of each of the group. 

4.1.2. Incremental Setup of Co-Routed Signal 

   In some cases, it may be necessary or desirable to set up the VCG 
   members individually, or to add group members to an existing group. 

   One example of this need is when the hardware that supports VCAT can 
   only add VCAT elements one at a time or cannot automatically match 
   the elements at the ingress and egress for the purposes of inverse 
   multiplexing.  Serial or incremental setup solves this problem. 

   In order to accomplish incremental setup an iterative process is used 
   to add group members.  For each iteration, NVC is incremented up to 
   the final value required.  The iteration consists of the successful 
   completion of a Path and Resv signaling.  At first, NVC = 1 and the 
   label includes just one timeslot identifier  

   At each of the next iterations, NVC is set to (NVC +1), one more 
   timeslot identifier is added to the ordered list in the Generalized 
   Label (in the Path or Resv message).  A node that receives a Path 
   message that contains changed fields will process the full Path 
   message and, based on the new value of NVC, it will add a component

   signal to the VCAT group, and switch the new timeslot based on the 
   new label information. 

   Following the addition of the new label to the LSP, LCAS may be used 
   in-band to add the new label into the existing VCAT group.  LCAS 
   signaling for this function is described in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

4.1.3. Removing a Component Signal 

   The procedure to remove a component signal is similar to that used to 
   add components as described in Section 4.1.2.  The LCAS in-band 
   signaling step is taken first to take the component out of the group.  
   LCAS signaling is described in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

   In this case, the NVC value is decremented by 1 and the timeslot 
   identifier for the dropped component is removed from the ordered list 
   in the Generalized Label.  This function is not supported without 
   management intervention for VCAT-only interfaces as removing one 
   component of the VCG will result in errors in the inverse-
   multiplexing procedure of VCAT and result in the teardown of the 
   whole group.  So, this is a feature that only LCAS-capable VCAT 
   interfaces can support without management intervention at the end 
   points. 

4.1.4. Removing Multiple Component Signals in One Shot 

   The procedure is similar to 4.1.3.  In this case, the NVC value is 
   changed to the new value and all relevant timeslot identifiers for 
   the components to be torn down are removed from the ordered list in 
   the Generalized Label.  This is also not supported for VCAT-only 
   interfaces without management intervention as removing one component 
   of the VCG will tear down the whole group. 

4.1.5. Use of multiple LSPs for Co-Routed Signals 

   Co-routed signals may also be supported by distinct LSPs signaled 
   separately using exactly the techniques described for diversely 
   routed signals in Section 4.2. 

4.1.6. Teardown of Whole VCG 

   The entire LSP is deleted in a single step (i.e., all components are 
   removed in one go) using deletion procedures of [RFC 3473].

4.2. Diversely Routed Signals 

   The initial GMPLS specification did not support diversely routed 
   signals using the NVC construct.  In fact, RFC 3946 says: 

         [...] The standard definition for virtual concatenation allows 
         each virtual concatenation components to travel over diverse 
         paths.  Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must 
         travel over the same (component) link if they are part of the 
         same LSP.  This is due to the way that labels are bound to a 
         (component) link.  Note however, that the routing of components 
         on different paths is indeed equivalent to establishing 
         different LSPs, each one having its own route.  Several LSPs 
         can be initiated and terminated between the same nodes and 
         their corresponding components can then be associated together 
         (i.e., virtually concatenated). 

   Diverse routing of signals can be a useful capability but requires 
   the extensions identified in this document. 

4.2.1. Associating Diversely Routed Signals 

   The feature that needs to be added is the functionality to associate 
   the components of the same VCG.  For this purpose, we use the 
   Association Object that was defined in [E2E-RECOVERY] to associate 
   working and recovery LSPs. 

   A diversely routed VCG uses a number of routes R <= VCG size, as some 
   routes may be the same for several components.  A number of LSPs, L 
   (L >= R) are used with each LSP establishing at least one component 
   of the VCG, and at most all of the co-routed members of the group.  
   For a set of c components using the same route, we set up the LSP 
   with NVC = c exactly as explained in section 4.1.1.  Therefore, the 
   association of group members or of sub-groups to form the VCG 
   requires the association of the LSPs used to establish the group 
   members. 

   To be able to associate the LSPs, the Session object MUST be the same 
   for all LSPs (this also indicates that the same Tunnel ID is used for 
   all the LSPs).  The LSP ID, however, MUST be different for each LSP 
   to distinguish between the LSPs.  However, since there are 
   potentially many reasons for multiple LSPs within a single session 
   (for example, end-to-end protection, make-before-break, etc.) a 
   mechanism to identify the association of a subset LSPs is needed.

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2006 
    

   The Association ID in the Association object is a 16-bit value, so we 
   can have for one SESSION up to 2^16 associations, meaning up to 2^16 
   diversely routed VCAT groups and any number of co-routed LSPs. 

   Since we are not using this Association ID to indicate protection, 
   the value for the Association ID should be decided by an outside 
   entity.  This may be the management plane.  The assignment of the 
   Association ID is outside the scope of GMPLS but MUST be unique for 
   the same Session. 

   Note that this does not preclude the use of another Association ID to 
   indicate the recovery, as the standard allows the use of multiple 
   Association objects.  We need to differentiate between the 
   association objects used for the VCAT group and the association 
   objects used for recovery. 

   In this draft, we define a new association type to indicate that this 
   is a VCG association. 

4.2.1.1. Format 

   Association Type: 16 bits  

               Value       Type  
               -----       ----  

                 3         VCAT group  

   See [E2E-RECOVERY] for the definition of other fields and values 
   while noting again that the Association ID should be unique per 
   session. 

4.2.2. Recap of Setup Using Diversely Routed Components 

   For every route R, use procedure outlined in 4.1.1 or 4.1.2 depending 
   on the capability of the equipment or general preference.  The Path 
   message MUST include the Association object with type set to 3. 

   For example, we use two routes: one to carry 3 VC-4 circuits and the 
   other to carry 4 VC-4 circuits.  This results in two associated LSPs. 

   Following the addition of the new LSP (i.e., RESV message is received 
   by the endpoint adding bandwidth), LCAS signaling is used in-band to 
   hitlessly add the new label into the existing group [ITU-T-G.7042].

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2006 
    

4.2.3. Recap of Reduction/Teardown Using Diversely Routed Components 

   For every route R, to remove component circuits on that route, first, 
   LCAS signaling is used in-band to remove the labels associated with 
   the LSP from the group.  LCAS signaling is defined in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

   Then, use procedures outlined in 4.1.3 or 4.1.4.  

   This again can only be done on LCAS-capable interfaces.  If the 
   procedure is attempted on VCAT-only interfaces, then the whole VCG is 
   torn down (this is not a graceful teardown so ingress/egress initiate 
   a Path Tear/Resv Tear) on all routes R. 

4.2.4. Update and Upgrade of Existing VCAT Groups 

   For existing VCAT groups, in order to allow them to participate in 
   diversely routed VCGs, we use the same method of changing the message 
   ID for the Path message of an existing LSP and adding the Association 
   object that will be interpreted at all intermediate and edge nodes 
   and that Association object will be added to the LSP information. 

4.2.5. One LSP per Circuit 

   Similarly to in 3.2.4, one may wish to use as many LSPs as circuits.  
   This is supported and each LSP will be used to set up one element of 
   the VCG.  The Association object is used to indicate the VCG 
   association type. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests from IANA the assignment of a new Association 
   Type within the Association object.  This object was defined in [E2E-
   RECOVERY]. 

6. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces a new use of the Association object for GMLS 
   signaling [RFC3473] to associate diversely routed VCAT group members.  
   It does not introduce any new signaling messages, nor change the 
   relationship between LSRs that are adjacent in the control plane.  
   This association information in the event of an interception may 
   indicate that there members of the same VCAT group that take a 
   different route and may indicate to an interceptor that the network 
   may be more robust. 

   Otherwise, this document does not introduce any additional security

APPENDIX A: An Overview of VCAT and LCAS 

   Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) is a standardized layer 1 inverse 
   multiplexing technique that can be applied to OTN [ITU-T-G.709], 
   SONET [ANSI-T1.105], SDH [ITU-T-G.707], and PDH [ITU-T-G.7043] 
   component signals.  By inverse multiplexing we mean a method that 
   combines multiple links at a particular layer into an aggregate link 
   to achieve a commensurate increase in available bandwidth on that 
   aggregate link.  More formally, VCAT essentially combines the payload 
   bandwidth of multiple path layer network signals (or trails) to 
   support a single client (e.g. Ethernet) layer link.  For a more 
   detailed introduction, see [BCRH06], [BRS04] and [Hel05]. 

A.1. VCAT Signals and Components 

   In the following we will use SDH terminology rather than both SONET 
   and SDH terminology.  In SDH Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) can be 
   applied to the following component time division multiplex (TDM) 
   signals referred to as Virtual Containers (VCs): VC-11, VC-12, VC-2, 
   VC-3, and VC-4. 

   Only like component signals can be aggregated into a VCAT group.  
   These groups are respectively known as: VC-11-Xv, VC-12-Xv, VC-2-Xv 
   (X= 1... 64), VC-3-Xv and VC-4-Xv (X=1... 256). 

   VCAT can be applied to the following PDH signals as specified in 
   reference [ITU-T-G.7043]: DS1, E1, E3, DS3.  Similar to the SONET/SDH 
   case these component signals can only be combined with like signals 
   to produce aggregates.  For some reason the virtual concatenation 
   groups of the PDH signals were not given unique designations in [ITU-
   T-G.7043] so we shall adopt a similar notation to the SDH VCAT 
   signals for the permitted PDH VCAT signals that follow: DS1-Xv, E1-Xv 
   (X=1... 16), E3-Xv, DS3-Xv (X= 1... 8). 

   Concatenation in the optical transport network (OTN) is realized by 
   means of virtual concatenation of Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPU) 
   signals.  OPUk signals (k= 1, 2, 3) can be concatenated into OPUk-Xv 
   aggregates (X= 1... 256).  See reference [ITU-T-G.709] for details. 

A.2. VCAT Capabilities and Limitations 

   VCAT performs inverse multiplexing by octet/byte de-interleaving of 
   the encapsulated client bit stream.  The main limitation of any VCAT 
   standard or implementation is the amount of differential delay that 
   can be accommodated between the component signals when they are 
   diversely routed.  These are summarized for the different signal

   types in reference [BCRH06] and [Hel05] with details given in the 
   respective standards documents. 

A.3. The LCAS Protocol 

   The Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme for VCAT signals is a protocol 
   for dynamically and hitlessly changing (i.e., increasing and 
   decreasing) the capacity of a VCAT group.  LCAS also provides 
   survivability capabilities, automatically decreasing the capacity if 
   a member of the VCAT group experiences a failure in the network, and 
   increasing the capacity when the network fault is repaired.  LCAS, 
   itself, provides a mechanism for interworking between LCAS and non-
   LCAS VCAT end points.  VCAT does not require LCAS for its operation. 

   LCAS functionality does not overlap or conflict with GMPLS' routing 
   or signaling functionality for the establishment of component links 
   or entire VCAT groups.  LCAS instead is used to control whether a 
   particular component signal is actually put into service carrying 
   traffic for the VCAT group. 

   LCAS provides for graceful degradation of failed links by having the 
   sink end report back the receive status of all member components.  In 
   the case of a reported member failure, the source end will stop using 
   the component and the source end will send an LCAS message to the 
   sink end that it is not transmitting data on that component.  The 
   worst case notification times are summarized in [BCRH06] and [Hel05].

APPENDIX B: Carrier Perspective on VCAT/LCAS Application Areas 

   We present in this appendix a number of application areas of VCAT and 
   LCAS that make them valuable in the transport network. 

B.1. VCAT Advantages 

   When used as a transport layer, SONET/SDH networks may require that 
   containers be grouped together to offer services with higher 
   bandwidth than the base elementary transport entities.  While 
   contiguous concatenation imposes stringent constraints on the 
   placement of component signals and restricts sizing to specific 
   combinations (X= 1, 4, 16 ...), virtual concatenation offers much 
   more flexibility (X= 1, 2, 3 ...) in sizing and no placement 
   restrictions. 

B.1.1. Right Sizing Bandwidth 

   Virtual concatenation allows the customization of the number of 
   components in a group, thus offering a bandwidth closer to the client 
   layer needs.  A common example is the STS-3c-7v/VC-4-7v often used in 
   data transport since well fit to 1 Gbit/s traffic, whereas an STS-
   48c/VC-4-16c (imposed by contiguous concatenation) would be too big 
   and lead to wasting bandwidth. 

B.1.2. Bandwidth Efficiencies in a Mesh Network 

   Given an end-to-end bandwidth demand between a source and a sink and 
   a mesh network topology, there may be enough total bandwidth across 
   the network to meet the demand, but not along a single route.  VCAT 
   has the ability to transport components of a Virtually Concatenated 
   Group (VCG) over different paths which can be diversely routed in the 
   network.  In this way, a carrier increases the efficiency of the 
   transport network by making better use of the mesh topology of that 
   network. 

B.1.3. Minimizing Restoration Impact  

   The diverse routing enabled by VCAT is a useful capability since, in 
   case of single failure, only a subset of the members of the VCG needs 
   to be recovered, which allows a higher availability than the single 
   route case.  This means that a failure does not require recovery for 
   the whole VCG but only for the failed path, and a sub-part of the 
   total bandwidth will be easier to restore than the full pipe.  This 
   becomes more beneficial when combined with LCAS (see below).  As a 
   matter of fact, this is a key driver for using VCAT in a carrier's 
   network.

B.1.4. Modify Component Routing  

   In order to migrate from singly-routed transport services and 
   distribute circuits over multiple routes, it is also useful to 
   segregate a single VCG into several LSPs.  Indeed, while resources 
   may be provisioned using a single LSP at day one, there should be a 
   migration path to allow the members of the VCG to be carried over 
   diverse routes as allowed by VCAT. 

B.2. LCAS Advantages 

   When VCAT is used in a carrier network, enabling LCAS brings a number 
   of additional advantages to network operations. 

B.2.1. Graceful Degradation 

   When a member of an LCAS-enabled VCG is faulty, the other members 
   keep carrying their portion (interleaved bytes) of traffic, i.e., the 
   portion of the traffic on the faulty member does not reach the 
   destination.  Hence, the entire VCG is delivering errored data until 
   the faulty member is removed from the VCG.  With LCAS the process of 
   removing the faulty member is automated and very fast.  Note that 
   removing the member from carrying traffic for the group is different 
   from setting up or removing the member circuit.  This functionality 
   is particularly useful when the VCG is diversely routed because some 
   bandwidth remains available during restoration and can be used by the 
   client layer with no interruption to traffic, albeit at a decreased 
   bit-rate. 

B.2.2. Dynamic Adjustment 

   LCAS allows for hitless resizing of VCGs between two endpoints.  
   Without LCAS, the bandwidth associated with a transport service 
   cannot be modified without traffic disruption: a VCG needs indeed to 
   be re-provisioned with the necessary number of components to meet the 
   new demand.  LCAS brings the necessary mechanisms to modify a VCG by 
   adding and removing some components while allowing the VCG to carry 
   traffic uninterrupted. 

B.2.3. Painless Re-Grooming 

   When connections need to be rerouted due to maintenance or to make 
   efficient use of network resources, the process, known as re-
   grooming, generally impacts user traffic.  LCAS enables a hitless 
   method for re-grooming by first adding to VCGs additional components 
   that have been set up on the new desired path, then removing the old

   components from the VCG and releasing the unused resources from the 
   network.
