Abstract

   A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the
   Internet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and
   destinations.  However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or
   characteristics to a given resource identifier and subsequently
   assessing those attributes or characteristics has not been specified
   and deployed.

   Two tasks are envisioned.  The first task will be to define a general
   resolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers to a
   list of attributes.  The second task will be to define an
   administrative model and update protocol that can be used to set up
   and maintain the information the resolution protocol accesses.

Internet-Draft             RESCAP Requirements                 June 2002


1. Discussion

   This draft is being discussed on the ResCap mailing list at
   <rescap@cs.utk.edu>.  Subscription requests can be sent to <rescap-
   request@cs.utk.edu> (send an email message with the word "subscribe"
   in the body).  More information on the mailing list along with an
   archive of back messages is available at <ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/
   rescap>.

2. Introduction

   An attribute is a named characteristic of a resource identifier with
   a value that is meaningful in the context in which it is used.  An
   attribute may be requested from a ResCap server.  An example of an
   attribute might be a content type that an email address is capable of
   receiving.

   A capability is a named set of one or more attributes that is
   meaningful in the context in which it is evaluated.  A capability may
   be requested from a ResCap server.  An example of a capability would
   be the complete set of content types that an email address could
   receive.

   A particularly important resolution service of the general type
   described in the Abstract is one which, when given a mail address
   identifying a particular mail recipient, will return a series of
   attributes describing the capabilities of that recipient.  This
   differs from a directory service in that no searching or other
   advanced query operations are involved.  Likewise; this is not a
   discovery protocol.

3. General requirements

3.1 Security

   The protocols must include support for authenticated messages between
   clients and servers.  Specifically, it must be possible for a rescap
   client requesting information to reliably identify the server who is
   the source of the response.  The client should be able to require a
   server to authenticate itself.  The question as to whether the server
   is authorized to respond with the information requested is outside
   the scope of the protocols.  See the Security Considerations section
   for more information.

   Similarly, it must be possible for a rescap server to reliably
   identify the client who is making the request for information.  The
   server should be able to require the client to authenticate itself.
   The question as to whether the client is authorized to request the

Internet-Draft             RESCAP Requirements                 June 2002


   information is outside the scope of the protocols.  See the Security
   Considerations section for more information.

   Because the principal purpose of the protocols is the dissemination
   of public information, support for confidentiality services is
   explicitly not required from the protocols.  Nevertheless, specific
   attributes or capabilities may themselves be encrypted, unbeknownst
   to the protocol.  Also, local security policies may require the use
   of a secure transport layer that includes confidentiality services.
   See the Security Considerations section for more information.

4. Resolution protocol requirements

   Throughout the rest of this section, "the protocol" refers to the
   resolution protocol.

4.1 Scalability

   The protocol must be highly scalable both for number of entries in
   the database and number of entries per second resolved.

   Example: Mail services with tens of millions of users could easily
   expect tens of millions of requests per day for client attribute
   information.

4.2 Reply data

   The protocol must be able to support attributes and capabilities that
   are arbitrarily long text or binary values.  The protocol should be
   optimized for the exchange of relatively short length resource
   identifiers and attribute values.  By way of example, the distinction
   between short and long could be determined by whether or not the
   request and response fit in an ordinary UDP packet.

   Servers must either provide the information requested, provide a
   referral indicating from where the information may be requested, or
   indicate the information is not available.  Servers may forward
   requests on behalf of clients, but the forward must be transparent to
   the client.

4.3 Granularity

   A mechanism needs to exist whereby a subset of capabilities for a
   resource can be fetched.  I.e., the protocol request syntax should be
   able ask for one or more features instead of all of them at once.
   However, the client also needs to be able to ask for all capabilities
   known to the server without naming all of them.

Internet-Draft             RESCAP Requirements                 June 2002


   Example: A client might only want to know the S/MIME capabilities of
   a recipient, but not care about its media features.

4.4 Expiration

   Some means to indicate the expected lifetime of a capability is
   required, so that a client application can judge whether, or when,
   the information should be considered stale.

   The expectation is that data will be infrequently updated, and that
   the granularity for time-stamps would be in seconds.

   The protocol should also support a mechanism for indicating the "last
   changed date" of a given attribute.

   Example: The ResCap server may believe that the recipient is only
   temporarily unable to receive large mail messages.

4.5 Referral

   Some sort of request referral mechanism is needed.  In other words,
   the protocol must support a mechanism whereby a response can indicate
   "I don't know, but go ask the ResCap server at address X." or "use
   the following URL to retrieve the ResCap response you requested."
   That is, the response might be a simple DNS name, or it might be a
   full ResCap URL.

   Example: A server might delegate all requests for S/MIME certificate
   information to a different server that keeps track of that type of
   information.

4.6 Security

   The protocol must be able to handle authenticated queries.  The
   protocol must also support transmission of signed and/or encrypted
   responses.  The protocol should allow for a ResCap server to hold and
   return "pre-signed" responses.  This would allow it to hold
   capability information signed by the controller of the resource to
   which it refers, and also to sign responses off-line to avoid the
   need to perform signature computations at the time of responding to a
   query.  This may imply a need to apply a signature to just part of a
   response.

   Servers may require clients to use authenticated requests.  Clients
   are not required to be able to create authenticated queries.  Such
   clients will not be able to make requests of servers requiring
   authenticated queries; such servers might regard this as a feature.

Internet-Draft             RESCAP Requirements                 June 2002


   Clients may require servers to use authenticated responses.  Servers
   must be able to create authenticated responses.

   Controls on which attributes will be announced should exist.

   Note that consideration of transport-level security is out of scope
   here; an appropriate mechanism such as TLS or IPSec should be used
   instead.

   Example: A server might give less information to a client that is
   unauthenticated than to one that is authenticated.  Some information
   from the server may be important enough for the server to want to
   prevent tampering, or even to prevent snoopers from reading.

4.7 Server location

   DNS resource records should be used to determine a protocol server.

   Example:  The ResCap server that provides responses for resources at
   "example.com" might itself be running on a host other than
   "example.com", such as if the administrator of "example.com" has
   outsourced ResCap services to another company.

4.8 Preferences

   Preferences for a set of capabilities, if needed, are to be a
   supplied in a schema-specific fashion.

   Example: A recipient might strongly prefer image/tiff files over
   image/jpeg because s/he can display image/tiff on his/her system
   without launching an external application.

4.9 Simplicity

   The protocol should be sufficiently simple that it allows
   implementation of client and/or server functionality in very small,
   low cost devices (e.g.  telephones, modems, printers, smart-cards,
   etc.).

4.10 Replication and Synchronization

   We need to define the model for consistency between replicas - e.g.
   if a client is using one replica for queries and has to fail over to
   another, what assumptions can the client make about the consistency
   between the two replicas?

   We should consider whether to assume strict master-slave as this
   choice would severely limit scalability of the service.  Multi-master

Internet-Draft             RESCAP Requirements                 June 2002


   seems preferable, but this impacts the protocol as hooks are needed
   to allow clients to make sense of the data if they need to get it
   from multiple servers.

5. Administrative update protocol requirements

   Throughout the rest of this section, "the protocol" refers to the
   administrative update protocol.

5.1 Access control

   Authentication of anyone updating the database is required.

   Example: Individual mail users should be able to update some or all
   of the information about them in the database, but such updates must
   be done with authentication to prevent others from maliciously
   entering false information.

5.2 Inheritance

   The protocol must support inheritance.  Specifically, mechanisms must
   be provided by which administrators can set default values for
   members of their administrative domains.

   If a change is made to a default resource capability value that has
   previously been inherited by some other resource, then the inheritor
   should receive the new value.

   Example: The media features for all addresses at a particular mail
   server might be the same because the mail server processes all
   messages at all addresses.

5.3 Scalability

   The protocol must support atomic processing of request messages.
   This processing does not include updating any replicated sources for
   the information nor.  The client should receive a completion response
   from the server, but the underlying protocol (if used over UDP) might
   require the client to retransmit its request at appropriate intervals
   until it receives such a response.

5.4 Security

   The protocol must include support for authenticated messages.
   Servers and clients must use authenticated requests and responses to
   effect changes to attributes or capabilities.

Internet-Draft             RESCAP Requirements                 June 2002


5.5 Replication and Synchronization

   SRV and/or NAPTR resource records may be used to determine a protocol
   server.  [SRV, NAPTR]

6. Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed in sections 2.1, 3.6, 4.1 and 4.4 of
   this memo.

   It is also worth noting that the data which these protocols will be
   designed to deal with are meant to be public, not private.

   However, support for authentication should be included in the
   resolution protocol to permit administrators to restrict the
   attributes that are returned in response to a request according to a
   locally specified security policy.  The security policy may require
   the use of a transport security protocol, e.g., TLS [TLS], to provide
   additional security services not supported by these protocols.
