3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in section "Terminology" of the DHCP specification.

4. Network Time Protocol (NTP) Servers option

   The Network Time Protocol Servers option provides a list of one or 
   more IP addresses of NTP [2] servers available to the client. The 
   NTP servers SHOULD be listed in the order of preference.

   The format of the Network Time Protocol Servers option is as shown
   below:

       0                   1                   2                   3

5. Timezone option

   The Timezone option is used by the server to convey client's timezone 
   information to the client.

   The format of the Timezone option is:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   option-code:   OPTION_TIME_ZONE (tbd)

   option-len: Length of the 'time-zone' field in octets

   time-zone:   Time zone of the client in the format as explained below.
   
      Std[Offset[Dst[Offset],[Start[/Time],End[/Time]]]]

   where '[' and ']' enclose optional fields, '|' indicates choice
   of exactly one of the alternatives, ',' and '/' represent literal
   characters present in the string.

   If "Offset" is specified, then the time-zone is represented in the
   IEEE 1003.1 POSIX timezone format [3].

      Std      Three or more octets for the standard timezone (Std).
               Any character (or case) except a leading colon, digits,
               comma, minus or plus sign is allowed. If the time-zone
               is not represented in IEEE 1003.1 POSIX timezone format [3], 
               then Std is treated as the index to the timezone database,
               for example, a file name, from where additional information
               about the timezone may be obtained.

      Offset   Indicates the value one must add to local time to
               arrive at UTC, of the form:  [+|-]hh[:mm[:ss]].  Offset
               following Std is required, if the timezone is represented
               in IEEE 1003.1 POSIX timezone format. Digits are always 
               interpreted as decimal number.  If preceded by a '-', the 
               timezone is east of the Prime Meridian, otherwise it is west 
               ('+' is optional) The permissible values for hh[:mm[:ss]] are 
               as follows:

                  hh       0 <= hh <= 23

                  mm       0 <= mm <= 60
                  
		  ss       0 <= ss <= 60

      Dst      Three or more octets for the daylight savings timezone.
               If Dst is missing, then daylight savings time does not
               apply in this locale.  If no Offset follows Dst, then
               Dst is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.
               Any character (or case) except a leading colon, digits,
               comma, minus or plus sign is allowed.

      Start    Indicates the day of the year, in one of the formats
               indicated below, when to change to daylight savings time.
               The ``Time'' field (which follows immediately after a
               ``/'' character, if present) indicates when the change is
               made, in local time.

Internet-Draft       Time Configuration Options for DHCPv6      Feb 2003



      End      Indicates the day of the year, in one of the formats
               indicated below, when to change back from daylight
               savings time.  The ``Time'' field (which follows
               immediately after a ``/'' character, if present)
               indicates when the change is made, in local time.

      Time     Time has the same format as Offset, except that no
               leading ``-'' or ``+'' is permitted.  The default is
               02:00:00.

   The day of the year needs to be given in any of the following 
   formats:

      Jn       The julian day n, (1 <= n <= 365).  Leap days are not
               counted.

      n        Zero-based julian day, (0 <= n <= 365).  Leap days are
               counted so it is possible to refer to Feb 29.

      Mm.n.d   The ``d''th day, (0 <= d <= 6) of week ``n'' of month
               ``m'' of the year (1 <= n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12, where week
               5 means last ``d'' day in month ``m'' which may occur in
               either the fourth or the fifth week.  Week ``1'' is the
               first week in which the ``d'' day occurs. Day ``0'' refers
               Sunday, day ``1'' refers Monday and so on.

   Examples:

   i) Indian Standard Time zone is represented as:

      IST-5:30

   Here, ``IST'' refers the standard timezone and ``-5:30'' is the offset. 
   `-' sign in the offset says that the timezone is 5 hours and 30 minutes
   ahead of UTC. Absence of ``Dst'' says that daylight savings doesn't apply
   to this locale.

   ii) For Eastern USA time zone, 1986, the timezone string is as shown below:

      EST5EDT4,116/02:00:00,298/02:00:00

   It says:

   The standard time zone is in 5 hours behind UTC. The Daylight Savings 
   Timezone is 4 hours behind UTC. Day light savings starts at 116 day, i.e., 
   April 27 02:00 AM standard time and ends at 298th day, i.e., October 26 
   02:00 AM daylight time.

Internet-Draft       Time Configuration Options for DHCPv6      Feb 2003

      It can also represented as:
      
      EST5EDT,116/02:00:00,298/02:00:00
    
    Since no offset follows the ``Dst'', daylight savings time is 1 hour 
    ahead of standard time, thus, it is 4 hours behind UTC.

    iii) Representing ii) in the non POSIX standard way is:

       America/New-York

     It says that the locale belongs to New-York timezone in America, which 
     will be used as the index in to a timezone database to get more 
     information of the timezone.

6. Appearance of these option

   The NTP servers and Timezone options MUST appear only in the following 
   messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Confirm, Renew, Rebind, 
   Information-Request and Reply. 

   The option number for these options MAY appear in the Option Request
   Option [1] in the following messages: Solicit, Request, Confirm, Renew, 
   Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure.

7. Security Considerations

   The NTP servers option may be used by an intruder DHCP server to 
   cause DHCP clients to contact an intruder NTP server, resulting in 
   invalid synchronization of time in client and finally leading to
   time critical applications running inaccurately in client machine.
   The time accuracy can be crucial to some security algorithms. For 
   example, it may cause expired certificates to gain a new life, making
   the application less secured.

   The Timezone option may be used by an intruder DHCP server to assign 
   invalid time zones, leading to timing issues for the applications running 
   on the client machine.

   To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCP client SHOULD use 
   authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" 
   in the DHCPv6 specification [1]).

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to these options from the
   option-code space defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of the DHCPv6
   specification [1].
