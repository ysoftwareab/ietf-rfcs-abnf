INTERNET-DRAFT    Multiplexing Scheme Updates for QUIC   28 January 2022


1.  Introduction

   "Multiplexing Scheme Updates for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP) Extension for Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"
   [RFC7983] defines a scheme for a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
   [RFC3550] receiver to demultiplex DTLS [RFC6347], Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC8489], Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP) / Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP)
   [RFC3711], ZRTP [RFC6189] and TURN Channel packets arriving on a
   single port.

   This document updates [RFC7983] and [RFC5764] to also allow QUIC
   [RFC9000] to be multiplexed on the same port.  Currently implemented
   QUIC congestion control mechanisms are unsuitable for transport of
   media in realtime communications use cases.  As a result, peer-to-
   peer operation in WebRTC scenarios, described in [P2P-QUIC] [P2P-
   QUIC-TRIAL], used RTP for transport of audio and video while QUIC was
   used for data exchange.

   In such a scenario, SRTP [RFC3711] is keyed using DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764]
   and therefore SRTP/SRTCP [RFC3550], STUN, TURN, DTLS [RFC6347] and
   QUIC need to be multiplexed on the same port. If QUIC congestion
   control is modified to enable peer-to-peer transport of audio and
   video with low latency [I-D.engelbart-rtp-over-quic] as well as data,
   only STUN, TURN and QUIC would need to be multiplexed on the same
   port.

   Since new versions of QUIC are allowed to change aspects of the wire
   image, there is no guarantee that future versions of QUIC beyond
   version 1 will adhere to the multiplexing scheme described in this
   document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Multiplexing of TURN Channels

   TURN channels are an optimization where data packets are exchanged
   with a 4-byte prefix instead of the standard 36-byte STUN overhead
   (see Section 3.5 of [RFC8656]).  [RFC7983] allocated the values from
   64 to 79 in order to allow TURN channels to be demultiplexed when the
   TURN Client does the channel binding request in combination with the
   demultiplexing scheme described in [RFC7983].

   As noted in [I-D.aboba-avtcore-quic-multiplexing], the first octet of



Aboba, et. al                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Multiplexing Scheme Updates for QUIC   28 January 2022


   a QUIC short header packet falls in the range 64 to 127, thereby
   overlapping with the allocated range for TURN channels of 64 to 79.

   The first octet of QUIC long header packets fall in the range 192 to
   255.  Since QUIC long header packets preceed QUIC short header
   packets, if no packets with a first octet in the range of 192 to 255
   have been received, a packet whose first octet is in the range of 64
   to 79 can be demultplexed unambiguously as TURN Channel traffic.
   Since WebRTC implementations supporting QUIC data exchange do not
   utilize TURN Channels, once packets with a first octet in the range
   of 192 to 255 have been received, a packet whose first octet is in
   the range of 64 to 127 can be demultiplexed as QUIC traffic.

3.  Updates to RFC 7983

   This document updates the text in Section 7 of [RFC7983] (which in
   turn updates [RFC5764]) as follows:

   OLD TEXT

   The process for demultiplexing a packet is as follows.  The receiver
   looks at the first byte of the packet.  If the value of this byte is
   in between 0 and 3 (inclusive), then the packet is STUN.  If the
   value is between 16 and 19 (inclusive), then the packet is ZRTP.  If
   the value is between 20 and 63 (inclusive), then the packet is DTLS.
   If the value is between 64 and 79 (inclusive), then the packet is
   TURN Channel.  If the value is in between 128 and 191 (inclusive),
   then the packet is RTP (or RTCP, if both RTCP and RTP are being
   multiplexed over the same destination port).  If the value does not
   match any known range, then the packet MUST be dropped and an alert
   MAY be logged.  This process is summarized in Figure 3.

                    +----------------+
                    |        [0..3] -+--> forward to STUN
                    |                |
                    |      [16..19] -+--> forward to ZRTP
                    |                |
        packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS
                    |                |
                    |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel
                    |                |
                    |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP
                    +----------------+

   NEW TEXT

   The process for demultiplexing a packet is as follows.  The receiver
   looks at the first byte of the packet.  If the value of this byte is
   in between 0 and 3 (inclusive), then the packet is STUN.  If the
   value is between 16 and 19 (inclusive), then the packet is ZRTP.  If
   the value is between 20 and 63 (inclusive), then the packet is DTLS.
   If the value is in between 128 and 191 (inclusive) then the packet is
   RTP (or RTCP, if both RTCP and RTP are being multiplexed over the
   same destination port). If the value is between 80 and 127 or between
   192 and 255 (inclusive) then the packet is QUIC. If the value is
   between 64 and 79 inclusive, then if a packet has been previously
   forwarded that is in the range of 192 and 255, then the packet is
   QUIC, otherwise it is TURN Channel.

   If the value does not match any known range, then the packet MUST be
   dropped and an alert MAY be logged. This process is summarized in
   Figure 3.

           packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS
                       |                |
                       |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel
                       |     [64..127] -+--> forward to QUIC
                       |                |    (Short Header)
                       |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP
                       |                |
                       |    [192..255] -+--> forward to QUIC
                       +----------------+    (Long Header)

4.  Security Considerations

   The solution discussed in this document could potentially introduce
   some additional security considerations beyond those detailed in
   [RFC7983].

   Due to the additional logic required, if mis-implemented, heuristics
   have the potential to mis-classify packets.

   When QUIC is used for only for data exchange, the TLS-within-QUIC



Aboba, et. al                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Multiplexing Scheme Updates for QUIC   28 January 2022


   exchange [RFC9001] derives keys used solely to protect the QUIC data
   packets.  If properly implemented, this should not affect the
   transport of SRTP nor the derivation of SRTP keys via DTLS-SRTP, but
   if badly implemented, both transport and key derivation could be
   adversely impacted.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
