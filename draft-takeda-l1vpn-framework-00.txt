Abstract

   This document provides a framework for Layer 1 Virtual Private
   Networks (L1VPNs). This framework is intended to aid in developing
   and standardizing protocols and mechanisms to support interoperable
   L1VPNs.

   The document examines motivations for L1VPNs, high level (service
   level) requirements, and outlines some of the architectural models
   that might be used to build L1VPNs.

0. Summary

   (This section to be removed before publication as an RFC.)

0.1. Summary

   This document describes a framework for Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPNs).

   L1VPNs provide services over layer 1 networks, such as WDM and TDM
   networks. This document provides a framework for L1VPNs and the
   realization of the framework by those networks being controlled by
   GMPLS protocols.

0.2. Where does it fit in the picture of the IETF Work

   Services may be provisioned across layer 1 networks using
   GMPLS protocols. L1VPNs may be managed and operated using these
   protocols as described in this document. GMPLS protocols were
   developed within the IETF using IP addressing and based on IP and
   other Internet protocols. The IETF continues to work with GMPLS
   protocols, enhancing them and applying them to new requirements.

   VPN related work areas might also have points of interaction with the
   content of this document.

0.3. Justification

   This document exists to demonstrate the service level requirements
   for L1VPNs and to create a framework for L1VPNs within the existing
   Internet architectures. As such, this document is the justification
   for better understanding of L1VPNs within the IETF.

   Study Group 13 of the ITU-T has been investigating the service level
   requirements for L1VPNs with input from major network service
   providers and equipment vendors. There is a strong feeling within SG13
   that the desirability of L1VPN services is growing and that there is a
   need for a minimum set of common approaches that will lead to
   interoperable solutions.

0.4. Related Internet Documents

   Much of the background work for this document has been directly
   developed within the ITU-T and is presented as [Y.1312] and
   [Y.L1VPNARCH]. However, some Internet drafts are related to this topic
   and the following three ones are relevant ones.

3. Introduction

   The document examines motivations for Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks
   (L1VPNs), provides high level (service level) requirements, and
   outlines some of the architectural models that might be used to
   build L1VPNs.

   The objective of the document is mainly to present the requirements
   and architecture work in this field that has been undertaken within
   the ITU-T.

   L1VPNs provide services over layer 1 networks. This document provides
   a framework for L1VPNs and the realization of the framework by those
   networks being controlled by GMPLS protocols.

3.1 Overview

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004



3.1.1 Network Topology

   The layer 1 network, made of Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs) or Time 
   Division Multiplex (TDM) capable switches, may be seen as consisting
   of provider edge (PE) devices that give access from outside of the
   network, and provider (P) devices that operate only within the core of
   the network. Similarly, outside the layer 1 network is the customer
   network consisting of customer (C) devices with access to the layer 1
   network made through customer edge (CE) devices.

   A CE and PE are connected by one or more links. A CE may also be
   connected to more than one PE, and a PE may have more than one CE
   connected to it.

3.1.2 Introducing Layer 1 VPNs

   The concept of a provider provisioned VPN (PPVPN) has been established
   through many previous documents such as [L2VPN-FRAME] and
   [L3VPN-FRAME]. Terminology for PPVPNs is set out in [PPVPN-TERM] with
   special reference to layer 2 and layer 3 VPNs.

   The realization of Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPNs) can be based on extensions of
   the concepts of the PPVPN to the layer 1 network. It must be
   understood that meeting the requirements set out in this document may
   necessitate modifications to the existing mechanisms both for the
   control plane within the layer 1 network and for service provisioning
   at the edge of the network between the CE and PE devices. It is at
   this interface (between CE and PE devices) that the L1VPN service is
   provided.

3.1.3 Current Technologies for Dynamic Layer 1 Provisioning

   Pre-existing efforts at standardization have focused on the provision
   of dynamic connections within the layer 1 network (signaling and
   routing), and the interfaces for requesting services between the CE
   and PE or between PEs at network boundaries (UNI and E-NNI
   respectively).

   No change in principle would be required to the operation within the
   network, and the E-NNI is not in scope for current L1VPN
   considerations. But the UNI is very relevant since it is a means by
   which the CE can make service requests to the PE to establish services
   (that is, connections) across the layer 1 network to remote CEs.

   Current UNIs include features to facilitate requests for end-to-end
   (that is, CE to CE) service requests that include the specification of
   constraints such as explicit paths, bandwidth requirements, protection
   needs, and (of course) destinations.


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires August 2004              [Page 5]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004



   The UNIs, however, do not provide a sufficiently high level of service
   to support VPNs without some additions. For example, there is no way
   to distinguish between control messages received over a shared control
   link at a UNI, and these messages must be disambiguated with respect
   to the L1VPN to which they apply.

   Further, there is currently no leakage of routing information across
   the PE to CE boundary. While this restriction may be considered
   desirable from the perspective of network separation, VPN operation
   may benefit from the dynamic exchange of routing information
   between CEs that provide access to the VPNs.

   In order that L1VPNs can be supported in a fully functional manner,
   these deficiencies and other requirements set out later in this
   document must be addressed.

3.2 Relationship with ITU-T

   This document is based on the work of the ITU-T Study Group 13
   Question 11. This group has been researching and specifying both the
   requirements and the architecture of L1VPNs for some time. In this
   context, this document is a representation of the findings of the
   ITU-T, and a presentation of those findings in terms and format that
   are familiar to the IETF.

   In particular, this document is limited to the areas of concern of
   the IETF. That is, it is limited to layer 1 networks that utilize
   IP as the underlying support for their control plane.

   The intention of this document is to present the requirements and
   architectures developed within the ITU-T to the IETF for better
   understanding and further cooperation between the two bodies.

   Some work related to L1VPN solution space has already been done within
   the IETF. This document intends to set a framework of requirements and
   architectures into which all possible solutions can fit.

4. Motivations

   In this discussion many merits and motivations may be taken for
   granted.

   The general benefits and desirability of VPNs has been described
   many times and in many places. This document does not dwell on the
   merits of VPNs as such, but focuses entirely on the applicability
   of the VPN concept to layer 1 networks.

   Similarly, the utility and value of a control plane for the

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004


   configuration, management and operation of a layer 1 network is
   well-rehearsed.

4.1 Basic Layer 1 Services

   Basic layer 1 services may be characterized in terms that include:

   - Connectivity: Between a pair of CEs.
   - Capacity: For example, the bit rate for a TDM service or the
     capacity of a lambda.
   - Transparency: For example, for an SDH network, overhead
     transparency.
   - Availability: The percentage of time that the quality of the service
     meets the agreed criteria. To achieve the required level of
     availability for the customer connections the service provider's
     network may use restoration or protected resources.
   - Performance: For example, the number of error-seconds per month.

   The layer 1 services may be categorized based on the combination of
   connectivity features (U-plane) and service control capability
   features (C-plane) available to the customer. A CE is associated with
   the service interface between a customer site and the network, and the
   categorization can be seen in the context of this service interface as
   follows.

   1. A single connection between a pair of CEs.

      - Static Service
        The classic private line service achieved through a permanent
        connection.

      - Dynamic Service
        Either a switched connection service, or a customer-controlled
        soft permanent connection service

   2. Multiple connections among a set of CEs.

      - Static Service
        A private network service consisting of a mesh of permanent
        connections.

      - Dynamic Service
        A dynamic private network service consisting of any combination
        of switched connection services and customer-controlled soft
        permanent connection services.

   For both service types, connections are point-to-point, and can be
   permanent, soft-permanent, or switched. For a static service, the
   network is responsible for the management of both the network

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004


   infrastructure and the end user connections. For dynamic services, the
   network is only responsible for the configuration of the
   infrastructure; end user connections are established dynamically by
   the network.

   Note that the ITU-T allows the second categorization of service type 
   to embrace a variety of C-plane types.

4.1.1 L1VPN for Dynamic Layer 1 Provisioning

   Private network services in the second category (above) can be
   enhanced so that multiple private networks are supported across the
   layer 1 network as virtual private networks. These are Layer 1
   Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs).

   Compared to the first type of service, the L1VPN service has features
   such as a separate policy per VPN, and distribution of information
   about which CEs can participate in which VPNs.

4.2 Merits of L1VPN

4.2.1 Customer Merits

   From the customer's perspective, there are two main benefits to a
   L1VPN. These benefits apply over and above the advantages of access
   to a dynamically provisioned network.

   - The customer can outsource the direct management of an optical
     network by placing the VPN management in the control of a third
     party. This frees the customer from the need to configure and
     manage the connectivity information for the CEs that participate
     in the VPN.

   - The customer can make small-scale use of an optical network. So,
     for example, by sharing access to the optical network with many
     other users, the customer sites can be connected together across
     the optical network without bearing the full cost of deploying
     and managing the optical network.

   To some extent, the customer may also gain from the provider's
   benefits (see below). That is, if the provider is able to extract
   more value from the layer 1 network, and provide better
   differentiated services, the customer will benefit from lower
   priced services that are better tailored to the customer's needs.

4.2.2 Provider Merits

   The provider benefits from the customer's perception of benefits.



T.Takeda, et al.            Expires August 2004              [Page 8]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004


   In particular, the provider can build on dynamic, on-demand services
   by offering new VPN services and off-loading the CE-to-CE
   configuration requirements from the customers

   Additionally, a more flexible VPN structure applied to the optical
   network allows the provider to make more comprehensive use of the
   spare (that is, previously unused) resources within the network. In
   particular, since the PE could be responsible for routing the
   connection through the optical network, the optical network can
   reclaim control of how resources are used and adjust the paths so
   that optimal use is made of all available resources.

4.3 L1VPN Deployment Scenarios

4.3.1 Multi-Service Backbone

   A multi-service backbone is characterized in terms such that one
   service department of a carrier receiving the carrier's L1VPN service
   provides different kinds of higher-layer service. The customer
   receiving the L1VPN service (i.e. each service department) can offer
   its own services whose payloads can be any layer (e.g. ATM, IP, TDM).
   From the L1VPN service provider point of view, these services are not
   visible and are not part of the L1VPN service. That is, the type of
   service being carried within the L1 payload is not known by the
   service provider.

   The benefit is that the same L1 core network resources are shared by
   multiple services. A large capacity backbone network (U-Plane) can be
   built economically by having the resources shared by multiple
   services usually with flexibility to modify topologies, while
   separating the control functions. Thus, each customer can select a
   specific set of features that are needed to provide their own
   service.

4.3.2 Carrier's Carrier

   A carrier's carrier is characterized in terms such that one carrier
   that receives another carrier's L1VPN service provides its own
   services. In this scenario, two carriers may be in different
   organizations (or may be separately managed within the same
   organization). It is, therefore, expected that the information
   provided at the service demarcation points is more limited than in
   the multi-service backbone case. Similarly, more less control of the
   L1VPN service is given at the service demarcation points. For example,
   customers of L1VPN service receive:

   - more limited view of L1VPN service provider network

   - more limited control over L1VPN service provider network.


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires August 2004              [Page 9]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004



   One of the merits is that each carrier can concentrate on a specific
   service. For example, the customer of the L1VPN service may focus on
   L3 services, e.g. providing secure access to the Internet, leaving
   the L1VPN provider to focus on the L1 service, i.e. providing a long
   haul bandwidth between cities. The L1VPN customer can construct its
   own network using L1 resources supplied by the L1VPN provider,
   usually with flexibility to modify topologies, and utilize dedicated
   C-Plane functionalities.

4.3.3 L1 Resource Trading

   In addition to the scenarios where the second tier service provider
   is using a single core service provider as mentioned above, it is
   possible for the second tier provider to receive services from more
   than one core service provider. In this scenario, there are some
   benefits for the second tier service provider such as dynamic carrier
   selection based on the price and route redundancy.

   The second tier service provider can support a function that enables
   a L1 resource trading service. Using resource information published
   by its core service providers, a second tier service providers can
   decide how to best use those providers. For example, if one core
   service provider is no longer able to satisfy requests for service,
   an alternate service provider can be used. Or the second tier service
   provider could choose to respond to price changes over time.

   Another example of second tier service provider use is to reduce
   exposure to failures in each provider (improve availability).

4.3.4 Inter-SP L1 VPN

   In addition to the scenarios where a single connection between two
   CEs is routed over a single service provider, it is possible that a
   connection is routed over multiple service providers. This service
   scenario is called Inter-SP L1VPN.

   This scenario can be used to construct a single L1VPN from services
   provided by multiple regional providers. There could be a variety
   of business relationships among providers and customers.

5. Reference models

   Figure 5.1 describes the L1VPN reference model.

                    Figure 5.1: L1VPN reference model

   In L1VPN, L1 connections are provided between CE's physical interfaces
   within the same VPN. In Figure 5.1, a connection is provided between
   the lefthand CE of VPN A and the upper righthand CE of VPN A, and
   another connection is provided between the lefthand CE of VPN B and
   lower righthand CE of VPN B (shown as "=" mark).

5.1 CE/PE/P Terminology

   In the reference model, the following three types of network devices
   are described. Note that these terminologies are from PPVPN works
   [PPVPN-TERM].

   o CE (Customer Edge) device

   A CE device is a customer device that receives L1VPN service from the


T.Takeda, et al.            Expires August 2004             [Page 11]

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004


   provider. A CE device is connected to at least one PE device. A CE
   device can be a variety of devices, for example, TDM cross connect,
   router and L2 switch. A CE device may also be attached to one or more
   C devices on the customer site.

   o PE (Provider Edge) device

   A PE device is a provider device that provides L1VPN service to the
   customer. A PE device is connected to at least one CE device. A layer
   1 PE device is a TDM or optical cross connect. Or a PE device may be
   an EPL (Ethernet Private Line) type of device, that maps Ethernet
   frames on L1 connections.

   o P (Provider) device

   A P device is a provider device, which is connected only to other
   provider devices (P or PE devices). A layer 1 P is a TDM or optical
   cross connect.

5.2 Customer/Provider Terminology

   In this document, the following two types of administrative entities
   are described.

   o Customer

   A Customer has authority over a set of CE devices within the same VPN
   (e.g. the owner of CE devices). Note that a customer may outsource the
   management of CE devices to other organizations, including to the
   provider itself.

   o Provider

   A Provider has authority over the management of the provider network.

5.3 Management Systems

   As shown in the reference model, a provider network may contain a
   management system(s). A management system(s) may support functions
   including provisioning, monitoring, billing and recording. Provider's
   management system(s) may also communicate with customer's management
   system(s) in order to provide services.

6. Generic Service Description

   This section describes generic service descriptions. More detailed
   service description is described as specific service models in section
   7.

Internet Draft    draft-takeda-l1vpn-framework-00.txt   February 2004


6.1 CE Construct

   - The CE device may contain multiple VPN instances.
   - CE-PE physical links (between physical interfaces) may be shared by
     multiple VPNs. (assuming that each CE-PE logical link maps one-to-
     one to a VPN, and maps one-to-one or many-to-one to the physical
     link)

6.2 Generic Service Features

   L1VPN has following two generic service features.

   - Connectivity restriction: Layer 1 connectivity is provided to a
     limited set of CE's physical interfaces. (This set forms the L1VPN
     membership.)
   - Per VPN control and management: Some level of control and management
     capability is provided to the customer. Details differ depending on
     service models described in section 7.

7. Service Models

   This section describes Layer 1 VPN service models, derived from the
   generic service description presented above, that can be supported by
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols enabled networks.

   Such layer 1 networks are managed and controlled using GMPLS as
   described in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. It must be understood that
   meeting the requirements set out in this document may necessitate
   modifications to the existing GMPLS protocols both for the control
   plane within the layer 1 network and for service provisioning at the
   edge of the network between the CE and PE devices. A CE and a PE are
   connected by one or more GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) links as
   defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING]. The ends of each link are usually
   represented as GMPLS-capable interfaces.

7.1 Management-based Service Models

   Figure 7.1 describes the management-based service models.

              Figure 7.1: Management-based service models

   In this service model, customer's management system(s) and provider's
   management system(s) communicate with each other. Customer's
   management system(s) access provider's management system(s) to request
   L1 connection setup/deletion between a pair of CEs. Customer's
   management system(s) may obtain additional information, such as
   resource availability information and monitoring information, from
   provider's management system(s). There is no control message exchange
   between a CE and PE.

   The provider network may be based on GMPLS. In this case, existing
   protocols to meet this service model may need to be extended (e.g. to
   support soft permanent connections). However, interfaces between
   management systems are not within the scope of this document.
   Interfaces between management systems and network devices may need to
   be studied further.

7.2 Signaling-based Service Models (Overlay Service Models)

   Figure 7.2 describes the signaling-based service models.

                Figure 7.2: Signaling-based service models

   In this service model, the customer interface is based on GMPLS UNI
   overlay. The CE requests L1 connection setup/deletion to a remote CE.
   There is no routing between a CE and PE. The CE does not receive
   routing information of remote CE sites, nor routing information of the
   provider network. The CE's interface may be assigned a public or
   private address, that designates connection end points.

   A CE may optionally receive a list of TE link addresses  to which it
   can request a connection (a list of addresses within the same VPN)
   (overlay ext.).

   Note that in addition, there may be communication between customer's
   management system(s) and provider's management system(s) in order to
   provide detailed monitoring and fault information etc. to customers.

7.3 Signaling and Routing Service Models

   In this service model, the customer interface is based on GMPLS
   signaling and routing. The CE requests L1 connection setup/deletion to
   a remote CE. There is routing between a CE and PE, or more precisely
   between a CE and the VPN routing context instantiated on the PE. By
   using traffic engineering-based routing information obtained,
   customers can use traffic engineering capabilities within his portion
   of the provider network.

   For example, a customer can setup two disjoint connections between a
   pair of CEs. Another example is that a customer can request a
   connection between a pair of devices within CE sites, and not
   necessarily between CEs.

   Note that in addition, there may be communication between customer's
   management system(s) and provider's management system(s) in order to
   provide detailed monitoring and fault information etc. to customers.

   There are two more detailed signaling and routing service models,
   virtual link models and per VPN peer models.

7.3.1 Virtual Link Models

   Figure 7.3 describes the virtual link models.

              interface                        interface

                     Figure 7.3: Virtual link models

   In this service model, a virtual link is constructed between PEs. A
   virtual link is a TE link connecting two devices where a direct
   physical link does not exist. The CE receives routing information of
   PE-CE links, remote CE sites, as well as virtual links. A virtual
   link's TE attributes may be derived from physical links within the
   provider network.

   As a special case, the provider may choose not to advertise virtual
   links to customers. The CE receives routing information of CE-PE links
   and remote CE sites only. This corresponds to advertising a whole
   provider network as one node, i.e. Generalized Virtual Private Cross-
   Connect (GVPXC) [GVPN].

7.3.2 Per VPN Peer Models

   Figure 7.4 describes per VPN peer models.

                        +--------------------+
                        |                    |

   provider network per VPN, and discloses per VPN TE link information to
   corresponding CEs. As such, a CE receives routing information of PE-CE
   links, remote CE sites, as well as partitioned portions of the
   provider network.

   Note that PEs may advertise abstracted routing information of the
   provider network to CEs, for administrative purpose, as well as for
   excluding "unnecessary information". 

   Note that when inter-area/AS solutions are available, it may be
   valuable to consider inter-area/AS interfaces to be the basis for
   customer interface.

8. Service Models and Service Requirements

   Service models mentioned in section 7 is related to what information
   is exchanged between the CE and the PE. In addition, service models
   vary depending on how U-Plane resources are allocated for each VPN.
   Specifically, service models are described by combining following
   service requirements.

   NOTE: Later version of this document may include more detailed service
   requirements from Y.1312.

   o U-Plane resource allocation
       
     - Shared or dedicated : Shared means that provider network physical
       links are shared by multiple VPNs.(Physical links are allocated to
       each VPN when connection is requested, and physical links
       allocated to one VPN at one time can be allocated to another VPN
       at another time.) Dedicated means that provider network physical
       links are partitioned per VPN. (Physical links allocated to one
       VPN can not be used by other VPNs.)

   o Information exchanged between the CE and the PE
      
     - Signaling 
     - Membership information :  A list of TE link addresses within the
       same VPN (connection end points)
     - Customer network routing information
     - Provider network routing information

   Table 1 shows combination of service requirements and service models.
