Abstract

   This document defines two YANG modules that augment the System data
   model defined in the [RFC 7317] with TACACS+ client model and
   additional AAA model.  The data model of Terminal Access Controller
   Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) client allows the configuration
   of TACACS+ servers for centralized Authentication, Authorization and
   Accouting.  While the current system model only supports
   authentication configuration, the additional AAA model allows system
   authorization and accouting configuration.

   The YANG modules in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG modules that augment the System data
   model defined in the [RFC 7317] with TACACS+ client model and
   additional AAA model.  The data model of Terminal Access Controller
   Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) client allows the configuration
   of TACACS+ servers for centralized Authentication, Authorization and
   Accouting.  While the current system model only supports
   authentication configuration, the additional AAA model allows system
   authorization and accouting configuration.

   TACACS+ provides Device Administration for routers, network access
   servers and other networked computing devices via one or more
   centralized servers which is defined inthe TACACS+ Protocol.
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs]

   A YANG Data Model for System Management [RFC7317]defines two YANG
   features to support local or RADIUS authentication:

   o  User Authentication Model: Define a list of usernames and
      passwords and control the order in which local or RADIUS
      authentication is used.

Internet-Draft             TACACS+ YANG model                 March 2019


   o  RADIUS Client Model: Defines a list of RADIUS server that a device
      used.

   Since TACACS+ is also used for device management and the feature is
   not contained in the system model, this document defines a YANG data
   model that allows users to configure TACACS + client functions on a
   device.

   Additionally, to support full AAA feature, the "ietf-aaa" YANG module
   defined in this document provides user authorization model and user
   accouting model.  The additional AAA model is intended to be used
   together with the authentication feature of the System model, to
   authorize what services that a user is allowed to use, and to
   maintain a record of the actions performed when a user logging on.

   The YANG models can be used with network management protocols such as
   NETCONF[RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration
   of network devices.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  TACACSPLUS Client Model

   This model is used to configure TACACS+ client on the device to
   support deployment scenarios with centralized authentication,
   authorization, and accounting servers.  Authentication is used to
   validates a user's name and password, authorization allows the user
   to access and execute commands at various command levels assigned to
   the user and accounting keeps track of the activity of a user who has
   accessed the device.

   The ietf-tacacs module is intended to augment the "/sys:system" path
   defined in the ietf-system module with "tacacs" grouping.  Therefore,
   a device can use local, Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
   (RADIUS), or Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus
   (TACACS+) to validate users who attempt to access the router by
   several mechanisms, e.g. a command line interface or a web-based user
   interface.

   The "server" list is directly under the "tacacs" container, which is
   is to hold a list of different TACACS+ server and use server-type to
   distinguish the three protocols.  The list of servers is for
   redundancy purpose.

   The "statistics" container under the "server list" is to record
   session statistics and usage information during user access which
   include the amount of data a user has sent and/or received during a
   session.

   The data model for tacacs has the following structure:

4.  AAA Model Augmentation

   This document augments the system model with authorization model and
   accouting model to support full AAA feature.

   For the authentication model, if the NETCONF server advertises the
   "tacacs" feature, the device also supports user authentication using
   TACACSPLUS.  For NETCONF transport protocols that support password
   authentication, the leaf-list "user-authentication-order" is used to
   control if TACACSPLUS password authentication should be used.

   For the authorization model and accouting model, the extended AAA
   data model has the following structure:

       |     +--rw event* [event-type]

                +--rw event-type    identityref
                +--rw record?       enumeration

4.1.  User Authorization Model

   Following authentication, a user must gain authorization for doing
   certain tasks.  For instance, the user may try to issue commands.
   The authorization process determines whether the user has the
   authority to issue such commands.

   This document defines two optional authorization YANG features:
   "local-users" and "tacacs", which the server advertises to indicate
   support for configuring local users on the device and support for
   using TACACSPLUS for authorization, respectively.

   In addition, an authorization parameter is defined to indicate a
   specific authorization event, and an event can be added by defining
   other event identifiers.  Currently,
   "aaa_authorization_event_command" is used to determine whether the
   user is allowed to run commands.

4.2.  User Accounting Model

   Accounting is used to record the authorization information and
   accouting specific information such as start and stop times and
   resource usage information.

   This document defines two optional accouting YANG features: "local-
   users" and "tacacs", which the server advertises to indicate support
   for configuring local users on the device and support for using
   TACACSPLUS for accouting, respectively.

   Two accouting parameters are defined to indicate specific accouting
   event and also the record type.

   o  "event type": "aaa_accounting_event_command" is defined to record
      commands issued by the user.

Internet-Draft             TACACS+ YANG model                 March 2019


   o  "record": Start records indicate that a accouting service is about
      to begin.  Stop records indicate that a service has just
      terminated.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   This document describes the use of TACACS+ for purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accouting, it is vulnerable to all
   of the threats that are present in TACACS+ applications.  For a
   discussion of such threats, see Section 9 of the TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].
