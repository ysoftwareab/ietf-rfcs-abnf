<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal,
        standard functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and destination
        host. Two such functions are network address translation and firewalling.
</p>
<p>When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with NATs and firewalls, as
        described in the MIDCOM architecture, then problems may occur in the transport of media
        traffic when signaling protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is the
        case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP). This document highlights
        problems that may arise. Unfortunately, it is difficult for the end points to detect or
        predict problematic behavior and to determine whether the media path is reliably available
        for packet exchange. 
</p>
<p>This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of NAT and firewall
        control, the reasons that they exist, and possible means of improving their behavior to
        allow protocols that rely upon signaling along the media path to operate effectively.

Introduction</h3>

<p>According to by RFC 3234 <a class='info' href='#RFC3234'>[RFC3234]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and S. Brim, &ldquo;Middleboxes: Taxonomy and Issues,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> middleboxes are defined as any
        intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router
        on the data path between a source host and destination host.
</p>
<p>In the context of SIP a SIP ALG may interact with a node along the media path to control
        network address translation, firewalling, and other functions. 
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> With firewall control packet filters are installed based on the SIP signaling
            interaction to implement a behavior of 'deny by default' in order to reduce the risk of
            unwanted traffic. This function is often referred to as 'gating'. Depending on the
            timing of the packet filter installation and the content of the packet filter signaling
            traffic along the media, such as DTLS-SRTP or ICE, may be treated in an unexpected way. 
</p>
<p>In cases where the middlebox is involved in overcoming unmanaged NAT traversal the case
            is similar. The key feature of this type of NAT traversal is a desire to overcome the
            possible lack of information about any <a class='info' href='#RFC4787'>[RFC4787]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audet, F. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> address and/or port
            mapping by a possibly unknown NAT device (server reflexive address and filtering
            properties). In particular, a NAT binding for an endpoint may not exist yet for the
            address and port identified in the endpoint's SDP. As such, a pilot packet sent by that
            endpoint behind the NAT is required to create the necessary mappings in the NAT for the
            media relay to deliver media destined for that endpoint. Until that pilot packet is
            received no media packets may be reliably forwarded to the endpoint by the relay. 
</p>
</blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p> This document presents a summary of these two techniques, discusses their impact upon
        other protocols such as ICE and DTLS-SRTP, and proposes a set of recommendations to mitigate
        the effects of gating and latching on in-band negotiation mechanisms.

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

</p>
<p>We use the terms filter, policy action (or action), policy rule(s), MIDCOM agent, and
        MIDCOM Policy Decision Point (PDP) as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3303'>[RFC3303]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Srisuresh, P., Kuthan, J., Rosenberg, J., Molitor, A., and A. Rayhan, &ldquo;Middlebox communication architecture and framework,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. The MIDCOM agent
        is co-located with a SIP ALG that communicates with the firewall or the media relay.

Architecture</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#architecture'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Analysed Firewalling Architecture</span><span>)</span></a> shows the architecture that is being considered in this
        document with respect to firewall and NAT traversal using media relaying. The timing and
        directionality with which media packets are allowed to traverse a particular edge device is
        the subject of this investigation. The MIDCOM agent thereby pushes policy rules to the
        middlebox that allow or deny certain flows to bypass. Additionally, in case of media
        relaying it is important for the MIDCOM agent to adjust the signaling messages.

Packet Filtering</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#architecture'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Analysed Firewalling Architecture</span><span>)</span></a> highlights the interaction between the MIDCOM agent and the
        middlebox. These two elements inspect call control signaling and media path packets and
        determine when packets from a given source to a given destination are allowed to flow
        between endpoints. It is common for the gate controller to be the local outbound proxy for a
        given SIP UA being gated. 
</p>
<p>The primary responsibility of the MIDCOM agent, which is co-located with a SIP entity, is
        to examine the call control signaling to determine the media addresses and ports used to
        define the media path between the gated device and the endpoint(s) with which it is
        corresponding. For SIP, this would correspond to the media addresses described within SDP
        after at least one full offer/answer exchange. 
</p>
<p>This information is used to create one or more packet filters that describe the expected
        media path(s) for the call. These packet filters are combined with an algorithmic
        determination, typically based on the state of the call, as to which direction(s) media
        packets are allowed to flow between the endpoints, if at all. The filter and the action that
        is being installed by the MIDCOM agent at the middlebox may change during the lifetime of a
        SIP signaling session, depending on the state of the call or on changes of the address and
        port information of one (or even both) of the end points.
</p>
<p>It is possible that the gate controller may not be able to establish an exact address or
        port for one endpoint involved in the call in which case it may wildcard the address and/or
        port for the source and/or destination endpoint in the packet flow filter. In such a case,
        the packet flow filter is considered to have matched against a given media packet for the
        wildcarded field. 
</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to specify the filter using wildcards, for example, if some end
        point address information is not known at a given point in time. Additionally, the default
        firewalling policy is subject to local configuration ('deny per default' vs. 'permit per
        default'). For a given SIP signaling sessions the policy at the MIDCOM agent might be very
        strict with respect to the packets that are allowed to flow in a particular direction. For
        example, packets may be allowed to flow in both directions, only in one direction for a
        specific media stream. No particular behavior can be assumed. 
</p>
<p>When a media session is destroyed (end of call, deleted from the session description,
        etc.), the MIDCOM agent removes policy rules created for that media session at the
        middlebox.

Protocol Interaction</h3>

<p>MIDCOM agents may employ a variety of models to determine when to change the status of a
          particular policy rule. This is especially true when a call is being established. For SIP,
          this would be when an early dialog is established between endpoints. Although there is the
          potential for a great deal of variability due to an intentional lack of specification,
          typically, one of two models is used by the MIDCOM agent to determine the state of a
          policy rule during call setup: single-stage and two-stage commit. The term 'commit' here
          refers to the point at which a policy rule is setup that allows media traffic to flow. For
          example, this would be the point at which packets for a media stream marked a=sendrecv in
          SDP was allowed to flow bi-directionally by the middlebox.

Single-Stage Commit</h3>

<p>Single stage commit is commonly used when the MIDCOM agent is most involved only in
            firewalling. For SIP, MIDCOM agents use a single-stage commit model typically install
            policy rules for the call when the 200 OK to the INVITE is received in the case that the
            INVITE contained an SDP offer, or when the ACK is received if the initial offer was sent
            in the 200 OK itself.
</p>
<p>This model is often used to prevent media from being sent end-to-end prior to the call
            being established.

<p>In the example above, policy is created in steps 4 and 5 to allow bi-directional media
            flow based on the SDP exchanged in steps 1 and 3. In this example, the MIDCOM agent
            installs the policies after the 200 OK to the INVITE arrives in step 3. With a
            firewalling policy of 'deny by default' media sent prior to steps 5 and 4 by the UAC or
            UAS is discarded by the middleboxes. 
</p>
<p>Noted that early media that arrives before the 200 OK would require special treatment
            since otherwise it would be dropped as well.

Two-Stage Commit</h3>

<p>Two-stage commit is used when the MIDCOM agent also providers functionality, such as
            Quality of Service signaling that may require resources to reserved early on in the call
            establishment process before it is known if the call will be answered. An example of
            this would be where the MIDCOM agent is responsible for guaranteeing a minimum level of
            bandwidth along the media path. In this case an initial set of policies may be sent by
            the MIDCOM agent to the middlebox even though they are put into a pending state but
            trigger a resource reservation. Later, when the call is accepted, the gate controller
            may update the state of the policies to active them.

</p>
<p>In the example above, policies are created in steps 5 and 6 based off of the SDP sent
            in steps 1 and 3 in an initial inactive state (no packets are allowed to flow) despite
            the SDP indicating the media should be bi-directional. This interaction with the
            middlebox, however, triggers a QoS reservation to take place. Later, when the 200 OK to
            the INVITE comes in step 7, the policies are updated in steps 8 and 9 to indicate that
            packets should be allowed to flow bi-directionally. Although functionally equivalent to
            the single-stage commit example given earlier in <a class='info' href='#single-stage-commit'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example Single-stage Commit with SIP and SDP</span><span>)</span></a>,
            other operations at the gate agent may have been performed simultaneously in steps 5 and
            6 that justifies the early explicit definition of the gates in an inactive state. The
            full usage of PRACK here is not shown for purposes of brevity.

Further Reading</h3>

<p>Packet filtering based on the approach described in this document has been described in a
          number of documents. Although the usage of this architecture can also be found on the
          Internet their behavior is largely specified only in documents that relate to IMS
          standardization. The behavior of the devices deployed on the Internet is therefore largely
          undocumented. Nevertheless, the following documents give the reader a better idea of the
          functionality and the signaling interaction. These documents may also specify an
          additional behavior in relation to how packet filtering is used when the MIDCOM agent is
          responsible for processing SIP/SDP call control signaling and the middlebox is responsible
          for a variety of activities beyond pure filtering. For example, it is common for
          middleboxes to exempt RTCP flows from being blocked even though the associated RTP flows
          are not allowed to flow in order to support RTCP signaling while a call is on hold. These
          references are given here for the reader to gather a better understanding of how this is
          mechanism is used in various forums and is non-exhaustive:

<p>Note that different terms are used for the MIDCOM agent and the middlebox. For example,
          in an IMS context the MIDCOM agent would be part of the P-CSCF and PCRF elements or in
          TISPAN it would be part of the P-CSCF, A-RACF and SPDF that are involved in controlling
          gating operations. Many different elements perform the role of a middlebox: GSM GGSN, CDMA
          PDSN, SAE serving gateway, TISPAN PCEF and A-BGF/C-BGF/I-BGF, PacketCable CMTS, etc. These
          functions may be present in the network in a unified or decomposed architecture.

NAT Traversal</h3>

<p>Two distinct types of NAT traversal can be supported by a MIDCOM agent and the connected middlebox:
      </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
          The MIDCOM agent and the attached middlebox act as a B2BUA at the border of an operator's network to protect this network and to perform the IP address and port conversion, which may be required because private address spaces are used within the network, or because IPv4 and IPv6 address realms are interfacing. For this use case, the middlebox itself performs functions similar to a NAT and is deployed instead of a NAT at a network border.
        
</li>
<li>
          The MIDCOM agent and attached middlebox support the traversal of a residential NAT (also termed costumer premise equipment), which is typically located at the user's side of an access network, for instance within a DSL router. The middlebox thereby acts as kind of media relay.
        
</li>
</ol><p>
      
</p>
<p>
      Both functions can be combined by the same MIDCOM agent and connected middlebox, for instance by a TISPAN C-BGF.
      
</p>
<p>
      As shown in <a class='info' href='#architecture'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Analysed Firewalling Architecture</span><span>)</span></a> the MIDCOM agent that is being co-
      located with the SIP ALG functionality interacts with the middlebox
      that is also a NAT in order to request and allocate NAT bindings and then modifies the SDP offer and answer within SIP to insert the IP addresses and port allocated by the NAT as destination for the media in both directions.  A
      consequence of the interaction with a (double) NAT is that the media
      traffic is forced to traverse a certain NAT in both directions (also
      called media anchoring). The opening of pinholes through the middlebox is only done on request of the MIDCOM agent, and not triggered by the detection of outbound media flows. Such middleboxes are for instance the TISPAN A-BGF/C-BGF/I-BGF and the 3GPP IMS Access Gateway.
      
</p>
<p>
      The functionality and control of the middlebox becomes comparable to a media gateway and TISPAN standardized the usage of the H.248 / MEGACO protocol for the control of the middlebox by the midcom MIDCOM agent.

Protocol Interaction</h3>

<p>The MIDCOM agent's role is to inspect call control signaling and update media address and
          port values based upon media relay binding information allocated with the middlebox/media
          relay. For SIP, this minimally involves updating the c= and m= lines in the SDP, although
          some implementations may also update other elements of the SDP for various reasons. 
</p>
<p>Because the endpoints may not be able to gather a server reflexive address for their
          media streams, the MIDCOM agent employs the following algorithm to ensure that media can
          flow to the given endpoint:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
    When receiving an initial SDP offer, the MIDCOM agent
 requests authorization for the request arriving at the middlebox,
configures the middlebox to forward media between the offerer and the destination address / port as received in the incoming SDP offer, reserves a local IP address and port, and replaces the destination address and port from the incoming offer with the IP address / port used by the middlebox in the forwarded offer.
            
</li>
<li>When receiving an initial SDP answer, the MIDCOM agent
       configures the middlebox for the corresponding session to send media towards the answerer towards the destination address and port as received in the incoming SDP answer,
       request the middlebox to reserve a local IP address / port,
        and exchange the destination address and port from the incoming answer with that middlebox IP address and port in the forwarded answer.
            
</li>
<li>If the middlebox supports the traversal of residential NATs, it applies a technique called "media latching": The destination IP address of packets forwarded by the middlebox in the outbound direction is derived from the source IP address of packets received in the inbound direction. This overrides a destination address possibly configured by the MIDCOM agent.
</li>
</ol><p>
        
</p>
<p>An example of this algorithm is shown in <a class='info' href='#latching_callflow'>Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Call Flow with SIP + SDP</span><span>)</span></a> when using SIP and
          SDP. In this example the UAC is the endpoint served by the MIDCOM agent, which is also
          acting as a local outbound proxy, and the UAS is the corresponding endpoint. We assume that the 
          UAC is located behind a residential NAT; this NAT is, however, not shown in <a class='info' href='#latching_callflow'>Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Call Flow with SIP + SDP</span><span>)</span></a>.

<p>In TS 23.228 the 3GPP standardized the usage of a SIP-ALG residing in the P-CSCF to control an IMS Access Gateway, acting as middlebox at the interface between the IMS and the access network (see Annex G), and the usage of a SIP-ALG residing in the IBCF to control an TrGW as a middlebox at the interface between the IMS and external networks or other IMS networks (see Annex I).
</p>
<p>Although the described residential NAT traversal approach is used by a number of implementations to
          overcome incorrect address/port information in call control signaling from an endpoint

Interactions between Media Path Signaling and Middlebox Behavior</h3>

        document.

Packet Filtering</h3>

<p>The description in <a class='info' href='#packet-filter'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Filtering</span><span>)</span></a> highlighted that the timing of the
          policy rule installation by the MIDCOM agent towards the middlebox has an impact on when
          and what media traffic is allowed to traverse.
</p>
<p>The installation of policy rules is a prerequisite for related media to flow. As those policy rules are derived from information from both SDP offer and answer, they are typically installed at the completion of the first offer-answer exchange.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the middlebox may prevent the exchange of packets in the media path after this point by closing "gates" until the
          session establishment signaling has reached a pre-configured milestone where the MIDCOM
          agent signals to the middlebox that packets are allowed to traverse in both directions.
          Prior to this, packets may be allowed to flow uni-directionally to satisfy certain service
          requirements or may be entirely blocked by the middlebox. For SIP <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>
          the typically milestone that must be reached is offer/answer exchange <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> accompanied by an acknowledgement that the dialog has been accepted
          by the UAS (i.e., 200 OK to the INVITE). 
          
          It depends on the policy of an operator when to open gates. The policy may take into account the requirements of special media types to have early bidirectional media exchanges, e.g. if the usage of DTLS is indicated in SDP.
        
</p>
<p>
          A concrete example of the impact can be found
          with the case of key exchange along the media path, as it is provided by DTLS-SRTP. Figure
          2 of <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;dtls&#8209;srtp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fischl, J., Tschofenig, H., and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> shows that the arrival of the SIP
          INVITE at the UAS triggers the DTLS handshake. This message would be blocked by the
          middlebox, as described in <a class='info' href='#packet-filter'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Filtering</span><span>)</span></a> since the MIDCOM agent has not
          yet installed policy rules. 
          
          The consequence is that the communication fails unless the UAS repeats attempts for an DTLS handshake until connectivity is established in both directions by the installation of policy rules and the presence of opened gates. Due to extra time required for the DTLS exchange the user may experience clipping.
          
         
</p>
<p>
          According to 3GPP standards, gates for RTCP are always opened when policy rules for related media are installed, even if related media traffic is still blocked. Therefore, signalling embedded in RTCP is likely to pass after the completion of the first offer-answer exchange.
          
          Standardized policy rules only inspect source and destination information of IP packets and the transport protocol (e.g., UDP and TCP). 
          Obviously, this is not a property that can be guaranteed to be true in the
          future.

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
NAT Traversal</h3>

<p>The described NAT traversal interaction prevents asynchronous exchange of packets in the
          media path until a pilot packet has been received by the middlebox from the endpoint being
          served. It can be employed for both the <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> offerer and/or answerer.
          Therefore, in the worst case, both endpoints must generate a pilot packet towards each
          other to ensure a bi-directional media path exists. Any signaling on the media path that
          relies upon a uni-directional handshake in the reverse direction may not complete until
          media in the forward direction by the other endpoint. If signaling on the media path is
          required to complete prior to media generation the handshake may stall indefinitely.
</p>
<p>Middleboxes as described in <a class='info' href='#nat-traversal'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>NAT Traversal</span><span>)</span></a> will not allow any media to pass through 
          without being configured to do so by the MIDCOM agent when the first offer-answer exchange is completed. 
          Without latching, it may be technically feasible to pass media packets from answerer towards the offerer after the offer has passed the MIDCOM agent, but existing implementations hardly show that behavior. 
          Furthermore, such middleboxes may apply gating policies similar to the policies discussed in <a class='info' href='#packet-filter2'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Filtering</span><span>)</span></a> in addition.
        
</p>
<p>
        The described latching technique for residential NAT traversal interaction requires that a pilot packet has been
        received by the middlebox from the endpoint being served before the middlebox is able to send packets towards the endpoint.
        This latching technique can be
        employed for both the RFC 3264 offerer and answerer.  Therefore,
        in the worst case, both endpoints must generate a pilot packet
        towards each other to ensure that a bi-directional media path exists. If the first packets to be exchanged in the media path are signalling packets and a particular directionality of those packets is required, communication may fail.
        To overcome these problems, empty packets could be sent by the endpoint that has to receive rather than to send the first signalling message. The offer is capable of sending the pilot packet only when receiving the destination information within the answer. Thus, before that point in time the offerer will also not be able to receive any media packets or related signalling.
        
</p>
<p>
          In a similar manner as outlined in <a class='info' href='#packet-filter2'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Filtering</span><span>)</span></a>, any in-path signalling messages that are sent before the offer-answer exchange is completed will be dropped.

Preliminary Recommendations</h3>

<p>The following preliminary recommendations are suggested:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>REC #1: </dt>
<dd>It is recommended that any protocol handshake on the media path
            ensure that a mechanism exists that causes both endpoints to send at least one packet in
            the forward direction as part of, or prior to, the handshake process. Retransmission of
            STUN connectivity checks (see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;rfc3489bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., Matthews, P., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for (NAT) (STUN),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) as part of
            ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> is an example of such a mechanism that
            satisfies this recommendation. Sending of no-op RTP packets (see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-no-op'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;avt&#8209;rtp&#8209;no&#8209;op]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andreasen, F., &ldquo;A No-Op Payload Format for RTP,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) is another example.
</dd>
<dt>REC #2: </dt>
<dd>
            
            It is recommended that middleboxes present on the media
            path allow at least a nominal amount of traffic to be exchanged between
            endpoints after the completion of the first offer-answer exchange to enable the completion of media path signaling prior to
            the session being established. Such policies may be restricted to media types that use in-path signalling. The amount of traffic necessary to
            complete the signaling between endpoints is expected to be orders
            of magnitude smaller than that of any sufficiently interesting
            fraudulent traffic.
            
            
</dd>
<dt>REC #3: </dt>
<dd>It is recommended that failure to complete signaling on the
          media path not automatically cause the session establishment to
          fail unless explicitly specified by one or more endpoints.  A
            fallback scenario where endpoints retry signaling on the media path is recommended. Recommended points in time to retry signalling on the media path are after the completion of the first offer-answer exchange and again after the session has been established. Additional retries with adequate pacing may be used in addition.
</dd>
<dt>REC #4:</dt>
<dd>	If signaling on the media path is required before media can flow, the answer should send the SDP answer as soon as possible, for example within a provisional SIP response, to allow the media path signalling to bypass middleboxes and therefore to avoid clipping.
