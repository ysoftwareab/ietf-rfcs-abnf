Abstract

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  Assertion Control which allows a client to specify that a directory
  operation should only be processed if the assertion when applied to
  the target entry of the operation.  It can be used to construct "test
  and set" and "test and clear" operations.

1.  Overview

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  [RFC3377] assertion control.  The assertion control allows the client
  to specify a condition which allows the operation to be processed
  normally only when true.  Otherwise the operation fails.

  The control can be used with the Modify operation [RFC2251] to perform
  atomic "test and set" and "test and clear" operations as the the
  asserted condition is evaluated as an integral part the operation.
  The control may be attached to other update operations to support
  conditional add, delete, and renaming of objects.

  The control may also be used with the search operation.  Here the
  assertion is applied to the base object of the search before searching
  for objects matching the search scope and filter.

  The control may also be used with the compare operation.  Here it
  extends the compare operation to allow a more complex assertion.


2. Terminology

  Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680].  The term
  "BER-encoded" means the element is to be encoded using the Basic
  Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions detailed in Section 5.1
  of [RFC2251].

  DN stands for Distinguished Name.
  DSA stands for Directory System Agent (i.e., a directory server).
  DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


3.  The Assertion Control

  The assertion control is an LDAP Control [RFC2251] whose controlType
  is IANA-ASSIGNED-OID and controlValue is a BER-encoded Filter
  [RFC2251, Section 4.5.1].  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.
  There is no corresponding response control.

  Servers implementing this technical specification SHOULD publish
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID as a value of the 'supportedControl' attribute
  [RFC2252] in their root DSE.

  The control is appropriate for both LDAP interrogation and update
  operations [RFC2251] including Add, Compare, Delete, Modify, ModifyDN
  (rename), and Search.  It is not appropriate for Abandon, Bind nor
  Unbind operations.  Nor is it appropriate for the Start TLS [RFC2830]
  operation.

  When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the processing of the
  request is conditional on the evaluation of the Filter as applied
  against the target of the operation.  If the Filter evaluates to TRUE,
  then the request is processed normally.  If the Filter evaluates to
  FALSE, then assertionFailed (IANA-ASSIGNED-CODE) resultCode is
  returned and no further processing is performed.

  For Add, Compare, and ModifyDN the target is indicated by the entry
  field in the request.  For Modify, the target is indicated by the
  object field.  For Delete, the target is indicated by the DelRequest
  type.  For the Compare operation and all update operations, the
  evaluation of the assertion MUST be performed as an integral part of
  the operation.  That is, the evaluation of the assertion and the
  normal processing SHALL be done as one atomic action.

  For search operation, the target is indicated by the baseObject field
  and the evaluation is done after "finding" but before "searching"
  [RFC2251].  Hence, if the evaluation fails, no entries or
  continuations references are returned.

  Other documents may specify how this control applies to other LDAP
  operations.  In doing so, they must how the target entry is
  determined.


3.  Security Considerations

  The filter may, like other values of the request, contain sensitive
  information.  When so, this information should be appropriately
  protected.

  As with any general assertion mechanism, the mechanism can be used to
  determine directory content.  Hence, the mechanism SHOULD be subject
  to appropriate access controls.

  Some assertions may be very complex, requiring significant time and
  resources to evaluate.  Hence, the mechanism SHOULD be subject to
  appropriate administrative controls.

  All security considerations for the base operations [RFC2251] to which
  this control is attached to apply, as do general LDAP security
  considerations [RFC3377].
