            specified as a NAT traversal mechanism for protocols based
            on the offer/answer exchange model. In practice, only the
            Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has used
            ICE. This document provides guidance on how other
            protocols can make use of ICE.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> has been specified by the
IETF as a mechanism for NAT traversal for protocols based on the
offer/answer model <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, which exchanges Session
Description Protocol (SDP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4566'>[RFC4566]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M., Jacobson, V., and C. Perkins, &ldquo;SDP: Session Description Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> objects to
negotiate media sessions. 

</p>
<p>
ICE has many benefits. It is automated, relying on very little
configuration. It works through an extremely broad range of network
and NAT topologies. It is robust, establishing connections in many
challenging environments. It is efficient, utilizing relays and
intermediaries only when other options will not work. At the time of
writing, ICE has seen widespread usage on the Internet for traversal
of Voice over IP, primarily based on the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>

</p>
<p>
However, SIP is not the only protocol that requires the establishment
of host-to-host relationships for communications. Consequently, ICE
has recently been considered as the NAT traversal technique for other
protocols. These include Peer-to-Peer SIP (P2PSIP)
<a class='info' href='#I-D.bryan-p2psip-reload'>[I&#8209;D.bryan&#8209;p2psip&#8209;reload]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Lowekamp, B., Rescorla, E., Baset, S., and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
<a class='info' href='#I-D.manyfolks-hip-sturn'>[I&#8209;D.manyfolks&#8209;hip&#8209;sturn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nikander, P., Melen, J., Komu, M., and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Mapping STUN and TURN messages on HIP,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and Mobile IP v6
<a class='info' href='#I-D.tschofenig-mip6-ice'>[I&#8209;D.tschofenig&#8209;mip6&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tschofenig, H., &ldquo;Mobile IP Interactive Connectivity Establishment (M-ICE),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. In each case, the
protocol in question provides a mechanism for two hosts to rendezvous
through some intermediary, and then needs a host-to-host connection
established. This fits the NAT traversal capability provided by ICE.

</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the ICE specification itself is intertwined with SDP
and the offer/answer model, and is not immediately usable by protocols
that do not utilize offer/answer. For this reason, each of these
protocols need to define how to utilize ICE for their specific
needs. This document provides guidelines for authors of such
specifications. It includes guidance on when ICE can be used by a
protocol, describes each of ICE's major functions and how they can be
applied. 

</p>
<p>
This document assumes the reader is familiar with ICE and its
operation.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Can My Protocol Use ICE?</h3>

<p>
Not all protocols can make use of ICE. ICE works only with protocols
that fit the pattern of a session protocol. A session protocol is one
in which there exists some kind of rendezvous service, typically
through a server on the Internet, by which hosts can contact each
other. Through the rendezvous service, hosts can exchange information
for the purposes of negotiating a direct host to host connection. Each
host is assumed to have an identifier by which it is known to the
rendezvous service, and by which other hosts can identify it. There is
typically some kind of registration operation, by which a host
connects to the rendezvous service and identifies itself. This
protocol design pattern is shown in <a class='info' href='#fig-session'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Session Protocols</span><span>)</span></a>.

<p>
If hosts can reach each other through the rendezvous service, why
create direct connections? Typically, the rendezvous service provides
an indirect connection, and may be very suboptimal in terms of latency
and other path metrics. The rendezvous service may also have limited
bandwidth, and not be capable of supporting the volume of data
required to flow between the hosts.

</p>
<p>
As an example, in SIP, the rendezvous service is the SIP server. The
identifier is the SIP URI. The registration process is supported using
the SIP REGISTER method. Connections are established using the INVITE
method. 

</p>
<p>
For a protocol to use ICE, it must exhibit the properties of
a session protocol as described above. Furthermore, it must provide a
mechanism for exchanging information between the hosts for purposes
of establishing the connection. It must provide for, at least, one
message from the initiator to the other host, and one message back. If
all of these criteria are met, ICE can be used.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Target Architecture</h3>

<p>
The goal of the recommendations in this document is to enable an
architecture for firewall and NAT traversal across many protocols that
has two properties:

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>STUN and TURN servers can be used to support multiple applications
</li>
<li>Gateways can easily be built between ICE-using protocols that are
compatible 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The second of these requires further discussion. In some cases, two
different protocols are ones that provide similar functions, so that
it is reasonable to build gateways between them. For example, gateways
between SIP and H.323, or between SIP and RTSP, are reasonable things
to do. A gateway function between two session protocols needs to
concern itself with converting the signaling and converting the media
protocol - whether it be RTP or something else. It is highly desirable
to avoid actual conversion operations along the direct media
path. These greatly increase the cost and complexity of gateway
functions. Consequently, the ideal architecture looks like this:

<p>
In this architecture, clients of two different protocols (A and B)
make use of signaling servers for their respective protocols. There is
a gateway function between them, but this function ONLY concerns
itself with the signaling. The content of the established sessions -
which includes the media and the path-based connectivity checks that
ICE uses - do not require any protocol conversion. 

</p>
<p>
Of course, implementations can choose to gateway the media and checks
if they want, but it is a strong objective of the recommendations here
that they don't HAVE TO. 

</p>
<p>
The architecture also shows that the goal is to have a common set of
TURN and STUN functions that serve all applications using ICE.

Lite Implementation</h3>

<p>
The lite mode of operation for ICE allows for usage by agents which
are always reachable by any other agent, both now and in the
future. The using protocol needs to decide whether this mode of
operation is supported or not. If not, all agents will be full
implementations. If the mode is supported, agents can either be lite
or full. 

</p>
<p>
The principal consideration is the likelihood of agents being always
publicly reachable, vs. the cost of an ICE implementation. ICE itself
provides strong caution against the lite mode of implementation. It is
very easy for protocol designers to envision specific scenarios for
deployment of their protocol, and then for the reality to be
different. Furthermore, the full mode provides important security
benefits. It ensures that an ICE implementation cannot be used to
launch DoS attacks. Consequently, that same guidance is given here: using
protocols should only use ICE's lite mode if there is a belief that
implementors absolutely will not implement the full mode, and that
those implementations will always be publicly reachable by every other
agent for the lifetime of deployment of that implementation, and that
the security benefits of full mode are not worth the implementation
complexity.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Multiple Components</h3>

<p>
ICE introduces the concept of multiple components for a single media
stream. ICE attempts to provide atomic processing across components,
such that a set of candidates (one for each component) are only used
if all of them succeeded. This grouping is useful when it is desirable
for path characteristics to be identical across multiple IP addresses
and ports that make up a connection of some sort.

</p>
<p>
Using protocols should indicate whether this functionality is needed
or not. If not, the procedures defined for ICE are used as is, but the
implementation for the using protocol just assumes there is always a
single component per stream.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Multiple Media Streams</h3>

<p>
ICE allows for multiple media streams. ICE largely runs independently
for each stream, with a few important exceptions. First, ICE will
perform pacing across all of the streams, thus providing aggregate
congestion control. Secondly, ICE will utilize results from one stream
to speed up the results of candidate gathering for another stream. 

</p>
<p>
Using protocols should decide whether the concept of multiple streams
applies or not. If it does, the using protocol can elect to run ICE on
each stream completely independently (in which case its effectively a
separate offer/answer exchange and ICE state machine for each stream),
or together. The primary consideration, as noted above, is whether
aggregate congestion control and rapid convergence are
desired. This document recommends that, if a using protocol has
multiple streams, it runs ICE jointly across them, as defined by the
ICE specification (in other words, there is one instance of the ICE
state machine, not one for each media stream).

Gathering of Candidates</h3>

<p>
This phase of operation involves the gathering of candidates by the
agent. Any using protocol will need to perform this step. The
specification for the using protocol should point to Section 4.1 of
ICE, and dictate that the procedures there be followed. However,
there are several aspects of the gathering operation which are subject
to considerations by the using protocol, and the using protocol should
provide additional guidance on whether any of these behaviors change
or not.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
Candidate types</h3>

<p>
ICE allows an agent, as a matter of policy, to gather candidates of a
particular type - host, server reflexive, and relayed. Consequently, a
using protocol needs to define whether its agents will support all
three, or just a subset. ICE recommends strongly that all three types
be gathered and supported. This is because reliability of connection
establishment cannot be provided unless all three mechanisms are
implemented. Using protocols should only utilize a subset if their
deployment topologies are limited to cases where one of the agents
will always be behind NATs with endpoint independent mapping
properties.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2.&nbsp;
Pacing</h3>

<p>
ICE defines a pacing algorithm for rate limiting the traffic it
generates during the gathering phase. When used in conjunction with
the parameter computations in Section 16.2, those algorithms are
applicable to any protocol. However, they may be overly conservative
for certain applications. Consequently, using protocols can define
alternative mechanisms for pacing ICE. 

</p>
<p>
However, using protocols should be aware that there are two issues
that drove the design of the pacing. One of them is network congestion
control. The using protocol has to ensure that its pacing remains TCP
friendly whenever possible. The second issue is NAT overload. Testing
of NAT devices at the time of writing showed that some of them went
into an 'overload' mode when too many mappings were created within a
short interval of time. Keeping the creation of new mappings to a rate
less than one every 50ms seemed to address this problem. Using
protocols should follow a similar design goal.

Number and Discovery of Servers</h3>

<p>
ICE only defines operations for a single STUN server

Wing, &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for (NAT) (STUN),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, or for a single TURN
server <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-turn'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;turn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Mahy, R., and P. Matthews, &ldquo;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. It does not consider
cases where there are multiple STUN and/or multiple TURN servers used
by the agent. However, this is an omission for the sake of
simplicity. If a using protocol has a need to highly optimize the
connection paths in multi-layer natting environments, multiple STUN
servers - ideally one behind each NAT - can provide an optimal path. A
using protocol can elect to specify that multiple STUN servers be used
in these cases.

</p>
<p>
Of course, the using protocol will need to specify how a client
discovers or is configured with those additional STUN servers. The
usage of multiple STUN servers affects pacing; the overall rate of
candidate gathering across all servers needs to be congestion
controlled and stay below the rate of a new allocation every 50ms.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.4"></a><h3>5.1.4.&nbsp;
Other Protocols</h3>

<p>
It is possible that the using protocol can define or utilize other
mechanisms for gathering candidates. For example, a mechanism may be
built into the rendezvous protocol itself. Indeed, this is the primary
reason for using something besides STUN and TURN. If a using protocol
is not building such functionality into the rendezvous server itself,
it is highly recommended that it reuse the STUN and TURN protocols.

</p>
<p>
The primary reason for this is that it allows a domain to deploy STUN
and TURN servers just once, and then reuse them for multiple protocols
that require NAT traversal functionality. This reuse is highly
desirable, and would likely outweigh any minor protocol improvements
that could come from 'rolling your own' mechanism for gathering
candidates. This is why an exception is called out for building the
gathering protocol into the rendezvous server itself; that server
needs to be deployed anyway.

</p>
<p>
However, there are pitfalls to building a candidate gathering
mechanism into the rendezvous protocol and server. In particular,
obtaining relayed candidates from a rendezvous protocol can be
problematic. TURN servers are ideally deployed throughout the network,
in points that are topologically close to clients. Since the whole
purpose of ICE is to allow two clients to connect directly to each
other without sending data through the rendezvous server, building
TURN-like functionality into the rendezvous server defeats much of the
purpose of ICE itself. Such a move only makes sense if it is believed
that, for the using protocol, the likelihood of usage of relayed
candidates is particularly low.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.5"></a><h3>5.1.5.&nbsp;
Prioritization</h3>

<p>
ICE allows the prioritization of candidates to be a matter of local
policy. Using protocols may define their own policy for how candidates
are prioritized. However, protocols absolutely must utilize the same
range of priority values (0 to 2^32 - 1), and must use the concepts of
foundations and bases, along with the procedures for eliminating
redundant candidates. Utilizing those ensures that ICE can be
interoperated easily between different using protocols with only a
gateway function on the signaling, not the media.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.6"></a><h3>5.1.6.&nbsp;
Default Candidates</h3>

<p>
The concept of default candidates is primarily to support backwards
compatibility, and may not be required for a using protocol. Firstly,
if a using protocol is being defined for the first time, and ICE is
being used as a mandatory-to-implement part of the protocol, then
clearly there are no backwards compatibility issues, and the default
candidate mechanism is not needed.

</p>
<p>
Even in cases where there are older, non-ICE implementations, there
are several basic mechanisms that can be used to deal with it:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Capability Query:</dt>
<dd> An ICE-compliant agent can query the
  target agent, prior to an ICE exchange, to determine if they support
  ICE. If they do, the agent proceeds with the ICE exchange,
  otherwise, they do not. If a using protocol utilizes this basic
  technique, the default candidate mechanism is not needed. 
</dd>
<dt>Fail-and-Retry:</dt>
<dd> An ICE-compliant agent sends an initial
  message with ICE parameters, along with some kind of flag which
  tells the recipient to reject the message if it doesn't support
  ICE. If such a rejection is received, the agent retries without
  ICE. If a using protocol utilizes this technique, the default
  candidate mechanism is not needed. 
</dd>
<dt>Fallback:</dt>
<dd> An ICE-compliant agent sends an initial
  message with ICE parameters, but they are encoded in such a way that
  they will be ignored by a non-ICE implementation. If a non-ICE
  implementation receives them, it sends back an answer without ICE,
  and the offerer notices this and proceeds without ICE. This
  technique requires the default candidate mechanism defined by ICE.

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
Of these three approaches, the first two require potentially two round
trips to setup a session, whereas the third can do it in a single
round trip regardless of the capabilities of the other agent. 
When latency for establishment is an important concern, the fallback
approach is preferable.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Initial Exchange of Candidates</h3>

<p>
ICE specifies the usage of the offer/answer protocol and the Session
Description Protocol for exchanging ICE parameters. This mechanism is
clearly ICE specific, and the using protocol should define something
appropriate. However, in all cases, the protocol exchange has to allow
for a two-phase exchange where one side offers ICE information to the
other, and the other offers ICE information back in response. Though
it is possible for protocols to utilize mechanism other than a
two-phase exchange, this is not recommended, since it significantly
complicates the construction of gateways between protocols that
utilize ICE.

ICE Mismatch</h3>

<p>
The ICE mismatch feature is very specific to SIP. It is a consequence
of the existence of intermediaries which routinely modify the media
destination in the SDP, but are not ICE aware and will just ignore
(and pass on) any ICE attributes that are present. The ICE mismatch
mechanism detects these cases and falls back to non-ICE operation.

</p>
<p>
A using protocol should only utilize this mechanism if it happens to
have similar deployment constraints.

Parameter Encoding</h3>

<p>
The syntax for the messages is entirely a matter of convenience for
the using protocol. However, the following parameters and their data
types needs to be conveyed in the initial exchange:

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Candidate attribute</dt>
<dd> There will be one or more of these
  for each "media stream". Each candidate is composed of:

<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Foundation:</dt>
<dd> A sequence of up to 32 characters.
</dd>
<dt>Component-ID:</dt>
<dd> This would be present only if the using
   protocol were utilizing the concept of components. If it is, it
   would be a positive integer that indicates the component ID for
   which this is a candidate. 
</dd>
<dt>Transport:</dt>
<dd> An indicator of the transport protocol
   for this candidate. This need not be present if the using protocol
   will only ever run over a single transport protocol. If it runs
   over more than one, or if others are anticipated to be used in the
   future, this should be present. 
</dd>
<dt>Priority:</dt>
<dd> An encoding of the 32 bit priority
   value. 
</dd>
<dt>Candidate Type:</dt>
<dd> The candidate type, as defined in
   ICE. 
</dd>
<dt>Related Address and Port:</dt>
<dd> The related IP address and
   port for this candidate, as defined by ICE. 
</dd>
<dt>Extensibility Parameters:</dt>
<dd> The using protocol should
   define some means for adding new per-candidate ICE parameters in
   the future. 
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Lite Flag:</dt>
<dd> If ICE lite is used by the using protocol,
  it needs to convey a boolean parameter which indicates whether the
  implementation is lite or not. 
</dd>
<dt>Ufrag and Password:</dt>
<dd> The using protocol has to convey a
  username fragment and password. It must allow up to 256 characters
  for the ufrag and 256 for the password. 
</dd>
<dt>ICE extensions:</dt>
<dd> In addition to the per-candidate
  extensions above, the using protocol should allow for new
  media-stream or session-level attributes. 

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
If the using protocol is using the ICE mismatch feature, a way is
needed to convey this parameter in answers. If is a boolean flag.

</p>
<p>
The exchange of parameters is symmetric; both agents need to send the
same set of attributes as defined above.

</p>
<p>
The using protocol may (or may not) need to deal with backwards
compatibility with older implementations that do not support
ICE. If the fallback mechanism is being used, then presumably the
using protocol already provides a way of conveying the default
candidate (its IP address and port) in addition to the ICE
parameters.

Role Determination</h3>

<p>
The role determination mechanism must be used by the using
protocol. However, the conflict resolution algorithm in Section 5.2 of
ICE is almost entirely an artifact of the fact that SIP separates its
signaling exchange from the offer/answer exchange. In using protocols that
lack this separation, the conflict resolution algorithm itself will
never get used.

Connectivity Checks</h3>

<p>
The core of the ICE algorithm is the connectivity checks. After both
sides have gathered candidates and have exchanged them with each
other, the check process begins. Here, it is very important that the
using protocol simply follow the mechanisms already defined by
ICE. Implementations should directly utilize the functionality defined
in Section 5.7 to compute pairs and priorities, prune, form the check
lists, and compute states. If a using protocol has elected not to use
the concepts of multiple components or multiple streams, these
algorithms simplify. However, the using protocol must not specify a
different algorithm; it can only reuse what is there and constrain its
behavior by mandating constrained inputs (only one component, or only
one media stream).

</p>
<p>
The actual connectivity checks themselves must also be performed
exactly as defined in Section 7 of ICE. The using protocol should just
reference that section directly. Note that, even if a using protocol
does not need to use the role conflict detection mechanism, it must
include the ICE-CONTOLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes in its
connectivity checks as described in Section 7 of ICE. This ensures
that it is possible to easily build gateways between different
protocols using ICE.

different mechanisms for computing Ta and RTO, and may even define a
different mechanism entirely for interleaving scheduled and triggered
checks.

checks needs to take congestion control and NAT overload into

Conclusion of ICE</h3>

<p>
The procedures for concluding ICE as defined in Section 8 should be
used as defined for the using protocol, with only a few areas of
flexibility.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4.1"></a><h3>5.4.1.&nbsp;
Regular vs. Aggressive Nomination</h3>

<p>
The primary area of
flexibility is around regular vs. aggressive nomination. A using
protocol can mandate that all implementations use one or the other or
allow for both. The considerations for this choice are identical for
the using protocol as they are for ICE in general. Aggressive
nomination is faster but can introduce glitches; regular nomination is
slower but is more stable. Regular nomination is recommended if at all
possible.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4.2"></a><h3>5.4.2.&nbsp;
Updated Signaling and Remote Candidates</h3>

<p>
ICE defines conditions on which an updated offer is required to be
sent after ICE concludes - namely, if the candidates selected by ICE
are not a match for the default candidates, an updated exchange is
sent. 

</p>
<p>
This function of ICE is primarily an artifact of the realities of SIP
deployments. It is not at all needed for correctness of ICE
operation. In the case of SIP, signaling intermediaries that are
inspecting the offer/answer exchanges, but are not ICE aware, will be
confused unless there is an updated exchange. This same consideration
applies to using protocols. If the using protocol has deployments with
intermediaries that inspect messages, and will be confused if the
actual connections/media are established to something different than
any defaults that were signaled, the updated exchange should be
used. If not, it can be avoided.

</p>
<p>
If it is used, the remote-candidates attribute has to be conveyed in
the updated offer, and the agents need to implement the algorithms
described in Section 9 of ICE for setting the answer based on this
attribute. Furthermore, the signaling protocols require a way to
encode it.

</p>

<a name="rfc.section.5.5"></a><h3>5.5.&nbsp;
Subsequent Signaling</h3>

<p>
ICE defines procedures for performing subequent offer/answer exchanges
that have an affect of updating the state of ICE. Support for
subsequent exchanges is needed if the using protocol requires any of
the following capabilities:

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The ability to add a new candidate to a set while ICE is already in
  progress, without abandoning the progress so far. 
</li>
<li>The ability to add a new media stream, or remove a new media
  stream, without redoing ICE processing for all of the media
  streams. 
</li>
<li>The ability to change the IP address or port for a media stream,
  but to do so with a "make before break" property - so that the new
  destination begins to be used only once checks for the new
  destination have completed. 

</li>
</ul>

<p>
If any of these properties are important, ICE's capabilites for
subsequent signaling should be utilized. 

</p>
<p>
One use case where these functions are not needed is when the using
protocol fundamentally doesn't allow any kind of updating of
connection addresses. If it requires the previous connection to be
closed, and a new one to be opened starting from scratch, ICE's
subsequent signaling feature is not needed.

</p>
<p>
If subsequent signaling is used, ICE restarts must be supported.

Media and Keepalives</h3>

<p>
The keepalive procedures in Section 10 must be used as defined. The
media handling rules in Section 11 apply as well, with the exception
of the RTP-specific guidelines.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
Several ICE features exist to provide security, including the message
integrity mechanism. Using protocols must use these in the same way
ICE does.

</p>
<p>
The guidelines defined here do allow a using protocol to support the
ICE lite mode of operation. The lite mode is less secure than full
mode, as it allows an implementation to be used as a source of DoS
traffic. For this reason, using protocols must address, in their
security considerations, why they have elected to allow the lite
implementation in cases where it is being supported.
