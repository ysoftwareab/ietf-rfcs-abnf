1.  Introduction

This document outlines the Radio Frequency (RF) Interface
Management Information Bases (MIBs) for high-speed data-over-cable
systems developed by the MCNS Data Over Cable Services working group.

Two Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIBs are defined.  The 
first is the MCNS Interface MIB and defines objects that enable 
management of the CATV MAC and PHY layer interfaces.  The second is the 
MCNS Cable Modem (CM) MIB and defines objects that enable management of 
CMs and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).

This specification is intended to enable prospective vendors of cable modems and other data-over-cable systems to address the operations support requirements in a uniform and consistent manner.


2. CM and CMTS Management Requirements

This section describes the CM and CMTS management requirements. The MIBs 
compliant with these requirements are described in Section 3 and 
formally defined in Section 5.

2.1 Accounting Management

Although many different types of billing scenarios exist for operators, 
the only scenarios which require use of CM and CMTS managed objects are 
those based on metered usage or reserved bandwidth.
Common practice by several Internet Service Providers (ISPs) allows 
usage-based billing based on peak rates. A DOCS provider can implement 
usage-based billing two ways:  By polling the CMs or by polling the 
CMTS. 

In the first method, a service provider can poll the ifInOctets and 
ifOutOctets counters from the MIB-II [RFC-1213] Interfaces group on each 
CM.  This has the advantage of enabling both upstream and downstream 
traffic metering with the potential disadvantage of affecting network 
performance.

The second metered billing method involves monitoring the 
mcnsifCmtsServiceTotalDataSlots counter from the mcnsifCmtsServiceTable 
on each CMTS.  This has the advantage of avoiding congestion on the RF 
network; however, it enables upstream traffic metering only.
In a typical ISP environment, a BSS polls the appropriate counters on 
each customer device once every 15 minutes throughout a monthly billing 
cycle. This data is converted into an average utilization rate for the 
sample period. Doing so permits the ISP to bill based on peak bandwidth 
by choosing the sample ranked at the 90-95th percentile. Note that the 
billing system may also include time-of-day rate variations.
The billing of reserved upstream MAC bandwidth is aided by information 
available from the mcnsifQosProfileTable for each CM. These MIB

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


variables report the upstream QOS characteristics, not just the nominal 
bandwidth, associated with each service ID and enable the service 
provider to bill for Grade of Service by verifying QOS. 


2.2 Configuration Management

2.2.1 Version Control

The CM MUST (and the CMTS SHOULD) support software revision and 
operational parameter configuration interrogation. In particular, the 
fields of the sysObjectID Object Identifier (OID) of the CM MUST 
successively encode the vendor ID, the hardware platform, the hardware 
revision, the software/PROM major revision number, the software/PROM 
minor revision number, and (optionally) the software patch level. Each 
parameter MUST occupy exactly one field. The fields of the sysObjectID 
OID of the CMTS SHOULD use the same encoding.

2.2.2 Software upgrades

The CM software upgrade process is documented in [MCNS7].
The mechanism to upgrade software from an SNMP manager MUST be supported 
by CMs, and SHOULD be supported by CMTSs. From a network management 
station, the operator:

-sets mcnscmSwServer to the address of the TFTP server for software 
upgrades
-sets mcnscmSwFilename to the file pathname of the software upgrade 
image
-sets mcnscmSwAdminStatus to upgrade-from-mgt

One reason for the SNMP-initiated upgrade is to allow loading of a 
temporary software image (e.g., special diagnostic software) that 
differs from the software normally used on that modem without changing 
the provisioning database.

Note that software upgrades should not be accepted blindly by the cable 
modem. The cable modem may refuse an upgrade if:

-The download is incomplete.
-The file contents are incomplete or damaged.
-The software is not intended for that hardware device (may include the 
case of a feature set that has not been purchased for this device).

2.2.3 System Initialization and Configuration

Most system configuration of CMs is performed through a combination of 
CATV MAC, DHCP, and TFTP exchanges. These exchanges are defined in 
detail in the Radio Frequency Interfaces Specification [MCNS7]. In 
particular, to enable event logging through SYSLOG, the DHCP server sets 
the log server option [RFC-1533] to the address of the SYSLOG server.

2.3 Fault Management

2.3.1 SNMP Usage

In the DOCS environment, the goals of fault management are the remote 
detection, diagnosis, and correction of network problems. Therefore, the 
CM MUST support SNMP management traffic across both the Ethernet and 
CATV MAC interfaces. Access to these interfaces may be restricted to 
support policy goals (see the mcnscmNmAccessTable); i.e., the service 
provider can choose to disable this at anytime. 

CM installation personnel can use SNMP queries from a station on the 
Ethernet to perform on-site CM and CATV MAC diagnostics and fault 
classification (note that this may require temporary provisioning of the 
CM from an Ethernet DHCP server). Further, future customer applications 
using SNMP queries can diagnose simple post-installation problems, 
avoiding visits from service personnel and minimizing help desk 
telephone queries. 

Standard MIB-II support MUST be implemented to instrument interface 
status, packet corruption, protocol errors, network performance, etc. 
The transmission MIB for Ethernet-like objects [RFC-1643] MUST be 
implemented on each CM and CMTS Ethernet and Fast Ethernet port. The 
ifXTable [RFC-1573] SHOULD be implemented to provide discrimination 
between broadcast and multicast traffic.

The CM and CMTS MUST support managed objects for fault management of the 
PHY and MAC layers. The MIB includes variables to track PHY state such 
as codeword collisions and corruption, signal-to-noise ratios, transmit 
and receive power levels, propagation delays, micro-reflections, in 
channel response, and Sync loss. The MIB also includes variables to 
track MAC state such as collisions and excessive retries for requests, 
immediate data transmits, and initial ranging requests.

For fault management at all layers, the CM/CMTS MUST generate replies to 
SNMP queries (subject to policy filters) for counters and status, MUST 
send SNMP traps to one or more trap NMSs (subject to policy), and MUST 
send event logging to a SYSLOG server (if a log server is defined).
The ifTestTable [RFC-1573] SHOULD be implemented for any diagnostic test 
procedures that can be remotely initiated.

2.3.2 Event Logging

Event logging and history provide vendors an opportunity for product 
differentiation. The ability to report useful logs may depend on semi-
graceful failure modes and on the ability to record such in nonvolatile 
storage.






Anderson, Sawyer, Woundy                                        [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


Events SHOULD be reported via log entries in a MIB, the SYSLOG facility 
(as documented in Section 6), and SNMP traps. Reporting of events 
SHOULD be fully configurable by priority class. At a minimum, it MUST be 
possible to disable SNMP Trap and SYSLOG transmission.

A local event log that is available via SNMP queries SHOULD be 
implemented to track events that cannot be reported at the time that 
they occur. This log SHOULD support a minimum of ten event log entries, 
and SHOULD persist across device re-boots.

The definition and coding of events is vendor-specific. In deference to 
the network operator who must troubleshoot multi-vendor networks, the 
circumstances and meaning of each event are reported as human-readable 
text. Vendors SHOULD provide time-of-day clocks in CMs to provide useful 
timestamping of events. Similarly, event logs SHOULD be persistent 
across device re-boots. The depth of the event log is vendor dependent, 
with oldest entries discarded as needed.

For each vendor-specific event that is reportable via TRAP, the vendor 
must create an enterprise-specific trap definition. Trap definitions 
MUST include mcnscmEvText and should be defined as:

trapName 	TRAP-TYPE
            ENTERPRISE  myEnterprise
            VARIABLES   { mcnscmEvText, other useful objects }
            DESCRIPTION
               "trap description"
            ::= value of mcnscmEvId

The event framework described in this section MUST be implemented in CMs 
and SHOULD be implemented in CMTSs.

2.3.3 Trap and Syslog Throttling

The CM and CMTS MUST provide support for trap and syslog message 
throttling as described below.  The network operator can employ message 
rate throttling or trap limiting by manipulating the appropriate MIB 
variables.

2.3.3.1 Rate Throttling

Network operators may employ either of two rate control methods.
In the first method, the device ceases to send traps and SYSLOG messages 
when the rate exceeds the specified maximum message rate. It resumes 
sending traps only if reactivated by a network management station 
request. 

In the second method, the device resumes sending traps when the rate 
falls below the specified maximum message rate.




Anderson, Sawyer, Woundy                                        [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


The network operator configures the specified maximum message rate by 
setting the measurement interval (in seconds), and the maximum number of 
trap and SYSLOG messages (excluding duplicates) to be transmitted within 
the measurement interval. The operator can query the operational 
throttling state (to determine whether traps are enabled or blocked by 
throttling) of the device, as well as query and set the administrative 
throttling state (to manage the rate control method) of the device.

2.3.3.2 Trap Limiting

Network operators may wish to limit the number of traps sent by a device 
over a specified time period. The device ceases to send traps and SYSLOG 
messages when the number of traps exceeds the specified threshold.  It 
resumes sending traps only when the measurement interval has passed.

The network operator defines the maximum number of traps he is willing 
to handle and sets the measurement interval to a large number (in 
hundredths of a second).  For this case, the administrative throttling 
state is set to stop at threshold which is the maximum number of traps.

See "Techniques for Managing Asynchronously Generated Alerts" [RFC-1224] 
for further information.

2.3.4 Non-SNMP Fault Management protocols

The OSS can use a variety of tools and techniques to examine faults at 
multiple layers. For the IP layer, useful non-SNMP based tools include 
ping (ICMP Echo and Echo Reply), traceroute (UDP and various ICMP 
Destination Unreachable flavors). Pings to a CM from its Ethernet side 
MUST be supported to enable local connectivity testing from a customer's 
PC to the modem. The CM and CMTS MUST support IP end-station generation 
of ICMP error messages and processing of all ICMP messages.

2.4 Performance Management

At the CATV MAC layer, performance management focuses on the monitoring 
of the effectiveness of cable plant segmentation and rates of upstream 
traffic and collisions. Instrumentation is provided in the form of the 
standard interfaces statistics, as well as the mcnsifCmtsServiceTable 
and mcnsifCmServiceTable.

It is not anticipated that the CMTS upstream bandwidth allocation 
function will require active network management intervention and tuning. 
Nevertheless, management objects are provided in case tuning or direct 
control is necessary. The three key upstream contention intervals are 
the request interval, the immediate data interval, and the initial 
ranging maintenance interval. If the upstream collision rate of requests 
and immediate data is high relative to the upstream traffic bandwidth, 
then the network management system (NMS) might increase the size of the 
request and immediate data intervals, respectively. The NMS might 
increase the size of the initial ranging maintenance interval when the 


Anderson, Sawyer, Woundy                                        [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


upstream collision rate of initial ranging messages is relatively high, 
such as at the conclusion of a wide-spread regional power outage. The 
NMS might also decrease the size of these contention intervals under low 
collision rate conditions, since these intervals occupy bandwidth that 
may be otherwise used for upstream transmission bandwidth. As a last 
resort, the NMS might change the guaranteed upstream bandwidth for one 
or more service IDs, to relieve upstream traffic congestion for key 
subscribers. The CM MUST implement MIB counters that report the number 
of contention interval collisions (measured as the number of contention 
interval retries) per service ID, and the CMTS MUST implement read-write 
MIB objects that control the size of the contention intervals for each 
upstream channel. The CMTS SHOULD implement a read-write MIB object that 
controls the guaranteed upstream bandwidth for each service ID.

At the LLC layer, the performance management focus is on bridge traffic 
management. The CM and CMTS (if the CMTS implements transparent 
bridging) MUST implement the Bridge MIB [RFC-1493], including the 
dot1dBase and dot1dTp groups. The CM and CMTS MUST implement a managed 
object that controls whether the 802.1d spanning tree protocol (STP) is 
run and topology update messages are generated; STP is unnecessary in 
hierarchical, loop-free topologies. If the STP is enabled for the 
CM/CMTS, then the CM/CMTS MUST implement the dot1dStp group. These MIB 
groups' objects allow the NMS to detect when bridge forwarding tables 
are full, and enable the NMS to modify aging timers.

A final performance concern is the ability to diagnose unidirectional 
loss. Both the CM and CMTS MUST implement the MIB-II [RFC-1213] 
Interfaces group. When there exists more than one upstream or downstream 
channel, the CM/CMTS MUST implement an instance of IfEntry for each 
channel. The ifStack MIB [RFC-1573] MUST be used to define the 
relationships among the CATV MAC interfaces and their channels.

2.5 Protocol Filters

The CM MUST implement LLC and IP protocol filters. The LLC protocol 
filter entries can be used to limit CM forwarding to a restricted set of 
network-layer protocols (such as IP, IPX, NetBIOS, and Appletalk). The 
IP protocol filter entries can be used to restrict upstream or 
downstream traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, 
transport-layer protocols (such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP), and source and 
destination TCP/UDP port numbers. The CM SHOULD support a minimum of ten 
LLC protocol filter entries, and ten IP protocol filter entries.

2.6 Common Spectrum Management

The CMTS SHOULD implement the HFC RF Spectrum Management MIB [CSMIMIB]. 
The definition of this MIB is likely to evolve, and vendors should 
anticipate changes in this area.

3. Areas for Future Consideration

This section outlines some areas for future consideration within this 
specification.  

-As ATM standards develop, this specification will include appropriate 
standards references.
-Enterprise-specific traps will be defined in the future as dictated by 
field experience.
-Multicast service provisioning within the cable modem will be clearly 
defined.
-To support the billing of reserved downstream MAC bandwidth, the CMTS 
should implement the evolving RSVP/Integrated Services MIB(s). Because 
of the variety of output queuing mechanisms, comments are solicited for 
the management mechanisms to support this.
-Comments are solicited as to required and recommended diagnostic test 
procedures.

4. Management Information Base (MIB)

This section defines the minimum set of managed objects required to 
support the CM and CMTS management requirements identified in the 
previous section. Vendors may augment this MIB with objects from other 
standard or vendor-specific MIBs where appropriate.

4.1 MIB Organization

There are three parts of the MIB needed for CMs and CMTSs. The first is 
a set of objects drawn from standard SNMP MIBs that bear on this class 
of devices. It is not the intention of this specification to duplicate 
existing specifications. These are available as RFCs from the IETF and 
are widely available.

The second part is a set of objects for the CATV interfaces of the CM 
and CMTS. This MIB provides the objects needed to configure, operate, 
and monitor the physical CATV interfaces. This specification is derived 
from the MCNS MAC specification [MCNS7]. These objects are defined in 
Section 5.2 as the mcnsif MIB.

The third part is a set of objects for management of CM and CMTS 
devices. These provide system-level functionality that is specific to 
the business and operational environments of cable data systems. These 
objects are defined in Section 5.3 as the mcnscm MIB.

The latter two parts are presented here as separate MIBs. 
The mcnsif and mcnscm MIBs are formally defined in Section 5.

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


4.2 Managed Objects from Existing Standards

4.2.1 The MIB-II 'system' Group

The System Group from MIB-II [RFC-1213] MUST be implemented. See Section 
2.2.1 for sysObjectID requirements.

4.2.2 The MIB-II 'interface' Group

The MIB-II interface group provides essential information about both MAC 
interfaces and individual channels. The interface extensions (ifXTable) 
[RFC-1573] SHOULD be supported.

4.2.2.1 Interface Organization and Numbering

An instance of ifEntry exists for each CATV MAC interface, as well as 
each LAN interface.

If a MAC interface consists of more than one upstream and downstream 
channel, then a separate instance of ifEntry MUST also exist for each 
channel.

If table entries exist separately for upstream and downstream channels, 
then the ifStack group ([RFC-1573]) must be implemented to identify 
relationships among sub-interfaces. Note that the CATV MAC interface 
must exist, even if it is further broken out into sub-interfaces.

The example in Figure 4-1 illustrates a MAC interface with one 
downstream and two upstream channels:



                      ____________________________
                     |    CATV MAC: IfIndex=4     |
                     |____________________________|
                          |         |           |
                 _________|___   ___|_______   _|_________
                | Downstream: | | Upstream: | | Upstream: |
                |  IfIndex=5  | | IfIndex=6 | | IfIndex=7 |
                 -------------   -----------   -----------
   Implementation of ifStackTable for this example.

              | IfStackHigherLayer | ifStackLowerLayer |
              |         4          |         5         |
              |         4          |         6         |
              |         4          |         7         |

               Figure 4-1:  Interface Numbering Example





Anderson, Sawyer, Woundy                                        [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


At the CMTS, interface numbering is at the discretion of the vendor, and 
should correspond to the physical arrangement of connections. If table 
entries exist separately for upstream and downstream channels, then the 
ifStack group ([RFC-1573]) must be implemented to identify relationships 
among sub-interfaces. Note that the CATV MAC interface(s) must exist, 
even if further broken out into sub-interfaces.

At the CM, interfaces SHOULD be numbered as:

-Ethernet: 1
-CATV MAC: 2
-all others (individual channels if present, telephony return if 
present): n+2

Note that network management platforms MUST NOT rely on this numbering 
scheme, and should use ifType and the ifStack table to identify 
interfaces.

4.2.2.2 Specific Interface Attributes

The ifAdminStatus object provides administrative control over both MAC 
interfaces and individual channels.

For CATV MAC interfaces, ifSpeed is defined as the bit rate of the 
highest-speed channel which is attached to this interface.

The ifSpecific object must be set to { mcnsif } for CATV MAC interfaces. 
For upstream channels, it is set to { mcnsifUpstreamTable }. For 
downstream channels, it is set to { mcnsifDownstreamTable }. Note that 
this object is deprecated in reference [RFC-1573].

The ifType object needs enumerated values to be assigned from the 
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. Values are needed for:

-CATV CMTS MAC interface
-CATV CM MAC interface
-CATV upstream channel
-CATV downstream channel

For each Ethernet or Fast Ethernet interface present on a CM or CMTS, 
there must exist a corresponding ifEntry with ifType ethernet-csmacd(6) 
[RFC1213].

4.2.3 The MIB-II 'ip' Group

The IP group is implemented. It does not apply to IP packets forwarded 
by the device as a link-layer bridge. For the CM, it applies only to the 
device as an IP host. At the CMTS, it applies to the device as an IP 
host, and as a router if IP routing is implemented.

INTERNET-DRAFT          DOCS RF Interface MIB                April 1997


4.2.4 Other MIB-II Groups

All devices MUST implement all MIB-II groups which apply to the 
functionality of the device. At a minimum, this includes the ICMP, UDP, 
and SNMP groups, all of which apply only to the device's role as an IP 
host.

4.2.5 The Bridge MIB

In both the CM and the CMTS (if the CMTS implements transparent 
bridging), the Bridge MIB [RFC-1493] MUST be implemented to represent 
the bridging process.

In the CMTS that implements transparent bridging, the Bridge MIB SHOULD 
be used to represent information about the MAC Forwarder state.

4.2.6 The Ethernet-Like MIB

The Ethernet-like MIB ([RFC-1643]) must be implemented if Ethernet or 
Fast Ethernet interfaces are present.

4.2.7 The FDDI MIB

The FDDI MIB ([RFC-1512]) must be implemented if Fiber Distributed Data 
Interfaces are present.

5. Concise MIB Definition

This section contains formal definitions of the MCNS Interface MIB and 
the MCNS CM MIB. Both are presented in the SNMP Version 2 Concise MIB 
Definition format. An essentially empty MCNS MIB provides a root point 
for the two MIBs.

5.1 Root MIB for MCNS

This MIB exists solely to provide an anchor in the mib tree for the two 
MIBs which follow.

5.2 Definition of Managed Objects for Data-over-Cable Service Interfaces

The following groups are provided for management of the CATV MAC layer 
interfaces:

-mcnsifCmMacTable (and mcnsifCmtsMacTable) - each entry extends the 
definition of the CM (and CMTS) MAC interface beyond that included in 
ifEntry. The CMTS table provides controls for bandwidth allocation and 
other aspects of network control.

-mcnsifDownstreamChannelTable - each entry describes the characteristics 
of a single downstream channel.

-mcnsifUpstreamChannelTable - each entry describes the characteristics 
of a single upstream channel.

-mcnsifPreambleTable - provides reference preamble strings for use with 
mcnsifModulationTable.

-mcnsifModulationTable - each entry describes a modulation profile 
associated with one or more upstream channels.

-mcnsifCmServiceTable (and mcnsifCmtsServiceTable) - describes each 
service queue. Each CM will maintain one or more service queues. Each 
CMTS will assign and maintain all of the service queues within a MAC 
domain.

-mcnsifQosProfileTable - defines quality of service characteristics to 
be used by the mcnsifServiceTable.

-mcnsifCmtsTallyTable - provides MAC-layer protocol tallies for the 
CMTS.

-mcnsifCmTallyTable - provides MAC-layer protocol tallies for the CM.

6. Protocol Definition for SYSLOG

This section documents the usage of the SYSLOG protocol for the 
Operations Support System environment. The SYSLOG protocol is a UDP-
based protocol that permits remote logging of devices. Messages may be 
associated with different facilities and multiple priorities.

The basic format of the SYSLOG packet is simple to describe. The UDP 
source and destination port number is 514. The UDP payload consists of a 
facility/priority value enclosed in angle brackets, followed by a null-
terminated string. The UDP payload string normally includes an optional 
time-of-day stamp, an identification string, an optional PID (in square 
brackets), and the actual logging message.

For consistency in a multi-vendor CM environment, this section adds 
further constraints to the SYSLOG packet. The CM uses the "local0" 
facility in its SYSLOG messages, so that the SYSLOG server can manage CM 
SYSLOG messages separately from kernel, mail, news, and other generic 
facilities. This limits the facility/priority values to the range of 128 
to 135. The actual facility/priority value depends on the urgency of the 
message: emergency(128), alert(129), critical(130), error(131), 
warning(132), notice(133), information(134), and debug(135).

This section also constrains the UDP payload string. The time-of-day 
stamp SHOULD NOT be included, forcing the SYSLOG server to provide its 
own (consistent) timestamps for all CM SYSLOG messages. The 
identification string MUST be "Cablemodem", and the "optional PID" MUST 
be a constant vendor-specific identification label, to assist in SYSLOG 
server logging management.

An example of a valid SYSLOG UDP payload would be 
"<132>Cablemodem[VendorX]: Downloading new CM software". This example 
payload might be recorded on the SYSLOG server as "Jan 12 12:56:03 
24.1.1.1 Cablemodem[VendorX]: Downloading new CM software".
