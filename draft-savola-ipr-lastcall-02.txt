1. Introduction

   This memo describes an additional policy with last calls regarding
   Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosures or other knowledge of
   IPR.

   The existence and the pointer to the IPR disclosures or an indication
   of non-existence of knowledge of such disclosures must be mentioned
   in all IETF last calls and should be mentioned in working group last
   calls.

   Additionally, all documents under the IETF change control for which a
   last call prior to the approval was not required and IPR disclosures
   are known, must now be either last-called or rejected.

   The second describes the general last call procedure.  The third and
   fourth sections discuss specific issues in working group and IETF
   last calls, respectively.  The fourth section lists a few brief notes
   on the impact on the process.

   This memo updates RFC 2026 [IETF] and RFC 2418 [WG].

2. General Last Call Procedure

   When last-calling a document, it should (WG last call) or must (IETF
   last call) be mentioned whether IPR concerns are known.

   Such a short mention should include at least:

     o the existence of knowledge of IPR, via disclosure(s) or
       otherwise, and
     o the pointer to all the relevant disclosure(s) in the IETF IPR
       repository.

   On the other hand, if there are no known IPR issues, the fact should
   be clearly mentioned in the last call announcement.

   If there is knowledge of IPR but the disclosures have not been
   recorded in the IETF IPR repository yet, documents must not be last-
   called prior to the disclosures appearing in the repository.

   If, after a significant delay and attempts to get the the known IPR
   registered to the repository are unsuccesful, the last caller can
   choose either:

      1. to register a placeholder disclosure, giving a pointer to the
         disclosure,
      2. to indicate the fact that knowledge of IPR has not been
         registered in the last call, giving a pointer to the knowledge,
         contribution or participation where the the knowledge of IPR
         surfaced, or
      3. not to proceed until the knowledge of IPR has been properly
         registered.

   Such placeholder disclosures must be clearly distinguished from other
   disclosures.

2.1. Examples

   In case there are IPR disclosures, the portion of the text in the
   last call could be like:

        Relevant IPR has been disclosed.  See
        http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/SRI-NGTRANS.txt for details.

   Or if no disclosures or other knowledge are known, the text in the
   last call could be like:

Internet Draft      draft-savola-ipr-lastcall-02.txt            May 2003


        No IPR disclosures or other knowledge are known.

3. Working Group Last Calls

   Working group (WG) last calls are optional [WG], but in practice are
   issued for all Internet-Drafts prior to the submission to the IESG.

   If there is a working group last call, the chair(s) issuing the last
   call should also make a mention whether IPR concerns have been raised
   regarding the document, or whether no disclosures or other knowledge
   are known, as described in section 2.

   The reason why describing IPR issues in WG last calls is not
   mandatory is due to the assumption that most WG participants can be
   expected to be aware of the IPR of the technologies being worked on
   in the working group.  However, everyone may not be fully aware of
   all the IPR in a WG, and IPR disclosures may have been made only
   recently after a participant has last looked at the IPR repository.
   Thus, it is strongly encouraged to include an IPR notice in all
   working group last calls.

4. IETF Last Calls

   IETF Last Calls are mandatory for all standards track documents
   [IETF], whether for entering into, advancing within or removing from
   the standards track.

4.1. When to Have an IETF Last Call

   It has not been necessary to last-call Experimental and Informational
   RFC's which are products of a working group.  If such a document has
   known IPR, whether disclosed or not, an IETF last call must be
   executed in the similar fashion as with standards track documents
   [IETF].

   It has not been necessary to last-call non-WG Experimental or
   Informational RFC submissions going directly to the RFC Editor.  Some
   of these documents are not under the IETF change control, i.e., no
   rights to create derivative works are granted, or that only
   publication as an Internet-Draft is allowed; examples of such are
   proprietary protocols and republications of other Standards
   Organizations' documents.

   When a document under the IETF change control is passed to the IESG
   for review, and the document has known IPR, whether disclosed or not,
   an IETF last call must be executed in similar fashion as with
   standards track documents, or the IESG must propose that the RFC
   Editor not publish the document.

Internet Draft      draft-savola-ipr-lastcall-02.txt            May 2003


   If the RFC Editor publishes such a document anyway, the IESG must
   insert an appropriate IESG Note in the document, as described in
   [IETF], indicating the presence of IPR.

   Note that due to possibly different policies, the existence of IPR
   issues in e.g. IRTF RFC submissions may not be known at all if no IPR
   disclosures are made for such Internet-Drafts.

4.2. The Contents of the IETF Last Call

   Any IETF Last Call must include an indication whether IPR has been
   disclosed or otherwise known, and if so, the pointer to the
   disclosure in the IPR repository, as specified in section 2.

   It is recommended that some additional information is also provided
   in the last call, as the readers of the IETF last call cannot be
   expected to know the details why the particular solution was chosen
   despite the known IPR.

   If a document is being removed from the standards track and is being
   replaced with something else, possible IPR disclosures with the
   latter should also be described in the similar fashion in the last
   call.

   The responsibility for filling the IPR parts of an IETF last call is
   with the shepherding Area Director [PROCED], but it is expected that
   in practice it's done by the working group chairs (if applicable) or
   document authors/editors.

5. Process Considerations

   The memo adds only little weight to the process while making the IPR
   knowledge much more apparent in all the stages of the RFC approval
   process; this should make it easier for people which may be hampered
   by particular types of IPR or licensing to comment and debate the
   solutions prior to the approval.

   The document specifically tries to avoid restricting its scope to
   only IPR disclosures: the known IPR which has been filed in the IPR
   database.  At least at the time of writing, the window it may take to
   go from contribution or participation to formally disclosing IPR may
   be relatively long.  The key process factor is that decisions should
   only be made after the community has been able been able to react to
   any knowledge of the IPR, whether formally disclosed or not.  In most
   cases, this could mean waiting for the formal disclosure before
   executing a last call.

   It is possible that some forms of licensing could be excepted from
   the "IPR disclosures" category -- but as the terms vary from company
   to company and license to license and there has not been any
   harmonization, there cannot be exceptions at the moment.

   This policy has been designed with "good-faith" IETF participants in
   mind, but provides enough flexibility in any case, for example
   against denial-of-service attacks, third-party disclosures and
   "submarine" patents.

   The general principle of this policy is that as it is impossible to
   completely judge the quality of disclosures, any knowledge must be
   made known with as much detail as is reasonable, so that others will
   be able to judge whether it might affect them.

   In certain cases, it may be questionable whether an IPR issue is
   "known" or not.  All indications made by the a person associated with
   the organization owning the IPR should be considered known.  However,
   especially some third party notices may sometimes be very vague, for
   example like "I think I've heard of a patent application on this a
   year ago".  Whether such indications can be considered "known" is at
   the discretion of last-caller(s), typically WG chair(s) or an Area
   Director.  A good rule of the thumb, however, is that it's better to
   err on the side of caution.

   If knowledge of IPR surfaces during or after the last call period,
   but prior to the approval of the document, a new last call should be
   announced.

6. Acknowledgements

   The first proposal was presented in Apr 2003 on the IPR working group
   mailing list; Spencer Dawkins and Brian Carpenter provided support
   and comments.  The first published version was commented by Bob
   Wyman, Mike Heard, Steve Coya, and Brian Carpenter.  Additional
   substantial comments were received from Bert Wijnen, Harald
   Alvestrand, Jorge Contreras, and Scott Brim.

7. Security Considerations

   The memo makes the IETF RFC approval process of documents with IPR
   disclosures more transparent; this has no security considerations.

   A policy without any flexibility could be easily wielded to aid in a
   denial-of-service attack.  Such attacks are expected to be relatively
   rare that spending resources in specifing a detailed process in
   advance would seem to be a waste of energy.  Therefore, a degree of
   flexibility has been added to enable better protection if something
