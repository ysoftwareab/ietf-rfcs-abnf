               Abstract 
                   
                  This memo introduces a new object for carrying GRSVP-TE labels, 
                  namely Mp2Cp Label object.  This new object SHOULD be used in order 
                  to move under the Control Plane (CP) domain LSPs that were created by 
                  the Management Plane (MP). 
                   
                  The result of using Mp2Cp Label in GRSVP-TE is that, at the end of 
                  the signaling flow, an LSP that was created by Management Plane is 
                  moved under to Control Plane domain.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  The usage of a GMPLS control plane in already existent network, it is 
                  foreseen to be not a green field application in the sense that MP 
                  created circuits and GMPLS created ones will coexist together. 
                   
                  At present there is no way for a Carrier Operator that wants to 
                  associate GMPLS information to an already existent circuit to do 
                  that. 
                  A new object is proposed in this memo, namely Mp2Cp Label.  This 
                  object and the associated procedures permits to associate Control 
                  Planes information to a circuit that was created by the Management 
                  Plane. 
                   
                  The basic idea is in some way similar to Restart Procedure that uses 
                  the Recovery Label, Section 4.3 RFC 3473 [3], in the sense that the 
                  cross connection in the Data Plane are already present and only GMPLS 
                  information has to be associated to it. 
                   
                  The modification proposed in this document refers only to Path 
                  message, that is, the message flow is left unmodified (Path, Resv and 
                  Resv Confirm). 
                   
                  At the end of the signaling the LSP is totally in charge of the 
                  Control Plane. 
                
                   
               2. Signaling  
                   
                  Signaling uses the same messages as usual, Path, Resv and Resv 
                  Confirm, also the processing of the messages is the same but the fact 
                
                
               Caviglia                  Expires - May 2004                  [Page 2] 
                                    draft-caviglia-mp2cp-00.txt        November 2003 
                
                
                  that in the Data Plane the cross connection are already present, only 
                  GRSVP-TE information need to be associated to them.   
                   
                  In order to support mp2cp Label the ERO object in the Path message 
                  MUST to be filled with all the relevant information of the LSP, that 
                  is, up to the Label level.  That can be done by means of the Label 
                  ERO subobject [3].  In case of unnumbered links please refer to [4]. 
                   
                  The filling of the ERO up to the Label Level should be not a problem 
                  because the LSP already exist in the Network and the MP should have 
                  all the required information. 
                   
                  Given the above GRSVP-TE state can be associated to the existing 
                  cross connection during the Path processing.   
                   
                  Resv and Resv Confirm messages are processed as usual. 
                   
                   
               3. Path Message  
                   
                  This Section covers the procedure needed to manage a Path message 
                  containing a Mp2Cp Label object. 
                   
               3.1 Procedures 
                   
                  A node receiving a Path message containing a Mp2Cp Label checks if 
                  there is a Data Plane cross connection between the resources 
                  indicated by the message.  The information required in order to 
                  perform the check are carried by the Mp2Cp Label in the sender 
                  descriptor and, as usual, by the ERO Label sub-object inside the ERO 
                  object. 
                   
                  If yes then a GRSVP-TE state is associated with the cross connection.    
                  From now on that cross connection is part of an LSP managed by the 
                  Control Plane instead of part of a connection managed by the 
                  Management Plane. 
                   
                  If no the node performs an additional check. 
                   
                  If both the two resources (Termination Connection Point/Connection 
                  Point in case of SONET/SDH Networks) indicated by the Path message 
                  are free then: 
                   
                  - the cross connection in the Data Plane is performed and, 
                   
                  - the associated GRSVP-TE state is created.  
                   
                  If the two resources are used in a way that is different from the one 
                  indicated by the Path message then a PathErr with a particular Error

                  AdoptingFailed (Error Code and Error Value TBA) MUST be generated.  
                  AdoptingFailed indicates that the moving of an LSP from the MP to the 
                  CP has failed.  Management of PathErr with AdoptingFailed error is 
                  described in the following Section. 
                   
                  The following example illustrates the three possible cases. 
                  The cross connection to be moved under the control plane is made of 
                  Timeslot A and B.  The symbol <----> means that the two Timeslots are 
                  cross connected.   
                   
                   
                                       Data Plane                 Control Plane 
                  Case 1                A<---->B                  NoInformation 
                   
                  Case 2                A      B                  NoInformation 
                   
                  Case 3                A<---->C                  NoInformation 
                   
                   
                  - Case 1: no actions are taken in the Data Plane, GRSVP-TE state is 
                  associated to the cross connection; 
                   
                  - Case 2: the cross connection is created in the Data Plane and the 
                  GRSVP-TE state is associated to it; 
                   
                  - Case 3: a PathErr with AdoptingFailed MUST be sent Upstream. 
                   
                  For bi-directional LSPs, the upstream label is carried as usual by 
                  the UPSTREAM_LABEL. 
                  In this case the processing is the same as described above. 
                   
                   
               3.2 Mp2Cp Label 
                   
                  The format of a mp2cp_Label object is identical to a Generalized 
                  Label.  A mp2cp_Label object uses Class-Number TBA (of form 0bbbbbbb) 
                  and the C-Type of the label being suggested. 
                   
                   
               3.3 PathErr 
                   
                  When a node receives a PathErr with AdoptingFailed as error only the 
                  GRSVP-TE state associated to the cross connection have to be deleted 
                  but the cross connection MUST NOT be deleted. 
                   
                   
               3.4 RSVP Message Formats 
                   
                  This section presents the RSVP message related formats as modified by

                  this document.  Where they differ, formats for unidirectional LSPs 
                  are presented separately from bidirectional LSPs.  Unmodified formats 
                  are not listed.  Again, MESSAGE_ID and related objects are defined in 
                  [5].

               Intellectual Property Rights Notices 
                   
                  The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
                  intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
                  pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in   
                  this document or the extent to which any license under such rights   
                  might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it   
                  has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the   
                  IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and   
                  standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of   
                  claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of   
                  licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to   
                  obtain a general license or permission for the use of such   
                  proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can   
                  be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
                   
                  The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
                  copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
                  rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice   
                  this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive   
                  Director.
