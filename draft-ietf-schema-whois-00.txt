Status of this Memo

      This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
      documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its
      areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also
      distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

      Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
      months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
      documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-
      Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as ``work

Abstract

   This document defines a MIME directory profile [1] for holding a
   WHOIS [2] schema and is intended for communication with the Internet
   schema listing service.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

1. Overview

   The document defines how a MIME type may be used to transfer a single
   WHOIS schema definition.  Although [2] specifies the result as non-
   machine readable it should be realized that the returned object is
   simply text.  Schemas created from this specify the parsing of the
   text.  Therefore an example of how a to register a WHOIS schema is
   presented.

2. Example MIME Directory Type Registrations

   This document defines an example whoisSchema used in the "schema-
   whois-example-0" profile.

2.1 whoisSchema

   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org
   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type whoisSchema

   Type name: whoisSchema

   Type purpose: To represent an example WHOIS schema

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type valuetype: text, encoded according to the BNF of section 2.1.1

   Type special notes: Each value of this type specifies the contents of
   a WHOIS schema definition.  A definition of all attributes in the schema
   MUST be present in the content containing this value.

   Intended usage: COMMON

2.1.1 whoisSchema Syntax Definition

   Values of whoisSchema are represented according to the following BNF:

      whoisSchema = "(" whsp attribute-line *[whsp "$" whsp attribute-line] whsp ")"
      attribute-line = *[ "line:" whsp attr *[whsp "$" whsp attr]
      attr = 1*utf8

   All attributes have text values.  It should be noted that this
   definition is not intended to handle all formatting circumstances nor
   is intended for complete machine parsing.

3.0 Example

  From: whomever@wherever.com
  To: Someone@somewhere.com
  Subject: schema information
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Message-Id: <ids1@wherever.com>
  Content-Type: text/directory; profile="schema-whois-0";charset="utf-8"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: Quoted-Printable
  whoisSchema: ( line: Lastname $ Firstname  $ Handle $ Email $
    line: Address1 $ line: Address2 $ line: City $ State $ Zip $
    line: Phones $ line: null $ line: Record-Last-Updated $

4. Security Considerations

   A MIME body part containing a text/directory may be incorporated in a
   digitally signed MIME content, which can be used to verify that the
   body part has not been modified in transit.  When the signer has been
   certified by a trusted third party service, it may also be possible
   to verify the origin of the content.
