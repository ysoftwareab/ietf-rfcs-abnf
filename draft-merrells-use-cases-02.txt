Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases         May 2006


3.  Goals

   The goals of the protocol are:

   Identity Information Exchange:

      The primary goal of any DIX protocol is to automate the exchange
      of Identity Information over the Internet.


   Ease of Adoption:

      Any DIX protocol must provide the lowest possible barriers to
      adoption to ensure wide-spread usage of the protocol.


   Internet Scale:

      Any DIX protocol must provide an Internet scale solution to
      identity information exchange.


   Privacy:

      Any DIX protocol must ensure that all aspects of user privacy can
      be maintained.

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases         May 2006


6.  Browser Based Use Cases

   Some use cases are dependent upon others, so should be perused in
   order.  Beth is our protagonist throughout; a typical Internet user,
   but she's a bit of a geek.  Her friend Adam also appears.  A less
   sophisticated Internet user and a bit of a dubious character.  These
   use cases motivate a HTTP binding for a DIX protocol.

6.1.  B1

   Beth receives an email from a friend introducing her to a new
   website, geeknews.com, a techie news site.  She wishes to sign up so
   that she can read some articles.  She sees an IN button, which she
   clicks.  Her identity agent displays a screen informing her that
   geeknews.com is requesting some data, her first name.  She enters
   'Beth' at the prompt, provides consent and the data is sent to the
   site.

6.2.  B2

   Beth browses to geekdate.com, she clicks an IN button.  Her identity
   agent informs her that geekdate.com is requesting some data, her
   first name.  Her agent already has this data.  She provides consent
   and the data is sent to the site.

6.3.  B3

   Beth decides to create a profile at geekdate.com.  She sees an IN
   button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent displays a screen
   informing her that geekdate.com is requesting some data, an
   identifier.  She provides consent and the identifier and identifier
   verification data is sent to the site.  Geekdate.com uses the
   verification data to verify that Beth owns the identifier her agent
   provided.

6.4.  B4

   Beth decides to create a new profile at geekdate.com.  She sees an IN
   button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent displays a screen
   informing her that geekdate.com is requesting some data, an
   Identifier.  She instructs her identity agent to create an identifier
   specific to her relationship with geekdate.com.  She provides consent
   and the data is sent to the site.

6.5.  B5

   Beth decides to flesh out her profile at geekdate.com.  Geekdate.com
   displays a registration form.  One field requests a URL of a photo of

Internet-Draft    Digital Identity Exchange - Use Cases         May 2006


   her.  Beside it is a SAVE button.  She enters the URL and clicks the
   button.  Her identity agent displays a screen informing her that this
   data item can be stored.  She decides that she wants to be able to
   provide that data to other sites.  She provides consent and the data
   is stored by her agent.

6.6.  B6

   Geeknews.com offers Beth the option to build up a readership
   preferences profile over time, the benefit being that the site will
   tailor its content to her interests.  She decides to take up the
   offer, she sees an IN button, which she clicks.  Her identity agent
   informs her that geeknews.com is requesting some data, an Identifier.
   She selects an existing identifier, which she chooses to use for a
   subset of the sites she has a relationship with.  She provides
   consent and the data is sent to the site.

6.7.  B7

   Beth wants to have multiple identifiers, for different aspects of
   herself, her personas.  She wants to have a 'home' persona for
   identity data that she releases to her personal sites, such as
   geeknews.com.  She wants to have a separate 'work' persona for
   identity data that she releases to work-related sites, such as
   helpdesk.com.  She wants some of her identity data to be the same for
   her different personas, and other data to be different.

6.8.  B8

   [Assumptions: Beth has visited geeknews and geekdate before and has
   informed her identity agent that she consents to a relationship with
   them.]  Beth starts her day with a strong coffee and a perusal of
   geeknews.com.  She starts her computer and authenticates herself to
   the operating system.  By that authentication mechanism she has also
   authenticated herself to her identity agent, as her vendor of that
   system has hooked it into the operating system's authentication
   system.  She browses to geeknews.com and clicks the IN button and is
   directly shown the content, no further clicks.  She then browses to
   geekdate.com, she clicks the IN button and is directly presented with
   her profile no further clicks.

6.9.  B9

   Beth's identity agent prompts her to provide a 'spoken name'.  Using
   the multimedia capabilities of her computer she records her spoken
   name; an mp3 of her saying 'Beth'.  She later browses to
   voicebox.com, which runs a voicemail service, she opts to create an
   account and the site requests some properties, amongst which is a

   request for her spoken name.  She provides consent and the data is
   sent to the site.

6.10.  B10

   Beth purchases a book from an online store, as she's checking out the
   store makes her an offer: 10% off for completion of a demographic
   survey.  She's tempted, but how many data fields are there?  One
   hundred!  Too many to be worth the effort.  But it happens to be
   commonly requested data, which her identity agent has already
   gathered during previous exchanges with other sites.  So, she
   completes the remaining fields, provides consent and all the data is
   sent to the site.

6.11.  B11

   Beth has invested significant effort in building up a persona and
   reputation around a specific identifier, her 'home' identifier.  But,
   she has become dissatisfied with her identity agent and so decides to
   switch vendors.  She establishes a new agent and migrates her
   identity data from the old one to the new one.  She then changes the
   delegation of authority for her identifier from her old identity
   agent to her new identity agent for authentication and provision of
   identity data.

6.12.  B12

   Whilst in town Beth stops off at an Internet Cafe to check her email.
   She goes to her webmail account, which requires that she identity
   herself.  Her Identity Agent prompts her for consent and provides her
   identifier so that she can gain access to her email.

6.13.  B13

   Beth visits a website to purchase some books.  The site requests some
   identity information, her shipping address.  Her Identity Agent warns
   her that satisfying the request would contravene her established
   privacy policy.  The website wishes to pass her address to affiliated
   companies so that they may send her valuable promotional offers, but
   Beth has a privacy policy that not allow unsolicited mail to be sent
   to her shipping address.

6.14.  B14

   Beth moves house, so she changes the home address information stored
   by her Identity Agent.  Her Identity Agent offers to notify all
   relying parties to whom she has previously provided her home address.

6.15.  B15

   Beth leaves work and goes to the bus stop.  Whilst waiting for the
   next bus home she uses her smart phone to browse geeknews.com.  Her
   Identity Agent provides her with the same ease of browsing that she
   experiences on her work and home computers.

6.16.  B16

   Beth is ending her day at work.  She leaves work and waits for the
   next bus home.  Her friend calls and invites her to the movies.  She
   uses her phone to browse to the movies.com to find out what's
   playing.  The site requests her current location, which she consents
   to release via her Identity Agent.

6.17.  B17

   Beth signs up with a financial services site, BigPicture.com, which
   provides an aggregate view of her finances.  To provide its service
   BigPicture.com requires access to her existing bank accounts.  Beth
   wishes to securely provide agency rights to BigPicture.com, so she
   acquires the appropriate access tokens from her existing bank account
   providers and stores them with her Identity Agent.  She then presents
   the access tokens to BigPicture.com so that it can access her account
   data.

6.18.  B18

   Beth goes to an auction side, ibay.com.  Her Identity Agent shows a
   signed graphic of ibay.com for releasing data.  Beth knows that she's
   dealing with ibay.com, and not an impostor.

6.19.  B19

   Adam decides to create a profile at geekdate.com. geekdate.com
   requests an Identifier.  He instructs his identity agent to create an
   identifier specific to his relationship with geekdate.com.

6.20.  B20

   Adam heavily frequents two gambling sites, casino.com and
   betting.com.  He uses the same identifier across both sites as he
   wants them to know he is the same person.

6.21.  B22

   Beth has many computing devices in her life, running different
   operating systems and different application software.  She makes her

   own choices about her own computing environment, but she has little
   choice when the software is bundled by the device manufacturer or at
   work where she is subject to her employer's policies.  As a
   consequence she has multiple identity agents managing her 'work'
   persona; both on her office computer and her work mobile phone.

6.22.  B23

   Adam's computing environment is somewhat simpler, with both his
   'gambling' and 'church' personas managed by his identity agent on his
   home computer.

7.  Assertion Use Cases

   These use cases motivate the need for third-party attested attribute
   value assertions, referred to in the following as 'claims'.

7.1.  A1

   Beth is a frequent traveler on Galactic Air, whose site offers a
   claim of membership for use at affiliate sites.  She acquires a
   membership claim, which her Identity Agent stores for her.

7.2.  A2

   Beth visits a Galactic Air affiliate site that provides discounted
   travel insurance for frequent travelers.  She presents her Galactic
   Air membership claim from her Identity Agent and receives a discount.

7.3.  A3

   Beth visits a rental cars site.  She opts out of the offered drivers
   insurance as she is covered by her travel insurance.  To complete the
   booking the site requests a claim that she has valid insurance.  Her
   identity agent is unable to satisfy the request so provides a list of
   suggested sources.  Beth picks her insurance provider and her
   identity agent acquires the required claim and with her consent
   presents it to the rental car site.

7.4.  A4

   A couple of months later Beth books another trip.  The travel site
   requests her claim of Galactic Air membership.  Her identity agent
   finds that the claim has expired, so refreshes it by requesting an
   updated claim from galacticair.com.

7.5.  A5

   When she visits onlinebank.com, she clicks IN.  Her Identity Agent is
   informed by the online back that a strong authentication mechanism is
   required, and is provided with a list of acceptable mechanisms,
   including two-factor authentication.  Beth&#65533;s Identity Agent
   authenticates Beth using a two-factor device.  The data that is sent
   to the online bank includes a claim from the vendor of the two-factor
   device, confirming that Beth was authenticated with a two-factor
   device.

7.6.  A6

   Adam uses a service to acquire a verified email claim.  With it he

   can prove that he owns his email address, Adam@example.com, without
   having to go through a verification process.

7.7.  A7

   Beth gives her friend, Adam@example.com, access to her photos.  Adam
   receives an email from Beth inviting him to view her photos.  He goes
   to the site, which requests a verified email claim.  He presents his
   claim and gains access to the photos Beth has published for him.

7.8.  A8

   Adam visits a site that requires that he prove he is over 21.  He
   provides the site with a claim that he is over 21, issues by the
   government of his country of residence, gov.ca.  The claim contains
   no other information about Adam and the site is unable to use the
   claim to discover more information about Adam.

7.9.  A9

   Adam returns to the same site.  He must again prove that he is over
   21.  He provides a claim, but the site cannot tell that it is Adam
   that has returned again to the site.

7.10.  A10

   Beth provides a claim from galacticair.com to many different
   websites.  She wants all of the sites to know that she is the same
   person providing the claim, so she can receive a free flight at the
   end of the year.

7.11.  A11

   Beth's employer has partnered with a local university to provide it's
   staff with access to online courses.  She signs up for some modules
   at the university admissions website acquiring an enrollment claim.
   She then browses to the computer science school website to sign up
   for an advanced programming course.  The site requests claims that
   she is an employee, that she has previously completed some basic
   introductory modules, and that she has been enrolled.

   Beth is shopping online for a new laptop computer.  She visits an
   online site that caters to recently graduated professionals.  She
   selects a machine and investigates the lease options available.  To
   work out the monthly payment the site requests some claims: A claim

   appropriately branded tote bag.  A claim that she's a member of
   Galactic Air, so that she can be credited with airmiles for her
   purchase.  And, a claim from a credit scoring agency that she has a
   'good' credit rating.

7.13.  A13

   Beth is at home checking her work email, she has an email from a
   colleague assigning a customer support issue to her.  The company
   help desk system is provided by helpdesk.com, an on-demand
   application provider.  She clicks through a link in the email to the
   page that describes the issue.  Helpdesk.com requests a claim that
   Beth is an employee of 'Nano Software Inc', which she provides from
   her Identity Agent, and she gains access to the page.

7.14.  A14

   Beth is shopping online at a site for a college text book.  The site
   offers a discount to students, so requests an appropriate claim.
   With Beth's consent her Identity Agent acquires an enrollment claim
   from her university.  The university issues the claim, but signs it
   as a parent authority, which represents all universities in the
   region.  The Identity Agent, with Beth's consent, presents the claim
   to the site, which can now verify that Beth is a student, but can not
   determine which university she is a student of.

8.  Non Browser Based Use Cases

   These use cases motivate alternative protocol bindings for a DIX
   protocol.

8.1.  NB1 - REST

   Beth wants to use QOPO.com for printing her pictures that are stored
   in flackr.  She visits QOPO.com and her identity agent is instructed
   to acquire a token from flackr.  Her Identity Agent retrieves the
   token from flackr and presents it to QOPO.com.  QOPO.com passes the
   token over the REST based web service that flackr provides to
   retrieve her photos for printing.

8.2.  NB2

   Beth is a big fan of Rocky Gervas and listens to his podcast
   fanatically.  The Rocky Gervas show recently started charging a small
   fee for the podcast.  Her media player polls the podcast
   periodically.  When polled the site requests a claim from Beth's
   Identity Agent asserting that Beth has paid for the podcast.  Beth's
   Identity Agent retrieves the claim presents it to the site and the
   latest episode of The Rocky Gervas show is downloaded.

8.3.  NB3 - WebDAV

   At work Beth uses her website editing software (a WebDAV client) to
   publish some company confidential content to their extranet.  Beth is
   collaborating with Charles at another company, who requires access to
   the content.  Beth configures the extranet to allow Charles access.
   Charles uses his website editing software (also a WebDAV client) to
   fetch the content.  The extranet site requests identity information,
   which his client presents from his Identity agent, and he is able to
   edit the content.

8.4.  NB4 - AtomPub

   Beth uses a blogging client (AtomPub) to both post content to her
   blog and to add comments on other people's blog postings.  Her client
   uses her identity agent to associate identifying information (her
   blog url and favicon) with her comments.

8.5.  NB5 - XCAP and SIMPLE

   Beth uses her instant messaging client (a SIMPLE client) to
   communicate with her friends.  She uses her client to update her
   profile information (via XCAP), adding a new friend.  Her client
   didn't need to authenticate to her XCAP server, as she had already

   authenticated herself to her identity agent.

8.6.  NB6 - CalDAV

   Beth needs to arrange a conference call with Charles.  She uses her
   calendaring software (a CalDAV client) to publish her free-busy time
   to Charles.  Charles uses his calendaring software (also a CalDAV
   client) to fetch Beth's free-busy time.  Beth's calendar publisher
   requests some identity information of Charle's client.  It's provided
   from his identity agent and he is able to book a time for the call.

8.7.  NB7 - IMAP/POP3 and CalDAV

   At work Beth uses both calendaring (CalDAV) and email
   (IMAP,POP3,SMTP) clients to manage her time and messages.  Her
   identity agent authenticates her as owning the identifier that both
   clients use to identify her.  In this way she need only authenticate
   once to her identity agent instead of twice, once to each client.

8.8.  NB8 - RSS, Web, and CalDAV

   Beth works in a distributed workgroup collaborating with colleagues,
   individual contractors, and employees of partner companies.  The
   calendaring information she has access to is available via CalDAV,
   RSS, and HTTP/HTML.  Each of her software clients uses her identity
   agent to ensure she need only authenticate once, instead of once per
   client.
