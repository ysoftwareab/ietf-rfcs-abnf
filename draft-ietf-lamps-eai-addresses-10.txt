1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines rfc822Name subjectAltName choice for representing
   [RFC5321] email addresses.  This form is restricted to a subset of
   US-ASCII characters and thus can't be used to represent
   Internationalized Email addresses [RFC6531].  To facilitate use of
   these Internationalized Email addresses with X.509 certificates, this
   document specifies a new name form in otherName so that
   subjectAltName and issuerAltName can carry them.  In addition this
   document calls for all email address domain in X.509 certificates to
   conform to IDNA2008 [RFC5890].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]
   notation.

3.  Name Definitions

   The GeneralName structure is defined in [RFC5280], and supports many
   different names forms including otherName for extensibility.  This
   section specifies the SmtpUTF8Name name form of otherName, so that
   Internationalized Email addresses can appear in the subjectAltName of
   a certificate, the issuerAltName of a certificate, or anywhere else
   that GeneralName is used.

   id-on-SmtpUTF8Name OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on 9 }

   SmtpUTF8Name ::= UTF8String (SIZE (1..MAX))

   When the subjectAltName (or issuerAltName) extension contains an
   Internationalized Email address, the address MUST be stored in the
   SmtpUTF8Name name form of otherName.  The format of SmtpUTF8Name is
   defined as the ABNF rule SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  SmtpUTF8Mailbox is a
   modified version of the Internationalized Mailbox which was defined
   in Section 3.3 of [RFC6531] which was itself derived from SMTP
   Mailbox from Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5321].  [RFC6531] defines the
   following ABNF rules for Mailbox whose parts are modified for
   internationalization: <Local-part>, <Dot-string>, <Quoted-string>,
   <QcontentSMTP>, <Domain>, and <Atom>.  In particular, <Local-part>
   was updated to also support UTF8-non-ascii.  UTF8-non-ascii was
   described by Section 3.1 of [RFC6532].  Also, sub-domain was extended
   to support U-label, as defined in [RFC5890].

   This document further refines Internationalized [RFC6531] Mailbox
   ABNF rules and calls this SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  In SmtpUTF8Mailbox, sub-
   domain that encode non-ASCII characters SHALL use U-label Unicode
   native character labels and MUST NOT use A-label [RFC5890].  This
   restriction prevents having to determine which label encoding A- or
   U-label is present in the Domain.  As per Section 2.3.2.1 of
   [RFC5890], U-label use UTF-8 [RFC3629] with Normalization Form C and
   other properties specified there.  In SmtpUTF8Mailbox, sub-domain
   that encode ASCII character labels SHALL use NR-LDH restrictions as
   specified by section 2.3.1 of [RFC5890] and SHALL be restricted to
   lower case letters.  One suggested approach to apply these sub-
   domains restriction is to restrict sub-domain so that labels not
   start with two letters followed by two hyphen-minus characters.
   Consistent with the treatment of rfc822Name in [RFC5280],
   SmtpUTF8Name is an envelope <Mailbox> and has no phrase (such as a
   common name) before it, has no comment (text surrounded in
   parentheses) after it, and is not surrounded by "<" and ">".

   Due to operational reasons described shortly and name constraint
   compatibility reasons described in its section, SmtpUTF8Name
   subjectAltName MUST only be used when the local part of the email
   address contains UTF-8.  When the local-part is ASCII, rfc822Name
   subjectAltName MUST be used instead of SmtpUTF8Name.  The use of
   rfc822Name rather than SmtpUTF8Name is currently more likely to be
   supported.  Also use of SmtpUTF8Name incurs higher byte
   representation overhead due to encoding with otherName and the
   additional OID needed.  This may be offset if domain requires non-
   ASCII characters as SmtpUTF8Name supports U-label whereas rfc822Name
   supports A-label.

   SmtpUTF8Name is encoded as UTF8String.  The UTF8String encoding MUST
   NOT contain a Byte-Order- Mark (BOM) [RFC3629] to aid consistency
   across implementations particularly for comparison.

4.  IDNA2008

   To facilitate comparison between email addresses, all email address
   domain in X.509 certificates MUST conform to IDNA2008 [RFC5890] (and
   excludes any "mappings" mentioned in that document).  Otherwise non-
   conforming email address domains introduces the possibility of
   conversion errors between alternate forms.  This applies to
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox and rfc822Name in subjectAltName, issuerAltName and
   anywhere else that GeneralName is used.

5.  Matching of Internationalized Email Addresses in X.509 certificates

   In equivalence comparison with SmtpUTF8Name, there may be some setup
   work to enable the comparison i.e. processing of the SmtpUTF8Name
   content or the email address that is being compared against.  The
   process for setup for comparing with SmtpUTF8Name is split into
   domain steps and local- part steps.  The comparison form for local-
   part always is UTF-8.  The comparison form for domain depends on
   context.  While some contexts such as certificate path validation in
   [RFC5280] specify transforming domain to A-label, this document
   RECOMMENDS transforming to UTF-8 U-label instead.  This reduces the
   likelihood of errors by reducing conversions as more implementations
   natively support U-label domains.

   Comparison of two SmtpUTF8Name is straightforward with no setup work
   needed.  They are considered equivalent if there is an exact octet-
   for-octet match.  Comparison with other email address forms such as
   Internationalized email address or rfc822Name requires additional
   setup steps.  Domain setup is particularly important for forms that
   may contain A- or U-label such as International email address, or
   A-label only forms such as rfc822Name.  This document specifies the
   process to transform the domain to U-label.  (To convert the domain
   to A-label, follow the process specified in section 7.5 and 7.2 in
   [RFC5280]) The first step is to detect A-label by using section 5.1
   of [RFC5891].  Next if necessary, transform the A-label to U-label
   Unicode as specified in section 5.2 of [RFC5891].  Finally if
   necessary convert the Unicode to UTF-8 as specified in section 3 of
   [RFC3629].  For ASCII NR-LDH labels, upper case letters are converted
   to lower case letters.  In setup for SmtpUTF8Mailbox, the email
   address local-part MUST conform to the requirements of [RFC6530] and
   [RFC6531], including being a string in UTF-8 form.  In particular,
   the local-part MUST NOT be transformed in any way, such as by doing
   case folding or normalization of any kind.  The <Local-part> part of
   an Internationalized email address is already in UTF-8.  For

Internet-Draft  I18N Mail Addresses in X.509 certificates       May 2017


   rfc822Name the local-part, which is IA5String (ASCII), trivially maps
   to UTF-8 without change.  Once setup is complete, they are again
   compared octet-for-octet.

   To summarize non-normatively, the comparison steps including setup
   are:

   1.  If the domain contains A-labels, transform them to U-label.

   2.  If the domain contains ASCII NR-LDH labels, lowercase them.

   3.  Ensure local-part is UTF-8.

   4.  Compare strings octet-for-octet for equivalence.

   This specification expressly does not define any wildcards characters
   and SmtpUTF8Name comparison implementations MUST NOT interpret any
   character as wildcards.  Instead, to specify multiple email addresses
   through SmtpUTF8Name, the certificate SHOULD use multiple
   subjectAltNames or issuerAltNames to explicitly carry those email
   addresses.

6.  Name constraints in path validation

   This section updates [RFC5280] name constraints defined in section
   4.2.1.10 to work with SmtpUTF8Name subjectAltName.  The following
   specifies that a SmtpUTF8Name aware CA use a compatible name
   constraint representation.  Similarly a SmtpUTF8Name aware path
   validators MUST be able to apply name constraint comparison to the
   subject distinguished name and both forms of subject alternative name
   rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Name.

   The SmtpUTF8Name aware email address name constraint form is
   specified to be rfc822Name motivated by compatibility considerations
   with legacy systems that already understand that form.  This
   specification modifies [RFC5280] name constraint to only require with
   MAY that it represents all addresses at a host or all mailboxes in a
   domain, and require with MAY NOT that it represent a particular
   mailbox.  For context, [RFC5280] Section 4.2.1.10 specifies with MAY
   that name constraint represent a particular mailbox, all addresses at
   a host, or all mailboxes in a domain by specifying the complete email
   address, a host name, or a domain.  The change is due to rfc822Name
   name constraints inability to represent a specific mailbox with a
   UTF-8 email local part email address.  CA certificate issuers should
   be aware of this lessened support.

   Constraint comparison with SmtpUTF8Name subjectAltName starts with
   the setup steps defined by Section 5.  The setup applies to the

Internet-Draft  I18N Mail Addresses in X.509 certificates       May 2017


   inputs of the comparison which is one of a subject distinguished name
   or a rfc822Name or SmtpUTF8Name subjectAltName, and one of a
   rfc822Name name constraint.  Non-normatively the setup will convert
   any domain A-label to U-label in the rfc822Name name constraint, and
   to lower case any doman NR-LDH label in both the name constraint and
   the subject.  After setup, this follows the comparison steps defined
   in 4.2.1.10 of [RFC5280] with some modifications as follows.  The
   comparison process starts by determining the name constraint
   representation i.e. email host name or domain part, then comparing
   the name constraint against the corresponding part in the email
   address using a byte for byte comparison.  This document suggests
   that name constraint comparison with subject distinguished name or
   rfc822Name subjectAltName also follow these setup and comparisons
   steps as well.

   The name constraint requirement with SmtpUTF8Name subject alternative
   name is illustrated in the non-normative diagram Figure 1.  The first
   example (1) illustrates a permitted rfc822Name ASCII only hostname
   name constraint, and the corresponding valid rfc822Name
   subjectAltName and SmtpUTF8Name subjectAltName email addresses.  The
   second example (2) illustrates a permitted rfc822Name hostname name
   constraint with A-label, and the corresponding valid rfc822Name
   subjectAltName and SmtpUTF8Name subjectAltName email addresses.

7.  Security Considerations

   Use for SmtpUTF8Name for certificate subjectAltName (and
   issuerAltName) will incur many of the same security considerations of
   Section 8 in [RFC5280] but is further complicated by permitting non-
   ASCII characters in the email address local-part.  This complication,
   as mentioned in Section 4.4 of [RFC5890] and in Section 4 of
   [RFC6532], is that use of Unicode introduces the risk of visually
   similar and identical characters which can be exploited to deceive
   the recipient.  The former document references some means to mitigate
   against these attacks.

Appendix B.  Example of SmtpUTF8Name

   This non-normative example demonstrates using SmtpUTF8Name as an
   otherName in GeneralName to encode the email address
   "u+8001u+5E2B@example.com".

Internet-Draft  I18N Mail Addresses in X.509 certificates       May 2017


      The hexadecimal DER encoding of the email address is:
      A022060A 2B060105 05070012 0809A014 0C12E880 81E5B8AB 40657861
      6D706C65 2E636F6D

      The text decoding is:
        0  34: [0] {
        2  10:   OBJECT IDENTIFIER '1 3 6 1 5 5 7 0 18 8 9'
       14  20:   [0] {
       16  18:     UTF8String '..@example.com'
             :     }
             :   }

                                 Figure 3

   The example was encoded on the OSS Nokalva ASN.1 Playground and the
   above text decoding is an output of Peter Gutmann's "dumpasn1"
   program.
