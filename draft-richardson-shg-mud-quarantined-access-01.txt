1.  Introduction

   The document details an extension to the Manufacturer Usage
   Description (MUD) mechanism to be able to mark one or more ACLs as
   being enabled even though the device has quaranteed.

2.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.
