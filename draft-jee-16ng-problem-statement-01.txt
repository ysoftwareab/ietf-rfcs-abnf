Internet-Draft           16ng Problem Statement           September 2005


1.  Introduction

   Broadband Wireless Access networks address the inadequacies of low
   bandwidth wireless communication for user requirements such as high
   quality data/voice service, fast mobility, wide coverage, etc.  The
   IEEE 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless Access Standards
   develops standards and recommended practices to support the
   development and deployment of broadband Wireless Metropolitan Area
   Networks.  Additionally, IEEE 802.16e is an amendment that adds
   support for mobility over the base IEEE 802.16 specification.

   Recently, the WiMAX Forum, and, in particular, its NWG (Network
   Working Group) is defining the IEEE 802.16(e) network architecture
   (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Mobility, Interworking with different networks,
   AAA, etc).  The NWG is thus taking on work at layers above those
   defined by the IEEE 802 standards (typically limited to the physical
   and link layers only).  Similarly, WiBro (Wireless Broadband), a
   Korean effort which focuses on the 2.3 GHz spectrum band, is also
   based on the IEEE 802.16e specification.

   IEEE 802.16(e) is different from existing wireless access
   technologies such as IEEE 802.11 or 3G. Accordingly, while 802.16
   defines the encapsulation of an IP datagram in an IEEE 802.16 MAC
   payload, complete description of IP operation is not present and can
   benefit from IETF input and specification.  This document will
   describe the problems identified in adopting IPv6 over IEEE 802.16(e)
   networks.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .


3.  Problem Statement

   The first problem identified in adopting IPv6 over IEEE 802.16(e)
   networks is that IEEE 802.16(e) is different from existing wireless
   access technologies such as IEEE 802.11 or 3G. Accordingly, while
   802.16 defines the encapsulation of an IP datagram in an IEEE 802.16
   MAC payload, complete description of IP operation is not present and
   can benefit from IETF input and specification.  For example:
   immediately subsequent to network entry an 802.16 subscriber station
   has no capability whatsoever for data (as opposed to management)
   connectivity.  The criteria by which the Base Station (or other
   headend elements) set up the 802.16 MAC connections for data

   transport is not part of the 802.16 standard and depends on the type
   of data services being offered (ie. the set up of transport
   connections will be different for IPv4 and IPv6 services).
   Additionally - as 802.16 is a point-to-multipoint network - an 802.16
   subscriber station is not capable of broadcasting (eg. for neighbor
   discovery) or direct communication to the other nodes in the network.
   While the built-in LAN emulation feature of 802.16 ("802.3
   Convergence Sublayer") rectifies this, it may involve additional
   packet overhead.  This lacking of facility for native multicasting
   for IPv6 packet transfer results in inappropriateness to apply the
   standard Neighbor Discover Protocol specially regarding, address
   resolution, router discovery, duplicated address detection and
   stateless auto-configuration.

   The second problem identified in adopting IPv6 over IEEE 802.16(e)
   networks is applying the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4068]
   owing to the difficulty in utilizing the layer 2 handover
   information.  From RFC 4068, mobile node is recommended to send FBU
   (Fast Binding Update) message to the PAR (Previous Access Router)
   based on the accurate target BS information on the connected link to
   operate as predictive mode.  In IEEE 802.16e [IEEE 802.16e], the
   mobile subscriber station decides the ultimate target base station
   and sends the MOB_HO-IND message to the serving BS to notify the
   decided target BS information which results in disabling any IPv6
   packet transfer on that link.  This means that the layer 3's fast
   handover processing needs to break into the layer 2 processing,
   between the target decision and the MOB_HO-IND message transfer, to
   operate as predictive mode.  Normally, this kind of intervention is
   not preferred, because this requires certain interruption of the
   layer 2 processing, eventually resulting in the handover delay.  For
   reactive mode, utilizing the "Link up" trigger to immediately
   initiate sending FNA (Fast Neighbor Advertisement) or performing DNA
   (Detecting Network Attachment) procedures is highly desirable to
   reduce delay and packet loss.  In IEEE 802.16(e) networks, a SS
   (Subscriber Station) receive a REG-RSP message from the serving BS
   when the registration is accepted.  This registration authorizes a SS
   to forward IP traffic to the network.  Thus, receiving the REG-RSP
   can be mapped as "Link up" trigger in IEEE 802.16(e) networks.


4.  Security Considerations

   None of considerations are required in this section.
