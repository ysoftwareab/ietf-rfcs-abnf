Internet-Draft            IPsec IKE Action MIB              October 2006


Abstract

   This document defines a SMIv2 Management Information Base (MIB)
   module for configuring Internet Key Exchange (IKE) actions for the
   security policy database (SPD) of a device that uses the IPsec
   Security Policy Database Configuration MIB for configuring the IKE
   protocol actions on that device.  The IPsec IKE Action MIB integrates
   directly with the IPsec Security Policy Database Configuration MIB
   and it is meant to work within the framework of an action referenced
   by that MIB.

Internet-Draft            IPsec IKE Action MIB              October 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module for configuration of an Internet
   Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409] action within the IPsec security policy
   database (SPD).  This module works within the framework of the IPsec
   Security Policy Database Configuration MIB (IPSEC-SPD-MIB) [RFCZZZZ].
   It can be referenced as an action by the IPSEC-SPD-MIB and is used to
   configure IKE negotiations between network devices.

   Companion document [RFCZZZZ], documents the IPsec Security Policy
   Database Configuration MIB.  Companion document [RFCYYYY], documents
   the IPsec Security Policy IPsec Action MIB for configuration of
   static IPsec SAs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


4.  Relationship to the DMTF Policy Model

   The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) has created an object
   oriented model of IPsec policy information known as the IPsec Policy
   Model White Paper [IPPMWP].  The contents of this document are also
   reflected in the "IPsec Configuration Policy Model" (IPCP) [RFC3585].
   This MIB module is a task specific derivation (i.e. an SMIv2
   instantiation) of the IKE actions portions of the IPCP's IPsec
   configuration model for use with SNMPv3.  This includes the necessary
   filter, negotiation, identity and IKE action information required to

Internet-Draft            IPsec IKE Action MIB              October 2006


   enable IKE negotiation within the IPsec Policy framework.


5.  MIB Module Overview

   The MIB module describes the necessary information to implement IKE
   actions and their associated negotiations referred to by the IPsec
   Security Policy Database Configuration MIB.  A basic understanding of
   IKE, of IPsec processing, of the IPsec Configuration Policy Model and
   of how actions fit into the overall framework of the IPSEC-SPD-MIB
   are required to use this MIB properly.  When referring to an action
   in this MIB from the IPSEC-SPD-MIB, the filters within the IPSEC-SPD-
   MIB that are associated to the action are limited to those that are
   supported by IKE [RFC2409] and this MIB.


6.  MIB definition

   The following MIB Module imports from: [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580], [RFC3411], [RFC4001].

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module used to configure IPsec policy
   services.  Since IKE negotiates keys for IPsec and IPsec provides
   security services, it is important that the IKE configuration data
   SHOULD be least as protected as the IPsec provided security service.
   There are two main threats you need to thwart when configuring IPsec
   devices.

   1.  Malicious Configuration: This MIB configures network security
       services.  If an attacker has SET access to any part of this MIB,
       the network security services configured by this MIB SHOULD be
       considered broken.  The network data sent through the associated
       gateway should no longer be considered as protected by IPsec
       (i.e., it is no longer confidential or authenticated).
       Therefore, only the official administrators SHOULD be allowed to
       configure a device.  In other words, administrators' identities
       SHOULD be authenticated and their access rights checked before
       they are allowed to do device configuration.  The support for SET

       operations to the IPSEC-IKEACTION-MIB in a non-secure
       environment, without proper protection, will invalidate the
       security of the network traffic affected by the IPSEC-IKEACITON-
       MIB.

   2.  Disclosure of Configuration: In general, malicious parties SHOULD
       NOT be able to read security configuration data while the data is
       in network transit.  An attacker reading the configuration data
       may be able to find misconfigurations in the MIB that enable
       attacks to the network or to the configured node.  Since this
       entire MIB is used for security configuration, it is highly
       RECOMMENDED that only authorized administrators are allowed to
       view data in this MIB.  In particular, malicious users SHOULD be
       prevented from reading SNMP packets containing this MIB's data.
       SNMP GET data SHOULD be encrypted when sent across the network.
       Also, only authorized administrators SHOULD be allowed SNMP GET
       access to any of the MIB objects.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not include adequate security.  Even
   if the network itself is secure (e.g. by using IPsec), earlier
   versions of SNMP have virtually no control as to who on the secure
   network is allowed to access (i.e. read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Therefore, when configuring data in the IPSEC-IKEACTION-MIB, you
   SHOULD use SNMP version 3.  The rest of this discussion assumes the
   use of SNMPv3.  This is a real strength, because it allows
   administrators the ability to load new IPsec configuration on a
   device and keep the conversation private and authenticated under the
   protection of SNMPv3 before any IPsec protections are available.
   Once initial establishment of IPsec configuration on a device has
   been achieved, it would be possible to set up IPsec SAs to then also
   provide security and integrity services to the configuration
   conversation.  This may seem redundant at first, but will be shown to
   have a use for added privacy protection below.

7.2.  Protecting against unauthenticated access

   The current SNMPv3 User Security Model provides for key based user
   authentication.  Typically, keys are derived from passwords (but are
   not required to be), and the keys are then used in HMAC algorithms
   (currently MD5 and SHA-1 HMACs are defined) to authenticate all SNMP
   data.  Each SNMP device keeps a (configured) list of users and keys.
   Under SNMPv3 user keys may be updated as often as an administrator
   cares to have users enter new passwords.  But Perfect Forward Secrecy
   for user keys is not yet provided by standards track documents,
   although RFC2786 defines an experimental method of doing so.

7.3.  Protecting against involuntary disclosure

   While sending IPsec configuration data to a Policy Enforcement Point
   (PEP), there are a few critical parameters which MUST NOT be observed
   by third parties.  Specifically, except for public keys, keying
   information MUST NOT be allowed to be observed by third parties.
   This include IKE Pre-Shared Keys and possibly the private key of a
   public/private key pair for use in a PKI.  Were either of those
   parameters to be known to a third party, they could then impersonate
   the device to other IKE peers.  Aside from those critical parameters,
   policy administrators have an interest in not divulging any of their
   policy configuration.  Any knowledge about a device's configuration
   could help an unfriendly party compromise that device.  SNMPv3 offers
   privacy security services, but at the time this document was written,
   the only standardized encryption algorithm supported by SNMPv3 is the
   DES encryption algorithm.  Support for other (stronger) cryptographic
   algorithms is in the works and may be done as you read this (e.g.
   AES [RFC3826]).  When configure IPsec policy using this MIB, policy
   administrators SHOULD use a privacy security service that is at least
   as strong as the desired IPsec policy.  E.G., If an administrator
   were to use this MIB to configure an IPsec connection that utilizes a
   3DES algorithms, the SNMP communication configuring the connection
   SHOULD be protected by an algorithm as strong or stronger than the
   3DES algorithm.

7.4.  Bootstrapping your configuration

   Most vendors will not ship new products with a default SNMPv3 user/
   password pair, but it is possible.  If a device does ship with a
   default user/password pair, policy administrators SHOULD either
   change the password or configure a new user, deleting the default
   user (or at a minimum, restrict the access of the default user).
   Most SNMPv3 distributions should, hopefully, require an out-of-band
   initialization over a trusted medium, such as a local console
   connection.  If a product does install with default user/password
   information, these values should be changed before connecting to a

8.  IANA Considerations

   Only one IANA consideration exist for this document.  The
   consideration is the node number allocation of the IPSEC-IKEACTION-
   MIB under the IPSEC-SPD-MIB MIB's spdActions node.
