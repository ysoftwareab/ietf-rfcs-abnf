Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in
   conjunction with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide
   a variety of short-term and long-term reception statistics.  The
   available reporting may include aggregate information across longer
   periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.  This
   document specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual
   packets discarded from the jitter buffer after successful reception.

Internet-Draft             RTCP XR Discard RLE             December 2008


1.  Introduction

   RTP [RFC3550] provides a transport for real-time media flows such as
   audio and video together with the RTP control protocol which provides
   periodic feedback about the media streams received in a specific
   duration.  In addition, RTCP can be used for timely feedback about
   individual events to report (e.g., packet loss) [RFC4585].  Both
   long-term and short-term feedback enable a sender to adapt its media
   transmission and/or encoding dynamically to the observed path
   characteristics.

   RFC3611 [RFC3611] defines RTCP eXtension Reports as a detailed
   reporting framework to provide more than just the coarse RR
   statistics.  The detailed reporting may enable a sender to react more
   appropriately to the observed networking conditions as these can be
   characterized better, albeit at the expense of extra overhead.

   Among many other fields, RFC3611 specifies the Loss RLE block which
   define runs of packets received and lost with the granularity of
   individual packets.  This can help both error recovery and path loss
   characterization.  In addition to lost packets, RFC 3611 defines the
   notion of "discarded" packets: packets that were received but dropped
   from the jitter buffer because they were either too early (for
   buffering) or too late (for playout).  This metric is part of the
   VoIP metrics report block even though it is not just applicable to
   audio: it is specified as the fraction of discarded packets since the
   beginning of the session.  See section 4.7.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Recently proposed extensions to the XR reporting suggest enhancing
   this discard metric:
   o  Reporting the number of discarded packets during either the last
      reporting interval or since the beginning of the session, as
      indicated by a flag in the suggested XR report
      [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcp-xr-discard].
   o  Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during the last
      reporting interval or cumulatively since the beginning of the
      session [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-discard].

   However, none of these metrics allow a receiver to report precisely
   which packets were discarded.  While this information could in theory
   be derived from high-frequency reporting on the number of discarded
   packets or from the gap/burst report, these two mechanisms do not
   appear feasible: The former would require an unduly high amount of
   reporting which still might not be sufficient due to the non-
   deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets.  The latter incur
   significant complexity and reporting overhead and might still not
   deliver the desired accuracy.

Internet-Draft             RTCP XR Discard RLE             December 2008


   This document defines a discard report block following the idea of
   the run-length encoding applied for lost and received packets in
   RFC3611.

   Complementary to or instead of the indication which packets were
   lost, an XR block is defined to indicate the number of bytes lost,
   per interval or for the duration of the session, similar to other XR
   report blocks.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550] and in the extensions for XR
   reporting [RFC3611] applies.


3.  XR Discard RLE Report Block

   The XR Discard RLE report block uses the same format as specified for
   the loss and duplicate report blocks in RFC3611 [RFC3611].  Figure
   Figure 1 recaps the packet format.  The fields "BT", "T", "block
   length", "SSRC of source", "begin_seq", and "end_seq" SHALL have the
   same semantics and representation as defined in RFC3611.  The
   "chunks" encoding the run length SHALL have the same representation
   as in RFC3611, but encode discarded packets.

   The 'E' bit is introduced to distinguish between packets discarded
   due to early arrival and those discarded due to late arrival.  The
   'E' bit MUST be set to '1' if the chunks represent packets discarded
   due to too early arrival and MUST be set to '0' otherwise.

   In case both early and late discarded packets shall be reported, two
   Discard RLE report blocks MUST be included; their sequence number
   range MAY overlap, but individual packets MUST only be reported as
   either early or late.  Packets reported in both MUST be considered as
   discarded without further information available, packets reported in
   neither are considered to be properly received and not discarded.

   Editor's node: is it acceptable to use one of the 'reserved' bits for
   this purpose or should two block types be used?

   The XR Bytes Discarded report block uses the following format:

                 Figure 2: XR Bytes Discarded Report Block

   The Interval Metric flag (I) (1 bit) is used to indicate whether the
   Post-Repair Loss metric is an Interval or a Cumulative metric, that
   is, whether the reported value applies to the most recent measurement
   interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the
   Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
   cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).

   The 'E' flag (1 bit) is introduced to distinguish between bytes
   discarded due to early arrival and bytes discarded due to late
   arrival.  The 'E' bit MUST be set to '1' if the 'number of bytes
   discarded' represents bytes discarded due to too early arrival and
   MUST be set to '0' otherwise.  In case both early and late discarded
   packets shall be reported, two Bytes Discarded report blocks MUST be
   included.

   The 'number of bytes discarded' (32 bits) is an unsigned integer
   value indicating the total number of bytes discarded (I=0) or the
   number of bytes discarded since the last RTCP XR Bytes Discarded
   block was sent (I=1).

   Editor's note: is it acceptable to use one of the 'reserved' bits for
   this purpose or should two block types be used?


5.  Protocol Operation

   This section describes the behavior of the reporting (= receiver) RTP
   node and the sender RTP node.

5.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)

   Any of the Discard RLE and the Bytes Discarded RLE report blocks
   SHOULD be sent in conjunction with an RTCP RR as a compound RTCP
   packet.  Nevertheless, the Discard RLE Report Block MAY be sent as a
   non-compound packet [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcp-non-compound] to expedite
   reporting or to increase the reporting frequency.

Internet-Draft             RTCP XR Discard RLE             December 2008


   Transmission of RTCP XR Discard RLE and Bytes Discarded reports is up
   to the discretion of the receiver, as is the reporting granularity.
   They MAY sent independently of each other or together in a single
   datagram.

   However, for the Discard RLE report blocks, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the receiver signals all discarded packets using the method defined
   in this document.  If all packets over a reporting period were
   discarded, the receiver MAY use the Discard Report Block
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcp-xr-discard] instead.  In case of limited available
   reporting bandwidth, it is up to the receiver whether or not to
   include RTCP XR Discard RLE reports or not.

   The receiver MAY send the Discard RLE and the Bytes Discarded reports
   as part of the regularly scheduled RTCP packets as per RFC3550.  It
   MAY also include Discard RLE Reports in immediate or early feedback
   packets as per RFC4585.

5.2.  Media Sender

   The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving any
   Discard RLE or Bytes Discarded reports.  If Discard RLE reports are
   generated by the receiver, the sender cannot rely on all these
   reports being received, nor can the sender rely on a regular
   generation pattern from the receiver side.

   However, if the sender receives any RTCP reports but no Discard RLE
   report blocks and is aware that the receiver supports Discard RLE or
   Bytes Discarded report blocks, it SHOULD assume that no packets were
   discarded at the receiver.


6.  SDP signaling

   The present report blocks define an extension to RTCP XR reporting.
   Whether or not this specific extended report is sent is left to the
   discretion of the receiver.  Its presence may enable better operation
   of the sender since more detailed information is available.  Not
   providing this information will make the sender rely on other RTCP
   report metrics.  Whether there is a need to signal this optimization
   is left for further study at this point.  If the receiver knows that
   the sender supports this metric, it may decide to include such
   reports as deemed necessary and not send them otherwise to save
   reporting bandwidth.  Hence, there is some value.

   Editor's node: There is ample precedence for signaling such
   capabilities (and even required support) in SDP, so that defining the
   corresponding attributes is a straightforward exercise should the

   need be confirmed.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC3550, RFC3611, and RFC4585 apply.
   Since this document offers only a more precise reporting for an
   already existing metric, no further security implications are
   foreseen.


8.  IANA Considerations

   One or two IANA actions are expected, depending on the future
   evolution of this document: Registration of two XR report blocks and,
   optionally, registration of SDP attributes for indicating support for
   these XR Report Blocks.
