      An Architecture for IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4
                   draft-ietf-6tisch-architecture-22

Abstract

   This document describes a network architecture that provides low-
   latency, low-jitter and high-reliability packet delivery.  It
   combines a high-speed powered backbone and subnetworks using IEEE
   802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) to meet the requirements
   of LowPower wireless deterministic applications.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless Networks enable a wide variety of devices of any size to get
   interconnected, often at a very low marginal cost per device, at any
   range, and in circumstances where wiring may be impractical, for
   instance on fast-moving or rotating devices.

   On the other hand, Deterministic Networking maximizes the packet
   delivery ratio within a bounded latency so as to enable mission-
   critical machine-to-machine (M2M) operations.  Applications that need
   such networks are presented in [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  They
   include Professional Media and Operation Technology (OT) Industrial
   Automation Control Systems (IACS).

   The Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) [RFC7554] mode of the IEEE Std
   802.15.4 [IEEE802154] Medium Access Control (MAC) was introduced with
   the IEEE Std 802.15.4e [IEEE802154e] amendment and is now retrofitted
   in the main standard.  For all practical purposes, this document is
   expected to be insensitive to the revisions of that standard, which
   is thus referenced undated.  TSCH is both a Time-Division
   Multiplexing and a Frequency-Division Multiplexing technique whereby
   a different channel can be used for each transmission, and that
   allows to schedule transmissions for deterministic operations.

   Proven Deterministic Networking standards for use in Process Control,
   including ISA100.11a [ISA100.11a] and WirelessHART [WirelessHART],
   have demonstrated the capabilities of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC
   for high reliability against interference, low-power consumption on
   well-known flows, and its applicability for Traffic Engineering (TE)
   from a central controller.

   To enable the convergence of IT and OT in Low-Power Lossy Networks
   (LLNs), the 6TiSCH Architecture supports an IETF suite of protocols
   over the IEEE Std 802.15.4TSCH MAC to provide IP connectivity for
   energy and otherwise constrained wireless devices.

   6TiSCH provides large scaling capabilities, which, in a number of
   scenarios, require the addition of a high-speed and reliable backbone
   and the use of IP version 6 (IPv6) [RFC8200].  The 6TiSCH
   Architecture leverages 6LoWPAN [RFC4944] to adapt IPv6 to the
   constrained media and RPL [RFC6550] for the distributed routing
   operations.

   The 6TiSCH Architecture introduces an IPv6 Multi-Link subnet model
   that is composed of a federating backbone, e.g., an Ethernet bridged
   network, and a number of IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH low-power wireless
   networks federated and synchronized by Backbone Routers.

   Centralized routing refers to a model where routes are computed and
   resources are allocated from a central controller.  This is
   particularly helpful to schedule deterministic multihop
   transmissions.  In contrast, Distributed Routing refers to a model
   that relies on concurrent peer to peer protocol exchanges for TSCH
   resource allocation and routing operations.

   The architecture defines mechanisms to establish and maintain routing
   and scheduling in a centralized, distributed, or mixed fashion, for
   use in multiple OT environments.  It is applicable in particular to
   highly scalable solutions such as used in Advanced Metering
   Infrastructure [AMI] solutions that leverage distributed routing to
   enable multipath forwarding over large LLN meshes.

   Other use cases includes industrial control systems, building
   automation, in-vehicle command and control, commercial automation and
   asset tracking with mobile scenarios, and home automation
   applications.  The determinism provides for a more reliable
   experience which can be used to monitor and manage resources, e.g.,
   energy and water, in a more efficient fashion.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  New Terms

   The draft does not reuse terms from the IEEE Std 802.15.4
   [IEEE802154] standard such as "path" or "link" which bear a meaning
   that is quite different from classical IETF parlance.

   This document adds the following terms:

   6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e):  6TiSCH defines
               an adaptation sublayer for IPv6 over TSCH called 6top, a
               set of protocols for setting up a TSCH schedule in
               distributed approach, and a security solution. 6TiSCH may
               be extended in the future for other MAC/PHY pairs
               providing a service similar to TSCH.

   6top (6TiSCH Operation Sublayer):  The next higher layer of the IEEE
               Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC layer.  6top provides the
               abstraction of an IP link over a TSCH MAC, schedules
               packets over TSCH cells, and exposes a management
               interface to schedule TSCH cells.

   6P (6top Protocol):  The protocol defined in [RFC8480].  6P enables
               Layer-2 peers to allocate, move or deallocate cells in
               their respective schedules to communicate.  6P operates
               at the 6top layer.

   6P Transaction:  A 2-way or 3-way sequence of 6P messages used by
               Layer-2 peers to modify their communication schedule.

   ASN (Absolute Slot Number):  The total number of timeslots that have
               elapsed since the PAN coordinator has started the TSCH
               network.  Incremented by one at each timeslot.  It is
               wide enough to not roll over in practice.

   bundle:     A group of equivalent scheduled cells, i.e. cells
               identified by different [slotOffset, channelOffset],
               which are scheduled for a same purpose, with the same
               neighbor, with the same flags, and the same slotframe.
               The size of the bundle refers to the number of cells it
               contains.  For a given slotframe length, the size of the
               bundle translates directly into bandwidth.  A bundle is a
               local abstraction that represents a half-duplex link for
               either sending or receiving, with bandwidth that amounts
               to the sum of the cells in the bundle.

   Layer-2 vs. Layer-3 bundle:  Bundles are associated for either
               Layer-2 (switching) or Layer-3 (routing) forwarding
               operations.  A pair of Layer-3 bundles (one for each
               direction) maps to an IP Link with a neighbor, whereas a
               set of Layer-2 bundles (a number per neighbor, either
               from or to the neighbor) corresponds to the relation of
               one or more incoming bundle(s) from the previous-hop
               neighbor(s) with one or more outgoing bundle(s) to the
               next-hop neighbor(s) along a Track.

   CCA (Clear Channel Assessment):  A mechanism defined in [IEEE802154]
               whereby nodes listen to the channel before sending to
               detect ongoing transmissions from other parties.  Because
               the network is synchronized, CCA cannot be used to detect
               colliding transmissions within the same network, but it
               can be used to detect other radio networks in vicinity.

   cell:       A unit of transmission resource in the CDU matrix, a cell
               is identified by a slotOffset and a channelOffset.  A
               cell can be scheduled or unscheduled.

   Channel Distribution/Usage (CDU) matrix:  : A matrix of cells (i,j)
               representing the spectrum (channel) distribution among
               the different nodes in the 6TiSCH network.  The CDU
               matrix has width in timeslots, equal to the period of the
               network scheduling operation, and height equal to the
               number of available channels.  Every cell (i,j) in the
               CDU, identified by (slotOffset, channelOffset), belongs
               to a specific chunk.

   channelOffset:  Identifies a row in the TSCH schedule.  The number of
               channelOffset values is bounded by the number of
               available frequencies.  The channelOffset translates into
               a frequency with a function that depends on the absolute
               time when the communication takes place, resulting in a
               channel hopping operation.

   chunk:      A well-known list of cells, distributed in time and
               frequency, within a CDU matrix.  A chunk represents a
               portion of a CDU matrix.  The partition of the CDU matrix
               in chunks is globally known by all the nodes in the
               network to support the appropriation process, which is a
               negotiation between nodes within an interference domain.
               A node that manages to appropriate a chunk gets to decide
               which transmissions will occur over the cells in the
               chunk within its interference domain (i.e., a parent node
               will decide when the cells within the appropriated chunk
               are used and by which node, among its children.

   CoJP (Constrained Join Protocol):  The Constrained Join Protocol
               (CoJP) enables a pledge to securely join a 6TiSCH network
               and obtain network parameters over a secure channel.
               Minimal Security Framework for 6TiSCH
               [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] defines the minimal
               CoJP setup with pre-shared keys defined.  In that mode,
               CoJP can operate with a single round trip exchange.

   dedicated cell:  A cell that is reserved for a given node to transmit
               to a specific neighbor.

   deterministic network:  The generic concept of deterministic network
               is defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  When
               applied to 6TiSCH, it refers to the reservation of Tracks
               which guarantee an end-to-end latency and optimize the
               PDR for well-characterized flows.

   distributed cell reservation:  A reservation of a cell done by one or
               more in-network entities.

   distributed Track reservation:  A reservation of a Track done by one
               or more in-network entities.

   EB (Enhanced Beacon):  A special frame defined in [IEEE802154] used
               by a node, including the JP, to announce the presence of
               the network.  It contains enough information for a pledge
               to synchronize to the network.

   hard cell:  A scheduled cell which the 6top sublayer may not
               relocate.

   hopping sequence:  Ordered sequence of frequencies, identified by a
               Hopping_Sequence_ID, used for channel hopping when
               translating the channel offset value into a frequency.

   IE (Information Element):  Type-Length-Value containers placed at the
               end of the MAC header, used to pass data between layers
               or devices.  Some IE identifiers are managed by the IEEE
               [IEEE802154].  Some IE identifiers are managed by the
               IETF [RFC8137].

   join process:  The overall process that includes the discovery of the
               network by pledge(s) and the execution of the join
               protocol.

   join protocol:  The protocol that allows the pledge to join the
               network.  The join protocol encompasses authentication,
               authorization and parameter distribution.  The join
               protocol is executed between the pledge and the JRC.

   joined node:  The new device, after having completed the join
               process, often just called a node.

   JP (Join Proxy):  Node already part of the 6TiSCH network that serves
               as a relay to provide connectivity between the pledge and

               the JRC.  The JP announces the presence of the network by
               regularly sending EB frames.

   JRC (Join Registrar/Coordinator):  Central entity responsible for the
               authentication, authorization and configuration of the
               pledge.

   link:       A communication facility or medium over which nodes can
               communicate at the Link-Layer, the layer immediately
               below IP.  In 6TiSCH, the concept is implemented as a
               collection of Layer-3 bundles.  Note: the IETF parlance
               for the term "Link" is adopted, as opposed to the IEEE
               Std 802.15.4 terminology.

   pledge:     A new device that attempts to join a 6TiSCH network.

   (to) relocate a cell:  The action operated by the 6top sublayer of
               changing the slotOffset and/or channelOffset of a soft
               cell.

   (to) schedule a cell:  The action of turning an unscheduled cell into
               a scheduled cell.

   scheduled cell:  A cell which is assigned a neighbor MAC address
               (broadcast address is also possible), and one or more of
               the following flags: TX, RX, shared, timeskeeping.  A
               scheduled cell can be used by the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH
               implementation to communicate.  A scheduled cell can
               either be a hard or a soft cell.

   SF (6top Scheduling Function):  The cell management entity that adds
               or deletes cells dynamically based on application
               networking requirements.  The cell negotiation with a
               neighbor is done using 6P.

   SFID (6top Scheduling Function Identifier):  A 4-bit field
               identifying an SF.

   shared cell:  A cell marked with both the "TX" and "shared" flags.
               This cell can be used by more than one transmitter node.
               A back-off algorithm is used to resolve contention.

   slotframe:  A collection of timeslots repeating in time, analogous to
               a superframe in that it defines periods of communication
               opportunities.  It is characterized by a slotframe_ID,
               and a slotframe_size.  Multiple slotframes can coexist in
               a node's schedule, i.e., a node can have multiple
               activities scheduled in different slotframes, based on

               the priority of its packets/traffic flows.  The timeslots
               in the Slotframe are indexed by the SlotOffset; the first
               timeslot is at SlotOffset 0.

   slotOffset: A column in the TSCH schedule, i.e. the number of
               timeslots since the beginning of the current iteration of
               the slotframe.

   soft cell:  A scheduled cell which the 6top sublayer can relocate.

   time source neighbor:  A neighbor that a node uses as its time
               reference, and to which it needs to keep its clock
               synchronized.

   timeslot:   A basic communication unit in TSCH which allows a
               transmitter node to send a frame to a receiver neighbor,
               and that receiver neighbor to optionally send back an
               acknowledgment.

   Track:      A Track is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that is used as
               a complex multi-hop path to the destination(s) of the
               path.  In the case of unicast traffic, the Track is a
               Destination Oriented DAG (DODAG) where the root of the
               DODAG is the destination of the unicast traffic.  A Track
               enables replication, elimination and reordering functions
               on the way (more on those functions in the Deterministic
               Networking Architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]).
               A Track reservation locks physical resources such as
               cells and buffers in every node along the DODAG.  A Track
               is associated with a owner that can be for instance the
               destination of the Track.

   TrackID:    A TrackID is either globally unique, or locally unique to
               the Track owner, in which case the identification of the
               owner must be provided together with the TrackID to
               provide a full reference to the Track.  If the Track
               owner is the destination of the Track then the
               destination IP address of packets along the Track can be
               used as identification of the owner and a local
               InstanceID [RFC6550] can be used as TrackID.  In that
               case, a RPL Packet Information [RFC6550] in an IPv6
               packet can unambiguously identify the Track and can be
               expressed in a compressed form using [RFC8138].

   TSCH:       A medium access mode of the IEEE Std 802.15.4
               [IEEE802154] standard which uses time synchronization to
               achieve ultra-low-power operation, and channel hopping to
               enable high reliability.

   TSCH Schedule:  A matrix of cells, each cell indexed by a slotOffset
               and a channelOffset.  The TSCH schedule contains all the
               scheduled cells from all slotframes and is sufficient to
               qualify the communication in the TSCH network.  The
               number of channelOffset values (the "height" of the
               matrix) is equal to the number of available frequencies.

   Unscheduled Cell:  A cell which is not used by the IEEE Std 802.15.4
               TSCH implementation.

3.1.  A Non-Broadcast Multi-Access Radio Mesh Network

   A 6TiSCH network is an IPv6 [RFC8200] subnet which, in its basic
   configuration illustrated in Figure 1, is a single Low-Power Lossy
   Network (LLN) operating over a synchronized TSCH-based mesh.

             Figure 1: Basic Configuration of a 6TiSCH Network

   Inside a 6TiSCH LLN, nodes rely on 6LoWPAN Header Compression
   (6LoWPAN HC) [RFC6282] to encode IPv6 packets.  From the perspective
   of the network layer, a single LLN interface (typically an IEEE Std
   802.15.4-compliant radio) may be seen as a collection of Links with
   different capabilities for unicast or multicast services.

   In a mesh network, 6TiSCH nodes are not necessarily reachable from
   one another at Layer-2 and an LLN may span over multiple links.

   This forms an homogeneous non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA) subnet,
   which is beyond the scope of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND)
   [RFC4861][RFC4862].  Extensions to IPv6 ND were introduced with
   6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (6LoWPAN ND) [RFC6775][RFC8505].  Within
   an NBMA subnet, 6LoWPAN ND enables an address registration to avoid
   address duplication, and RPL [RFC6550] enables routing in the so-

   called Route Over fashion, either in storing (stateful) or non-
   storing (stateless, with routing headers) mode.

   6TiSCH nodes join the mesh by attaching to nodes that are already
   members of the mesh.  Some nodes act as routers for 6LoWPAN ND and
   RPL operations, as detailed in Section 4.1.  Security aspects of the
   join process by which a device obtains access to the network are
   discussed in Section 6.

   With TSCH, devices are time-synchronized at the MAC level.  The use
   of a particular RPL Instance for time synchronization is discussed in
   Section 4.3.4.  With this mechanism, the time synchronization starts
   at the RPL root and follows the RPL loopless routing topology.

   RPL forms Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs)
   within Instances of the protocol, each Instance being associated with
   an Objective Function (OF) to form a routing topology.  A particular
   6TiSCH node, the LLN Border Router (6LBR), acts as RPL root, 6LoWPAN
   HC terminator, and Border Router for the LLN to the outside.  The
   6LBR is usually powered.  More on RPL Instances can be found in
   section 3.1 of RPL [RFC6550], in particular "3.1.2.  RPL Identifiers"
   and "3.1.3.  Instances, DODAGs, and DODAG Versions".  RPL adds
   artifacts in the data packets that are compressed with a 6LoWPAN
   addition 6LoRH [RFC8138].

   Additional routing and scheduling protocols may be deployed to
   establish on-demand Peer-to-Peer routes with particular
   characteristics inside the 6TiSCH network.  This may be achieved in a
   centralized fashion by a PCE [PCE] that programs both the routes and
   the schedules inside the 6TiSCH nodes, or by in a distributed fashion
   using a reactive routing protocol and a Hop-by-Hop scheduling
   protocol.

   This architecture expects that a 6LoWPAN node can connect as a leaf
   to a RPL network, where the leaf support is the minimal functionality
   to connect as a host to a RPL network without the need to participate
   to the full routing protocol.  The architecture also expects that a
   6LoWPAN node that is not aware at all of the RPL protocol may also
   connect as described in [I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves].

3.2.  A Multi-Link Subnet Model

   An extended configuration of the subnet comprises multiple LLNs as
   illustrated in Figure 2.  In the extended configuration, a Routing
   Registrar [RFC8505] may be connected to the node that acts as RPL
   root and / or 6LoWPAN 6LBR and provides connectivity to the larger
   campus / factory plant network over a high-speed backbone or a back-
   haul link.  The Routing registrar may perform IPv6 ND proxy

   operations, or redistribute the registration in a routing protocol
   such as OSPF [RFC5340] or BGP [RFC2545], or inject a route in a
   mobility protocol such as MIPv6 [RFC6275], NEMO [RFC3963], or LISP
   [RFC6830].

   Multiple LLNs can be interconnected and possibly synchronized over a
   backbone, which can be wired or wireless.  The backbone can operate
   with IPv6 ND [RFC4861][RFC4862] procedures or an hybrid of IPv6 ND
   and 6LoWPAN ND [RFC6775] [RFC8505].

           Figure 2: Extended Configuration of a 6TiSCH Network

   A Routing Registrar that performs proxy IPv6 ND operations over the
   backbone on behalf of the 6TiSCH nodes is called a Backbone Router
   (6BBR) [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router].  The 6BBRs are placed along
   the wireless edge of a Backbone, and federate multiple wireless links
   to form a single MultiLink Subnet.  The 6BBRs synchronize with one
   another over the backbone, so as to ensure that the multiple LLNs
   that form the IPv6 subnet stay tightly synchronized.

   The use of multicast can also be reduced on the backbone with a
   registrar that would contribute to Duplicate Address Detection as
   well as Address Lookup using only unicast request/response exchanges.
   [I-D.thubert-6lo-unicast-lookup] is a proposed method that presents
   an example of how to this could be achieved with an extension of
   [RFC8505], using a 6LBR as a SubNet-level registrar.

   As detailed in Section 4.1 the 6LBR that serves the LLN and the root
   of the RPL network need to share information about the devices that
   are learned through either protocol but not both.  The preferred way



Thubert                 Expires December 26, 2019              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   of achieving this is to collocate/combine them.  The combined RPL
   root and 6LBR may be collocated with the 6BBR, or directly attached
   to the 6BBR.  In the latter case, it leverages the extended
   registration process defined in [RFC8505] to proxy the 6LoWPAN ND
   registration to the 6BBR on behalf of the LLN nodes, so that the 6BBR
   may in turn perform proxy classical ND operations over the backbone.

   The DetNet Architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] studies
   Layer-3 aspects of Deterministic Networks, and covers networks that
   span multiple Layer-2 domains.  If the Backbone is Deterministic
   (such as defined by the Time Sensitive Networking WG at IEEE), then
   the Backbone Router ensures that the end-to-end deterministic
   behavior is maintained between the LLN and the backbone.

3.3.  TSCH: A Deterministic MAC Layer

   Though at a different time scale (several orders of magnitude), both
   IEEE Std 802.1TSN and IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH standards provide
   Deterministic capabilities to the point that a packet that pertains
   to a certain flow may traverse a network from node to node following
   a precise schedule, as a train that enters and then leaves
   intermediate stations at precise times along its path.

   With TSCH, time is formatted into timeslots, and individual
   communication cells are allocated to unicast or broadcast
   communication at the MAC level.  The time-slotted operation reduces
   collisions, saves energy, and enables to more closely engineer the
   network for deterministic properties.  The channel hopping aspect is
   a simple and efficient technique to combat multipath fading and co-
   channel interference.

   6TiSCH builds on the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC and inherits its
   advanced capabilities to enable them in multiple environments where
   they can be leveraged to improve automated operations.  The 6TiSCH
   Architecture also inherits the capability to perform a centralized
   route computation to achieve deterministic properties, though it
   relies on the IETF DetNet Architecture
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], and IETF components such as the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) [PCE], for the protocol aspects.

   On top of this inheritance, 6TiSCH adds capabilities for distributed
   routing and scheduling operations based on the RPL routing protocol
   and capabilities to negotiate schedule adjustments between peers.
   These distributed routing and scheduling operations simplify the
   deployment of TSCH networks and enable wireless solutions in a larger
   variety of use cases from operational technology in general.
   Examples of such use-cases in industrial environments include plant
   setup and decommissioning, as well as monitoring of lots of lesser

   importance measurements such as corrosion and events and mobile
   workers accessing local devices.

3.4.  Scheduling TSCH

   A scheduling operation attributes cells in a Time-Division-
   Multiplexing (TDM) / Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) matrix
   called the Channel distribution/usage (CDU) to either individual
   transmissions or as multi-access shared resources.  The CDU matrix
   can be formatted in chunks that can be allocated exclusively to
   particular nodes to enable distributed scheduling without collision.
   More in Section 4.3.5.

   From the standpoint of a 6TiSCH node (at the MAC layer), its schedule
   is the collection of the timeslots at which it must wake up for
   transmission, and the channels to which it should either send or
   listen at those times.  The schedule is expressed as one or more
   slotframes that repeat over and over.  Slotframes may collide and
   require a device to wake up at a same time, in which case the
   slotframe with the highest priority is actionable.

   The 6top sublayer (see Section 4.3 for more) hides the complexity of
   the schedule from the upper layers.  The Link abstraction that IP
   traffic utilizes is composed of a pair of Layer-3 cell bundles, one
   to receive and one to transmit.  Some of the cells may be shared, in
   which case the 6top sublayer must perform some arbitration.

   Scheduling enables multiple communications at a same time in a same
   interference domain using different channels; but a node equipped
   with a single radio can only either transmit or receive on one
   channel at any point of time.  Scheduled cells that play an equal
   role, e.g., receive IP packets from a peer, are grouped in bundles.

   The 6TiSCH architecture identifies four ways a schedule can be
   managed and CDU cells can be allocated: Static Scheduling, Neighbor-
   to-Neighbor Scheduling, Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management,
   and Hop-by-hop Scheduling.

   Static Scheduling:  This refers to the minimal 6TiSCH operation
      whereby a static schedule is configured for the whole network for
      use in a slotted-Aloha fashion.  The static schedule is
      distributed through the native methods in the TSCH MAC layer and
      does not preclude other scheduling operations to co-exist on a
      same 6TiSCH network.  A static schedule is necessary for basic
      operations such as the join process and for interoperability
      during the network formation, which is specified as part of the
      Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration [RFC8180].

      adaptation of the bandwidth of the Links that are used for IPv6
      traffic between adjacent routers.  Scheduling Functions such as

      [I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf] influence the operation of the MAC layer to
      add, update and remove cells in its own, and its peer's schedules
      using 6P [RFC8480], for the negotiation of the MAC resources.

   Centralized (or Remote) Monitoring and Schedule Management:  This
      refers to the central computation of a schedule and the capability
      to forward a frame based on the cell of arrival.  In that case,
      the related portion of the device schedule as well as other device
      resources are managed by an abstract Network Management Entity
      (NME), which may cooperate with the PCE to minimize the
      interaction with and the load on the constrained device.  This
      model is the TSCH adaption of the "DetNet Architecture"
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], and it enables Traffic Engineering
      with deterministic properties.

   Hop-by-hop Scheduling:  This refers to the possibility to reserves
      cells along a path for a particular flow using a distributed
      mechanism.

   It is not expected that all use cases will require all those
   mechanisms.  Static Scheduling with minimal configuration one is the
   only one that is expected in all implementations, since it provides a
   simple and solid basis for convergecast routing and time
   distribution.

   A deeper dive in those mechanisms can be found in Section 4.5.

3.5.  Distributed vs. Centralized Routing

   6TiSCH enables a mixed model of centralized routes and distributed
   routes.  Centralized routes can for example be computed by an entity
   such as a PCE.  6TiSCH leverages the RPL [RFC6550] routing protocol
   for interoperable distributed routing operations.

   Both methods may inject routes in the Routing Tables of the 6TiSCH
   routers.  In either case, each route is associated with a 6TiSCH
   topology that can be a RPL Instance topology or a Track.  The 6TiSCH
   topology is indexed by a Instance ID, in a format that reuses the
   RPLInstanceID as defined in RPL.

   RPL [RFC6550]is applicable to Static Scheduling and Neighbor-to-
   Neighbor Scheduling.  The architecture also supports a centralized
   routing model for Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management.  It is
   expected that a routing protocol that is more optimized for point-to-

   point routing than RPL [RFC6550], such as the "Asymmetric AODV-P2P-
   RPL in Low-Power and Lossy Networks" [I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl] (AODV-
   RPL), which derives from the Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing
   (AODV) [I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2] will be selected for Hop-by-hop
   Scheduling.

   Both RPL and PCE rely on shared sources such as policies to define
   Global and Local RPLInstanceIDs that can be used by either method.
   It is possible for centralized and distributed routing to share a
   same topology.  Generally they will operate in different slotFrames,
   and centralized routes will be used for scheduled traffic and will
   have precedence over distributed routes in case of conflict between
   the slotFrames.

3.6.  Forwarding Over TSCH

   The 6TiSCH architecture supports three different forwarding models.
   One is the classical IPv6 Forwarding, where the node selects a
   feasible successor at Layer-3 on a per packet basis and based on its
   routing table.  The second derives from Generic MPLS (G-MPLS) for so-
   called Track Forwarding, whereby a frame received at a particular
   timeslot can be switched into another timeslot at Layer-2 without
   regard to the upper layer protocol.  The third model is the 6LoWPAN
   Fragment Forwarding, which allows to forward individual 6loWPAN
   fragments along a route that is setup by the first fragment.

   In more details:

   IPv6 Forwarding:  This is the classical IP forwarding model, with a
      Routing Information Based (RIB) that is installed by the RPL
      routing protocol and used to select a feasible successor per
      packet.  The packet is placed on an outgoing Link, that the 6top
      layer maps into a (Layer-3) bundle of cells, and scheduled for
      transmission based on QoS parameters.  Besides RPL, this model
      also applies to any routing protocol which may be operated in the
      6TiSCH network, and corresponds to all the distributed scheduling
      models, Static, Neighbor-to-Neighbor and Hop-by-Hop Scheduling.

   G-MPLS Track Forwarding:  This model corresponds to the Remote
      Monitoring and Schedule Management.  In this model, A central
      controller (hosting a PCE) computes and installs the schedules in
      the devices per flow.  The incoming (Layer-2) bundle of cells from
      the previous node along the path determines the outgoing (Layer-2)
      bundle towards the next hop for that flow as determined by the
      PCE.  The programmed sequence for bundles is called a Track and
      can assume DAG shapes that are more complex than a simple direct
      sequence of nodes.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding:  This is an hybrid model that derives
      from IPv6 forwarding for the case where packets must be fragmented
      at the 6LoWPAN sublayer.  The first fragment is forwarded like any
      IPv6 packet and leaves a state in the intermediate hops to enable
      forwarding of the next fragments that do not have a IP header
      without the need to recompose the packet at every hop.

   A deeper dive on these operations can be found in Section 4.7.

   The following table summarizes how the forwarding models apply to the
   various routing and scheduling possibilities:

3.7.  6TiSCH Stack

   The IETF proposes multiple techniques for implementing functions
   related to routing, transport or security.

   The 6TiSCH architecture limits the possible variations of the stack
   and recommends a number of base elements for LLN applications to
   control the complexity of possible deployments and device
   interactions, and to limit the size of the resulting object code.  In
   particular, UDP [RFC0768], IPv6 [RFC8200] and the Constrained
   Application Protocol [RFC7252] (CoAP) are used as the transport /
   binding of choice for applications and management as opposed to TCP
   and HTTP.

   The resulting protocol stack is represented in Figure 4:

                      Figure 4: 6TiSCH Protocol Stack

   RPL is the routing protocol of choice for LLNs.  So far, there was no
   identified need to define a 6TiSCH specific Objective Function.  The
   Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration [RFC8180] describes the operation of RPL
   over a static schedule used in a slotted aloha fashion, whereby all
   active slots may be used for emission or reception of both unicast
   and multicast frames.

   The 6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282] is used to compress the IPv6
   and UDP headers, whereas the 6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH) [RFC8138]
   is used to compress the RPL artifacts in the IPv6 data packets,
   including the RPL Packet Information (RPI), the IP-in-IP
   encapsulation to/from the RPL root, and the Source Route Header (SRH)
   in non-storing mode.  "When to use RFC 6553, 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6"
   [I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo] provides the details on when headers or
   encapsulation are needed.

   The Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security], is leveraged by the Constrained Join
   Protocol (CoJP) and is expected to be the primary protocol for the
   protection of the application payload as well.  The application
   payload may also be protected by the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] sitting either under CoAP or over CoAP so
   it can traverse proxies.

   An overview of the initial steps of a device in a network can be
   found in Section 4.2.1; the security aspects of the join process are
   further detailed in Section 6.

   The 6TiSCH Operation sublayer (6top) is a sublayer of a Logical Link
   Control (LLC) that provides the abstraction of an IP link over a TSCH
   MAC and schedules packets over TSCH cells, as further discussed in
   the next sections, providing in particular dynamic cell allocation
   with the 6top Protocol (6P) [RFC8480].

   The reference stack that the 6TiSCH architecture presents was
   implemented and interop tested by a conjunction of opensource, IETF
   and ETSI efforts.  One goal is to help other bodies to adopt the
   stack as a whole, making the effort to move to an IPv6-based IoT
   stack easier.

   For a particular environment, some of the choices that are made in
   this architecture may not be relevant.  For instance, RPL is not
   required for star topologies and mesh-under Layer-2 routed networks,
   and the 6LoWPAN compression may not be sufficient for ultra-
   constrained cases such as some Low-Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks.
   In such cases, it is perfectly doable to adopt a subset of the
   selection that is presented hereafter and then select alternate
   components to complete the solution wherever needed.

4.  Architecture Components

4.1.  6LoWPAN (and RPL)

   A RPL DODAG is formed of a root, a collection of routers, and leaves
   that are hosts.  Hosts are nodes which do not forward packets that
   they did not generate.  RPL-aware leaves will participate to RPL to
   advertise their own addresses, whereas RPL-unaware leaves depend on a
   connected RPL router to do so.  RPL interacts with 6LoWPAN ND at
   multiple levels, in particular at the root and in the RPL-unaware
   leaves.

4.1.1.  RPL-Unaware Leaves and 6LoWPAN ND

   RPL needs a set of information to advertise a leaf node through a DAO
   message and establish reachability.

   "Routing for RPL Leaves" [I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves] details the
   basic interaction of 6LoWPAN ND and RPL and enables a plain 6LN that
   supports [RFC8505] to obtain return connectivity via the RPL network
   as an RPL-unaware leaf.  The leaf indicates that it requires
   reachability services for the Registered Address from a Routing
   Registrar by settig a 'R' flag in the Extended Address Registration
   Option [RFC8505], and it provides a TID that maps to a sequence
   number in section 7 of RPL [RFC6550].





Thubert                 Expires December 26, 2019              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   The RPL InstanceID that the leaf wants to participate to may be
   signaled in the Opaque field of the EARO.  On the backbone, the
   InstanceID is expected to be mapped to an overlay that matches the
   RPL Instance, e.g., a Virtual LAN (VLAN) or a virtual routing and
   forwarding (VRF) instance.

   Though at the time of this writing the above specification enables a
   model where the separation is possible, this architecture recommends
   to collocate the functions of 6LBR and RPL root.

4.1.2.  RPL Root And 6LBR

   With the 6LowPAN ND [RFC6775], information on the 6LBR is
   disseminated via an Authoritative Border Router Option (ABRO) in RA
   messages.  [RFC8505] extends [RFC6775] to enable a registration for
   routing and proxy ND.  The capability to support [RFC8505] is
   indicated in the 6LoWPAN Capability Indication Option (6CIO).  The
   discovery and liveliness of the RPL root are obtained through RPL
   [RFC6550] itself.

   When 6LoWPAN ND is coupled with RPL, the 6LBR and RPL root
   functionalities are co-located in order that the address of the 6LBR
   be indicated by RPL DIO messages and to associate the unique ID from
   the EDAR/EDAC [RFC8505] exchange with the state that is maintained by
   RPL.

   Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves] details how the DAO
   messages are used to reconfirm the registration, thus eliminating a
   duplication of functionality between DAO and EDAR/EDAC messages.

   Even though the root of the RPL network is integrated with the 6LBR,
   it is logically separated from the Backbone Router (6BBR) that is
   used to connect the 6TiSCH LLN to the backbone.  This way, the root
   has all information from 6LoWPAN ND and RPL about the LLN devices
   attached to it.

   This architecture also expects that the root of the RPL network
   (proxy-)registers the 6TiSCH nodes on their behalf to the 6BBR, for
   whatever operation the 6BBR performs on the backbone, such as ND
   proxy, or redistribution in a routing protocol.  This relies on an
   extension of the 6LoWPAN ND registration described in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router].

   This model supports the movement of a 6TiSCH device across the Multi-
   Link Subnet, and allows the proxy registration of 6TiSCH nodes deep
   into the 6TiSCH LLN by the 6LBR / RPL root.  This is why in [RFC8505]
   the Registered Address is signaled in the Target Address field of the

   NS message as opposed to the IPv6 Source Address, which, in the case
   of a proxy registration, is that of the 6LBR / RPL root itself.

4.2.  Network Access and Addressing

4.2.1.  Join Process

   A new device, called the pledge, undergoes the join protocol to
   become a node in a 6TiSCH network.  This usually occurs only once
   when the device is first powered on.  The pledge communicates with
   the Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) of the network through a Join
   Proxy (JP): a radio neighbor of the pledge.

   The join protocol provides the following functionality:

   o  Mutual authentication

   o  Authorization

   o  Parameter distribution to the pledge over a secure channel

   Minimal Security Framework for 6TiSCH
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] defines the minimal mechanisms
   required for this join process to occur in a secure manner.  The
   specification defines the Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) that is
   used to distribute the parameters to the pledge over a secure session
   established through OSCORE [I-D.ietf-core-object-security], and a
   secure configuration of the network stack.  In the minimal setting
   with pre-shared keys (PSKs), CoJP allows the pledge to join after a
   single round-trip exchange with the JRC.  The provisioning of the PSK
   to the pledge and the JRC needs to be done out of band, through a
   'one-touch' bootstrapping process, which effectively enrolls the
   pledge into the domain managed by the JRC.

   In certain use cases, the 'one touch' bootstrapping is not feasible
   due to the operational constraints and the enrollment of the pledge
   into the domain needs to occur in-band.  This is handled through a
   'zero-touch' extension of the Minimal Security Framework for 6TiSCH.
   Zero touch [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join] extension
   leverages the 'Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures
   (BRSKI)' [[I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] work to establish a
   shared secret between a pledge and the JRC without necessarily having
   them belong to a common (security) domain at join time.  This happens
   through inter-domain communication occurring between the JRC of the
   network and the domain of the pledge, represented by a fourth entity,
   Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).  Once the zero-
   touch exchange completes, the CoJP exchange defined in

   established between the pledge and the JRC.

4.2.2.  Registration

   Once the pledge successfully completes the CoJP protocol and becomes
   a network node, it obtains the network prefix from neighboring
   routers and registers its IPv6 addresses.  As detailed in
   Section 4.1, the combined 6LoWPAN ND 6LBR and root of the RPL network
   learn information such as the device Unique ID (from 6LoWPAN ND) and
   the updated Sequence Number (from RPL), and perform 6LoWPAN ND proxy
   registration to the 6BBR of behalf of the LLN nodes.

   Figure 6 illustrates the initial IPv6 signaling that enables a 6LN to
   form a global address and register it to a 6LBR using 6LoWPAN ND
   [RFC8505], is then carried over RPL to the RPL root, and then to the
   6BBR.

   As the network builds up, a node should start as a leaf to join the
   RPL network, and may later turn into both a RPL-capable router and a
   6LR, so as to accept leaf nodes to recursively join the network.

4.3.  TSCH and 6top

4.3.1.  6top

   6TiSCH expects a high degree of scalability together with a
   distributed routing functionality based on RPL.  To achieve this
   goal, the spectrum must be allocated in a way that allows for spatial
   reuse between zones that will not interfere with one another.  In a
   large and spatially distributed network, a 6TiSCH node is often in a
   good position to determine usage of the spectrum in its vicinity.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   With 6TiSCH, the abstraction of an IPv6 link is implemented as a pair
   of bundles of cells, one in each direction.  IP Links are only
   enabled between RPL parents and children.  The 6TiSCH operation is
   optimal when the size of a bundle is such that both the energy wasted
   in idle listening and the packet drops due to congestion loss are
   minimized, while packets are forwarded within an acceptable latency.

   Use cases for distributed routing are often associated with a
   statistical distribution of best-effort traffic with variable needs
   for bandwidth on each individual link.  The 6TiSCH operation can
   remain optimal if RPL parents can adjust dynamically, and with enough
   reactivity to match the variations of best-effort traffic, the amount
   of bandwidth that is used to communicate between themselves and their
   children, in both directions.  In turn, the agility to fulfill the
   needs for additional cells improves when the number of interactions
   with other devices and the protocol latencies are minimized.

   6top is a logical link control sitting between the IP layer and the
   TSCH MAC layer, which provides the link abstraction that is required
   for IP operations.  The 6top protocol, 6P, which is specified in
   [RFC8480], is one of the services provided by 6top.  In particular,
   the 6top services are available over a management API that enables an
   external management entity to schedule cells and slotFrames, and
   allows the addition of complementary functionality, for instance a
   Scheduling Function that manages a dynamic schedule management based
   on observed resource usage as discussed in Section 4.5.2.

4.3.1.1.  Hard Cells

   The architecture defines "soft" cells and "hard" cells.  "Hard" cells
   are owned and managed by an separate scheduling entity (e.g. a PCE)
   that specifies the slotOffset/channelOffset of the cells to be
   added/moved/deleted, in which case 6top can only act as instructed,
   and may not move hard cells in the TSCH schedule on its own.

4.3.1.2.  Soft Cells

   6top contains a monitoring process which monitors the performance of
   cells, and can move a cell in the TSCH schedule when it performs
   poorly.  This is only applicable to cells which are marked as "soft".
   To reserve a soft cell, the higher layer does not indicate the exact
   slotOffset/channelOffset of the cell to add, but rather the resulting
   bandwidth and QoS requirements.  When the monitoring process triggers
   a cell reallocation, the two neighbor devices communicating over this
   cell negotiate its new position in the TSCH schedule.

4.3.2.  Scheduling Functions and the 6top protocol

   In the case of soft cells, the cell management entity that controls
   the dynamic attribution of cells to adapt to the dynamics of variable
   rate flows is called a Scheduling Function (SF).

   There may be multiple SFs with more or less aggressive reaction to
   the dynamics of the network.

   An SF may be seen as divided between an upper bandwidth adaptation
   logic that is not aware of the particular technology that is used to
   obtain and release bandwidth, and an underlying service that maps
   those needs in the actual technology, which means mapping the
   bandwidth onto cells in the case of TSCH using the 6top protocol as
   illustrated in Figure 8.

                       Figure 8: SF/6P stack in 6top

   The SF relies on 6top services that implement the 6top Protocol (6P)
   [RFC8480] to negotiate the precise cells that will be allocated or
   freed based on the schedule of the peer.  It may be for instance that
   a peer wants to use a particular time slot that is free in its
   schedule, but that timeslot is already in use by the other peer for a
   communication with a third party on a different cell. 6P enables the
   peers to find an agreement in a transactional manner that ensures the
   final consistency of the nodes state.

   MSF [I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf] is one of the possible scheduling
   functions.  MSF uses the rendez-vous slot from [RFC8180] for network
   discovery, neighbor discovery, and any other broadcast.

   For basic unicast communication with any neighbor, each node uses a
   receive cell at a well-known slotOffset/channelOffset, derived from a
   hash of their own MAC address.  Nodes can reach any neighbor by

   installing a transmit (shared) cell with slotOffset/channelOffset
   derived from the neighbor's MAC address.

   For child-parent links, MSF continuously monitors the load to/from
   parents and children.  It then uses 6P to install/remove unicast
   cells whenever the current schedule appears to be under-/over-
   provisioned.

4.3.3.  6top and RPL Objective Function operations

   An implementation of a RPL [RFC6550] Objective Function (OF), such as
   the RPL Objective Function Zero (OF0) [RFC6552] that is used in the
   Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration [RFC8180] to support RPL over a static
   schedule, may leverage, for its internal computation, the information
   maintained by 6top.

   An OF may require metrics about reachability, such as the ETX.  6top
   creates and maintains an abstract neighbor table, and this state may
   be leveraged to feed an OF and/or store OF information as well.  A
   neighbor table entry may contain a set of statistics with respect to
   that specific neighbor.

   The neighbor information may include the time when the last packet
   has been received from that neighbor, a set of cell quality metrics
   (e.g.  RSSI or LQI), the number of packets sent to the neighbor or
   the number of packets received from it.  This information can be made
   available through 6top management APIs and used for instance to
   compute a Rank Increment that will determine the selection of the
   preferred parent.

   6top provides statistics about the underlying layer so the OF can be
   tuned to the nature of the TSCH MAC layer. 6top also enables the RPL
   OF to influence the MAC behaviour, for instance by configuring the
   periodicity of IEEE Std 802.15.4 Extended Beacons (EBs).  By
   augmenting the EB periodicity, it is possible to change the network
   dynamics so as to improve the support of devices that may change
   their point of attachment in the 6TiSCH network.

   Some RPL control messages, such as the DODAG Information Object (DIO)
   are ICMPv6 messages that are broadcast to all neighbor nodes.  With
   6TiSCH, the broadcast channel requirement is addressed by 6top by
   configuring TSCH to provide a broadcast channel, as opposed to, for
   instance, piggybacking the DIO messages in Layer-2 Enhanced Beacons
   (EBs), which would produce undue timer coupling among layers, packet
   size issues and could conflict with the policy of production networks
   where EBs are mostly eliminated to conserve energy.

4.3.4.  Network Synchronization

   Nodes in a TSCH network must be time synchronized.  A node keeps
   synchronized to its time source neighbor through a combination of
   frame-based and acknowledgment-based synchronization.  To maximize
   battery life and network throughput, it is advisable that RPL ICMP
   discovery and maintenance traffic (governed by the trickle timer) be
   somehow coordinated with the transmission of time synchronization
   packets (especially with enhanced beacons).

   This could be achieved through an interaction of the 6top sublayer
   and the RPL objective Function, or could be controlled by a
   management entity.

   Time distribution requires a loop-free structure.  Nodes taken in a
   synchronization loop will rapidly desynchronize from the network and
   become isolated.  It is expected that a RPL DAG with a dedicated
   global Instance is deployed for the purpose of time synchronization.
   That Instance is referred to as the Time Synchronization Global
   Instance (TSGI).  The TSGI can be operated in either of the 3 modes
   that are detailed in section 3.1.3 of RPL [RFC6550], "Instances,
   DODAGs, and DODAG Versions".  Multiple uncoordinated DODAGs with
   independent roots may be used if all the roots share a common time
   source such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).

   In the absence of a common time source, the TSGI should form a single
   DODAG with a virtual root.  A backbone network is then used to
   synchronize and coordinate RPL operations between the backbone
   routers that act as sinks for the LLN.  Optionally, RPL's periodic
   operations may be used to transport the network synchronization.
   This may mean that 6top would need to trigger (override) the trickle
   timer if no other traffic has occurred for such a time that nodes may
   get out of synchronization.

   A node that has not joined the TSGI advertises a MAC level Join
   Priority of 0xFF to notify its neighbors that is not capable of
   serving as time parent.  A node that has joined the TSGI advertises a
   MAC level Join Priority set to its DAGRank() in that Instance, where
   DAGRank() is the operation specified in section 3.5.1 of [RFC6550],
   "Rank Comparison".

   A root is configured or obtains by some external means the knowledge
   of the RPLInstanceID for the TSGI.  The root advertises its DagRank
   in the TSGI, that must be less than 0xFF, as its Join Priority in its
   IEEE Std 802.15.4 Extended Beacons (EB).  We'll note that the Join
   Priority is now specified between 0 and 0x3F leaving 2 bits in the
   octet unused in the IEEE Std 802.15.4e specification.  After

   consultation with IEEE authors, it was asserted that 6TiSCH can make
   a full use of the octet to carry an integer value up to 0xFF.

   A node that reads a Join Priority of less than 0xFF should join the
   neighbor with the lesser Join Priority and use it as time parent.  If
   the node is configured to serve as time parent, then the node should
   join the TSGI, obtain a Rank in that Instance and start advertising
   its own DagRank in the TSGI as its Join Priority in its EBs.

4.3.5.  SlotFrames and CDU matrix

   6TiSCH enables IPv6 best effort (stochastic) transmissions over a MAC
   layer that is also capable of scheduled (deterministic)
   transmissions.  A window of time is defined around the scheduled
   transmission where the medium must, as much as practically feasible,
   be free of contending energy to ensure that the medium is free of
   contending packets when time comes for a scheduled transmission.  One
   simple way to obtain such a window is to format time and frequencies
   in cells of transmission of equal duration.  This is the method that
   is adopted in IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH as well as the Long Term
   Evolution (LTE) of cellular networks.

   The 6TiSCH architecture defines a global concept that is called a
   Channel Distribution and Usage (CDU) matrix to describe that
   formatting of time and frequencies,

   A CDU matrix is defined centrally as part of the network definition.
   It is a matrix of cells with an height equal to the number of
   available channels (indexed by ChannelOffsets) and a width (in
   timeslots) that is the period of the network scheduling operation
   (indexed by slotOffsets) for that CDU matrix.  There are different
   models for scheduling the usage of the cells, which place the
   responsibility of avoiding collisions either on a central controller
   or on the devices themselves, at an extra cost in terms of energy to
   scan for free cells (more in Section 4.5).

   The size of a cell is a timeslot duration, and values of 10 to 15
   milliseconds are typical in 802.15.4 TSCH to accommodate for the
   transmission of a frame and an ack, including the security validation
   on the receive side which may take up to a few milliseconds on some
   device architecture.

   A CDU matrix iterates over and over with a well-known channel
   rotation called the hopping sequence.  In a given network, there
   might be multiple CDU matrices that operate with different width, so
   they have different durations and represent different periodic
   operations.  It is recommended that all CDU matrices in a 6TiSCH
   domain operate with the same cell duration and are aligned, so as to

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   reduce the chances of interferences from slotted-aloha operations.
   The knowledge of the CDU matrices is shared between all the nodes and
   used in particular to define slotFrames.

   A slotFrame is a MAC-level abstraction that is common to all nodes
   and contains a series of timeslots of equal length and precedence.
   It is characterized by a slotFrame_ID, and a slotFrame_size.  A
   slotFrame aligns to a CDU matrix for its parameters, such as number
   and duration of timeslots.

   Multiple slotFrames can coexist in a node schedule, i.e., a node can
   have multiple activities scheduled in different slotFrames.  A
   slotframe is associated with a priority that may be related to the
   precedence of different 6TiSCH topologies.  The slotFrames may be
   aligned to different CDU matrices and thus have different width.
   There is typically one slotFrame for scheduled traffic that has the
   highest precedence and one or more slotFrame(s) for RPL traffic.  The
   timeslots in the slotFrame are indexed by the SlotOffset; the first
   cell is at SlotOffset 0.

   When a packet is received from a higher layer for transmission, 6top
   inserts that packet in the outgoing queue which matches the packet
   best (Differentiated Services [RFC2474] can therefore be used).  At
   each scheduled transmit slot, 6top looks for the frame in all the
   outgoing queues that best matches the cells.  If a frame is found, it
   is given to the TSCH MAC for transmission.

4.3.6.  Distributing the reservation of cells

   The 6TiSCH architecture introduces the concept of chunks
   (Section 2.1) to distribute the allocation of the spectrum for a
   whole group of cells at a time.  The CDU matrix is formatted into a
   set of chunks, possibly as illustrated in Figure 9, each of the
   chunks identified uniquely by a chunk-ID.  The knowledge of this
   formatting is shared between all the nodes in a 6TiSCH network.

                Figure 9: CDU matrix Partitioning in Chunks

   The 6TiSCH Architecture expects that a future protocol will enable a
   chunk ownership appropriation whereby a RPL parent discovers a chunk
   that is not used in its interference domain, claims the chunk, and
   then defends it in case another RPL parent would attempt to
   appropriate it while it is in use.  The chunk is the basic unit of
   ownership that is used in that process.

   As a result of the process of chunk ownership appropriation, the RPL
   parent has exclusive authority to decide which cell in the
   appropriated chunk can be used by which node in its interference
   domain.  In other words, it is implicitly delegated the right to
   manage the portion of the CDU matrix that is represented by the
   chunk.

   Initially, those cells are added to the heap of free cells, then
   dynamically placed into existing bundles, in new bundles, or
   allocated opportunistically for one transmission.

   Note that a PCE is expected to have precedence in the allocation, so
   that a RPL parent would only be able to obtain portions that are not
   in-use by the PCE.

4.4.  Communication Paradigms and Interaction Models

   Section 2.1 provides the terms of Communication Paradigms and
   Interaction Models, which can be placed in parallel to the
   Information Models and Data Models that are defined in [RFC3444].

   A Communication Paradigms would be an abstract view of a protocol
   exchange, and would come with an Information Model for the
   information that is being exchanged.  In contrast, an Interaction
   Models would be more refined and could point on standard operation
   such as a Representational state transfer (REST) "GET" operation and

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   would match a Data Model for the data that is provided over the
   protocol exchange.

   Section 2.1.3 of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability] and
   next sections discuss application-layer paradigms, such as Source-
   sink (SS) that is a Multipeer to Multipeer (MP2MP) model primarily
   used for alarms and alerts, Publish-subscribe (PS, or pub/sub) that
   is typically used for sensor data, as well as Peer-to-peer (P2P) and
   Peer-to-multipeer (P2MP) communications.  Additional considerations
   on Duocast and its N-cast generalization are also provided.  Those
   paradigms are frequently used in industrial automation, which is a
   major use case for IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH wireless networks with
   [ISA100.11a] and [WirelessHART], that provides a wireless access to
   [HART] applications and devices.

   This specification focuses on Communication Paradigms and Interaction
   Models for packet forwarding and TSCH resources (cells) management.
   Management mechanisms for the TSCH schedule at Link-Layer (one-hop),
   Network-layer (multithop along a Track), and Application-layer
   (remote control) are discussed in Section 4.5.  Link-Layer frame
   forwarding interactions are discussed in Section 4.7, and Network-
   layer Packet routing is addressed in Section 4.8.

4.5.  Schedule Management Mechanisms

   6TiSCH uses 4 paradigms to manage the TSCH schedule of the LLN nodes:
   Static Scheduling, neighbor-to-neighbor Scheduling, remote monitoring
   and scheduling management, and Hop-by-hop scheduling.  Multiple
   mechanisms are defined that implement the associated Interaction
   Models, and can be combined and used in the same LLN.  Which
   mechanism(s) to use depends on application requirements.

4.5.1.  Static Scheduling

   In the simplest instantiation of a 6TiSCH network, a common fixed
   schedule may be shared by all nodes in the network.  Cells are
   shared, and nodes contend for slot access in a slotted aloha manner.

   A static TSCH schedule can be used to bootstrap a network, as an
   initial phase during implementation, or as a fall-back mechanism in
   case of network malfunction.  This schedule is pre-established, for
   instance decided by a network administrator based on operational
   needs.  It can be pre-configured into the nodes, or, more commonly,
   learned by a node when joining the network using standard IEEE Std
   802.15.4 Information Elements (IE).  Regardless, the schedule remains
   unchanged after the node has joined a network.  RPL is used on the
   resulting network.  This "minimal" scheduling mechanism that
   implements this paradigm is detailed in [RFC8180].

4.5.2.  Neighbor-to-neighbor Scheduling

   In the simplest instantiation of a 6TiSCH network described in
   Section 4.5.1, nodes may expect a packet at any cell in the schedule
   and will waste energy idle listening.  In a more complex
   instantiation of a 6TiSCH network, a matching portion of the schedule
   is established between peers to reflect the observed amount of
   transmissions between those nodes.  The aggregation of the cells
   between a node and a peer forms a bundle that the 6top layer uses to
   implement the abstraction of a link for IP.  The bandwidth on that
   link is proportional to the number of cells in the bundle.

   If the size of a bundle is configured to fit an average amount of
   bandwidth, peak traffic is dropped.  If the size is configured to
   allow for peak emissions, energy is be wasted idle listening.

   As discussed in more details in Section 4.3, the 6top Protocol
   [RFC8480] specifies the exchanges between neighbor nodes to reserve
   soft cells to transmit to one another, possibly under the control of
   a Scheduling Function (SF).  Because this reservation is done without
   global knowledge of the schedule of other nodes in the LLN,
   scheduling collisions are possible.

   And as discussed in Section 4.3.2, an optional Scheduling Function
   (SF) is used to monitor bandwidth usage and perform requests for
   dynamic allocation by the 6top sublayer.  The SF component is not
   part of the 6top sublayer.  It may be collocated on the same device
   or may be partially or fully offloaded to an external system.  The
   "6TiSCH Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF)" [I-D.ietf-6tisch-msf]
   provides a simple scheduling function that can be used by default by
   devices that support dynamic scheduling of soft cells.

   Monitoring and relocation is done in the 6top layer.  For the upper
   layer, the connection between two neighbor nodes appears as a number
   of cells.  Depending on traffic requirements, the upper layer can
   request 6top to add or delete a number of cells scheduled to a
   particular neighbor, without being responsible for choosing the exact
   slotOffset/channelOffset of those cells.

4.5.3.  Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management

   The work at the 6TiSCH WG is focused on non-deterministic traffic and
   does not provide the generic data model that would be necessary to
   monitor and manage resources of the 6top sublayer.  It is recognized
   that CoAP can be appropriate to interact with the 6top layer of a
   node that is multiple hops away across a 6TiSCH mesh.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   The entity issuing the CoAP requests can be a central scheduling
   entity (e.g. a PCE), a node multiple hops away with the authority to
   modify the TSCH schedule (e.g. the head of a local cluster), or a
   external device monitoring the overall state of the network (e.g.
   NME).  It is also possible that a mapping entity on the backbone
   transforms a non-CoAP protocol such as PCEP into the RESTful
   interfaces that the 6TiSCH devices support.

   With respect to Centralized routing and scheduling, it is envisioned
   that the related component of the 6TiSCH Architecture would be an
   extension of the Deterministic Networking Architecture
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], which studies Layer-3 aspects of
   Deterministic Networks, and covers networks that span multiple
   Layer-2 domains.

   The DetNet architecture is a form of Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) Architecture and is composed of three planes, a (User)
   Application Plane, a Controller Plane (where the PCE operates), and a
   Network Plane which can represent a 6TiSCH LLN.

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Layers and Architecture
   Terminology [RFC7426] proposes a generic representation of the SDN
   architecture that is reproduced in Figure 10.

   The DetNet work is expected to enable end to end Deterministic Path
   across heterogeneous network.  This can be for instance a 6TiSCH LLN
   and an Ethernet Backbone.

   This model fits the 6TiSCH extended configuration, whereby a 6BBR
   federates multiple 6TiSCH LLN in a single subnet over a backbone that
   can be, for instance, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.  In that model, 6TiSCH 6BBRs
   synchronize with one another over the backbone, so as to ensure that
   the multiple LLNs that form the IPv6 subnet stay tightly
   synchronized.

   If the Backbone is Deterministic, then the Backbone Router ensures
   that the end-to-end deterministic behavior is maintained between the
   LLN and the backbone.  It is the responsibility of the PCE to compute
   a deterministic path and to end across the TSCH network and an IEEE
   Std 802.1 TSN Ethernet backbone, and that of DetNet to enable end-to-
   end deterministic forwarding.

4.5.4.  Hop-by-hop Scheduling

   A node can reserve a Track (Section 4.6) to one or more
   destination(s) that are multiple hops away by installing soft cells
   at each intermediate node.  This forms a Track of soft cells.  A
   Track Scheduling Function above the 6top sublayer of each node on the
   Track is needed to monitor these soft cells and trigger relocation
   when needed.

   This hop-by-hop reservation mechanism is expected to be similar in
   essence to [RFC3209] and/or [RFC4080]/[RFC5974].  The protocol for a
   node to trigger hop-by-hop scheduling is not yet defined.

4.6.  On Tracks

   The architecture introduces the concept of a Track, which is a
   directed path from a source 6TiSCH node to one or more destination(s)
   6TiSCH node(s) across a 6TiSCH LLN.

   A Track is the 6TiSCH instantiation of the concept of a Deterministic
   Path as described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  Constrained
   resources such as memory buffers are reserved for that Track in
   intermediate 6TiSCH nodes to avoid loss related to limited capacity.
   A 6TiSCH node along a Track not only knows which bundles of cells it
   should use to receive packets from a previous hop, but also knows
   which bundle(s) it should use to send packets to its next hop along
   the Track.

4.6.1.  General Behavior of Tracks

   A Track is associated with Layer-2 bundles of cells with related
   schedules and logical relationships and that ensure that a packet
   that is injected in a Track will progress in due time all the way to
   destination.

   Multiple cells may be scheduled in a Track for the transmission of a
   single packet, in which case the normal operation of IEEE Std
   802.15.4 Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) can take place; the
   acknowledgment may be omitted in some cases, for instance if there is
   no scheduled cell for a possible retry.

   There are several benefits for using a Track to forward a packet from
   a source node to the destination node.

   1.  Track forwarding, as further described in Section 4.7.1, is a
       Layer-2 forwarding scheme, which introduces less process delay
       and overhead than Layer-3 forwarding scheme.  Therefore, LLN
       Devices can save more energy and resource, which is critical for
       resource constrained devices.

   2.  Since channel resources, i.e. bundles of cells, have been
       reserved for communications between 6TiSCH nodes of each hop on
       the Track, the throughput and the maximum latency of the traffic
       along a Track are guaranteed and the jitter is maintained small.

   3.  By knowing the scheduled time slots of incoming bundle(s) and
       outgoing bundle(s), 6TiSCH nodes on a Track could save more
       energy by staying in sleep state during in-active slots.

   4.  Tracks are protected from interfering with one another if a cell
       belongs to at most one Track, and congestion loss is avoided if
       at most one packet can be presented to the MAC to use that cell.
       Tracks enhance the reliability of transmissions and thus further
       improve the energy consumption in LLN Devices by reducing the
       chances of retransmission.

4.6.2.  Serial Track

   A Serial (or simple) Track is the 6TiSCH version of a circuit; a
   bundle of cells that are programmed to receive (RX-cells) is uniquely
   paired to a bundle of cells that are set to transmit (TX-cells),
   representing a Layer-2 forwarding state which can be used regardless
   of the network layer protocol.  A Serial Track is thus formed end-to-
   end as a succession of paired bundles, a receive bundle from the
   previous hop and a transmit bundle to the next hop along the Track.




Thubert                 Expires December 26, 2019              [Page 39]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   For a given iteration of the device schedule, the effective channel
   of the cell is obtained by adding a pseudo-random number to the
   channelOffset of the cell, which results in a rotation of the
   frequency that used for transmission.  The bundles may be computed so
   as to accommodate both variable rates and retransmissions, so they
   might not be fully used in the iteration of the schedule.

4.6.3.  Complex Track with Replication and Elimination

   The art of Deterministic Networks already include PRE techniques.
   Example standards include the Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) and
   the High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) [IEC62439].
   Similarly, and as opposed to a Serial Track that is a sequence of
   nodes and links, a Complex Track is shaped as a directed acyclic
   graph towards one or more destination(s) to support multi-path
   forwarding and route around failures.

   A Complex Track may branch off over non congruent branches for the
   purpose of multicasting, and/or redundancy, in which case it
   reconverges later down the path.  This enables the DetNet Packet
   Replication, Elimination and Ordering Functions (PREOF).  PRE may be
   used to complement Layer-2 ARQ to meet industrial expectations in
   Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), in particular when the Track extends
   beyond the 6TiSCH network in a larger DetNet network.

   In the art of TSCH, a path does not necessarily support PRE but it is
   almost systematically multi-path.  This means that a Track is
   scheduled so as to ensure that each hop has at least two forwarding
   solutions, and the forwarding decision is to try the preferred one
   and use the other in case of Layer-2 transmission failure as detected
   by ARQ.  Similarly, at each 6TiSCH hop along the Track, the PCE may
   schedule more than one timeslot for a packet, so as to support
   Layer-2 retries (ARQ).  It is also possible that the field device
   only uses the second branch if sending over the first branch fails.

4.6.4.  DetNet End-to-end Path

   Ultimately, DetNet [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] should enable to
   extend a Track beyond the 6TiSCH LLN as illustrated in Figure 11.  In
   that example, a Track that is laid out from a field device in a
   6TiSCH network to an IoT gateway that is located on an 802.1 Time-
   Sensitive Networking (TSN) backbone.  A 6TiSCH-Aware DetNet Service
   Layer handles the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering
   Functions over the DODAG that forms a Track.

   The Replication function in the 6TiSCH Node sends a copy of each
   packet over two different branches, and the PCE schedules each hop of
   both branches so that the two copies arrive in due time at the

   gateway.  In case of a loss on one branch, hopefully the other copy
   of the packet still makes it in due time.  If two copies make it to
   the IoT gateway, the Elimination function in the gateway ignores the
   extra packet and presents only one copy to upper layers.

4.6.5.  Cell Reuse

   The 6TiSCH architecture provides means to avoid waste of cells as
   well as overflows in the transmit bundle of a Track, as follows:

   A TX-cell that is not needed for the current iteration may be reused
   opportunistically on a per-hop basis for routed packets.  When all of
   the frame that were received for a given Track are effectively
   transmitted, any available TX-cell for that Track can be reused for
   upper layer traffic for which the next-hop router matches the next
   hop along the Track.  In that case, the cell that is being used is
   effectively a TX-cell from the Track, but the short address for the
   destination is that of the next-hop router.

   It results in a frame that is received in a RX-cell of a Track with a
   destination MAC address set to this node as opposed to broadcast must
   be extracted from the Track and delivered to the upper layer (a frame
   with an unrecognized destination MAC address is dropped at the lower
   MAC layer and thus is not received at the 6top sublayer).

   On the other hand, it might happen that there are not enough TX-cells
   in the transmit bundle to accommodate the Track traffic, for instance
   if more retransmissions are needed than provisioned.  In that case,



Thubert                 Expires December 26, 2019              [Page 41]

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   and if the frame transports an IPv6 packet, then it can be placed for
   transmission in the bundle that is used for Layer-3 traffic towards
   the next hop along the Track.  The MAC address should be set to the
   next-hop MAC address to avoid confusion.

   It results in a frame that is received over a Layer-3 bundle may be
   in fact associated to a Track.  In a classical IP link such as an
   Ethernet, off-Track traffic is typically in excess over reservation
   to be routed along the non-reserved path based on its QoS setting.
   But with 6TiSCH, since the use of the Layer-3 bundle may be due to
   transmission failures, it makes sense for the receiver to recognize a
   frame that should be re-Tracked, and to place it back on the
   appropriate bundle if possible.  A frame should be re-Tracked if the
   Per-Hop-Behavior group indicated in the Differentiated Services Field
   of the IPv6 header is set to Deterministic Forwarding, as discussed
   in Section 4.8.1.  A frame is re-Tracked by scheduling it for
   transmission over the transmit bundle associated to the Track, with
   the destination MAC address set to broadcast.

4.7.  Forwarding Models

   By forwarding, this specification means the per-packet operation that
   allows to deliver a packet to a next hop or an upper layer in this
   node.  Forwarding is based on pre-existing state that was installed
   as a result of a routing computation Section 4.8.  6TiSCH supports
   three different forwarding model, G-MPLS Track Forwarding, 6LoWPAN
   Fragment Forwarding and classical IPv6 Forwarding.

4.7.1.  Track Forwarding

   Forwarding along a Track can be seen as a Generalized Multi-protocol
   Label Switching (G-MPLS) operation in that the information used to
   switch a frame is not an explicit label, but rather related to other
   properties of the way the packet was received, a particular cell in
   the case of 6TiSCH.  As a result, as long as the TSCH MAC (and
   Layer-2 security) accepts a frame, that frame can be switched
   regardless of the protocol, whether this is an IPv6 packet, a 6LoWPAN
   fragment, or a frame from an alternate protocol such as WirelessHART
   or ISA100.11a.

   A data frame that is forwarded along a Track normally has a
   destination MAC address that is set to broadcast - or a multicast
   address depending on MAC support.  This way, the MAC layer in the
   intermediate nodes accepts the incoming frame and 6top switches it
   without incurring a change in the MAC header.  In the case of IEEE
   Std 802.15.4, this means effectively broadcast, so that along the
   Track the short address for the destination of the frame is set to
   0xFFFF.

   There are 2 modes for a Track, native mode and tunnel mode.

4.7.1.1.  Native Mode

   In native mode, the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is associated with flow-
   dependent meta-data that refers uniquely to the Track, so the 6top
   sublayer can place the frame in the appropriate cell without
   ambiguity.  In the case of IPv6 traffic, this flow identification may
   be done using a 6-tuple as discussed in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  In
   particular, implementations of this document should support
   identification of DetNet flows based on the IPv6 Flow Label field.
   The flow identification may also be done using a dedicated RPL
   Instance (see section 3.1.3 of [RFC6550]), signaled in a RPL Packet
   Information (more in section 11.2.2.1 of [RFC6550]).  The flow
   identification is validated at egress before restoring the
   destination MAC address (DMAC) and punting to the upper layer.

   Figure 12 illustrates the Track Forwarding operation which happens at
   the 6top sublayer, below IP.

4.7.1.2.  Tunnel Mode

   In tunnel mode, the frames originate from an arbitrary protocol over
   a compatible MAC that may or may not be synchronized with the 6TiSCH
   network.  An example of this would be a router with a dual radio that
   is capable of receiving and sending WirelessHART or ISA100.11a frames
   with the second radio, by presenting itself as an access Point or a
   Backbone Router, respectively.  In that mode, some entity (e.g.  PCE)
   can coordinate with a WirelessHART Network Manager or an ISA100.11a
   System Manager to specify the flows that are transported.

   In that case, the flow information that identifies the Track at the
   ingress 6TiSCH router is derived from the RX-cell.  The DMAC is set
   to this node but the flow information indicates that the frame must
   be tunneled over a particular Track so the frame is not passed to the
   upper layer.  Instead, the DMAC is forced to broadcast and the frame
   is passed to the 6top sublayer for switching.

   At the egress 6TiSCH router, the reverse operation occurs.  Based on
   tunneling information of the Track, which may for instance indicate
   that the tunneled datagram is an IP packet, the datagram is passed to
   the appropriate Link-Layer with the destination MAC restored.

4.7.1.3.  Tunneling Information

   Tunneling information coming with the Track configuration provides
   the destination MAC address of the egress endpoint as well as the
   tunnel mode and specific data depending on the mode, for instance a
   service access point for frame delivery at egress.

   If the tunnel egress point does not have a MAC address that matches
   the configuration, the Track installation fails.

   If the final Layer-3 destination address is the same address as the
   tunnel termination, then it is possible that the IPv6 address of the
   destination is compressed at the 6LoWPAN sublayer based on the MAC
   address.  It is thus mandatory at the ingress point to validate that
   the MAC address that was used at the 6LoWPAN sublayer for compression
   matches that of the tunnel egress point.  For that reason, the node
   that injects a packet on a Track checks that the destination is
   effectively that of the tunnel egress point before it overwrites it
   to broadcast.  The 6top sublayer at the tunnel egress point reverts
   that operation to the MAC address obtained from the tunnel
   information.

4.7.2.  IPv6 Forwarding

   As the packets are routed at Layer-3, traditional QoS and Active
   Queue Management (AQM) operations are expected to prioritize flows.

4.7.3.  Fragment Forwarding

   Considering that per section 4 of [RFC4944] 6LoWPAN packets can be as
   large as 1280 bytes (the IPv6 minimum MTU), and that the non-storing
   mode of RPL implies Source Routing that requires space for routing
   headers, and that a IEEE Std 802.15.4 frame with security may carry
   in the order of 80 bytes of effective payload, an IPv6 packet might
   be fragmented into more than 16 fragments at the 6LoWPAN sublayer.

   This level of fragmentation is much higher than that traditionally
   experienced over the Internet with IPv4 fragments, where
   fragmentation is already known as harmful.

   In the case to a multihop route within a 6TiSCH network, Hop-by-Hop
   recomposition occurs at each hop to reform the packet and route it.
   This creates additional latency and forces intermediate nodes to
   store a portion of a packet for an undetermined time, thus impacting
   critical resources such as memory and battery.

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment] describes a framework for forwarding
   fragments end-to-end across a 6TiSCH route-over mesh.  Within that
   framework, [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly] details a
   virtual reassembly buffer mechanism whereby the datagram tag in the
   6LoWPAN Fragment is used as a label for switching at the 6LoWPAN
   sublayer.

   Building on this technique, [I-D.ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery]
   introduces a new format for 6LoWPAN fragments that enables the
   selective recovery of individual fragments, and allows for a degree
   of flow control based on an Explicit Congestion Notification.

   In that model, the first fragment is routed based on the IPv6 header
   that is present in that fragment.  The 6LoWPAN sublayer learns the
   next hop selection, generates a new datagram tag for transmission to
   the next hop, and stores that information indexed by the incoming MAC
   address and datagram tag.  The next fragments are then switched based
   on that stored state.

   A bitmap and an ECN echo in the end-to-end acknowledgment enable the
   source to resend the missing fragments selectively.  The first
   fragment may be resent to carve a new path in case of a path failure.
   The ECN echo set indicates that the number of outstanding fragments
   should be reduced.

4.8.  Advanced 6TiSCH Routing

4.8.1.  Packet Marking and Handling

   All packets inside a 6TiSCH domain must carry the Instance ID that
   identifies the 6TiSCH topology that is to be used for routing and
   forwarding that packet.  The location of that information must be the
   same for all packets forwarded inside the domain.

   For packets that are routed by a PCE along a Track, the tuple formed
   by the IPv6 source address and a local RPLInstanceID in the packet
   identify uniquely the Track and associated transmit bundle.

   For packets that are routed by RPL, that information is the
   RPLInstanceID which is carried in the RPL Packet Information (RPI),
   as discussed in section 11.2 of [RFC6550], "Loop Avoidance and
   Detection".  The RPI is transported by a RPL option in the IPv6 Hop-
   By-Hop Header [RFC6553].

   A compression mechanism for the RPL packet artifacts that integrates
   the compression of IP-in-IP encapsulation and the Routing Header type
   3 [RFC6554] with that of the RPI in a 6LoWPAN dispatch/header type is
   specified in [RFC8025] and [RFC8138].

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   Either way, the method and format used for encoding the RPLInstanceID
   is generalized to all 6TiSCH topological Instances, which include
   both RPL Instances and Tracks.

4.8.2.  Replication, Retries and Elimination

   6TiSCH supports the PREOF operations of elimination and reordering of
   packets along a complex Track, but has no requirement about whether a
   sequence number would be tagged in the packet for that purpose.  With
   6TiSCH, the schedule can tell when multiple receive timeslots
   correspond to copies of a same packet, in which case the receiver may
   avoid listening to the extra copies once it had received one instance
   of the packet.

   The semantics of the configuration will enable correlated timeslots
   to be grouped for transmit (and respectively receive) with a 'OR'
   relations, and then a 'AND' relation would be configurable between
   groups.  The semantics is that if the transmit (and respectively
   receive) operation succeeded in one timeslot in a 'OR' group, then
   all the other timeslots in the group are ignored.  Now, if there are
   at least two groups, the 'AND' relation between the groups indicates
   that one operation must succeed in each of the groups.

   On the transmit side, timeslots provisioned for retries along a same
   branch of a Track are placed a same 'OR' group.  The 'OR' relation
   indicates that if a transmission is acknowledged, then
   retransmissions of that packet should not be attempted for remaining
   timeslots in that group.  There are as many 'OR' groups as there are
   branches of the Track departing from this node.  Different 'OR'
   groups are programmed for the purpose of replication, each group
   corresponding to one branch of the Track.  The 'AND' relation between
   the groups indicates that transmission over any of branches must be
   attempted regardless of whether a transmission succeeded in another
   branch.  It is also possible to place cells to different next-hop
   routers in a same 'OR' group.  This allows to route along multi-path
   Tracks, trying one next-hop and then another only if sending to the
   first fails.

   On the receive side, all timeslots are programmed in a same 'OR'
   group.  Retries of a same copy as well as converging branches for
   elimination are converged, meaning that the first successful
   reception is enough and that all the other timeslots can be ignored.
   A 'AND' group denotes different packets that must all be received and
   transmitted over the associated transmit groups within their
   respected 'AND' or 'OR' rules.

   The assumption for this particular problem is that a 6TiSCH node has
   a single radio, so it cannot perform 2 receive and/or transmit
   operations at the same time, even on 2 different channels.

   Say we have 6 possible channels, and at least 10 timeslots per
   slotframe.  Figure 18 shows a possible schedule whereby each
   transmission is retried 2 or 3 times, and redundant copies are
   forwarded in parallel via A and C on the one hand, and B and D on the
   other, providing time diversity, spatial diversity though different
   physical paths, and frequency diversity.

   awake.  Figure 19 shows the corresponding slotframe for node A.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require IANA action.

6.  Security Considerations

   This architecture operates on IEEE Std 802.15.4 and expects Link-
   Layer security to be enabled at all times between connected devices,
   except for the very first step of the device join process, where a
   joining device may need some initial, unsecured exchanges so as to
   obtain its initial key material.

   As detailed in Section 4.2.1, a pledge that wishes to join the 6TiSCH
   network must use a join protocol to obtain its security keys.  The
   join protocol used in 6TiSCH is the Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP).
   In the minimal setting defined in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security],
   the authentication requires a pre-shared key, based on which a secure

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   session is derived.  The CoJP exchange may also be preceded with a
   zero-touch handshake [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join] in
   order to enable pledge joining based on certificates and/or inter-
   domain communication.

   For the join procedure, the pledge is helped by a Join Proxy (JP)
   that relays the link-scope Join Request over the IP network to the
   Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) that can authenticate the pledge and
   validate that it is attached to the appropriate network.  As a result
   of this exchange the pledge is in possession of a Link-Layer material
   including a key and a short address, and all traffic is secured at
   the Link-Layer.

   The operation of 6TiSCH Tracks inherits its high level operation from
   DetNet and is subject to the observations in section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  As discussed there, measures must be
   taken to protect the time synchronization, and for 6TiSCH this
   includes ensuring that the ASN, which is used for the computation of
   NONCE, is not compromised.  Also, the installation and maintenance of
   6TiSCH Tracks depends in the availability of a controller with a PCE
   to compute and push them in the network.  When that connectivity is
   lost, existing Tracks may continue to operate until the end of their
   lifetime, but cannot be removed or updated, and new Tracks cannot be
   installed.  As with DetNet in general, the communication with the PCE
   must be secured and should be protected against DoS attacks, and the
   discussion on the security considerations defined for Abstraction and
   Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) in Section 9 of
   RFC8453], applies equally to 6TiSCH.

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


A.1.  Chartered IETF work items

   The operation of the Backbone Router [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router]
   is stable but the RFC is not published yet.  The protection of
   registered addresses against impersonation and take over will be
   guaranteed by Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and
   Lossy Networks [I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd], which is not yet published
   either.

   New procedures have been defined at ROLL that extend RPL and may be
   of interest for a 6TiSCH stack.  In particular
   [I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves] enables a 6LN that implements only
   [RFC8505] and avoid the support of RPL.

A.2.  Unchartered IETF work items

A.2.1.  6TiSCH Zerotouch security

   The security model and in particular the zerotouch join process
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join] depends on the ANIMA
   [ANIMA] Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI)
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] to enable zero-touch security
   provisionning; for highly constrained nodes, a minimal model based on
   pre-shared keys (PSK) is also available.  As written to this day, it
   also depends on a nmuber of documents in progress as CORE, and on
   "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)"
   [I-D.selander-ace-cose-ecdhe], which is facing significant opposition
   at ACE.

A.2.2.  6TiSCH Track Setup

   ROLL is now standardizing a reactive routing protocol based on RPL
   [I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl] The need of a reactive routing protocol to
   establish on-demand constraint-optimized routes and a reservation
   protocol to establish Layer-3 Tracks is being discussed at 6TiSCH but
   not chartered for.

   At the time of this writing, the formation of a new working group
   called RAW for Reliable and Available Wireless networking is being
   considered.  During the PAW BoF that took place on that matter, one
   of the considered work items was to develop a generic specification
   for Tracks that would cover 6TiSCH requirements as expressed in this
   architecture.

   ROLL is also standardizing an extension to RPL to setup centrally-
   computed routes [I-D.ietf-roll-dao-projection] The work on
   centralized Track computation is deferred to a subsequent work, not
   necessarily at 6TiSCH.  A Predicatable and Available Wireless (PAW)

Internet-Draft             6tisch-architecture                 June 2019


   bar-BoF took place; the formation of a new working group called RAW
   for Reliable and Available Wireless networking is being considered.
   RAW may form as a WG and develop a generic specification for Tracks
   that would cover 6TiSCH requirements as expressed in this
   architecture, more in [I-D.thubert-raw-technologies]

   The 6TiSCH Architecture should thus inherit from the DetNet
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] architecture and thus depends on it.
   The Path Computation Element (PCE) should be a core component of that
   architecture.  An extension to RPL or to TEAS [TEAS] will be required
   to expose the 6TiSCH node capabilities and the network peers to the
   PCE, possibly in combination with [I-D.rahul-roll-mop-ext].  A
   protocol such as a lightweight PCEP or an adaptation of CCAMP [CCAMP]
   G-MPLS formats and procedures could be used in combination to
   [I-D.ietf-roll-dao-projection] to install the Tracks, as computed by
   the PCE, to the 6TiSCH nodes.

A.2.3.  Using BIER in a 6TiSCH Network

   ROLL is actively working on Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) as
   a method to compress both the dataplane packets and the routing
   tables in storing mode [I-D.thubert-roll-bier].

   BIER could also be used in the context of the DetNet service layer.
   BIER-TE-based OAM, Replication and Elimination
   [I-D.thubert-bier-replication-elimination] leverages BIER Traffic
   Engineering (TE) to control in the data plane the DetNet Replication
   and Elimination activities, and to provide traceability on links
   where replication and loss happen, in a manner that is abstract to
   the forwarding information.

   a 6loRH for BitStrings [I-D.thubert-6lo-bier-dispatch] proposes a
   6LoWPAN compression for the BIER Bitstring based on 6LoWPAN Routing
   Header [RFC8138].

A.3.  External (non-IETF) work items

   The current charter positions 6TiSCH on IEEE Std 802.15.4 only.
   Though most of the design should be portable on other link types,
   6TiSCH has a strong dependency on IEEE Std 802.15.4 and its
   evolution.  The impact of changes to TSCH on this Architecture should
   be minimal to non-existent, but deeper work such as 6top and security
   may be impacted.  A 6TiSCH Interest Group at the IEEE maintains the
   synchronization and helps foster work at the IEEE should 6TiSCH
   demand it.

   Work is being proposed at IEEE (802.15.12 PAR) for an LLC that would
   logically include the 6top sublayer.  The interaction with the 6top

   sublayer and the Scheduling Functions described in this document are
   yet to be defined.

   ISA100 [ISA100] Common Network Management (CNM) is another external
   work of interest for 6TiSCH.  The group, referred to as ISA100.20,
   defines a Common Network Management framework that should enable the
   management of resources that are controlled by heterogeneous
   protocols such as ISA100.11a [ISA100.11a], WirelessHART
   [WirelessHART], and 6TiSCH.  Interestingly, the establishment of
   6TiSCH Deterministic paths, called Tracks, are also in scope, and
   ISA100.20 is working on requirements for DetNet.
