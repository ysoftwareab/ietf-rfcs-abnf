               A New Algorithm for SNMP Key Localization
                draft-du-opsawg-snmp-key-localization-00

Abstract

   This draft discusses a security issue with the algorithm for
   generating SNMP localized keys and introduce a new algorithm to
   address this problem.

1.  Introduction

   In Appendix 2 of [RFC3414], the SNMP localized key is obtained by the
   MD5 or SHA function with user password and SnmpEngineID as inputs.
   The user password should be padded by repeating itself if its length
   is less than 64 Octects.  RFC3414 warns that longer passwords with
   repetitive strings may result in exactly the same key.  For example,
   a password 'bertbert' will result in exactly the same key as password
   'bertbertbert'.  In other words, if an SNMP key string can be
   expressed by repeating string S with M times, other keys that
   expressed by repeating S with N times are also able to access the
   same target device.  The traditional solution to avoid this security
   issue is to implement an extra module to check the format of user
   password, such as the length of the key should be between 8 and 15
   chars, it must contain capital, small letters, digits and special
   characters, forbid using repetitive string with length as the divisor
   of 64.  This draft tries to tackle this issue by revising the key
   localization algorithm specified in Appendix 2 of [RFC3414].

2.  Updated Algorithm

   Instead of extending to 64 Octets, the original user password is only
   extended to M<64 octets.  The remaining Octets are padded with the
   original user password length.  The value of M could be various, here
   we recommend M=60.
