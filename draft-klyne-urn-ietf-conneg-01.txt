Internet-Draft         URNs for media feature tags              Nov 2001


1. Introduction

   This specification defines a form of URN to be used for media feature
   tags registered according to RFC 2506 [3].  The URN namespace used is
   'IETF', defined by RFC 2648 [5]  and extended by RFC???? [10] to
   include names for IETF protocol parameters.

1.1 Background

   RFC 2506 [3] defines a registry for feature tags used to describe
   media features of systems and documents.  These tags can be used to
   describe the capabilities and preferences of systems that send or
   receive data, and also the features used by specific data instances.
   A companion document, RFC 2533 [4], describes a format for combining
   these tags into expressions that describe the combined media features
   of a system or document.

   W3C have also been working on an XML [6] format for expressing client
   capabilities called CC/PP [9].  It is based on RDF [8], a generic XML
   metadata format that uses URIs to identify objects and the
   relationships between them.

   It has for some time been a goal that RFC2506-registered media
   feature tags will be usable by CC/PP profiles, providing some basis
   for interworking between IETF and W3C content negotiation schemes.
   By defining a URI form based on the urn: scheme, this specification
   satsifies that goal.  Thus, any new media feature tag registered will
   also have a defined form of URI for use in CC/PP, or any other scheme
   that uses URIs for identification od media features.

2. Registration template

   The URN sub-namespace for media feature tags is defined as follows.

   Registry name:
      media-feature

   Specification:
      RFC 2506 [3]

   Repository:
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-feature-tags

   Index value:
      The feature tag name is the registry index value.  RFC 2506 allows
      this tag name to contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
      digits, colon (":"), slash ("/"), dot ("."), percent ("%"), and
      dash ("-").  Media feature tags are case-insensitive.

   URN formation:
      The URN for a media feature tag is formed as:
      "urn:ietf:params:media-feature:<tag-name>", where <tag-name> is
      the media feature registry index value.

      RFC 2141 [1] defines the format of URNs.  Allowable characters
      include all of those noted above, with the following exceptions:

      *  '%' is used to introduced an escape sequence and if present in
         the feature tag name.

      *  '/' is reserved for future use and is recommended to be
         escaped.

      These characters, if they appear as part of a media feature tag
      name should be replaced by their %-encoded equivalent (per URI
      specification [2]); i.e.  '%' is represented as '%25', and '/' as
      '%2f'.

      URNs are defined by RFC 2141 [1] as lexically equivalent if they
      are identical following case normalization of the urn scheme name,
      the namespace name and any %-escaping used.  Media feature tags
      are defined such that upper- and lower-case ASCII characters are
      not distinguished.  Thus, in forming a URN, all ASCII characters
      in the media feature tag must be expressed in lower case.


3. Examples

   This table lists some media feature tags, and the corresponding urn:
   URIs.

   dpi
      urn:ietf:params:media-feature:dpi

   pix-x
      urn:ietf:params:media-feature:pix-x

   JBIG-stripe-size
      urn:ietf:params:media-feature:jbig-stripe-size

   g.acme.special/param
      urn:ietf:params:media-feature:g.acme.special%2fparam

4. IANA considerations

   This document calls for the creation of a new IETF sub-namespace, per
   RFC???? [10].  Registration details are in the preceding section.

5. Security considerations

   No security considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those already inherent in use of media feature tags.
