Abstract

   There is wide interest in interconnecting content distribution
   networks (CDNs), variously called "content peering" or "CDN
   peering".  A common vocabulary helps the process of discussing such
   interconnection and interoperation.  This document proposes elements
   for a such a common vocabulary.

1. Introduction

   This document presents a vocabulary for use in developing "content
   peering," or more accurately "peering of CDNs". Section 2 describes
   content distribution, CDNs, and the motivation for peering of CDNs
   in some more detail.  Section 3 consists of the actual definitions
   that constitute the model, and is intended to be the authoritative
   part of the document. All other sections contain examples and
   introduction.  Section 4 uses the definitions to further explain how
   aspects of peering are likely to work.

   Section 3 is organized alphabetically, which is appropriate for
   reference but which makes it difficult to read the first time.
   Rather than reading the document from beginning to end, the authors
   recommend that the first-time reader read sections 2 and 4, looking
   at definitions in section 3 as necessary.

   The interested reader is also referred to [3], which enumerates a
   large number of scenarios for content-peering-related interactions;
   [4], which describes a number of models for accounting and
   associated issues; and [5], which gives the overall architecture of
   the elements for CDN peering.

2. Problem Description

   Abstractly, the "content distribution problem" is to arrange a
   rendezvous between a content source at an origin server and a
   content sink at a viewer's client. In the trivial case (conventional
   web access without a CDN), the rendezvous mechanism is that every
   client sends every request directly to the origin server.

   This trivial approach to content distribution suffers from scaling
   and manageability problems. As the audience for the content source
   grows, so do the demands on the origin server and its associated
   infrastructure. A content provider with a popular content source can
   find that it has to invest in large server farms, load balancing,
   and high-bandwidth connections to keep up with demand. Even with
   those investments, the user experience for viewers may still be
   relatively poor due to congestion in the network as a whole.

   A content provider wants to focus its resources on developing
   high-value content, not on managing network infrastructure; so there
   is an opportunity for a service provider in this situation. A
   service provider can build a CDN and offer a content distribution
   service to a content provider.

   A CDN enables a service provider to act on behalf of the content
   provider to deliver copies of origin server content from multiple
   diverse locations. The increase in number and diversity of locations
   is intended to speed download times and thus improve the user
   experience. A nontrivial CDN has some combination of a redirection
   infrastructure, a content-delivery infrastructure, and a
   distribution infrastructure.  The content-delivery infrastructure
   consists of a set of "surrogate" servers that deliver copies of
   content to sets of users. The redirection infrastructure consists of
   mechanisms that move a client toward a rendezvous with a content
   server. The distribution infrastructure consists of mechanisms that
   move content from the origin server to the surrogates. An effective
   CDN serves frequently-accessed content from a surrogate that is
   "best suited" for a given client.

   There are two fundamental elements that give a CDN value:
   outsourcing infrastructure and improved content delivery. A CDN
   allows multiple surrogates to act on behalf of an orgin server,
   therefore removing the delivery of content from a centralized site
   to multiple and (usually) highly distributed sites. We refer to
   increased aggregate infrastructure size as scale. In addition, a CDN
   can be constructed with copies of content near to end users,
   overcoming issues of network size, network congestion, and network
   failures.  We refer to increased diversity of content locations as
   reach.

2.1 Extending Reach & Scale

   In a typical (non-peered) CDN, a single service provider operates
   the request routers, the surrogates, and the content distributors.
   In addition, that service provider establishes (business)
   relationships withe content publishers and acts on behalf of their
   origin sites to provide a distributed delivery system. The value of
   that CDN to a content provider is a combination of its scale and its
   reach.

   There are limits to how large any one network's scale and reach can
   be. Increasing either scale or reach is ultimately limited by the
   cost of equipment, the space available for deploying equipment,
   and/or the demand for that scale/reach of infrastructure. Sometimes
   a particular audience is tied to a single service provider or a
   small set of providers by constraints of technology, economics, or
   law. Other times, a network provider may be able to manage
   surrogates and a distribution system, but may have no direct
   relationship with content providers. Such a provider wants to have a
   means of affiliating their delivery and distribution infrastructure
   with other parties who have content to distribute. 

   CDN peering allows different CDNs to share resources so as to
   provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they
   could otherwise achieve.

3. Model

   This section consists of the definitions of a number of terms used
   to refer to roles, participants, and objects involved in Content
   Distribution Networks and CDN Peering.

   This section and the references section are normative. 

   ACCOUNTING 
      Measurement and recording of DISTRIBUTION and DELIVERY
      activities, especially when the information recorded is
      ultimately used as a basis for the subsequent transfer of money,
      goods, or obligations.

   ACCOUNTING ADVERTISEMENT 
      ADVERTISEMENT from a CDN's ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM about the
      collections of CONTENT for which that CDN requires ACCOUNTING
      information.

   ACCOUNTING PEERING 
      Interconnection of two or more ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS so as to enable
      the exchange of information between them. The form of ACCOUNTING
      PEERING required may depend on the nature of the NEGOTIATED
      RELATIONSHIP between the peering parties -- in particular, on the
      value of the economic exchanges anticipated.

   ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support ACCOUNTING PEERING
      with other CDNs. 

   ACCOUNTING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that supports ACCOUNTING for a
      single CDN.

   ADVERTISEMENT 
      Information about available resources, exchanged among PEERING
      SYSTEMS. Types of ADVERTISEMENT include REDIRECTION
      ADVERTISEMENTS, DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS and ACCOUNTING
      ADVERTISEMENTS.

   AUTHORITATIVE REDIRECTION SYSTEM 
      The REDIRECTION SYSTEM that is the correct/final authority for a
      particular item of CONTENT. Typically operated by the BILLING
      CDN. 

   BILLING CDN 
      The single CDN that has a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with the
      PUBLISHER making that CDN responsible for DISTRIBUTION of some
      particular collection of CONTENT. Contrast with DISTRIBUTING CDN.


Day, et. al.             Expires March 31, 2001                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPM                    September 2000


      Usually a BILLING CDN is owned and operated by a corresponding
      BILLING ORGANIZATION

   BILLING ORGANIZATION 
      An entity that operates an ACCOUNTING SYSTEM to support billing
      within a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with a PUBLISHER.

   CDN 
      Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network.  A
      collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS arranged for more effective
      delivery of CONTENT to CLIENTS.  Typically a CDN consists of a
      DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, SURROGATES, a REDIRECTION SYSTEM, and an
      ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

   CLIENT 
      The origin of a REQUEST and the destination of the corresponding
      delivered CONTENT.

   CONTENT 
      Digital data resources. CONTENT ultimately consists of CONTENT
      DATA UNITs whose internal structure is unknown by the CDN. 
      However, some CONTENT may be in a format known to the CDN, so
      that the CDN does have some ability to parse, analyze, or
      rearrange the collection of CONTENT DATA UNITs. One important
      form of CONTENT with additional constraints on DISTRIBUTION and
      DELIVERY is CONTINUOUS MEDIA.

   CONTENT DATA UNIT 
      A single collection of CONTENT bits, where any internal structure
      or semantics are unknown to the CDN. Thus, a CDN can succeed or
      fail at transporting a CONTENT DATA UNIT, but it cannot parse,
      analyze, or rearrange it.

   CONTENT PEERING GATEWAY (CPG) 
      A point through which a CDN can be peered with others through one
      or more kinds of peering. A CPG may be the point of contact for
      DISTRIBUTION PEERING, REDIRECTION PEERING, and/or ACCOUNTING
      PEERING, and thus may incorporate some or all of the
      corresponding PEERING SYSTEMs for the CDN.

   CONTENT SIGNAL 
      A message delivered through a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM that specifies
      information about an item of CONTENT. For example, a CONTENT
      SIGNAL can indicate that the ORIGIN has a new version of some
      piece of CONTENT.

   CONTINUOUS MEDIA 
      CONTENT where there is a timing relationship between source and
      sink; that is, the sink must reproduce the timing relationship


Day, et. al.             Expires March 31, 2001                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPM                    September 2000


      that existed at the source. The most common examples of
      CONTINUOUS MEDIA are audio and motion video. CONTINUOUS MEDIA can
      be real-time (interactive), where there is a "tight" timing
      relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback),
      where the relationship is less strict. 

   DELIVERY 
      The activity of presenting a PUBLISHER's CONTENT for consumption
      by a CLIENT. Contrast with DISTRIBUTION and REDIRECTION.

   DISTRIBUTING CDN 
      A CDN delivering CONTENT that does not have a NEGOTIATED
      RELATIONSHIP with the PUBLISHER. Contrast with BILLING CDN.

   DISTRIBUTION 
      The activity of moving a PUBLISHER's CONTENT from its ORIGIN to
      one or more SURROGATEs. Contrast with DELIVERY and REDIRECTION.

   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENT 
      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CDN's DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM
      describing the availability of collections of CONTENT via the
      CDN's DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

   DISTRIBUTION PEERING 
      Interconnection of two or more DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS so as to
      propagate CONTENT SIGNALS and copies of CONTENT to groups of
      SURROGATES.

   DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support DISTRIBUTION
      PEERING with other CDNs.

   DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support DISTRIBUTION for a
      single CDN. The DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM also propagates CONTENT
      SIGNALs.

   FIRST-REDIRECTION CDN 
      The CDN whose REDIRECTION SYSTEM first receives a particular
      REQUEST. The FIRST-REDIRECTION CDN is able to decide how that
      REQUEST should be redirected, if at all. Contrast with REMOTE CDN.

   INTER-CDN 
      Related to an activity that involves more than one CDN. Contrast
      with INTRA-CDN.

   INTRA-CDN 
      Related to an activity within a single CDN. Contrast with
      INTER-CDN.

Internet-Draft                   CDNPM                    September 2000


   NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP 
      A relationship whose terms and conditions are established outside
      the context of CDN peering protocols.

   NETWORK ELEMENT 
      A device or system that affects the processing of network
      messages.

   ORIGIN 
      The point at which CONTENT enters the DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM of the
      BILLING CDN. The ORIGIN for any item of CONTENT is the server or
      set of servers at the "core" of the distribution, holding the
      "master" or "authoritative" copy of that CONTENT.

   PEERING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS supporting some form of
      interconnected operation among two or more CDNs. See ACCOUNTING
      PEERING SYSTEM, DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM, REDIRECTION PEERING
      SYSTEM.

   PUBLISHER 
      The party that ultimately controls the content and its
      distribution. The PUBLISHER is the other party to the NEGOTIATED
      RELATIONSHIP with the BILLING CDN.

   REACHABLE SURROGATES 
      The collection of SURROGATES that can be contacted via a
      particular DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM or REDIRECTION SYSTEM.

   REDIRECTING CDN 
      A CDN whose REDIRECTION SYSTEM participates in the REDIRECTION of
      a particular REQUEST.

   REDIRECTION 
      The activity of directing a REQUEST from a CLIENT to a suitable
      SURROGATE.

   REDIRECTION ADVERTISEMENT 
      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CDN's REDIRECTION PEERING SYSTEM
      describing the availability of collections of CONTENT via that
      CDN's REDIRECTION SYSTEM.

   REDIRECTION PEERING 
      Interconnection of two or more REDIRECTION SYSTEMS so as to
      increase the number of REACHABLE SURROGATES for at least one of
      the interconnected systems.

   REDIRECTION PEERING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support REDIRECTION PEERING

      with other CDNs.

   REDIRECTION SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support REDIRECTION for a
      single CDN.

   REMOTE CDN 
      A CDN able to deliver CONTENT for a particular REQUEST that is
      not the FIRST-REDIRECTION CDN for that REQUEST.

   REQUEST 
      A message identifying a particular item of CONTENT to be
      delivered. [Editor Note: Brad Cain recommends distinguishing
      REDIRECTION REQUEST from CONTENT REQUEST. Does this make the
      model too closely tied to DNS-style redirection? To be discussed.]

   SURROGATE 
      A delivery server, other than the ORIGIN. Receives a redirected
      REQUEST and delivers the corresponding CONTENT. Note: This
      definition has a narrower semantic context than the more
      generally used term defined in [2].

4. Examples and Commentary

   This section further describes the model of Section 3 to explain
   concepts of CDNs and CDN peering. Note that these are only
   illustrative examples. If there are conflicts between the way a term
   is used here and the way it is defined in Section 3, the definition
   in Section 3 is authoritative.

4.1 Understanding CDNs

   The first use of the model, before peering CDNs, is simply to
   describe a single CDN at an abstract level.  The model describes
   CLIENTS that issue REQUESTS for CONTENT.  Each item of CONTENT
   starts from some ORIGIN.

   In the absence of a CDN, each REQUEST could simply go to an
   appropriate ORIGIN, which would deliver the corresponding CONTENT to
   the CLIENT.

   With a CDN, the picture is a little more elaborate. The CLIENT's
   REQUEST enters a REDIRECTION SYSTEM, and the ORIGIN's CONTENT enters
   a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. Both systems converge on SURROGATES, which
   are non-ORIGIN servers of CONTENT.  Effectively, the DISTRIBUTION
   SYSTEM is moving CONTENT out to SURROGATES, and the REDIRECTION
   SYSTEM is then taking advantage of that distribution of CONTENT.

   [Editor Note: Could change this description to deal with REDIRECTION
   REQUESTS and CONTENT REQUESTS.]

4.2 Understanding content structure

   The model defines CONTENT as well as two subsidiary but orthogonal
   concepts: CONTENT DATA UNIT and CONTINUOUS MEDIA.

   Any identifiable resource of digital data is an item of CONTENT. So
   CONTENT is the most generic description of what is transported and
   served up by a CDN. Although an item of CONTENT may have some
   internal structure that is known to the CDN, there is some unit
   (possibly as small as a bit) that is opaque to the CDN. These opaque
   elements are CONTENT DATA UNITs.

   In many cases, an item of CONTENT can be delivered by a CDN without
   concern about maintaining timing relationships. However, there are
   some forms of CONTENT where it is critical that some timing
   relationships be met. The model refers to those forms of CONTENT as
   CONTINUOUS MEDIA.

Internet-Draft                   CDNPM                    September 2000


4.3 Understanding Peering

   The model offers a number of ways in which different CDNs can be
   interconnected.  An arrangement of interconnected REDIRECTION
   SYSTEMS is called REDIRECTION PEERING. Analogously, interconnected
   DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS give rise to DISTRIBUTION PEERING, and
   interconnected ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS give rise to ACCOUNTING PEERING.
   The communicating elements on each side are referred to as PEERING
   SYSTEMS. So when two or more DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS may be
   interconnected by PEERING, it is actually the DISTRIBUTION PEERING
   SYSTEMS that are communicating with each other to accomplish the
   exchange of information required.  A CONTENT PEERING GATEWAY (CPG)
   is a generic term used in the model for one or more PEERING SYSTEMS
   when it is not important to distinguish the PEERING SYSTEM or form
   of PEERING involved.

   CPGs exchange ADVERTISEMENTS. There are three main kinds of
   ADVERTISEMENT: REDIRECTION ADVERTISEMENTS, DISTRIBUTION
   ADVERTISEMENTS, and ACCOUNTING ADVERTISEMENTS. A REDIRECTION
   ADVERTISEMENT describes a collection of URLs whose content can be
   delivered by redirection through the corresponding CDN.  A
   DISTRIBUTION ANNOUNCEMENT describes the service level(s) available
   from a CDN's SURROGATES (as a whole) to some collection of CLIENT
   addresses. An ACCOUNTING ANNOUNCEMENT a collection of CLIENT
   addresses, and the level of service that it can offer for delivering
   content to those CLIENTS.

4.4 Content Signalling

   CDNs operate on behalf of PUBLISHERs and ORIGINs and therefore must
   provide accurate, up-to-date copies of CONTENT. A CDN DISTRIBUTION
   SYSTEM may deliver CONTENT SIGNALS to relevant SURROGATES when
   appropriate. In the presence of peering, CONTENT SIGNALS must be
   propagated to the each SURROGATE with a copy of the relevant
   CONTENT.

5. Security Considerations

   [Editor's Note: Discuss the issues of delegated authority and trust
   between CDNs and Origin Servers.]

   [Editor's Note: Discuss man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service
   attacks on peered CDNs.]

   [Editor's Note: Consider problem of incorrect advertisements of
   content or service levels. Need to ensure that there are means
   within the protocol or recommended practices so that CDNs aren't
   encouraged to pull traffic they can't really handle.]
