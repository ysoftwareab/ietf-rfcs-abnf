1.  Introduction

   Sieve Email Filtering Language [RFC5228] is a popular email filtering
   language used upon final mail delivery.  Popularity of Sieve resulted
   in a myriad of Sieve extensions that can interact with each other in
   wonderful and complex ways.  There is currently no easy way to find
   out all actions defined by Sieve extensions published in RFCs, which
   make it quite difficult for Sieve extension writers and Sieve
   implementation developers to forsee interactions between Sieve
   actions.

   This document creates a registry of Sieve [RFC5228] actions in order
   to help developers and Sieve extension writers track interactions
   between different extensions.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for Sieve actions (see
   Section 2.9 of [RFC5228]).  The registration template contains 1)
   name of the action, 2) short description, 3) one of more document
   describing it and any significant updates (references), 4) name(s) of
   Sieve capabilit(ies) associated with the Sieve action being
   registered, 5) interactions with other Sieve actions, if any and 6)
   flag specifying whether the action cancels implicit keep (see
   Section 2.10.2 of [RFC5228]).

   [[Optional "comment" field?]]

   Registration procedure for this registry is Expert Review.  The
   Designated Expert only checks that the name of the action being
   registered matches documentation, that the description field is
   accurate, that the correct documents are referenced and that the list
   of relevant documents is as complete as possible.  The Designated
   Expert can't reject a registration based on personal dislike of the
   document defining an action and should always err on the side of
   registering, even if documentation is not complete.

   Addition of a new reference or change to the description field goes
   through the same registration procedure as a new registration.

3.  Open Issues

   [[This section should be empty before publication]]

   Should we include information for IMAP Sieve (RFC 6785)?

   Shall vendor specific actions be allowed to be registered?

4.  Security Considerations

   The sole purpose of this document is to create a new IANA registry,
   so it doesn't create new security considerations for Sieve.

   The new registry should help Sieve extension writers and Sieve
   implementors track interactions between different Sieve actions, so
   it might improve quality of specifications and implementations,
   including security aspects.
