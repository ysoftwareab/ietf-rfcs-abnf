              Packet Generation in Service Function Chains
                       draft-penno-sfc-packet-00

Abstract

   Service Functions (e.g., Firewall, NAT, Proxies and Intrusion
   Prevention Systems) generate packets in the reverse flow direction to
   the source of the current in-process packet/flow.  In this document
   we discuss and propose how to support this required functionality
   within the SFC framework.

1.  Introduction

   Service Functions (e.g., Firewall, NAT, Proxies and Intrusion
   Prevention Systems) generate packets in the reverse flow direction
   destined to the source of the current in-process packet/flow.  This
   is a basic intrinsic functionality and therefore needs to be
   supported in a service function chaining deployment.

2.  Problem Statement

   The challenge of this functionality in service chain environments is
   that generated packets need to traverse in the reverse order the same
   Service Functions traversed by original packet that triggered the
   packet generation.

   Although this might seem to be a straightforward problem, on further
   inspection there are a few interesting challenges that need to be
   solved.  First and foremost a few requirements need to be met in
   order to allow a packet to make its way through back to its source
   through the service path:

   o  A symmetric path ID needs to exist.  Symmetric path is discussed
      in [SymmetricPaths]

   o  The SF needs to be able encapsulate such error or proxy packets in
      a encapsulation transport such as VXLAN-GPE
      [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] + NSH header [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh]

   o  The SF needs to be able to determine, directly or indirectly, the
      symmetric path ID and associated next service-hop index or
      indicate reverse path for the service path ID in the original
      packet (TBD: verify or part)

3.  Definitions and Acronyms

   The reader should be familiar with the terms contained in
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] ,[I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] and
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe]

4.  Service Function Behavior

   When a Service Function wants to send packets to the reverse
   direction back to the source it needs to know the symmetric service
   path ID (if it exists) and associated service index.  This
   information is not available to Service Functions since they do not
   need to perform a next-hop service lookup.  There are four
   recommended approaches to solve this problem and we assume different
   implementations might make different implementation choices.  (Editor
   note: "if it exists?", reverse service path ID is required on SF or
   SFF)

   1.  The SF can receive service path forwarding information in the
       same manner a SFF does.  (Editor's note: not sure about this?
       SFF looks up next hop based on SPID/SI for normal SFF forwarding.
       In this case, SF needs to add the reverse SPID/SI which is
       similar to OAM support)

   2.  The SF can send the packet in the forward direction but set
       appropriate bits in the NSH header requesting a SFF to send the
       packet back to the source

   3.  The classifier can encode all information the SF needs to send a
       reverse packet in the metadata header

   4.  The controller uses a deterministic algorithm when creating the
       associated symmetric path ID and service index.

   We will discuss the ramifications of these approaches in the next
   sections.

4.1.  SF receives Reverse Forwarding Information

   This solution is easy to understand but brings a change on how
   traditionally service functions operate.  It requires SFs to receive
   and process a subset of the information a SFF does.  When a SF wants
   to send a packet to the source, the SF uses information conveyed via
   the control plane to impose the correct NSH.

   Advantages:

   o  Changes are restricted to SF and controller, no changes to SFF

   o  Incremental deployment possible

   o  No protocol between SF and SFF, which avoids interoperability
      issues

   o  No performance penalty on SFF due to in or out-of-band protocol

   Disadvantages:

   o  SFs need to process and understand Rendered Service Path messages
      from controller

   This solution can be characterized by putting the burden on the SF,
   but that brings the advantage of being self-contained (as well as
   providing a mechanism for other features).  Also, many SFs have
   policy or classification function which in fact makes them a
   classifier and SF combination in practice.

4.2.  SF requests SFF cooperation

   These solutions can be characterized by distributing the burden
   between SF and SFF.  In this section we discuss two possible in-band

   solutions: using OAM header and using a reserved bit 'R' in the NSH
   header.

4.2.1.  OAM Header

   When the SF needs to send a packet in the reverse direction it will
   set the OAM bit in the NSH header and use an OAM protocol
   [I-D.penno-sfc-trace] to request that the SFF impose a new, reverse-
   path NSH.  Post imposition, the SFF forwards the packet correctly.

   o  SF does not need to process and understand control plane path
      messages.

   o  Clear division of labor between SF and SFF.

   o  Extensible

   o  Original NSH header could be carried inside OAM protocol which
      leaves metadata headers available for SF-SFF communication.

   Disadvantages:

   o  SFFs need to process and understand a new OAM message type

   o  Possible interoperability issues between SF-SFF

   o  SFF Performance penalty

4.2.2.  Service Function Forwarder Behavior

   In the case where the SF has all the information to send the packet
   back to the origin then no changes are needed at the SFF.  When an SF
   requests SFF cooperation the SFF MUST be able to process the OAM
   message used to signal reverse-path forwarding:

   o  Process/decode OAM message

   o  Examine and act on any metadata present in the NSH header

   o  Examine its forwarding tables and find the symmetric path-id and
      index of the next service-hop

   The symmetric path can be found in the Rendered Service Path Yang
   model [RSPYang] and is conveyed to the SFF when a path is
   constructed.

   If a SFF does not understand the OAM message it just forwards the
   packet based on the original path-id and index.  Since it is a
   special OAM packet, it tell other SFF and SF that they should process
   it differently.  For example, a downstream intrusion detection SF
   might not associated flow state with this packet.

4.2.3.  Reserved bit

   In this solution the SF sets a reversed bit in the NSH that carries
   the semantic as the OAM solution discussed previously.  This solution
   is simpler from a SF perspective but requires allocating one of the

Internet-Draft             SFC packet reverse             September 2015


   reversed bits.  Another issue is that the metadata in the original
   packet might be overwritten by SFs or SFFs in the path.

   When SFF received the reversed bit, it shall look up a preprogrammed
   table to map the Service Path ID and Index in the NSH into a new
   Service Path ID and Index.  The SFF would then use the ID and Index
   pair to determine the SF/SFF which is in the reverse direction.

   Advantages:

   o  No protocol header overhead

   o  Limited performance impact on SF

   Disadvantages:

   o  Use of a reserved bit

   o  SFF Performance penalty

   o  Not extensible

4.3.  Classifier Encodes Information

   This solution allows the Service Function to send a reverse packet
   without interactions with the controller or SFF, therefore it is very
   attractive.  Also, it does not need to have the OAM bit set or use a
   reserved bit.  The penalty is that for a MD Type-1 packet a
   significant amount of information (48 bits) need to be encoded in the
   metadata section of the packet and this data can not be overwritten.
   Ideally this metadata would need to be added by the classifier.

   The Rendered Service Path yang model [RSPYang] already provides all
   the necessary information that a classifier would need to add to the
   metadata header.  An explanation of this method is better served with
   an examples.

4.3.1.  Symmetric Service Paths

   The figure below shows a simple SFC with symmetric service paths
   comprising three SFs.

   We will assume the classifier will encode the following information
   in the metadata:

   o  symmetric path-id = 2 (24 bits)

   o  symmetric starting index = 253 (8 bits)

   o  symmetric number of hops = 3 (8 bits)

   o  starting index = 255 (8 bits)

   In the method below we will assume SF will generate a reverse packet
   after decrementing the index of the current packet.  We will call
   that current index.

   If SF1 wants to generate a reverse packet it can find the appropriate
   index by applying the following algorithm:

current_index = 252

remaining_hops = symmetric_number_hops - starting_index - current_index
remaining_hops = 3 - (255 - 252) = 0
reverse_service_index = symmetric_starting_index - remaining_hops - 1
reverse_service_index = next_service_hop_index = 253 - 0 - 1 = 252
The "-1"  is necessary for the service index to point to the next service_hop.

   If SF2 wants to send reverse packet:

   current index = 253

4.3.2.  Asymmetric Service Paths

   In real world the forward and reverse paths can be asymmetric,
   comprising different set of SFs or SFs in different orders.  The
   following figure illustrates an example.  The forward path is
   composed of SF1, SF2, SF4 and SF5, while the reverse path skips SF5
   and has SF3 in place of SF2.

 Figure 3: SFC example with asymmetric paths

   An asymmetric SFC can have completely independent forward and reverse
   paths.  An SF's location in the forward path can be different from
   that in the reverse path.  An SF may appear in one direction of path
   only.  In order to use the same algorithm to calculate the service
   index generated by an SF, one design option is to insert special NOP
   SFs in the rendered service paths so that each SF is positioned
   symmetrically in the forward and reverse rendered paths.  The SFP
   corresponding to the example above is:

   SFP1 Forward -> SF1 : SF2 : NOP : SF4 : SF5

   SFP2 Reverse <- SF1 : NOP : SF3 : SF4 : NOP

   The NOP SF is assigned with a sequential service index the same way
   as a regular SF.  The SFF receiving a packet with the service path ID
   and service index corresponding to a NOP SF should advance the

   service index till the service index points to a regular SF.
   Implementation can use a loopback interface or other methods on the
   SFF to skip the NOP SFs.

   Once the NOP SF is inserted in the rendered service paths, the
   forward and reverse paths become symmetric.  The same algorithm can
   be applied by the SFs to generate service indexes in the opposite
   directional path.  The following tables list the service indexes
   corresponding to the example above.

   Cur SI = Current Service Index

4.3.3.  Analysis

   Advantages:

   o  SF does not need to request SFF cooperation or contact controller

   o  No SFF performance impact

   Disadvantages:

   o  Metadata overhead in case MD-Type 2 is used

   o  Relies on classifier or SFF to encode metadata information

   o  If classifier will encode information it needs to receive and
      process rendered service path information

   o  SFF needs to decrement NOP associated indexes

4.4.  Reversed Path derived using Forward Path ID and Index Method

   In this simplified model, no extra storage is required from the NSH
   and SFF does not need to know how to handle the reversed packet nor
   does it know about it.  Reverse Path is programmed by Orchestrator
   and used by SF having the need to send upstream traffic.

   Instead of defining a new Service Path ID, the same Service Path ID
   is used.  The Orchestrator must define the reverse chain of service
   using a different range of Service Path Index.  It is also assumed
   that the reverse packet must go through the same number of Services
   as its forward path.  It is proposed that Service Path Index (SPI)
   1..127 and 255..129 are the exact mirror of each other.

   Here is an example: SF1, SF2, and SF3 are identified using Service
   Path Index (SPI) 8, 7 and 6 respectively.

   Path 100 Index 8 - SF1

   Path 100 Index 7 - SF2

   Path 100 Index 6 - SF3

   Path 100 Index 5 - Terminate

   At the same time, Orchestrator programs SPI 248, 249 and 250 as SF1,
   SF2 and SF3.  Orchestrator also programs SPI 247 as "terminate".
   Reverse-SPI = 256 - SPI.

Internet-Draft             SFC packet reverse             September 2015


   Path 100 Index 247 - Terminate

   Path 100 Index 248 (256 - 8) - SF1

   Path 100 Index 249 (256 - 7) - SF2

   Path 100 Index 250 (256 - 6) - SF3

   If SF3 needs to send the packet in reverse direction, it calculates
   the new SPI as 256 - 6 (6 is the SPI of the packet) and obtained 250.
   It then subtract the SPI by 1 and send the packet back to SFF

   Subsequently, SFF received the packet and sees the SPI 249.  It then
   diverts the packet to SF2, etc.  Eventually, the packet SPI will drop
   to 247 and the SFF will strip off the NSH and deliver the packet.

   The same mechanism works even if SF1 later decided to send back
   another upstream packet.  The packet can ping-pong between SF1 and
   SF3 using existing mechanism.

   Advantages:

   o  No precious NSH area is consumed

   o  SF self-contained solution

   o  No SFF performance impact and no cooperation needed

   o  No Special Classification required

   Disadvantages:

   o  SPI range is reduced and may become incompatible with existing
      topology

   o  Assumption that the reverse path Service Functions are the same as
      forward path, only in reverse

   o  Reverse paths need to use Service Index = 128 for loop detection
      instead of SI = 0.

   An alternative to reducing Service Path Index range is to make use of
   a different Service Path ID, e.g. the most significant bit.  The bit
   can be flipped when the SF needs to send packet in reverse.  However,
   the negation of the SPI is still required, e.g.  SPI 6 becomes SPI
   250

Internet-Draft             SFC packet reverse             September 2015


   In either case, the SF must have the knowledge through Orchestrator
   that the reverse path has been programmed and the method (SPI only or
   SPI + SPID bit) to use.

   The mechanism to insert NOP to keep reverse path symmetric as
   described in section 4.3.2 can be applied in this method as well.

5.  Other solutions

   We explored other solution that we deemed to complex or that would
   bring a severe performance penalty:

   o  An out-of-band request-response protocol between SF-SFF.  Given
      that some service functions need to be able to generate packets
      quite often this will would create a considerable performance
      penalty.  Specially given the fact that path-ids (and their
      symmetric counterpart) might change and SF would not be notified,
      therefore caching benefits will be limited.

   o  An out-of-band request-response protocol between SF-Controller.
      Given that admin or network conditions can trigger service path
      creation, update or deletions a SF would not be aware of new path
      attributes.  The controller should be able to push new information
      as it becomes available to the interested parties.

   o  SF (or SFF) punts the packet back to the controller.  This
      solution obviously has severe scaling limitations.

6.  Implementation

   The solutions "Reversed Path derived using Forward Path ID and Index
   Method" and "SF receives Reverse Forwarding Information" were
   implemented in Opendaylight
