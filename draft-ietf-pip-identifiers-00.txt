Abstract

   Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP
   version 4.  The Pip header defines source and destination ID fields
   whose function it is to only identify the source and destination of a
   Pip packet--they have no routing significance.  While Pip systems
   treat the IDs as flat for the purpose of identification, it is useful
   to have hierarchical structure in the ID for other purposes, such as
   for doing a reverse DNS lookup on the ID.  This internet-draft
   defines the structure of Pip IDs.


Acknowledgements

   I want to thank John Curren and Bob Smart for their observations on
   the need for administrative structure in Pip IDs that led to this
   draft.

1.  Introduction


   Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP ver-
   sion 4.  The Pip header defines source and destination ID fields
   whose function, in the context of processing Pip headers, is to only
   identify the source and destination of a Pip packet--they have no
   routing significance.  While Pip systems treat the IDs as flat for
   the purpose of identification, it is useful to have hierarchical
   structure in the ID for other purposes, such as for doing a reverse
   DNS lookup on the ID.  This internet-draft defines the structure of
   Pip IDs.

   Pip IDs have the following characteristics:

   1.   They are globally unique binary strings 8 octets in length.

   2.   They are hierarchically structured.

   3.   Each component of the hierarchy is contiguous, and each
        hierarchical component is adjacent to its parent and child com-
        ponents.

   4.   The hierarchical structure is self-describing.  That is, the
        hierarchical structure can be determined by examination of the
        ID alone.

   5.   Pip IDs may be used for group identification, but such a Pip ID
        is not self-describing as being a group Pip ID.

   6.   Certain Pip IDs are well-known and have local meaning, such as
        "all routers on the subnet" and "this host".

   Pip IDs are formed by a hierarchy of number authorities, each of
   which is responsible for assigning the next lower level of the
   hierarchy.  While it is the intent that the hierarchical structure of
   Pip IDs follow administrative hierarchy (versus, for instance, topo-
   logical hierarchy), it is up to each number authority to determine
   how the next level is assigned.

   The top-level number authority for Pip IDs is the Internet Assigned
   Number Authority (IANA).

2.  Pip ID structure


   Semantically, the Pip ID is a series of integers, with each integer
   being hierarchically above the following one.  For instance, the Pip
   ID 12.96.4993.5 has four levels of hierarchy.  The IANA assigned the
   top-level (12).  The number authority represented by the top-level
   number 12 assigned the following level (96), and so on.

   The encoding of a Pip ID is similar to (but not the same as) that of
   the Object Identifier encoding in ASN.1.  That is, it is encoded as a
   series of (eight) octets, with the first bit of each octet indicating
   whether the next octet is part of the same integer or a new integer.
   If the first bit of the octet is 0, then it is the last octet of the
   integer.  If the first bit of the octet is 1, then the following
   octet is part of the same integer.

   For instance, the integer 127 is encoded as 01111111.  The integer
   128, however, is encoded as 10000001 00000000.  The leading 1 in the
   first octet indicates that the next octet is part of the same
   integer. The leading 0 is the second octet indicates that it is the
   final octet of the integer.  The value 128 comes from concatinating
   the seven least significant bits from each of the two octets.

   In encoded form, all Pip IDs are padded out to the full 8 octets.
   The pad octets consist of the value 10000000.  This is how the Pip ID
   encoding differs from the ASN.1 Object Identifier encoding.  In the
   ASN.1 encoding, an octet of 1000 0000 is illegal, because it
   represents a "wasted" octet in the case where the string of octets is
   variable length.

   As another example, consider the Pip ID 12.96.4993.5.  It is encoded
   as:

   12                00001100
   96                01100000
   4993              10100111 00000001
   5                 00000101
   pad               10000000 10000000 10000000

   The 12 and 96 take up one octet each.  The 4993 is greater than 127
   (largest 7-bit integer), but smaller than 16383 (largest 14-bit
   integer), so it requires 2 octets.  The 5 is the final digit.  The
   remaining 3 octets are padded with 10000000.

3.  Pip ID Assignments


   The following Pip ID assignments exist:


3.1.  IP Address


   An IP address can be used to create a Pip ID.  Thus, anybody with an
   IP address can use it to form a globally unique Pip ID.  The two for-
   mats for a Pip ID formed from an IP address are:

      1.net.subnetHost.x
      1.netSubnetHost.x

   where the lowest level (x) is optional.  All two formats have a top-
   level (IANA-assigned) integer of value 1.  This is followed by the
   two ways shown above to transform the IP address into the Pip ID.
   After this comes any additional levels of hierarchy that the number
   authority represented by the IP address wishes to append.

   The first format has at least 3 hierarchy levels.  The network number
   is the second, and the subnet and host field combined (what was ori-
   ginally called the Host field, before subnetting was invented) is the
   last level.  The second format has at least 2 hierarchy levels.  The
   second level is a single integer formed from the 32-bit IP address.

   Thus, the IP address 129.47.233.181, with subnet mask 255.255.255.192
   can form at least the following two Pip IDs:

        Decimal dot notation    Pip ID encoding (hex)
        --------------------    ---------------
        1.33071.59829           01 82 82 2f 83 d3 35 80
        1.2167400885            01 88 89 bf d3 b5 80 80

   Each of these IP-generated Pip IDs represents a different Pip ID.
   The first Pip ID (1.33071.59829) has one octet of "padding" (the
   second to the last octet, x80).  Thus, the owner of this IP address
   could append one additional level of hierarchy to form up to 127
   additional Pip IDs (1.33071.59829.0 through 1.33071.59829.127).  Note
   that the Pip ID 1.33071.59829.0 is different from the Pip ID
   1.33071.59829.  The former has encoding 01 82 82 2f 87 26 35 80 while
   the latter has encoding 01 82 82 2f 87 26 35 00.
      Note:  This form of ID is ugly in that the IP address is not

      easily extracted from the ID.  Another possible form is to pick a
      unique value for the first 4 octets, and simply encode the full 32
      bits of IP address in the last four octets of the ID.  The disad-
      vantage of this form is that it breaks the rules of the ASN.1-like
      notation of the ID.



3.2.  IEEE 802 Address


   An IEEE 802 address can be used to create a Pip ID.  Thus, anybody
   with an IEEE 802 address can use it to form a globally unique Pip ID.

   The format for an IEEE 802 Pip ID is:

   2.IEEE802address

   The top-level integer is value "2".  The remainder of the Pip ID is a
   single IEEE 802 address.  Since the IEEE 802 address is 48 bits in
   length, and since the remaining 7 octets only encode 49 bits, there
   is no room for a third level of hierarchy.



3.3.  Flat Well-Known IDs


   There are any number of uses for identifying systems of a certain
   type, rather than specific systems.  For instance, an ID for "all
   routers on the LAN" is useful for router discovery.  This specifica-
   tion defines the following well-known Pip IDs.  These well-known Pip
   IDs consist of a single hierarchy level (the top-level), but are so
   large that only one level of hierarchy is possible.

      Any Router
           Decimal dot notation = 2^56-1
           Pip ID encoding      = ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fe

      Any Host
           Decimal dot notation = 2^56-2
           Pip ID encoding      = ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fd

      Any System
           Decimal dot notation = 2^56-3

INTERNET-DRAFT              Pip Identifiers                November 1992


           Pip ID encoding      = ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fc

   The above three well-known Pip IDs serve for functions such as "all
   routers on a subnet", for instance in configuration algorithms such
   as router discovery.  Other well-known Pip IDs are expected to be
   defined in the future.



3.4.  Country Codes


   While it is probably adequate to assign top-level Pip ID numbers
   directly to organizations, there may be good reasons to assign them
   to countries.  One reason is that it reduces the administrative bur-
   den on IANA for assigning top-level numbers to every possible organi-
   zation.  Another reason is that the number of organizations in the
   world may be large enough that a layer of hierarchy above the organi-
   zation is needed for such purposes as ID-to-name directory service
   lookups.

   Therefore, this specification has reserved a block of numbers for
   country codes.  The actual number values have not yet been assigned.
   A consideration in assigning these numbers is whether the number
   takes up one octet or two octets.  A one octet number leaves more
   room for further assignment, and is therefore more desirable.  How-
   ever, there are enough countries that not all of them can have a
   one-octet top-level number (ISO 3166 lists 235 countries).

   A reasonable approach to assigning these numbers, however, would be
   to assign one-octet values to those countries with the largest Gross
   National Produce (GNP) or population.  CCITT assigns 1 or 2-digit
   E.164 country codes to 47 countries (and 3-digit country codes to the
   remaining countries), so it is probably reasonable to give the 47 or
   so countries with the highest GNPs one-octet country codes, and
   assign 2-octet codes to the remaining countries.  (The 8 most popu-
   lous nations are among the 40 nations with highest GNP.)

   Therefore, this standard tentatively reserves top-level numbers 80 -
   127 for those countries with the highest GNPs, and 128 - 316 for the
   remaining countries.
