Type           = the GIMPS message type (Query, Response, etc.)
AB=00 ("Mandatory"): If the object is not understood, the entire
      message containing it must be rejected with an error indication.

AB=01 ("Ignore"): If the object is not understood, it should be
      deleted and then the rest of the message processed as usual.

AB=10 ("Forward"): If the object is not understood, it should be
      retained unchanged in any message forwarded as a result of message
      processing, but not stored locally.

AB=11 ("Refresh"): If the object is not understood, it should be
      incorporated into the locally stored signaling application state
      for this flow/session, forwarded in any resulting message, and
      also used in any refresh or repair message which is generated
      locally.

PI-Length = the byte length of the Peer-Identity field

               0 if this object is carried in connection mode
IP-TTL    = initial or reported IP-TTL
IP-Ver    = the IP version for the Interface-Address field

Prof-Count = The number of profiles in the proposal

MRI-Length = the word length of the included MRI payload
Type-Count = the number of GIMPS payloads translated by the
                NAT; the Type numbers are included as a list
                (padded with 2 null bytes if necessary)
NAT-Count  = the number of NATs traversed by the message, and the
                number of opaque NAO-related payloads at the end
                of the object
