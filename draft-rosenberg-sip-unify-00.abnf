a=pickone: It has been proposed on the mailing lists that the
             caller could include all of their codecs in the SDP, but
             include a new attribute, "a=pickone" which tells the callee
             to just pick one of them when responding. This approach is
             somewhat specialized, and is not backwards compatible.
