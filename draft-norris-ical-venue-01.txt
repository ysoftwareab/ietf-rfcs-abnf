Abstract

   The currently existing iCalendar standard (RFC 2445) provides only a
   simple text field ("LOCATION" property) for specifying the location
   where an event (or "TODO" item) will occur.  While this may be
   adequate for human readers, it is difficult for automated systems to
   make use of.  With the recent advent of tools and services (event
   aggregators, for example) which would benefit greatly from structured
   location data, the need to specify detailed venue information has
   become apparent.  This document describes a proposed method for
   addressing this need.

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to
   ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org and/or the authors.

   Note: This document depends on RFC2445bis, currently in draft status,
   and should not proceed without RFC2445bis.

Internet-Draft                 ical-venue                    August 2007


1.  Introduction

   This specification introduces a new iCalendar [RFC2445] component
   VVENUE to provide detailed venue information for an event.  The
   currently existing iCalendar standard (RFC 2445), and its proposed
   successor (RFC 2445bis) provide only a simple text field ("LOCATION"
   property) for specifying the location where an event (or "TODO" item)
   will occur.  This is inadequate for use cases where structured
   location information (e.g. address, region, country, postal code) is
   required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of iCalendar in
   those settings.

   This specification is targeted at communicating detailed information
   about venues at which events occur; it is not intended to provide the
   level of location information necessary for resource scheduling.

   an example iCalendar file including the proposed venue component.
   This example is for a Joe Bloggs concert occuring at The Venue in San

   The "VVENUE" component works similarly to "VTIMEZONE".  It is
   referenced by parameter from the "LOCATION" property of a "VEVENT".

4.  Venue Identifier Parameter

   Parameter Name: "VVENUE"

   Purpose: To specify the identifier for the venue definition for a
   venue component in the property value.

   Format Definition:
     venueparam  = "VVENUE" "=" paramtext

   Description: The parameter MAY be specified on the "LOCATION"
   property when detailed information about the venue is available.

   Example: The following is an example of this property parameter as
   part of a LOCATION property in a VEVENT:

     LOCATION;VVENUE=1234@events.example.com:Novell\, Inc.\n1860
     South Novell Place\nBuilding H\, Executive Briefing Center\nProvo\,

5.  Venue Component

   Component Name: "VVENUE"

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe an
   event venue.

   Format Definition: A "VVENUE" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:
     venuec  = "BEGIN" ":" "VVENUE" CRLF
             venueprop
             "END" ":" "VVENUE" CRLF

     venueprop  = *(

               ; the following are all REQUIRED,
               ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

               uid

               ; the following are optional,
               ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

               name / description / street-address / extended-address /
               locality / region / country / postal-code / tzid / geo /
               location-type / categories

               ; the following are optional,
               ; and MAY occur more than once

               tel / url
             )

   Description: A "VVENUE" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties that represent a venue where an event occurs.  This
   extends the "LOCATION" property of "VEVENT" and "TODO" components,
   providing the ability to specify detailed information about the event
   venue.

   Example: The following is an example of the "VVENUE" calendar
   component used to represent the The Venue in San Diego, California.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MAY be specified in a "VVENUE" calendar

5.10.  Telephone Property

   Purpose: This property specifies a telephone number for a location.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters, including the
   TYPE parameter, can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MAY be specified in a "VVENUE" calendar

Internet-Draft                 ical-venue                    August 2007


   when the IANA location-type designation is available.

   Example: The following is an example of this property:
       LOCATION-TYPE:club, bar, restaurant

   Although categories and location type tokens are perhaps similar,
   they serve rather different purposes.  Location type tokens serve to
   categorize a VVENUE using a well-defined, finite list of
   possibilities (the IANA Location Type Registry).  Categories on the
   other hand are user-provided and user defined and have both a
   richness and "messiness" that allows user-created taxonomies to arise
   and evolve.

5.12.  TZID Use Within Venue Component

   Property Name: TZID

   Purpose: To specify the identifier for the time zone definition for a
   venue component.

   Description: The use of the TZID property within VVENUE is
   substantially similar to the use of the TZID parameter specified in
   RFC 2445 (iCalendar), extended to specify the time zone of a venue
   component.

   Where the TZID parameter specifies the identifier for the time zone
   definition for a time component, the TZID property conveys the same
   information for a venue component.

   An individual "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be specified for
   each unique "TZID" parameter value specified in the iCalendar object.

   Time zone calendar components may be shared between venue components
   and other components.  For instance, a venue component and an event
   component may both point to the same timezone component.

5.13.  GEO Property Use Within Venue Component

   The use of the GEO property within VVENUE is identical to that
   specified in RFC 2445 (iCalendar), extended simply to VVENUE.

5.14.  CATEGORIES Use Within Location Component

   The use of the CATEGORIES property within VVENUE is identical to that
   specified in RFC 2445 (iCalendar), extended simply to VVENUE.
