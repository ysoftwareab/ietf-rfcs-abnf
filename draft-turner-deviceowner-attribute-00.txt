Abstract 

   This document defines the deviceOwner attribute.  This attribute may 
   be carried in a public key certificate in the Subject Directory 
   Attributes extension, in an attribute certificate in the attribute 
   field, in a directory as an attribute, or in protocols that support 
   attributes.

Internet-Draft          Device Owner Attribute             October 2008 
    

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the Device Owner attribute.  This attribute 
   may be included in public key certificates [RFC5280], attribute 
   certificates [RFC3281], directories [X.500]/[RFC4512], or locations 
   that support attributes.  This attribute may be used in authorization 
   decisions. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The attributes are defined using ASN.1 [X.680]. 

2. Device Owner 

   The Device Owner attribute indicates the country or organization that 
   owns the Device with which this attribute is associated.  Device 
   Owner is a choice of ISO 3166 [ISO3166-1] and [ISO3166-2] country 
   codes or an object identifier that represents a group of nations, an 
   organization, or any entity other than a nation.  One of the choices 
   MUST be present. 

   The following object identifier identifies the Device Owner 
   attribute: 

     id-aa-KP-deviceOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 69 
     } 

   The ASN.1 syntax for the Device Owner attribute is as follows: 

     deviceOwner ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
       WITH SYNTAX    DeviceOwner 
       SINGLE VALUE   TRUE 
       IDENTIFIED BY  id-deviceOwner 
     }

Internet-Draft          Device Owner Attribute             October 2008 
    

     DeviceOwner  ::= CHOICE { 
       alpha2Country  [0] PrintableString ( SIZE (2) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-1 2 Letter Codes (aka digram) 
       alpha3Country  [1] PrintableString ( SIZE (3) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-1 3 Letter Codes (aka trigram) 
       alpha4Country  [2] PrintableString ( SIZE (4) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-2 4 Letter Codes (ISO 3166-1 digram and a hyphen 
         -- followed by one alpha or numeric code). 
       alpha5Country  [3] PrintableString ( SIZE (5) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-2 5 Letter Codes (ISO 3166-1 digram and a hyphen 
         -- followed by two alpha or numeric code). 
       alpha6Country  [4] PrintableString ( SIZE (6) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-2 6 Letter Codes (ISO 3166-1 digram and a hyphen 
         -- followed by three alpha or numeric code). 
       numericCountry     INTEGER ( SIZE (3) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-1 3 Digit Codes 
       group              OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
     } 

   There must only be one value of Device Owner associated with a 
   device. 

3. Security Considerations 

   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the 
   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must ensure 
   that the correct value is applied.  Further, once applied to the 
   object it must be bound to the object; this binding is normally 
   performed by digitally signing over the object and the attribute to 
   ensure data integrity. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
