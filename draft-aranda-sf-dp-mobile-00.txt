    Service Function Chaining Dataplane Elements in Mobile Networks 
                      draft-aranda-sf-dp-mobile-00


Abstract

   The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge for the
   infrastructure. The targeted services and the full deployment of
   virtualization in all segments of the network will need service
   function chains that previously resided in the(local and remote)
   infrastructure of the Network operators to extend to the radio access
   network (RAN).

   The objective of this draft is to provide a non-exhaustive but
   representative list of service functions in 4G and 5G networks. We
   base on the problem statement [RFC 7498] and architecture framework
   [SFC-Arch] of the working group, as well on the existing mobile
   networks use cases [SFC-mobile-uc] and the requirement gathering
   process of different initiatives around the world [5GPPP, IMT2020,
   5G-FK, IMT2020-CN ] to anticipate network elements that will be
   needed in 5G networks.

1.2  General scope of mobile service chains

   Current mobile access networks terminate at a mobile service creation
   point   (called Packet Gateway) typically located at the edge of an
   operator IP backbone. Within the mobile network, the user payload is
 


Aranda Gutierrez et.al.  Expires April 7, 2016                  [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT     SFC DP Elements in Mobile Networks    October 5, 2015


   encapsulated in 3GPP specific tunnels terminating eventually at the
   P-GW. In many cases application-specific IP traffic is not directly
   exchanged between the original mobile network, more specific the P-
   GW, and an application platform, but will be forced to pass a set of
   service functions. Network operators use these service functions to
   differentiate their services.

   In order to cope with the stringent requirements of 5G networks (cf.
   Section 1.3), we expect a new architecture to appear. This
   architecture will surely make extensive use of virtualisation up to
   the RAN. We also expect that IP packets will need to be processed
   much earlier that in the current 3GPP architecture. In this context,
   it is foreseeable that Service Function Chaining will play a
   substantial role when managing the chains network traffic will
   traverse. We also expect new kinds of service functions specific to
   the radio access part to appear and that these new service functions
   will need to be managed by the SFC management infrastructure of the
   operator.

1.3  Requirements for 5G networks

   As set forth by the 5G-PPP [5GPPP], the evolution of the
   infrastructure towards 5G should enable the following features in the
   mobile environment:
   o Providing 1000 times higher wireless area capacity
   o Saving up to 90% of energy per service provided
   o Reducing the average service creation time cycle from 90 hours to
     90 minutes
   o Facilitating very dense deployments of wireless communication links
     to connect over 7 trillion wireless devices serving over 7 billion
     people

1.4 Evolution of the end-to-end carrier network

   [SFC-Mobile-UC]  presents the structure of end-to-end carrier
   networks and focused on the Service Function Chaining use cases for
   mobile carrier networks, such as current 3GPP- based networks. We
   recognise that other types of carrier networks that are currently
   deployed share similarities in the structure of the access networks
   and the service functions with mobile networks. The evolution towards
   5G networks will make the distinction between these different types
   of networks blur and eventually disappear.

   5G networks are expected to massively deploy virtualisation
   technologies from the radio elements to the core of the network. The
   four building blocks of the RAN, i.e. i) spectrum allocation or
   physical layer (PHY), i) Medium Access Control (MAC), iii) Radio Link
   Control (RLC) and iv) Packet Data Convergence, are candidates for

   virtualisation.

2. Mobile network overview

   [SFC-Mobile-UC] provides an overview of mobile networks up to LTE
   (Long Term Evolution) networks. As the specifications mature, we will
   provide the updates to the LTE architecture.

2.1. Building blocks of 4G and 5G networks

   The major functional components of an LTE network are shown in Figure
   2 and include user equipment (UE) like smartphones or tablets, the
   LTE radio unit named enhanced NodeB (eNB), the serving gateway (S-GW)
   which together with the mobility management entity (MME) takes care
   of mobility and the packet gateway (P-GW), which finally terminates
   the actual mobile service. These elements are described in detail in
   [TS.23.401]. Other important components are the home subscriber
   system (HSS), the Policy and Charging Rule Function (PCRF) and the
   optional components: the Traffic Detection Function (TDF) and the
   Traffic Steering Support Function (TSSF), which are described in
   [TS.23.203].  The P-GW interface towards the SGi-LAN is called the
   SGi-interface, which is described in [TS.29.061]. The TDF resides on
   this interface. Finally, the SGi-LAN is the home of service function
   chains (SFC), which are not standardized by 3GPP.

   according to 3GPP standards. Between the eNB, S-GW and P-GW user
   plane IP packets are encapsulated in 3GPP-specific tunnels. In some
   mobile carrier networks the 3GPP-specific tunnels between eNB and S-
   GW are even additionally IPSec-encrypted. More precisely, IPSec
   originates/ terminates at the eNB and on the other side at an IPSec-
   GW often placed just in front of the S-GW. For more details see
   [TS.29.281], [TS.29.274] and [TS.33.210].

   In this context, service function chains will not only act on user
   plane IP traffic, but also on the traffic in RAN. The way these will
   act on user traffic may depend not only depend on subscriber, service
   or network specific control plane metadata, but also on the state of
   the network at the particular location of the user.

2.2. Overview of mobile service chain elements in 4G networks and their
   evolution in 5G

   [SFC-Mobile-UC] provides an overview of the service chain elements in
   4G networks. Figure 3, extracted from it, shows the service chain
   topology in such networks.

   based traffic handling may be linked to individual service functions.
   In 5G networks, we expect the packet gateway (P-GW) to loose its
   central position and be integrated with functions in the RAN. Radio
   Resource Control (RRC) in 5G network will be integrated into the
   Control Plane environment.


2.3 Classification schemes for 5G networks

   TBD: We expect classification schemes for 5G networks to evolve as
   the standards appear.

3 Control plane considerations TBD: We except the RRC to be integrated
   with the SFC Control plane in 5G. 

4 Operator requirements

   4G mobile operators use service function chains to enable and
   optimize service delivery, offer network related customer services,
   optimize network behavior or protect networks against attacks and
   ensure privacy. Service function chains are essential to their
   business. Without these, mobile operators are not able to deliver the
   necessary and contracted Quality of Experience (QoE) or even certain
   products to their customers.

   As set forth by the 5G-PPP [5GPPP], the evolution of the
   infrastructure towards 5G should enable the following features in the
   mobile environment:

   o Providing 1000 times higher wireless area capacity

   o Saving up to 90% of energy per service provided

   o Reducing the average service creation time cycle from 90 hours to
     90 minutes

   o Facilitating very dense deployments of wireless communication links
     to connect over 7 trillion wireless devices serving over 7 billion
     people

   To meet these additional requirements, operators will need to make an
   extensive use of service chains and to extend their scope to
   functions in the Radio Access Network.

5  Security Considerations

   Organizational security policies must apply to ensure the integrity
   of the SFC environment. SFC will very likely handle user traffic and
   user specific information  in greater detail than the current service
   environments do today. This is reflected in the considerations of
   carrying more metadata through the service chains and the control
   systems of the service chains. This metadata will contain sensitive
   information about the user and the environment in which the user is
   situated. This will require proper considerations in the design,
   implementation and operations of such environments to preserve the
   privacy of the user and also the integrity of the provided metadata.


6  IANA Considerations
