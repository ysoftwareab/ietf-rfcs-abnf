               YANG Data Model for L3VPN service delivery
                 draft-ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model-13

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver a
   Layer 3 Provider Provisioned VPN service.  The document is limited to
   the BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFC4110 and RFC4364.  This
   model is intended to be instantiated at management system to deliver
   the overall service.  This model is not a configuration model to be
   used directly on network elements.  This model provides an abstracted
   view of the Layer 3 IPVPN service configuration components.  It will
   be up to a management system to take this as an input and use
   specific configurations models to configure the different network
   elements to deliver the service.  How configuration of network
   elements is done is out of scope of the document.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for Layer 3 IPVPN service
   configuration.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

1.2.  Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Section 5.

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Definitions

   Customer Edge (CE) Device: Equipment that is dedicated to a
   particular customer and is directly connected (at layer 3) to one or
   more PE devices via attachment circuits.  A CE is usually located at
   the customer premises, and is usually dedicated to a single VPN,
   although it may support multiple VPNs if each one has separate
   attachment circuits.

   Provider Edge (PE) Device: Equipment managed by the SP that can
   support multiple VPNs for different customers, and is directly
   connected (at layer 3) to one or more CE devices via attachment
   circuits.  A PE is usually located at an SP point of presence (PoP)
   and is managed by the SP.

   PE-Based VPNs: The PE devices know that certain traffic is VPN
   traffic.  They forward the traffic (through tunnels) based on the
   destination IP address of the packet, and optionally on based on
   other information in the IP header of the packet.  The PE devices are
   themselves the tunnel endpoints.  The tunnels may make use of various
   encapsulations to send traffic over the SP network (such as, but not
   restricted to, GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec, or MPLS tunnels).

3.  Layer 3 IP VPN service model

   A Layer 3 IPVPN service is a collection of sites that are authorized
   to exchange traffic between each other over a shared IP
   infrastructure.  This layer 3 VPN service model aims at providing a
   common understanding on how the corresponding IP VPN service is to be
   deployed over the shared infrastructure.  This service model is
   limited to BGP PE-Based VPNs as described in [RFC4110] and [RFC4364].

   Site A                                       Site B


   The idea of the L3 IPVPN service model is to propose an abstracted
   interface to manage configuration of components of a L3VPN service.
   A typical usage is to use this model as an input for an orchestration
   layer who will be responsible to translate it to orchestrated
   configuration of network elements who will be part of the service.
   The network elements can be routers, but also servers (like AAA), and
   not limited to these examples.  The configuration of network elements
   MAY be done by CLI, or by NetConf/RestConf coupled with specific
   configuration YANG data models (BGP, VRF, BFD ...) or any other way.

   The usage of this service model is not limited to this example, it
   can be used by any component of the management system but not
   directly by network elements.

5.  Design of the Data Model

   The YANG module is divided in three main containers : vpn-services,
   sites.

   The vpn-svc under vpn-services defines global parameters for the VPN
   service for a specific customer.

   A site is composed of at least one site-network-access and may have
   multiple site-network-access in case of multihoming.  The site-
   network-access attachment is done through a bearer with a connection
   (transport protocol) on top.  The bearer refers to properties of the
   attachment that are below layer 3 while the connection refers to
   layer 3 protocol oriented properties.  The bearer may be allocated
   dynamically by the service provider and the customer may provide some
   constraints or parameters to drive the placement.

   Authorization of traffic exchange is done through what we call a VPN
   policy or VPN topology defining routing exchange rules between sites.

   The figure below describe the overall structure of the YANG module:

5.1.  VPN service overview

   The vpn-svc container contains generic information about the VPN
   service.  The vpn-id of the vpn-svc refers to an internal reference
   for this VPN service, while customer name refers to a more explicit

   reference to the customer.  This identifier is purely internal to the
   organization responsible for the VPN service.  The vpn-id MUST be
   unique.

5.1.1.  VPN service topology

   The type of topology of the VPN is required for configuration.
   Current proposal supports : any-to-any, hub and spoke (where hubs can
   exchange traffic), and hub and spoke disjoint (where hubs cannot
   exchange traffic).  New topologies could be added by augmentation.
   By default, any-to-any topology is used.

5.1.1.1.  Route Target allocation

   Layer 3 PE-based VPN is built using route-targets as described in
   [RFC4364].  It is expected management system to allocate
   automatically set of route-targets upon a VPN service creation
   request.  How management system allocates route-targets is out of
   scope of the document but multiple ways could be envisaged as
   described below.

                                    Management system
                     <------------------------------------------------->
                                                 Request RT
                      +-----------------------+  Topo a2a   +----------+
           RestConf   |                       |  ----->     |          |
   User ------------- | Service Orchestration |             |NetworkOSS|
           l3vpn-svc  |                       |  <-----     |          |
             model    +-----------------------+   Response  +----------+
                                                  RT1,RT2

   In the example above, a service orchestration, owning the
   instantiation of this service model, request route-targets to the
   network OSS.  Based on the requested VPN topology, the network OSS
   replies with one or multiple route-targets.  The interface between
   this service orchestration and network OSS is out of scope of this
   document.

                      +---------------------------+


   In the example above, a service orchestration, owning the
   instantiation of this service model, owns one or more pools of route-
   target (filled by service provider) that can be allocated.  Based on
   the requested VPN topology, it will allocate one or multiple route-
   targets from the pool.

   The mechanism displayed above are just examples and SHOULD NOT be
   considered as exhaustive list of solutions.

5.1.1.2.  Any to any

   +------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  VPN1_Site1 ------ PE1               PE2 ------ VPN1_Site2 |

   +------------------------------------------------------------+

               Figure - Any to any VPN topology

   In the any to any topology, all VPN sites can discuss between each
   other without any restriction.  It is expected that the management
   system that owns a any to any IPVPN service request through this
   model, needs to assign and then configure the VRF and route-targets
   on the appropriate PEs.  In case of any to any, in general a single
   route-target is required and every VRF imports and exports this
   route-target.

5.1.1.3.  Hub and Spoke

   In the hub and spoke topology, all spoke sites can discuss only with
   Hub sites but not between each other.  Hubs can discuss also between
   each other.  It is expected that the management system that owns a
   any to any IPVPN service request through this model, needs to assign
   and then configure the VRF and route-targets on the appropriate PEs.
   In case of hub and spoke, in general a two route-targets are required
   (one route-target for Hub routes, one route-target for spoke routes).
   A Hub VRF, connecting Hub sites, will export Hub routes with Hub
   route-target, and will import Spoke routes through Spoke route-
   target.  It will also import the Hub route-target to allow Hub to Hub
   communication.  A Spoke VRF, connecting Spoke sites, will export
   Spoke routes with Spoke route-target, and will import Hub routes
   through Hub route-target.

   The management system MUST take into account Hub and Spoke
   connections constraints.  For example, if management system decides
   to mesh a spoke site and a hub site on the same PE, it needs to mesh
   connections in different VRFs as displayed in the figure below.


      Hub_Site ------- (VRF_Hub)  PE1
                                 (VRF_Spoke)

   +-------------------------------------------------------------+

             Figure - Hub and Spoke disjoint VPN topology

   In the hub and spoke disjoint topology, all spoke sites can discuss
   only with Hub sites but not between each other.  Hubs cannot discuss
   between each other.  It is expected that the management system that
   owns a any to any IPVPN service request through this model, needs to
   assign and then configure the VRF and route-targets on the
   appropriate PEs.  In case of hub and spoke, in general a two route-
   targets are required (one route-target for Hub routes, one route-
   target for spoke routes).  A Hub VRF, connecting Hub sites, will
   export Hub routes with Hub route-target, and will import Spoke routes

   through Spoke route-target.  A Spoke VRF, connecting Spoke sites,
   will export Spoke routes with Spoke route-target, and will import Hub
   routes through Hub route-target.

   The management system MUST take into account Hub and Spoke
   connections constraints as in the previous case.

   Hub and spoke disjoint can also be seen as two hub and spoke VPNs
   sharing with a common set of spoke sites.

5.1.2.  Cloud access

   The proposed model provides cloud access configuration through the
   cloud-access container.  The usage of cloud-access is targeted for
   public cloud.  Internet access can also be considered as a public
   cloud access service.  The cloud-access container provides parameters
   for network address translation and authorization rules.

   Private cloud access may be addressed through NNIs as described in
   Section 5.14.

   A cloud identifier is used to reference the target service.  This
   identifier is local to each administration.

   If NAT is required to access to the cloud, the nat-enabled leaf MUST
   be set to true.  A NAT address may be provided in customer-nat-
   address, in case the customer is providing the public IP address for
   the cloud access.  If service provider is providing the NAT address,
   customer-nat-address is not necessary as it can be picked from a
   service provider pool.

   By default, all sites in the IPVPN MUST be authorized to access to
   the cloud.  In case restrictions are required, a user MAY configure
   the authorized-sites and denied-sites list.  The authorization-sites
   defines the list of sites authorized for cloud access.  The denied-
   sites defines the list of sites denied for cloud access.  The model
   supports both "deny all except" and "accept all except"
   authorization.

   The "deny all except" behavior is obtained by filling only the
   authorized-sites.  All the sites listed will be authorized, all
   others will be denied.

   The "accept all except" behavior is obtained by filling only the
   denied-sites.  All the sites listed will be denied, all others will
   be authorized.

   Defining both denied-sites and authorized-sites MUST be processed as
   "deny all except", so the denied-sites will have not effect.

   How the restrictions will be configured on network elements is out of
   scope of this document and will be specific to each deployment.

   In the example above, we may configure the global VPN to access
   Internet by creating a cloud-access pointing to the cloud identifier
   for Internet service.  No authorized-sites will be configured as all
   sites are required to access to Internet.  NAT-enabled will be set to
   true and a nat-address will be configured.

   <vpn-svc>
       <vpn-id>ZKITYHJ054687</vpn-id>

        </cloud-access>
       </cloud-accesses>
   </vpn-svc>

   If Site1 and Site2 requires access to Cloud1, a new cloud-access will
   be created pointing to the cloud identifier of Cloud1.  Authorized
   sites will be filled with reference to Site1 and Site2.

5.1.3.  Multicast service

   Multicast in IP VPN is described in [RFC6513].

   If IPVPN supports multicast service, it is expected to provide inputs
   on global multicast parameters.

   The user of this model will need to fill the flavor of trees that
   will be used by customer within the IPVPN (Customer tree).  The
   proposed model supports ASM, SSM and BiDirectional trees (and can be

   augmented).  Multiple flavors of tree can be supported
   simultaneously.

                          (SSM tree)
    Recv (IGMPv3) -- Site2 ------- PE2
                                              PE1 --- Site1 --- Source1
                                                            \
                                                             -- Source2

                           (ASM tree)
    Recv (IGMPv2) -- Site3 ------- PE3

                           (SSM tree)
    Recv (IGMPv3) -- Site4 ------- PE4
                                   /
    Recv (IGMPv2) -- Site5 --------
                           (ASM tree)


   In case of ASM flavor requested, this model requires to fill the rp
   and rp-discovery parameters.  Multiple RP to group mappings can be
   created using the rp-group-mappings container.  For each mapping, the
   RP service can be managed by the service provider using the leaf
   provider-managed/enabled set to true.  In case of provider managed
   RP, user can request for rendez-vous point redundancy and/or optimal
   traffic delivery.  Those parameters will help the service provider to
   select the appropriate technology to fulfill the customer service
   requirement : for instance, in case of request of optimal traffic
   delivery, service provider may decide to use Anycast-RP or RP-tree to
   SPT switchover.

   In case of customer managed RP, the RP address must be filled in the
   RP to group mappings using the "rp-address" leaf.  This leaf is not
   needed for provider managed RP.

   User can define a specific rp-discovery mechanism like : auto-rp,
   static-rp, bsr-rp modes.  By default, model considers static-rp if
   ASM is requested.  A single rp-discovery mechanism is allowed for the
   VPN.  "rp-discovery" can be used for provider and customer managed
   RPs.  In case of provider managed RP, if the user wants to use bsr-rp
   as discovery protocol, service provider will consider the provider
   managed rp-group-mappings for bsr-rp.  The service provider will so
   configure its selected RPs to be bsr-rp-candidates.  In case of
   customer managed RP and bsr-rp discovery mechanism, the rp-address
   provided will be considered as bsr-rp candidate.

5.1.4.  Extranet VPNs

   There are some cases where a particular VPN needs to access to
   resources that are external.  The resources may be located in another
   VPN.


               +-----------+              +-----------+
              /             \            /             \
   SiteA --  |   VPN A       |   ---    |    VPN B      | --- SiteB
              \             /            \             / (Shared
               +-----------+              +-----------+   resources)


   In the figure above, VPN B has some resources on Site B that need to
   be available to some customers/partners.  VPN A must be able to
   access those VPN B resources.

   Such VPN connection scenario can be achieved by the VPN policy
   defined in Section 5.4.2.2.  But there are some simple cases, where a
   particular VPN (VPN A) needs to access to all resources in a VPN B.
   The model provides an easy way to setup this connection using the
   extranet-vpns container.

   The extranet-vpns container defines a list of VPNs, a particular VPN
   wants to access.  The extranet-vpns must be used on "customer" VPNs
   accessing extranet resources in another VPN.  In the figure above, in
   order to give access for VPN A to VPN B, extranet-vpns container will
   be configured under VPN A with an entry corresponding to VPN B and
   there is no service configuration requirement on VPN B.

   Readers should note that even if there is no configuration
   requirement on VPN B, if VPN A lists VPN B as extranet, all sites in
   VPN B will gain access to all sites in VPN A.

   The site-role leaf defines the role of the local VPN sites in the
   target extranet VPN topology.  Site roles are defined in Section 5.3.
   Based on this, the requirements described in Section 5.3 regarding
   the site-role leaf are also applicable here.

   In the example below, VPN A accesses to VPN B resources through
   extranet connection, a spoke role is required for VPN A sites, so
   sites from VPN A must not be able to communicate between each other
   through the extranet VPN connection.

           </extranet-vpn>
       </extranet-vpns>
   </vpn-svc>

   This model does not define how the extranet configuration will be
   achieved.

   Any more complex VPN connection topology (e.g. only part of sites of
   VPN A accessing only part of sites of VPN B) needs to be achieved
   using the vpn attachment defined in Section 5.4.2.

5.2.  Site overview

   A site represents a connection of a customer location to one or more
   VPN services.


                                                    +-------------+

                                                    +-------------+

   A site is composed of some characteristics :

   o  Unique identifier (site-id) : to uniquely identify the site within
      the overall network infrastructure.  The identifier is a string
      allowing to any encoding for the local administration of the VPN
      service.

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


   o  Locations (locations) : site location informations to allow easy
      retrieval on nearest available resources.  A site may be composed
      of multiple locations.

   o  Devices : the customer can request one or more customer premise
      equipments from the service provider for a particular site.

   o  Management (management) : defines the model of management of the
      site, for example : co-managed, customer managed or provider
      managed.

   o  Site network accesses (site-network-accesses) : defines the list
      of network accesses associated to the sites and their properties :
      especially bearer, connection and service parameters.

   A site-network-access represents an IP logical connection of a site.
   A site may have multiple site-network-accesses.


     +------------------+             Site
     |                  |-----------------------------------
     |                  |****** (site-network-access#1) ******
     |  New York Office |
     |                  |****** (site-network-access#2) ******
     |                  |-----------------------------------
     +------------------+


   Multiple site-network-accesses are used for instance in case of
   multihoming.  Some other topology cases may also involve multiple
   site-network-accesses.

   The site configuration is viewed as a global entity, we assume that
   it is mostly the role of the management to split the parameters
   between the different elements within the network.  For example, in
   the case of the site-network-access configuration, the management
   system needs to split the overall parameters between PE configuration
   and CE configuration.

5.2.1.  Devices and locations

   A site may be composed of multiple locations.  All the locations will
   need to be configured as part of the locations container and list.  A
   typical example of multi-location site is a headquarter in a city
   composed of multiple building.  Those building may be located in
   different parts of the city and may be linked by intra-city fibers
   (customer metro network).  In such case, when connecting to a VPN

   service, the customer may want to implement multihoming based on its
   distributed locations.


       New York Site

     +------------------+             Site
     | +--------------+ |-----------------------------------
     | | Manhattan    | |****** (site-network-access#1) ******
     | +--------------+ |
     | +--------------+ |
     | | Brooklyn     | |****** (site-network-access#2) ******
     | +--------------+ |
     |                  |-----------------------------------
     +------------------+


   A customer may also requests some premise equipments (CEs) to the
   service provider through the "devices" container.  Requesting a CE
   implies a provider-managed or co-managed model.  A particular device
   must be ordered to a particular already configured location.  This
   would help the service provider to send the device to the appropriate
   installation address.  In a multilocation site, a customer may for
   example request a CE for each location on the site where multihoming
   must be implemented.  In the figure above, one device may be
   requested for Manhattan location and one other for Brooklyn location.

   By using devices and locations, the user will be to influence the
   multihoming scenario he wants to implement : single CE, dual CE ...

5.2.2.  Site network accesses

   As mentioned, a site may be multihomed.  Each IP network access for a
   site is defined in the site-network-accesses list.  The site-network-
   access defines how the site is connected on the network and is
   splitted in three main classes of parameters :

   o  bearer : defines requirements of the attachment (below Layer 3).

   o  connection : defines Layer 3 protocol parameters of the
      attachment.

   o  availability : defines the site availability policy.  Availability
      is defined in Section 5.6

   Some parameters from the site can be configured also at the site-
   network-access level like : routing, services, security ... Defining
   parameters only at site level will provide inheritance.  If a

   parameter is configured at both site and access level, the access
   level parameter MUST override the site level parameter.  Those
   parameters will be described later in the document.

   The site-network-access has a specific type (site-network-access-
   type).  This documents defines two types :

   o  point-to-point: describes a point to point connection between the
      service provider and the customer.

   o  multipoint: describes a multipoint connection between the service
      provider and the customer.

   The type of site-network-access may have an impact on the parameters
   offered to the customer, e.g. : a service provider may not offer
   encryption for multipoint accesses.  Deciding what parameter is
   supported for point-to-point and/or multipoint accesses is up to the
   provider and is out of scope of this document.  Some containers
   proposed in the model may require extension in order to work properly
   for multipoint accesses.

5.2.2.1.  Bearer

   Bearer defines the requirements for the site attachment to the
   provider network that are below Layer 3.

   The bearer parameters will help to decide the access media to be
   used.  This is further described in Section 5.5.3.

5.2.2.2.  Connection

   The connection defines the protocol parameters of the attachment
   (IPv4 and IPv6).  Depending of the management mode, it refers to the
   PE-CE addressing or CE to customer LAN addressing.  In any case, it
   describes the provider to customer responsibility boundary.  For a
   customer managed site, it refers to the PE-CE connection.  For a
   provider managed site, it refers to the CE to LAN connection.

5.2.2.2.1.  IP addressing

   IP subnet can be configured for either transport protocols.  For a
   dual stack connection, two subnets will be provided, one for each
   transport layer.

   The address-allocation-type will help in defining how the address
   allocation MUST be done.  The current model proposes three ways of IP
   address allocation :

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


   o  provider-dhcp : the provider will provide DHCP service for
      customer equipments, this is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6
      addressing.

   o  provider-dhcp-relay : the provider will provide DHCP relay service
      for customer equipments, this is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6
      addressing.  The customer needs to fill DHCP server list to be
      used.

   o  static-address : Addresses will be assigned manually, this is
      applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

   o  slaac : enables stateless address autoconfiguration ([RFC4862]).
      This is applicable only for IPv6.

   In the dynamic addressing mechanism, it is expected from service
   provider to provide at least the IP address, mask and default gateway
   information.

5.2.2.2.2.  OAM

   A customer may require a specific IP connectivity fault detection
   mechanism on the IP connection.  The model supports BFD as mechanism
   proposed to the customer.  This can be extended with other mechanisms
   by augmentation.  The provider can propose some profiles to the
   customer depending of the service level the customer wants to
   achieve.  Profile names must be communicated to the customer.  This
   communication is out of scope of this document.  Some fixed values
   for the holdtime period may also be imposed by the customer if the
   provider enables it.

5.2.2.3.  Inheritance of parameters between site and site-network-access

   Some parameters are available both at site level and site-network-
   access level.  Defining a parameter at site level will provide
   inheritance to all site-network-accesses under the site.  If a site-
   network-access has a parameter configured that is already defined at
   site level, the site-network-access parameter value will replace the
   site parameter value.

5.3.  Site role

   A VPN has a particular topology as described in Section 5.1.1.  As a
   consequence, each site belonging to a VPN as a particular role in
   this topology.  The site-role defines the role of the site in a
   particular VPN topology.

   In the any-to-any topology, all sites MUST have the same role which
   is any-to-any-role.

   In the hub-spoke or hub-spoke-disjoint topology, sites MUST have a
   hub-role or a spoke-role.

5.4.  Site belonging to multiple VPNs

5.4.1.  Site vpn flavor

   A site may be part of one or multiple VPNs.  The site flavor defines
   the way the VPN multiplexing is done.  The current version of the
   model supports four flavors:

   o  site-vpn-flavor-single: the site belongs to only one VPN.

   o  site-vpn-flavor-multi: the site belongs to multiple VPNs and all
      the logical accesses of the sites belongs to the same set of VPNs.

   o  site-vpn-flavor-sub: the site belongs to multiple VPNs with
      multiple logical accesses.  Each logical access may map to
      different VPNs (one or many).

   o  site-vpn-flavor-nni: the site represents an option A NNI.

5.4.1.1.  Single VPN attachment : site-vpn-flavor-single

   The figure below describes the single VPN attachment.  The site
   connects to only one VPN.

   In the example above, the New York office is multihomed, both logical
   accesses are using the same VPN attachment rules.  Both logical
   accesses are so connected to VPNA and VPNB.

   Reaching VPN A or VPN B from New York office will be based on
   destination based routing.  Having the same destination reachable
   from the two VPNs may cause routing troubles.  This would be the role
   of the customer administration to ensure the appropriate mapping of
   its prefixes in each VPN.

5.4.1.3.  Sub VPN attachment : site-vpn-flavor-sub

   The figure below describes a sub VPN attachment.  The site connects
   to multiple VPNs but each logical access is attached to a particular
   set of VPN.  Typical use case of subVPN is a customer site used by
   multiple affiliates with private resources for each affiliates that
   cannot be shared (communication is prevented between the affiliates).
   It is similar than having separate sites instead that the customer
   wants to share some physical components while keeping strong
   isolation.  In the example, the access#1 is attached to VPNB while
   the access#2 is attached to VPNA.

   Multi-VPN can be implemented in addition to subVPN, as a consequence,
   each site-network-access can access to multiple VPNs.  In the example
   below, access#1 is mapped to VPNB and VPNC, while access#2 is mapped
   to VPNA and VPND.

  |                  |                                  /       +-----+
  |                  |****(site-network-access#2)******|  VPNA /       \
  |                  |                                  \      | VPN D |

  +------------------+

   Multihoming is also possible with subVPN, in this case, site-network-
   accesses are grouped, and a particular group will access to the same
   set of VPN.  In the example below, access#1 and #2 are part of the
   same group (multihomed together) and will be mapped to VPN B and C,
   in addition access#3 and #4 are part of the same group (multihomed
   together) and will be mapped to VPN A and D.

   In term of service configuration, subvpn can be achieved by
   requesting the site-network-accesses to use the same bearer (see
   Section 5.5.4 and Section 5.5.6.4 for more details).

5.4.1.4.  NNI : site-vpn-flavor-nni

   Some Network to Network Interface (NNI) may be modeled using the site
   container (see Section 5.14.1).  Using the site container to model
   NNI is only one the possible option for NNI (see Section 5.14).  This
   option is called option A by reference to option A NNI defined in
   [RFC4364].  It is helpful for the service provider to identify that
   the requested VPN connection is not a regular site but a NNI as
   specific default device configuration parameters may be applied in
   case of NNI (example ACLs, routing policies ...).

   The figure above describes an option A NNI scenario that could be
   modeled using the site container.  In order to connect its customer
   VPN (VPN1 and VPN2) on SP B network, SP A may request creation of
   some site-network-accesses to SP B.  The site-vpn-flavor-nni will be
   used to inform SP B that this is a NNI and not a regular customer

   site.  The site-vpn-flavor-nni may be multihomed and multiVPN as
   well.

5.4.2.  Attaching a site to a VPN

   Due to the multiple site vpn flavors, the attachment is done at the
   site-network-access (logical access) level through the vpn-attachment
   container.  The vpn-attachment container is mandatory.  The model
   provides two ways of attachment :

   o  Referencing directly the target VPN.

   o  Reference a VPN policy for more complex attachments.

   A choice is implemented to allow user to choose the best fitting
   flavor.

5.4.2.1.  Reference a VPN

   Referencing a vpn-id provides an easy way to attach a particular
   logical access to a VPN.  This is the best way in case of single VPN
   attachment or subVPN with single VPN attachment per logical access.
   When referencing a vpn-id, the site-role must be added to express the
   role of the site in the target VPN topology.

   <site>
    <site-id>SITE1</site-id>
    <site-network-accesses>
     <site-network-access>
      <site-network-access-id>LA1</site-network-access-id>
      <vpn-attachment>
       <vpn-id>VPNA</vpn-id>
       <site-role>spoke-role</site-role>
      </vpn-attachment>
     </site-network-access>
     <site-network-access-id>LA2</site-network-access-id>
      <vpn-attachment>
       <vpn-id>VPNB</vpn-id>
       <site-role>spoke-role</site-role>
      </vpn-attachment>
     </site-network-access>
    </site-network-accesses>
   </site>

   The example above describes a subVPN case where a site SITE1 has two
   logical accesses (LA1 and LA2) with LA1 attached to VPNA and LA2
   attached to VPNB.

5.4.2.2.  VPN policy

   The vpn-policy helps to express a multiVPN scenario where a logical
   access belongs to multiple VPNs.  Multiple VPN policy can be created
   to handle the subVPN case where each logical access is part of a
   different set of VPNs.

   As a site can belong to multiple VPNs, the vpn-policy may be composed
   of multiple entries.  A filter can be applied to specify that only
   some LANs of the site should be part of a particular VPN.  Each time
   a site (or LAN) is attached to a VPN, we must precise its role (site-
   role) within the targeted VPN topology.

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  VPN2_Site3 ------ PE7                                       |
   +-------------------------+                                    |
                             |                                    |
   +-------------------------+                                    |
   |  VPN2_Site1 ------ PE3               PE4 ------ VPN2_Site2   |
   +----------------------------------+                           |
                                      |                           |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+ |
   |  VPN3_Site1 ------ PE5           |   PE6 ------ VPN3_Site2 | |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+ |
                                      |                           |
                                      +---------------------------+

   In the example above, VPN3_Site2 is part of two VPNs : VPN3 and VPN2.
   It will play hub-role in VPN2 and any-to-any role in VPN3.  We can
   express such multiVPN scenario as follows :

   <site>
    <site-id>VPN3_Site2</site-id>
    <vpn-policy-list>
     <vpn-policy>
      <vpn-policy-id>POLICY1</vpn-policy-id>
      <entries>
       <id>ENTRY1</id>
       <vpn>
        <vpn-id>VPN2</vpn-id>
        <site-role>hub-role</site-role>
       </vpn>
      </entries>
      <entries>
       <id>ENTRY2</id>
       <vpn>
        <vpn-id>VPN3</vpn-id>
        <site-role>any-to-any-role</site-role>

      </entries>
     </vpn-policy>

      </vpn-attachment>
     </site-network-access>
    </site-network-accesses>
   </site>

   Now in case more specific VPN attachment is necessary, filtering can
   be used.  For example, if LAN1 from VPN3_site2 must be attached to
   VPN2 as hub and LAN2 must be attached to VPN3, the following
   configuration can be used :

5.5.  Deciding where to connect the site

   The management system will have to decide where to connect each site-
   network-access of a particular site to the provider network (PE,
   aggregation switch ...).

   The current model proposes parameters and constraints that will help
   the management system to decide where to attach the site-network-
   access.

   The management system SHOULD honor the customer constraints, if the
   constraint cannot be filled, the management system MUST not provision
   the site and SHOULD provide an information to the user.  How the
   information is provided is out of scope of the document.  It would
   then be up to the user to relax the constraint or not.

   Parameters are just hints for management system for service
   placement.

   In addition to parameters and constraints : the management system
   decision MAY be based on any other internal constraint that are up to
   the service provider : least load, distance ...

5.5.1.  Constraint : Device

   In case of provider-management or co-management, one or more devices
   have been ordered by the customer.  The customer may decide to force
   a particular site-network-access to be connected on a particular

   In the figure above, the site-network-access#1 is associated to CE1,

   connection.

5.5.2.  Constraint/parameter : Site location

   The location information provided in this model MAY be used by a
   management system to decide the target PE to mesh the site.  A
   particular location must be associated to each site network access
   when configuring it.  The service provider MUST honor the termination
   of the access on the location associated with the site network
   access.

   In the example above, the management system may decide to mesh Site
   #1 on a PE from Philadelphia PoP for distance reason.  It may also
   take into account resources available on PEs to decide the exact
   target PE (least load).  In case of shortest distance PE used, it may
   also decide to mesh Site #2 on Washington PoP.

   In the previous section, we seen that a site-network-access can be
   associated with a particular device.  This device is already
   associated to a particular location.  In case of misconfiguration, a
   site-network-access may be associated with a device which is not in
   the same location the site-network-access was bound to.  In such
   situation, the management system SHOULD return an error and MAY
   advise the user about the inconsistency.

5.5.3.  Constraint/parameter : access type

   The management system will need to elect the access method to connect
   the site to the customer (for example : PPP over ISDN, xSDL, leased
   line, Ethernet backhaul ...).  The customer may provide some
   parameters/constraints that will provide hints to the management
   system.

   The bearer container information SHOULD be used as first input :

   o  The "requested-type" provides an information about the media type
      the customer would like.  If the "strict" leaf is equal to "true",



Litkowski, et al.        Expires March 17, 2017                [Page 37]

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


      this MUST be considered as a strict constraint, so the management
      system cannot connect the site with another media type.  If the
      "strict" leaf is equal to "false" (default), if the requested-type
      cannot be fullfilled, the management system can select another
      type.  The supported media types SHOULD be communicated by the
      service provider to the customer by a mechanism that is out of
      scope of the document.

   o  The "always-on" leaf defines a strict constraint : if set to
      "true", the management system MUST elect a media type which is
      always-on (this means no Dial access type).

   o  The "bearer-reference" is used in case the customer has already
      ordered a network connection to the service provider apart of the
      IPVPN site and wants to reuse this connection.  The string used in
      an internal reference from the service provider describing the
      already available connection.  This is also a strict requirement
      that cannot be relaxed.  How the reference is given to the
      customer is out of scope of the document but as a pure example,
      when the customer ordered the bearer (through a process out of
      this model), the service provider may had provided the bearer
      reference that can be used for provisionning services on top.

   Other parameters like the requested svc-input-bandwidth, svc-output-
   bandwidth MAY help to decide the access type to be used.  Any other
   internal parameters from the service provider can be used in
   addition.

5.5.4.  Constraint : access diversity

   Each site-network-access may have one or more constraints that would
   drive the placement of the access.  By, default the model assumes no
   constraint but is expected allocation of a unique bearer per site-
   network-access.

   In order to help the different placement scenarios, a site-network-
   access may be tagged using one or multiple group identifiers.  The
   group identifier is a string so can accomodate both explicit naming
   of a group of sites (e.g. "multi-homed-set1" or "subvpn") or using a
   numbered id (e.g. 12345678).  The meaning of each group-id is local
   to each customer administrator.  And the management system MUST
   ensure that different customers can use the same group-ids.  One or
   more group-id can also be defined at site-level, as a consequence,
   all site-network-accesses under the site MUST inherit the group-ids
   of the site they are belonging to.  When, in addition to the site
   group-ids, some group-ids are defined at site-network-access level,
   the management system MUST consider the union of all groups (site

   level and site network access level) for this particular site network
   access.

   For a particular currently configured site-network-access, each
   constraint MUST be expressed against a targeted set of site-network-
   accesses, the currently configured site-network-access MUST never be
   taken into account in the targeted set : e.g.  "I want my current
   site-network-access to be not be connected on the same PoP as the
   site-network-accesses that are part of group 10".  The set of site-
   network-accesses against which the constraint is evaluated can be
   expressed as a list of groups or all-other-accesses or all-other-
   groups. "all-other-accesses" means that the current site-network-
   access constraint MUST be evaluated against all the other site-
   network-accesses belonging to the current site. "all-other-groups"
   means that the constraint MUST be evaluated against all groups the
   current site-network-access is not belonging to.

   The current model proposes multiple constraint-types :

      pe-diverse : the current site-network-access MUST not be connected
      to the same PE as the targeted site-network-accesses.

      pop-diverse : the current site-network-access MUST not be
      connected to the same PoP as the targeted site-network-accesses.

      linecard-diverse : the current site-network-access MUST not be
      connected to the same linecard as the targeted site-network-
      accesses.

      same-pe : the current site-network-access MUST be connected to the
      same PE as the targeted site-network-accesses.

      same-bearer : the current site-network-access MUST be connected
      using the same bearer as the targeted site-network-accesses.

   Those constraint-types could be extended through augmentation.

   Each constraint is expressed as "I want my current site-network-
   access to be <constraint-type> (e.g. pe-diverse, pop-diverse) from
   those <target> site-network-accesses".  In addition,

   The group-id used to target some site-network-accesses may be the
   same as the one used by the current site-network-access.  This ease
   configuration of scenarios where a group of site-network-access has a
   constraint between each other.  As an example if we want a set of
   sites (site#1 up to #5) to be all connected on a different PE, we can
   tag them with the same group-id and express a pe-diverse constraint
   for this group-id.

   The group-id used to target some site-network-accesses may be also
   different as the one used by the current site-network-access.  This
   is used to express that a group of site has some constraint against
   another group of sites, but there may not be constraint inside the
   group itself.  As an example, if we consider a set of 6 sites with
   two sets and we want to ensure that a site in the first set must be
   pop-diverse from a site in the second set.

5.5.5.  Impossible access placement

   Some impossible placement scenarios may be created through the
   proposed configuration framework.  Impossible scenarios could be too
   restrictive constraints leading to impossible placement in the
   network or conflicting constraints that would also lead to impossible
   placement.  An example of conflicting rules would be to ask a site-
   network-access#1 to be pe-diverse from a site-network-access#2 and to
   ask at the same time that site-network-access#2 to be on the same PE
   as site-network-access#1.  When the management system cannot place
   the access, it SHOULD return an error message indicating that
   placement was not possible.

5.5.6.  Examples of access placement

5.5.6.1.  Multihoming

   The customer wants to create a multihomed site.  The site will be
   composed of two site-network-accesses and the customer wants the two
   site-network-accesses to be meshed on different PoPs for resiliency
   purpose.

5.5.6.2.  Site offload

   The customer has a 6 branch offices in a particular region and he
   wants to prevent to have all branch offices on the same PE.

   He wants to express that 3 branch offices cannot be connected on the
   same linecard.  But the other branch offices must be connected on a

   different PoP.  Those other branch offices cannot also be connected
   on the same linecard.


                                        PoP#1
                                     +---------+
                                     |   PE1   |
               Office#1 ---...       |   PE2   |
               Office#2 ---...       |   PE3   |
               Office#3 ---...       |   PE4   |
                                     +---------+


                                        PoP#2
                                     +---------+
               Office#4 ---...       |   PE4   |
               Office#5 ---...       |   PE5   |

                                     +---------+


   This scenario could be expressed in the following way :

   o  We need to create two sets of sites : set#1 composed of Office#1
      up to 3, set#2 composed of Office#4 up to 6.

   o  Sites within set#1 must be pop-diverse from sites within set#2 and
      vice versa.

   o  Sites within set#1 must be linecard-diverse from other sites in
      set#1 (same for set#2).

   This scenario could be expressed in the following way :

   o  The site will have 4 site network accesses (2 subVPN coupled with
      dual homing).

   o  Site-network-access#1 and #3 will correspond to the multihoming of
      the subVPN B.  A PE-diverse constraint is required between them.

   o  Site-network-access#2 and #4 will correspond to the multihoming of
      the subVPN C.  A PE-diverse constraint is required between them.

   o  To ensure proper usage of the same bearer for the subVPN, site-
      network-access #1 and #2 must share the same bearer as site-
      network-access #3 and #4.

5.5.7.  Route Distinguisher and VRF allocation

   Route distinguisher is also a critical parameter of PE-based L3VPN as
   described in [RFC4364] that will allow to distinguish common
   addressing plans in different VPNs.  As for Route-targets, it is
   expected management system to allocate a VRF on the target PE and a
   route-distinguisher for this VRF.

   If a VRF exists on the target PE, and the VRF fulfils the
   connectivity constraints for the site, there is no need to recreate
   another VRF and the site MAY be meshed within this existing VRF.  How
   the management system checks that an existing VRF fulfils the
   connectivity constraints for a site is out of scope of this document.

   If no VRF exists on the target PE, filling the site constraints, the
   management system will have to initiate a new VRF creation on the
   target PE and will have to allocate a new route distinguisher for
   this new VRF.

   The management system MAY apply a per-VPN or per-VRF allocation
   policy for the route-distinguisher depending of the service provider
   policy.  In a per-VPN allocation policy, all VRFs (dispatched on
   multiple PEs) within a VPN will share the same route distinguisher
   value.  In a per-VRF model, all VRFs will always have a unique route-
   distinguisher value.  Some other allocation policies are also
   possible, and this document does not restrict the allocation policies
   to be used.

   Allocation of route-distinguisher MAY be done in the same way as the
   route-targets.  The example provided in Section 5.1.1.1 could be
   reused.

   Note that a service provider MAY decide to configure target PE for
   automated allocation of route distinguisher.  In this case, there
   will be no need for any backend system to allocate a route-
   distinguisher value.

5.6.  Site network access availability

   A site may be multihomed, so having multiple site-network-accesses.
   Placement constraints defined in previous sections will help to
   ensure physical diversity.

   When the site-network-accesses are placed on the network, a customer
   may want to use a particular routing policy on those accesses.

   The site-network-access/availability defines parameters for the site
   redundancy.  The access-priority defines a preference for a
   particular access.  This preference is used to model loadbalancing or
   primary/backup scenario.  The highest the access-priority is, and the
   highest the preference will be.

   The figure below describes how access-priority attribute can be used.


   Hub#1 LAN (Primary/backup)          Hub#2 LAN (Loadsharing)
     |                                                  |
     |     access-priority 1       access-priority 1    |
     |--- CE1 ------- PE1         PE3 --------- CE3 --- |
     |                                                  |
     |                                                  |
     |--- CE2 ------- PE2         PE4 --------- CE4 --- |
     |     access-priority 2       access-priority 1    |


                             PE5
                              |
                              |
                              |
                             CE5
                              |
                         Spoke#1 site (Single-homed)

   In the figure above, Hub#2 requires loadsharing so all the site-
   network-accesses must use the same access-priority value.  At the

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


   contrary, as Hub#1 requires primary/backup, a higher access-priority
   will be configured on the primary access.

   More complex scenario can be modeled.  Let's consider a Hub site with
   5 accesses to the network (A1,A2,A3,A4,A5).  The customer wants to
   loadshare traffic on A1,A2 in the nominal situation.  If A1 and A2
   fails, he wants to loadshare traffic on A3 and A4, and finally if A1
   to A4 are down, he wants to use A5.  We can model it easily by
   associating the following access-priorities : A1=100, A2=100, A3=50,
   A4=50, A5=10.

   The access-priority has some limitation.  A scenario like the
   previous one with 5 accesses but with the constraint of having
   traffic loadshared between A3 and A4 in case of A1 OR A2 being down
   is not achievable.  But the authors consider that the access-priority
   covers most of the deployment use cases and the model can still be
   extended by augmentation to support new use cases.

5.7.  Traffic protection

   The service model supports the ability to protect traffic for the
   site.  Protection provides a better availability to multihoming by,
   for example, using local-repair techniques in case of failures.  The
   associated level of service guarantee would be based on an agreement
   between customer and service provider and is out of scope of this
   document.




       Site#1                            Site#2
   CE1 ----- PE1 -- P1            P3 -- PE3 ---- CE3
    |                              |             |
    |                              |             |
   CE2 ----- PE2 -- P2            P4 -- PE4 ---- CE4
             /
            /
   CE5 ----+
      Site#3

   In the figure above, we consider an IPVPN service with three sites
   including two dual homed sites (site#1 and #2).  For dual homed
   sites, we consider PE1-CE1 and PE3-CE3 as primary, and
   PE2-CE2,PE4-CE4 as backup for the example (even if protection also
   applies to loadsharing scenarios.)

   In order to protect Site#2 against a failure, user may set the
   enabled leaf of traffic-protection to true on the site-network-

   accesses of site#2.  How the traffic protection will be implemented
   is out of scope of the document.  But as an example, in such case, if
   we consider traffic coming from a remote site (site#1 or site#3),
   primary path is to use PE3 as egress PE.  PE3 may have preprogrammed
   a backup forwarding entry pointing to backup path (through PE4-CE4)
   for all prefixes going through PE3-CE3 link.  How backup path is
   computed is out of scope of the document.  When PE3-CE3 link fails,
   traffic is still received by PE3 but PE3 switch automatically traffic
   to the backup entry, path will so be PE1-P1-(...)-P3-PE3-PE4-CE4
   until remote PEs reconverge and use PE4 as egress PE.

5.8.  Security

   Security container defines customer specific security parameters for
   the site.

5.8.1.  Authentication

   The current model does not support any authentication parameters, but
   such parameters may be added in the authentication container through
   augmentation.

5.8.2.  Encryption

   Encryption can be requested on the connection.  It may be performed
   at layer 2 or layer 3 by selecting the appropriate enumeration in
   "layer" leaf.  The encryption profile can be a service provider
   defined profile or customer specific.

5.9.  Management

   The model proposes three types of common management options :

   o  provider-managed : the CE router is managed only by the provider.
      In this model, the responsibility boundary between SP and customer
      is between CE and customer network.

   o  customer-managed : the CE router is managed only by the customer.
      In this model, the responsibility boundary between SP and customer
      is between PE and CE.

   o  co-managed : the CE router is primarly managed by the provider and
      in addition SP lets customer accessing the CE for some
      configuration/monitoring purpose.  In the co-managed mode the
      responsibility boundary is the same as the provider-managed model.

   Based on the management model, different security options MAY be
   derived.

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


   In case of "co-managed", the model proposes some option to define the
   management transport protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) and the associated
   management address.

5.10.  Routing protocols

   Routing-protocol defines which routing protocol must be activated
   between the provider and the customer router.  The current model
   support : bgp, rip, ospf, static, direct, vrrp.

   The routing protocol defined applies at the provider to customer
   boundary.  Depending of the management of the management model, it
   may apply to the PE-CE boundary or CE to customer boundary.  In case
   of customer managed site, the routing-protocol defined will be
   activated between the PE and the CE router managed by the customer.
   In case of provider managed site, the routing-protocol defined will
   be activated between the CE managed by the SP and the router or LAN
   belonging to the customer.  In this case, it is expected that the PE-
   CE routing will be configured based on the service provider rules as
   both are managed by the same entity.

                               Rtg protocol
       192.0.2.0/24 ----- CE ----------------- PE1

                    Customer managed site

             Rtg protocol
       Customer router ----- CE ----------------- PE1

                    Provider managed site

   All the examples below will refer to a customer managed site case.

5.10.1.  Dual stack handling

   All routing protocol types support dual stack by using address-family
   leaf-list.

   Example of Dual stack using the same routing protocol :

   <routing-protocols>
     <routing-protocol>
       <type>static</type>
       <static>
           <address-family>ipv4</address-family>
           <address-family>ipv6</address-family>
       </static>
     </routing-protocol>
   </routing-protocols>

   Example of Dual stack using two different routing protocols :

   <routing-protocols>
     <routing-protocol>
       <type>rip</type>
       <rip>
           <address-family>ipv4</address-family>
       </rip>
     </routing-protocol>
     <routing-protocol>
       <type>ospf</type>
       <ospf>
           <address-family>ipv6</address-family>
       </ospf>
     </routing-protocol>
   </routing-protocols>

5.10.2.  Direct LAN connection onto SP network

   Routing-protocol "direct" SHOULD be used when a customer LAN is
   directly connected to the provider network and must be advertised in
   the IPVPN.

           LAN attached directly to provider network :

           192.0.2.0/24 ----- PE1

   In this case, the customer has a default route to the PE address.

5.10.3.  Direct LAN connection onto SP network with redundancy

   Routing-protocol "vrrp" SHOULD be used when a customer LAN is
   directly connected to the provider network and must be advertised in
   the IPVPN and LAN redundancy is expected.

         LAN attached directly to provider network with LAN redundancy:

           192.0.2.0/24 ------ PE1
                          |
                          +--- PE2

   In this case, the customer has a default route to the service
   provider network.

5.10.4.  Static routing

   Routing-protocol "static" MAY be used when a customer LAN is
   connected to the provider network through a CE router and must be
   advertised in the IPVPN.

                                   Static rtg
          192.0.2.0/24 ------ CE -------------- PE
                               |                |
                               |      Static route 192.0.2.0/24 nh CE
               Static route 0.0.0.0/0 nh PE

   In this case, the customer has a default route to the service
   provider network.

5.10.5.  RIP routing

   Routing-protocol "rip" MAY be used when a customer LAN is connected
   to the provider network through a CE router and must be advertised in
   the IPVPN.  For IPv4, the model assumes usage of RIP version 2.

   In case of dual stack routing requested through this model, the
   management system will be responsible to configure rip (including
   right version number) and rip-ng instances on network elements.

                                   RIP rtg
           192.0.2.0/24 ------ CE -------------- PE


5.10.6.  OSPF routing

   Routing-protocol "ospf" MAY be used when a customer LAN is connected
   to the provider network through a CE router and must be advertised in
   the IPVPN.

   It can be used to extend an existing OSPF network and interconnect
   different areas.  See [RFC4577] for more details.

                             +---------------------+


   The model also proposes an option to create an OSPF sham-link between
   two sites sharing the same area and having a backdoor link.  The
   sham-link is created by referencing the target site sharing the same
   OSPF area.  The management system will be responsible to check if
   there is already a shamlink configured for this VPN and area between
   the same pair of PEs.  If there is no existing shamlink, the
   management system will provision it, this shamlink MAY be reused by
   other sites.

                                +----------------+

   Regarding Dual stack support, user MAY decide to fill both IPv4 and
   IPv6 address families, if both protocols SHOULD be routed through
   OSPF.  As OSPF is using two different protocol for IPv4 and IPv6, the
   management system will need to configure both ospf version 2 and
   version 3 on the PE-CE link.

   Example of OSPF routing parameters in service model.

5.10.7.  BGP routing

   Routing-protocol "bgp" MAY be used when a customer LAN is connected
   to the provider network through a CE router and must be advertised in
   the IPVPN.

                                   BGP rtg
         192.0.2.0/24 ------ CE -------------- PE


   The session addressing will be derived from connection parameters as
   well as internal knowledge of SP.

   In case of dual stack access, user MAY request BGP routing for both
   IPv4 and IPv6 by filling both address-families.  It will be up to SP
   and management system to decide how to decline the configuration (two
   BGP sessions, single, multisession ...).

   The service configuration below actives BGP on PE-CE link for both
   IPv4 and IPv6.

   BGP activation requires SP to know the address of the customer peer.
   "static-address" allocation type for the IP connection MUST be used.

5.11.  Service

   The service defines service parameters associated with the site.

5.11.1.  Bandwidth

   The service bandwidth refers to the bandwidth requirement between PE
   and CE (WAN access bandwidth).  The requested bandwidth is expressed
   as svc-input-bandwidth and svc-output-bandwidth in bit per seconds.
   Input/output direction is using customer site as reference : input
   bandwidth so means download bandwidth for the site, and output
   bandwidth means upload bandwidth for the site.

   Using a different input and output bandwidth will allow service
   provider to know if customer allows for asymmetric bandwidth access
   like ADSL.  It can also be used to rate-limit in a different way
   upload and download on a symmetric bandwidth access.

   The bandwidth is a service bandwidth : expressed primarly as IP
   bandwidth but if the customer enables MPLS for carrier's carrier,
   this becomes MPLS bandwidth.

5.11.2.  QoS

   The model proposes to define QoS parameters in an abstracted way :

   o  qos-classification-policy : define a set of ordered rules to
      classify customer traffic.

   o  qos-profile : QoS scheduling profile to be applied.

5.11.2.1.  QoS classification

   QoS classification rules are handled by qos-classification-policy.
   The qos-classification-policy is an ordered list of rules that match
   a flow or application and set the appropriate target class of service
   (target-class-id).  The user can define the match using an
   application reference or a more specific flow definition (based layer
   3 source and destination address, layer 4 ports, layer 4 protocol).
   The current model defines some applications but new application
   identities may be added through augmentation.  The exact meaning of
   each application identity is up to the service provider, so it will
   be necessary for the service provider to advise customer on usage of
   application matching.

   Where the classification is done depends on the SP implementation of
   the service, but classification concerns the flow coming from the
   customer site and entering the network.

      rule in the ingress direction on the CE interface connected to
      customer LAN.

   o  Peer to peer traffic wille be classified in DATA3.

   o  All other traffic will be classified in DATA1.

   The order of rules is really important.  The management system
   responsible for translating those rules in network element
   configuration MUST keep the same processing order in element
   configuration.  The order of rule is defined by the "id" leaf.  The
   lowest "id" MUST be processed first.

5.11.2.2.  QoS profile

   User can choose between standard profile provided by the operator or
   custom profile.  The qos-profile defines the traffic scheduling
   policy to be used by the service provider.

                                  Provider network
                             +-----------------------+
   192.0.2.0/24
   198.51.100.0/24 ---- CE --------- PE
                           \       /
                          qos-profile


   In case of provider managed or co-managed connection, the provider
   should ensure scheduling according to the requested policy in both
   traffic directions (SP to customer and customer to SP).  As example
   of implementation, a device scheduling policy may be implemented both
   at PE and CE side on the WAN link.  In case of customer managed
   connection, the provider is only responsible to ensure scheduling
   from SP network to the customer site.  As example of implementation,
   a device scheduling policy may be implemented only at PE side on the
   WAN link towards the customer.

   A custom qos-profile is defined as a list of class of services and
   associated properties.  The properties are :

   o  rate-limit : used to rate-limit the class of service.  The value
      is expressed as a percentage of the global service bandwidth.
      When the qos-profile is implemented at CE side the svc-output-
      bandwidth is taken into account as reference.  When it is
      implemented at PE side, the svc-input-bandwidth is used.

   o  priority-level : used to define priorities between class of
      services.  The value of the priority to be used is dependant of
      each administration.  The higher the priority-level is, the higher
      the priority of the class will be.  Priority-level can be used to
      define strict priority queueing.  A priority-level 250 class will
      be served before a priority-level 100 class until there is no more
      packet to process or until rate-limit does not allow anymore
      packets from the higher priority class.

Internet-Draft                l3vpn-svc-cfg               September 2016


   o  guaranteed-bw-percent : used to define a guaranteed amount of
      bandwidth for the class of service.  It is expressed as a
      percentage.  The guaranteed-bw-percent uses available bandwidth at
      the priority-level of the class.  When the qos-profile is
      implemented at CE side the svc-output-bandwidth is taken into
      account as reference.  When it is implemented at PE side, the svc-
      input-bandwidth is used.

   Example of service configuration using a standard qos profile :

   <site>
       <site-id>1245HRTFGJGJ154654</site-id>
       <service>
           <svc-input-bandwidth>100000000</svc-input-bandwidth>

   The custom qos-profile for site1 defines that traffic from REAL_TIME
   class will have a higher priority than traffic from DATA class.  The
   REAL_TIME traffic will be rate-limit to 10% of the service bandwidth
   (10% of 100Mbps = 10Mbps) to let some place for DATA traffic.

   The custom qos-profile for site2 defines that traffic from REAL_TIME
   class will have a higher priority than traffic from data traffic.
   Data traffic will be splitted in two class of service DATA1 and DATA2
   that will share bandwidth between them according to the percentage of
   guaranteed-bw-percent.  The maximum of percentage to be used is not
   limited by this model but MUST be limited by the management system
   according to the policies authorized by the service provider.  The
   REAL_TIME traffic will be rate-limit to 30% of the service bandwidth
   (30% of 100Mbps = 30Mbps) to let some place for data traffic.  In
   case of congestion of the access, the REAL_TIME traffic can go up to
   30Mbps (Let's assume that 20Mbps only are consumed).  The DATA1 and
   DATA2 will share remaining bandwidth (80Mbps) according to their
   percentage.  So DATA1 will be served with at least 64Mbps of
   bandwidth.

5.11.3.  Multicast

   The multicast section defines the type of site in the customer
   multicast topology : source, receiver, or both.  These parameters
   will help management system to optimize the multicast service.  User
   can also define the type of multicast relation with the customer :
   router (requires a protocol like PIM), host (IGMP or MLD), or both.
   Transport protocol (IPv4 or IPv6 or both) can also be defined.

   build MPLS service using an IPVPN as transport layer.

   In the figure above, ISP1 resells IPVPN service but has no transport
   infrastructure between its PoPs.  ISP1 uses an IPVPN as transport
   infrastructure (belonging to another provider) between its PoPs.

   In order to support CsC, the VPN service must be declared MPLS
   support using the "carrierscarrier" leaf set to true in vpn-svc.  The
   link between CE1_ISP1/PE1 and CE2_ISP1/PE2 must also run a MPLS
   signalling protocol.  This configuration is done at the site level.

   In the proposed model, LDP or BGP can be used as MPLS signalling
   protocol.  In case of LDP, an IGP routing protocol MUST also be

   routing-protocol.

   In case Carrier's Carrier is enabled, the requested svc-mtu will
   refer to the MPLS MTU and no more to the IP MTU.

5.12.2.  Transport constraints

   A customer may require some constraints for transporting traffic
   between particular sites.  As example, a customer may require low
   latencies and disjoint paths between two hub sites.  The current
   model proposes to define a list of constraints that can be augmented
   for unicast and/or multicast traffic.  For unicast traffic, the model
   considers that the constraints are bidirectional (same constraint
   from site1 to site2 and site2 to site1).  For multicast, constraints
   are unidirectional from source to receiver.  The current model
   supports the following constraints :

   o  Latency : this constraint allow to create the lowest latency path
      possible or to create a path with a latency boundary.  In case a
      latency boundary is required, the boundary MUST be encoded in the
      constraint-opaque-value using a millisecond unit.

   o  Bandwidth : this constraint allow to create a path that fits
      specific bandwidth requirement.  If no constraint-opaque-value is
      provided, an implementation SHOULD use the lowest bandwidth
      between the two sites as reference.  If constraint-opaque-value is
      used, the required bandwidth MUST be encoded in Mbps, and the
      implementation MUST use this value as reference.

   o  Jitter : this constraint allow to create a path with a jitter
      boundary. constraint-opaque-value MUST be used with jitter
      constraint and MUST contain the jitter boundary expressed in
      milliseconds.

   o  Path diversity : this constraint allow creation of disjoint paths
      between two sites.  This requires the customer sites to be
      multihomed. constraint-opaque-value is not used.

   o  Site diversity : this constraint is similar to path diversity but
      ensures that paths are not crossing the same provider PoPs.  This
      requires the customer sites to be multihomed. constraint-opaque-
      value MAY be used to encode additional site location that must be
      avoided.

5.13.  External ID references

   The service model sometimes refers to external information through
   identifiers.  As an example, to order a cloud-access to a particular
   Cloud Service Provider (CSP), the model uses an identifier to refer
   to the targeted CSP.  In case, a customer is using directly this
   service model as an API (through REST or NETCONF for example) to
   order a particular service, the service provider should provide a
   list of authorized identifiers.  In case of cloud-access, the service
   provider will provide the identifiers associated of each available
   CSP.  The same applies to other identifiers like std-qos-profile, oam
   profile-name, provider-profile for encryption ...

   How SP provides those identifiers meaning to the customer is out of
   scope of this document.

5.14.  Defining NNIs

   An autonomous system is a single network or group of networks that is
   controlled by a common system administration group and that uses a
   single, clearly defined routing protocol.  In some cases, VPNs need
   to span across different autonomous systems in different geographic
   areas or across different service providers.  The connection between
   autonomous systems is established by the Service Providers and is
   seamless to the customer.

   Some examples are : Partnership between service providers (transport,
   cloud ...) to extend their VPN service seamlessly, or internal
   administrative boundary within a single service provider (Backhaul vs
   Core vs Datacenter ...).

   NNIs (Network to Network Interfaces) have to be defined to extend the
   VPNs across multiple autonomous systems.

   [RFC4364] defines multiple flavor of VPN NNI implementations.  Each
   implementation has different pros/cons that are outside the scope of
   this document.  As an example : In an Inter-AS Option A, ASBR peers
   are connected by multiple interfaces with at least one interface VPN
   that spans the two autonomous systems.  These ASBRs associate each
   interface with a VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instance and a
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session to signal unlabeled IP
   prefixes.  As a result, traffic between the back-to-back VRFs is IP.
   In this scenario, the VPNs are isolated from each other, and because
   the traffic is IP, QoS mechanisms that operate on IP traffic can be
   applied to achieve customer Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The figure above describes a service provider network "My network"
   that has several NNIs.  This network uses NNI to :

   o  increase its footprint by relying on L3VPN partners.

   o  connect its own datacenter services to the customer IPVPN.

   o  enable customer to access to its private resources located in
      private cloud owned by some cloud service providers.

   In option A, the two ASes are connected between each other with
   physical links on Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR).  There may
   be multiple physical connections between the ASes for a resiliency
   purpose.  A VPN connection, physical or logical (on top of physical),
   is created for each VPN that needs to cross the AS boundary.  A back-
   to-back VRF model is so created.

   This VPN connection can be seen as a site from a service model
   perspective.  Let's say that AS B wants to extend some VPN connection
   for VPN C on AS A.  Administrator of AS B can use this service model
   to order a site on AS A.  All connection scenarios could be realized
   using the current model features.  As an example, the figure above,
   where two physical connections are involved with logical connections
   per VPN on top, could be seen as a dual-homed subvpn scenario.  And
   for example, administrator from AS B will be able to choose the
   appropriate routing protocol (e.g. ebgp) to dynamically exchange
   routes between ASes.

   This document so supposes that option A NNI flavor SHOULD reuse the
   existing VPN site modeling.

   The cloud service provider or the customer itself may use our L3VPN
   service model exposed by service provider B to create the VPN
   connectivity.  We could consider that, as the NNI is shared, the
   physical connection (bearer) between CSP A and SP B already exists.
   CSP A may so request through a service model a new site creation with
   a single site-network-access (single homing used in the diagram).  As
   placement constraint, CSP A may use the existing bearer reference it
   has from SP A to force the placement of the VPN NNI on the existing
   link.  The XML below describes what could be the configuration
   request to SP B :

   In option B, the two ASes are connected between each other with
   physical links on Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR).  There may
   be multiple physical connections between the ASes for a resiliency
   purpose.  The VPN "connection" between ASes is done by exchanging VPN
   routes through MP-BGP.

   There are multiple flavors of implementations of such NNI, for
   example :

   1.  The NNI is a provider internal NNI between for example of
       backbone and a DC.  There is enough trust between the domains to
       not filter the VPN routes.  So all the VPN routes are exchanged.
       Route target filtering may be implemented to save some
       unnecessary route states.

   2.  The NNI is used between providers that agreed to exchange VPN
       routes for specific route-targets only.  Each provider is
       authorized to use the route-target values from the other
       provider.

   3.  The NNI is used between providers that agreed to exchange VPN
       routes for specific route-targets only.  Each provider has its
       own route-target scheme.  So a customer spanning the two networks
       will have different route-target in each network for a particular
       VPN.

   Case 1 does not require any service modeling, as the protocol enables
   dynamic exchange of necessary VPN routes.

   Case 2 requires to maintain some route-target filtering policy on
   ASBRs.  From a service modeling point of view, it is necessary to
   agree on the list of route target to authorize.

   In case 3, both ASes need to agree on the VPN route-target to
   exchange and in addition how to map a VPN route-target from AS A to
   the corresponding route-target in AS B (and vice-versa).

   Those modelings are currently out of scope of this document.

   provider network B and a cloud service provider A.  Both service
   providers does not trust themselves and use a different route-target

   allocation policy.  So, in term of implementation, the customer VPN
   has a different route-target in each network (RT A in CSP A and RT B
   is CSP B).  In order to connect the customer virtual network in CSP A
   to the customer IPVPN (VPN1) in SP B network, CSP A should request SP
   B to open the customer VPN on the NNI (accept the appropriate RT).
   Who does the RT translation is up to an agreement between the two
   service providers : SP B may permit CSP A to request VPN (RT)
   translation.

   From a VPN service perspective, option C NNI is very similar to
   option B as a MP-BGP session is used to exchange VPN routes between
   the ASes.  The difference is that the forwarding and control plane
   are separated on different nodes, so the MP-BGP is multi-hop between
   routing gateway (RGW) nodes.

   Modeling option B and C will be identical from a VPN service point of
   view.

6.  Service model usage example

   As explained in Section 4, this service model is intended to be
   instantiated at a management layer and is not intended to be used
   directly on network elements.  The management system serves as a
   central point of configuration of the overall service.

   This section provides an example on how a management system can use
   this model to configure an IPVPN service on network elements.

   The example wants to achieve the provisionning of a VPN service for 3
   sites using hub and spoke topology.  One of the site will be dual
   homed and loadsharing is expected.

   +-------------------------------------------------------------+
   |   Hub_Site  ------ PE1               PE2 ------ Spoke_Site1 |
   |      |                   +----------------------------------+
   |      |                   |
   |      |                   +----------------------------------+
   |   Hub_Site  ------ PE3               PE4 ------ Spoke_Site2 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------+

   The following XML describes the overall simplified service
   configuration of this VPN.

   <vpn-svc>
       <vpn-id>12456487</vpn-id>
       <customer-name>CUSTOMER1</customer-name>
       <topology>hub-spoke</topology>
   </vpn-svc>

   When receiving the request for provisioning the VPN service, the
   management system will internally (or through discussion with other
   OSS component) allocates VPN route-targets.  In this specific case
   two RTs will be allocated (100:1 for Hub and 100:2 for Spoke).  The
   output below describes the configuration of Spoke1.

   When receiving the request for provisioning Spoke1 site, the
   management system MUST allocate network resources for this site.  It
   MUST first decide the target network elements to provision the
   access, and especially the PE router (and may be an aggregation
   switch).  As described in Section 5.5, the management system SHOULD
   use the location information and SHOULD use the access-diversity
   constraint to find the appropriate PE.  In this case, we consider
   Spoke1 requires PE diversity with Hub and that management system
   allocate PEs based on lowest distance.  Based on the location
   information, the management system finds the available PEs in the
   nearest area of the customer and picks one that fits the access-
   diversity constraint.

   When the PE is chosen, management system needs to allocate interface
   resources on the node, one interface is so picked from the PE
   available pool.  The management system can start provisioning the PE
   node by using any mean (Netconf, CLI, ...).  The management system
   will check if a VRF is already present that fits the needs.  If not,
   it will provision the VRF : Route distinguisher will come from
   internal allocation policy model, route-targets are coming from the
   vpn-policy configuration of the site (management system allocated
   some RTs for the VPN).  As the site is a spoke site (site-role), the
   management system knows which RT must be imported and exported.  As
   the site is provider managed, some management route-targets may also

   Example of generated PE configuration :

   ip vrf Customer1
    export-map STD-CUSTOMER-EXPORT      <---- Standard SP configuration
    route-distinguisher 100:3123234324
    route-target import 100:1
    route-target import 100:5000        <---- Standard SP configuration
    route-target export 100:2                    for provider managed
   !

   When the VRF has been provisioned, the management system can start
   configuring the access on the PE using the allocated interface
   information.  IP addressing is chosen by the management system.  One
   address will be picked from an allocated subnet for the PE, another
   will be used for the CE configuration.  Routing protocols will also
   be configured between PE and CE and due to provider managed model,
   the choice is up to service provider : BGP was chosen for the
   example.  This choice is independant of the routing protocol chosen
   by customer.  For the CE - LAN part, bgp will be used as requested in
   the service model.  Peering addresses will be derived from those of
   the connection.  As CE is provider managed, CE AS number can be
   automatically allocated by the management system.  Some provider
   standard configuration templates may also be added.

  ip route vrf Customer1 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.255 198.51.100.2
  ! Static route for provider administration of CE
  !

   As the CE router is not reachable at this stage, the management
   system can produce a complete CE configuration that can be uploaded
   to the node by manual operation before sending the CE to customer
   premise.  The CE configuration will be built as for the PE.  Based on
   the CE type (vendor/model) allocated to the customer and bearer
   information, the management system knows which interface must be
   configured on the CE.  PE-CE link configuration is expected to be
   handled automatically using the service provider OSS as both
   resources are managed internally.  CE to LAN interface parameters
   like IP addressing are derived from ip-connection taking into account
   how management system distributes addresses between PE and CE within
   the subnet.  This will allow to produce a plug'n'play configuration
   for the CE.

7.  Interaction with Other YANG Modules

   As expressed in Section 4, this service module is intended to be
   instantiated in management system and not directly on network
   elements.

   It will be the role of the management system to configure the network
   elements.  The management system MAY be modular, so the component
   instantiating the service model (let's call it service component) and

   In the previous sections, we provided some example of translation of
   service provisioning request to router configuration lines as
   illustration.  In the NetConf/Yang ecosystem, it will be expected
   NetConf/YANG to be used between configuration component and network
   elements to configure the requested service on these elements.

   In this framework, it is expected from standardization to also work
   on specific configuration YANG modelization of service components on
   network elements.  There will be so a strong relation between the
   abstracted view provided by this service model and the detailed
   configuration view that will be provided by specific configuration
   models for network elements.

   Authors of this document are expecting definition of YANG models for
   network elements on this non exhaustive list of items :

   o  VRF definition including VPN policy expression.

   o  Physical interface.

   o  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6).

   o  QoS : classification, profiles...

   In the service example above, it is expected that the service
   component requests to the configuration component of the management
   system the configuration of the service elements.  If we consider
   that service component selected a PE (PE A) as target PE for the
   site, the configuration component will need to push the configuration
   to PE A.  The configuration component will use several YANG data
   models to define the configuration to be applied to PE A.  The XML
   configuration of PE-A may look like this :

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] or NETCONF protocol
   ([RFC6241].  The lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the
   transport-layer protocol provides both data integrity and
   confidentiality, see Section 2 in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] and
   [RFC6241].  The client MUST carefully examine the certificate
   presented by the server to determine if it meets the client's
   expectations, and the server MUST authenticate client access to any
   protected resource.  The client identity derived from the
   authentication mechanism used is subject to the NETCONF Access
   Control Module (NACM) ([RFC6536]).  Other protocols to access this
   YANG module are also required to support the similar mechanism.

   The data nodes defined in the "ietf-l3vpn-svc" YANG module MUST be
   carefully created/read/updated/deleted.  The entries in the lists
   below include customer proprietary or confidential information,

   therefore only authorized clients MUST access the information and the
   other clients MUST NOT be able to access to the information.

11.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a new URI from the IETF XML registry
   ([RFC3688]).  Authors are suggesting the following URI :

       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-svc
       Registrant Contact: L3SM WG
       XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace

   This document also requests a new YANG module name in the YANG Module
   Names registry ([RFC6020]) with the following suggestion :

       name: ietf-l3vpn-svc
       namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-svc
       prefix: l3vpn-svc
       reference: RFC XXXX
