Abstract 
    
    This document describes the multihoming issues in Mobile IP networks. 
    It specifies the basic multihoming scenario, a mobile node is multihomed 
    to multiple home agents within an AS, then describes the multihoming 
    method for this basic scenario. The principle of the multihoming method in 
    this document is that multiple home agents share security associations 
    established between a mobile node and a home agent. By sharing security 
    associations among home agents who serve the same home link, we can reduce 
    the burden of MN to manage the HA list. This document points out technical 
    issues related to sharing security associations among home agents and 
    specifies possible solutions for them. Also, this document describes how 
    to extend the basic multihoming method to more complicated multihoming 
    cases such as multiple home agents in different AS.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming scenario in mipv6        12 July 2004


1. Introduction

1.1 Motivations

    Multihoming, using multiple connectivities to multiple ISPs 
    simultaneously, provides more reliable and robust network connectivity to 
    customer networks by supporting fault-tolerance, load-sharing. However, 
    supporting multihoming in Mobile IP is more complicated matter because 
    there are invariably many multihoming scenarios in Mobile IP.
    
    Wakikawa, et al [5] proposed the HAHA protocol which includes multiple 
    home agents activation scenario. In HAHA protocol, the MN must keep track 
    of the home agents who have its binding information to verify the source 
    address of tunneled packets. In addition, MN must establish an independent 
    SA with each HA to receive to tunneled packets from multiple home agents, 
    which increases the burden of MN to manage security association (SA) 
    database.
    
    This document describes several multihoming scenarios in Mobile IP. These 
    scenarios considers the same situation as the multiple Home Agents (HA) 
    activation scenario in HAHA protocol, but they have different assumptions 
    from those in the HAHA protocol. The multihoming scenarios in this 
    document only considers the case that MN only has one HA address, so MN 
    feels like it is communicating with a single HA. Another difference from 
    the HAHA protocol, the MN only maintains one SA for multiple HAs by 
    allowing multiple HAs to share SAs established between the primary HA and 
    the MN. This document describes these multihoming scenarios and specifies 
    technical issues in supporting these multihoming scenarios. In addition, 
    the document provides possible solutions for technical problems in 
    supporting multi-homed MN in Mobile IP network.     
    
    
1.2 Assumptions 
    
    Designing a comprehensive multihoming architecture for various multihoming 
    scenarios is important, however, it is a difficult task to achieve because 
    of its complexity. In this section, we make a few assumptions to limit the 
    scope of the multihoming scenario and reduce the complexity of new 
    multihoming architecture in the given scenario. Removing these assumptions 
    does not mean that the architecture would fail to support mobility for 
    multihomed MNs. It simply requires replacing each assumptions with a 
    specific scheme which has the same functionalities as the following 
    assumptions.

    (Assumption 1) MN accesses multiple HAs using a single IP addresses: The 
    simplest way to remove this assumption is providing the HA list to MN. 
    That is, if MN has knowledge about IP addresses of HAs, it can select its 
    preferred HA based on the list. However, this solution is not transparent 
    to MN because it requires an extra function to manage the HA list. This 
    assumption is applicable across the document unless we specify a different 
    assumption.

    (Assumption 2) MN has only one active CoA at a time: Whenever MN visits 
    new network, it receives new COA. Thus, it is possible for MN to have 
    multiple CoAs. There are many scenarios that may lead to multiple CoAs for 
    MN, as described in [1]. This document assumes one active CoA for MN 
    because it is more common case in Mobile IP network.                          

    (Assumption 3) There exist trust relations among HAs: Since this document 
    supports multiple HAs, it requires inter-HA communications. Without a 
    certain level of trust relations among HAs, the new multihoming 
    architecture can easily be compromised. This document provide a inter-HA 
    protocol, the extension of the HAHA protocol, to provide the trust 
    relations among HAs.
        
    
2. Basic multihoming scenario - multiple HAs within a single AS                  
                                                                      
    The purpose of composing a basic scenario is to decide the scope of basic 
    multihoming architecture and to specify how this basic architecture does 
    support multi-homed MNs. The basic scenario considers the case that MN is 
    multihomed to multiple HAs in different home links within a single AS. The 
    fundamental differences of this basic scenario from the HAHA protocol are: 
    (1) multiple HAs are accessable using one HA address, (2) multiple HAs 
    share security associations established between MN and the primary HA. The 
    goal of this multihoming configuration is to provide HA redundancy for MN.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming scenario in mipv6        12 July 2004  

     
    Figure 1 illustrates an example of basic multihoming scenario. In this 
    scenario, we have three HAs which are located at different links within a 
    single AS. Each HA advertises the same network prefix for MN's home link 
    via the IGP routing protocol. The metric/cost used for these advertisement 
    can be statistically configured on HA or dynamically be MN which sending a 
    kind of priority information to each HA [6]. In addition, the AS routers 
    where the home links are located also advertises BGP messages to the 
    Internet.

    A MN, whose home address (HoA) is 192.168.1.100, visits a network 
    10.10.10/24, and receives a care-of-address, 10.10.10.100. The MN sends 
    out the Binding Update (BU) message to its home link with setting the 
    destination address, 192.168.1.254 reserved for HAs (We assume that the 
    MN's HoA is already registered). When the BU message is reached to AS 1, 
    it will be routed to one of HAs according to IGP routing policy. the HA 
    who receives the BU message from the MN becomes the primary HA for that 
    MN. In this example, we assume the home link where HA 1 is on is the best 
    route, so HA 1 is the primary HA for the MN. When HA 1 receives the BU 
    message, it updates the binding information on its Binding Information 
    Cache and sends out the Binding Information Update messages to other HAs 
    at different link.
    
    The primary HA (HA 1) sends the BU acknowledgment message back to the MN, 
    and invokes the IKE security association (SA) negotiation if necessary. If 
    the current SA between HA and MN is revoked or expired, the primary HA 
    should invoke the IKE SA negotiation. If SA for a specific MN has been 
    updated, the primary HA should send out the SA Information Update message 
    to other HAs. All HAs that receive the SA Information Update message 
    should confirm the reception of the message using the SA Information 
    acknowledgment.
    
    When the MN finishes updating binding information and SA information (if 
    necessary), it can communicate with multiple HAs using multiple 
    bidirectional tunnels. Conceptually, the MN feels like that it is 
    exchanging packets with only its primary HA. That is, all outbound packets 
    from MN are routed to the primary HA because it is the best route to the 
    home link, and all inbound packets from multiple HAs are tunneled to the 
    MN with one HA source address.
   
    The benefits of the basic multihoming scenario is that we can reduce the 
    burden of MN to maintain the HA list and SA database. Since the MN can 
    access multiple HAs using one HA address and multiple HAs share SAs, the 
    MN does not have to maintain HA list to track HAs who have its binding 
    information and SA information. If the MN should establish SA with each 
    HA, the burden to manage SA database would increase. Furthermore, if the 
    Key Management Mobility Capability (K) bit in the BU message is cleared, 
    HA should re-establish SA between MN and HA. It is obvious that IKE SA 
    renegotiation per BU dramatically increases the burden of MN.
    
    There are several technical issues in supporting this basic multihoming 
    scenario, including inconsistent IPsec sequence number and additional 
    inter-HA communications. The following section describes these technical 
    issues and possible solutions for them.

 3. Technical issues in implementing basic scenario    
    
    The basic principle of the basic multihoming scenario is that multiple HAs 
    share SA established between MN and its primary HA. However, there are 
    several technical issues in implementing this basic multihoming scenario. 
    This subsection describes these technical issues and suggests possible 
    solutions to deal with these issues.
    
    
3.1 Inconsistent IPsec sequence number
    
    The IPsec sequence number is an unsigned 32-bit counter which 
    monotonically increments by one for each IPsec packet [2,3]. This field is 
    mandatory and always present even if the anti-replay service for a 
    specific SA is disabled. In addition, the sender's and receiver's counters 
    are initialized to 0 when an SA is established, and the transmitted 
    sequence number must never be allowed to cycle. That, if all sequence 
    numbers are used, the sender's and receiver's counters must be reset to 0 
    by establishing new SA and key. 
    
    If multiple HAs are allowed to share the same SA, it is difficult to 
    synchronize IPsec sequence number among tunneled packets by them. That is, 
    if multiple HAs initially set their IPsec sequence numbers to 0 and 
    independently increase their sequence number by one, then an HA would 
    repeat the sequence number sent by other HA. This packet with repeated 
    IPsec sequence number by different HA is still considered as the replayed 
    and discard at MN.
    
    To cope with inconsistent IPsec sequence number among multiple senders, we 
    provide additional information, the original IP address of HA, for MN to 
    separate the IPsec packet stream from each HA. All HAs are accessible from 
    MN using the reserved HA address, but each HA should have its original IP 
    address to be attached to the home link. Each HA who shares the same SA adds 
    its original IP address information to the destination option header in 
    the outer header of tunneled packet [8]. To do this, we define the 
    ORIGIN_IP destination option.

    When MN receives the inbound tunneled packets, it checks the ORIGIN_IP 
    option in the destination option header to extract the original ip address 
    of the sender HA. Based on the original HA address, the MN can split the 
    IPsec tunneled streams into an individual stream from each HA.

    Additionally, to avoid unnecessary examination of the destination option 
    header for the non-multihomed MN, the primary HA must notify whether the 
    MN is multihomed or not. For this purpose, we define the multi-homed (M) 
    bit and use in the BU acknowledgment message. If M bit is set (using one 
    bit from reserved field), it indicates that the MN is multihomed to 
    multiple HAs.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming scenario in mipv6        12 July 2004   


3.2 Inter-HA protocol

    Because the basic multihoming scenario assumes multiple HAs who share 
    SA information, inter-HA protocol is required to synchronize binding and 
    SA information among HAs. The Inter-HA protocol can be categorized into 
    three parts, which are synchronizing binding information, synchronizing SA 
    information, and HA failure detection and recovery. Most messages except 
    synchronizing SA information in this section are equivalent to those 
    defined in HAHA protocol [5]. All the message described in this section 
    must be authenticated and encrypted using the IPsec ESP mode.


3.2.1 Synchronizing binding information 
    
    There are two possible ways in synchronizing binding information. First, 
    HA can request Binding Cache information for a specific MN to its primary 
    HA. In this case, the HA that wants Binding Cache information sends out the 
    Binding Information Request message to the primary HA for the MN. When the 
    primary HA for the MN receives the Binding Information request message, it 
    replies with the Binding information update message. In this case, the 
    sender of the Binding Information update message copies the identifier 
    field from the request message.
    
    The second is that the primary HA for a specific MN sends out the Binding 
    Information Update message to other HAs on the HA list whenever there is 
    the change in its Binding Information Cache. So, if MN registers a new CoA 
    to the primary HA, it sends out new binding information of the MN to other 
    HAs in order to synchronize binding information among them. The Binding 
    Information update message has the same format as the Binding update 
    request message, but it sets the identifier field with random number and 
    also use the Binding Cache Entry Information option [5]. 
    
    When a HA receives the solicited or unsolicited Binding Information update 
    message, it confirms with the Binding Information acknowledgment message 
    
    
3.2.2 Synchronizing SA information 

    Along with synchronizing binding information, synchronizing SA information 
    is a critical task to share SA information among multiple HAs. The 
    procedure of synchronizing SA information is very similar to that of 
    binding information except it requires an additional SA Information renew 
    request message.

    HA can request the SA information for a specific MN to the primary HA 
    using the SA information request message. This message also has 16 bit 
    non-zero identifier field to identity the sender of the request message. 
    When the primary HA receives the SA Information request message, it 
    replies with the SA information update message. 
    In this case, the primary HA copies the identifier field from the request 
    message and store SA entry
 information in the message.  
                                                 


S. Hong, et al                 Expires January 2005              [Page 6]    	          

Internet-Draft            Multihoming scenario in mipv6        12 July 2004    


    On the other hand, HA can send out the SA Information update message in 
    the same manner as the Binding Information update message when there is 
    the change in SA Information for a specific MN by reestablishing SA due to 
    SA revocation or expiration. In this case, the primary HA sets random 
    number in the identifier field. When other HAs receive the SA Information 
    update message, it replies with the SA Information acknowledgment message.

    Since multiple HA shares SAs, it is possible that one HA used all IPsec 
    sequence numbers earlier than other HAs. If that HA is the primary one, it 
    reestablishes new SA for MN and sends out the SA Information update 
    message. However, the HA is not primary HA, then it sends the SA 
    Information renew request message to the primary HA for that SA. When the 
    primary HA receives this message, it renew SA Information with the MN 
    and sends out the SA Information update message to other HAs.
    

3.3.3 HA failure detection and recovery

    There are two possible methods to detect HA failure. First, HA can detect 
    the failure of other HAs by sending an application-level keepalive message 
    to other HAs on a regular basis. If an HA does not respond to these 
    messages consecutively, the sender HA of this message marks the HA entry 
    as invalid.
    
    The second method is to use the HA HELLO message defined in [5]. HA 
    regularly sends out these HA HELLO messages to inform other HAs of 
    activeness of the sender HA of these messages. So, if an HA does not 
    receive these message several times in a row, it marks the HA entry as 
    invalid. 

    Recovering from HA failure in the basic scenario is relatively simple 
    because HAs share SA information. Even when an HA detects the failure of 
    one of HAs, it still sends out incoming traffic to the MN because it has 
    the SA information for the MN. However, if the failed HA is the primary HA 
    for MN, the outgoing traffic from MN will experience delay until the 
    IGP settles down new paths to other HAs. Once the new routes to an 
    alternate HA are available, the MN is able to keep sending out tunneled 
    packets with the same SA before the failure without re-establishing SA 
    information. In addition, if the failed HA is the primary HA for the MN 
    and the SA for MN should be renegotiated, the HA receiving the outbound 
    traffic from the MN checks if the primary HA for the MN is marked as 
    invalid. If yes, it takes over the primary HA position for the MN by 
    sending out the primary HA switch message as defined in [5].
    
    To make this work, A HA must know all other HAs located in different links 
    beforehand by manually configured on each HA.

4. Extended scenarios - multiple HAs in different AS

    In this section we extends the basic scenario to support multiple HAs in 
    different AS. 


4.1 Multiple HAs in different AS with one HoA

    This scenario considers the case that MN's home links are distributed in 
    different AS. The MN still can access the its home network in different 
    AS using one HoA. In practice, this scenario represents the global HA 
    distribution that multiple HAs are distributed globally irrespective of 
    routing domains to support the global access for their mobile customers. 
    The goal of this multi-homing scenario is to provide HA redundancy and 
    kind of a route optimization.

    Figure 2. Extended multihoming scenario: multiple HAs in different AS. 
              They are accessable using one HA address.

    Figure 2 illustrates an example of the extended multihoming scenario. As 
    shown in Figure 2, each AS supports multiple home links for MN as defined 
    in the basic scenario in section 2, and these ASs support multiple HAs 
    globally distributed in different routing domain by advertising the same 
    network prefix of MN's home network (192.169.1/24). The rest of Internet 
    will use the closest HA to communicate with the MN according to the BGP 
    routing policy.

    The benefit of this architecture is that the inbound traffic to the MN is 
    always going to be the cheapest HA according to the BGP policy of the CN 
    domain. For the outbound traffic from the MN is also going to be the cheapest 
    HA (the primary HA) to the visiting network, but it does not mean the 
    cheapest path to the CN.  To provide a kind of route optimization for the 
    outbound traffic from the MN, we need the inter-HA communications. That is, 
    if other HA can provide the better route path to the CN than that of the 
    primary HA, it can issue the primary HA switch message to the current 
    primary HA.

    The technical issue in this extended scenario is that multiple ASs should 
    advertise the same network prefix for MN's home link. These announcements 
    can be deleted by the mechanisms to cope with "route hijacking". Carbon, 
    et al [6] and Savola [7] pointed out this issue and showed the possible 
    solutions. In theory, all prefixes advertised by anyone should be available 
    in the route registry (e.g., Internet Route Registry (IRR))to examine 
    multihoming for a specific prefix.


4.2 Multiple HAs in different AS with multiple HoAs

    Another extended multihoming scenario is that multiple HAs are distributed 
    in different AS, but MN has multiple HoAs, may be one for each AS. This 
    scenario is the typical example of site-multihoming. This scenario is 
    likely that we have the combination of multiple basic scenario. That is, 
    the configuration of each AS are identical to that of the basic scenario. 
    Since HAs within an AS do not interfere with those in other AS, no change 
    in the basic scenario is required. Also, the HA in one AS does not have to 
    communicate with one in other HA, no inter-HA communication between them 
    is necessary.

5. Security considerations

    To protect all the messages between multiple HAs, the HA should use the 
    IPsec ESP mode to authenticate and encrypt inter-HA messages.

    Since multiple HAs share SA information established between the MN and its 
    primary HA, the primary HA should authenticate the other HAs who serves 
    the same MN to prevent a malicious HA from launching attacks. Whenever a 
    new HA is introduced to serve the same network prefix, other HAs should 
    verify if this new HA is authenticated and authorized for the service.

    Since this multihoming scenario needs trust relations among HAs who serve 
    the same home link, the mechanism to isolate the compromised HA when they 
    detects it is necesary.
