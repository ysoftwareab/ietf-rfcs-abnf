Abstract 
   
  This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with 
  network management protocols in the Internet community. In 
  particular, it defines a MIB for the Forwarding and Control Element 
  Separation (ForCES) Network Element (NE). The ForCES working group 
  is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the 
  behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE).

1. 
  Introduction 
    
 
   The ForCES MIB is a read-only MIB that captures information related 
   to the ForCES protocol. This includes state information about the 
   associations between CE(s) and FE(s) in the NE.  
    
   The ForCES MIB does not include information that is specified in 
   other MIBs, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.  
    
   The information in the ForCES MIB relative to associations includes 
   more specifically:  
    
   - identifiers of the elements in the association

   - state of the association  
   - configuration parameters of the association  
   - statistics of the association  
    
   The relevant references from the ForCES requirements and architecture 
   documents are repeated below:  
    
   From the ForCES requirements RFC [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 4:  
    
     “A NE MUST support the appearance of a single functional device. 
     For example, in a router, the TTL of the packet should be 
     decremented only once as it traverses the NE regardless of how many 
     FEs through which it passes.  However, external entities (e.g., FE 
     managers and CE managers) MAY have direct access to individual 
     ForCES protocol elements for providing information to transition 
     them from the pre-association to post-association phase.”  
      
   And [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 14: 
       
     “1. The ability for a management tool (e.g., SNMP) to be used to 
     read(but not change) the state of FE SHOULD NOT be precluded.  
     2. It MUST NOT be possible for management tools (e.g., SNMP, etc) 
     to change the state of a FE in a manner that affects overall NE 
     behavior without the CE being notified.” 
      
   According to the ForCES architecture RFC [RFC 3746], Section 3.3:  
      
     “CE managers may be physically and logically separate entities that 
     configure the CE with FE information via such mechanisms as COPS-PR 
     [7] or SNMP [5].” 
      
   and [RFC 3746], Section 5.7:   
      
     “RFC 1812 [2] also dictates that "Routers MUST be manageable by 
     SNMP". In general, for the post-association phase, most external 
     management tasks (including SNMP) should be done through 
     interaction with the CE in order to support the appearance of a 
     single functional device. Therefore, it is recommended that an SNMP 
     agent be implemented by CEs and that the SNMP messages received by 
     FEs be redirected to their CEs. AgentX framework defined in RFC 
     2741 ([6]) may be applied here such that CEs act in the role of 
     master agent to process SNMP protocol messages while FEs act in the 
     role of subagent to provide access to the MIB objects residing on 
     FEs.  AgentX protocol messages between the master agent (CE) and 
     the subagent (FE) are encapsulated and transported via ForCES, just 
     like data packets from any other application layer protocols.”

2. 
  Design of ForCES MIB 
    
   As state information is distributed across FEs and CEs, the following 
   alternatives may be considered:  
    
   1) CE MIBs  
   Each CE in the NE implements a CE MIB. The external SNMP-based 
   management tool must therefore be aware of each CE in order to obtain 
   a complete view of the NE by collecting state information obtained 
   from each CE MIB.  
   [Note: this may or may not comply with requirement #4 ("A NE MUST 
   support the appearance of a single functional device")]  
    
   2) single NE MIB  
   An entity in the NE implements an NE MIB that aggregates state 
   information collected from each CE (CEs are possibly from various 
   vendors). This requires a standard protocol in order to support 
   multi-vendor environment. AgentX with the NE as the master and the 
   CE(s) as the agent(s) may be considered here. 
     
   [Note: comments on the suitability of AgentX]  
    
   [Note: must choose between the two alternatives] 
    
3. 
  Capturing State Before Association Establishment 
    
   The ForCES protocol may be used by the CE to query the FE Protocol 
   LFB about some of the configuration parameters. But such queries may 
   obviously be issued only once the association is established.  
    
   In the ForCES protocol, the FE first issues an Association Setup 
   Request message to the CE which in turns responds with an Association 
   Setup Response message. It may be useful to capture in the MIB in 
   which state the association is seen from each of the FE and the CE 
   sides, as a means to detect PL-level communication anomalies. For 
   instance, from the FE side, the association is in the ATTEMPT state 
   as long as no response to the Association Setup message has been 
   received from the CE. Similarly, the association is in the 
   ESTABLISHING state as long as no message has been received from the 
   FE after the CE has issued a positive Association Setup Response 
   message (this is because configuration mistakes in the FE may cause 
   messages from the CE to be ignored, and the MIB could help in tracing 
   such errors).  
    
   The transient state in the FE until the association is established 
   cannot be queried using ForCES.  
    
   [Note: If such information is critical, then an FE MIB has to be 
   provided that can be queried separately]

  MIB Definition(s) 
    
   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the 
   following information is included in the MIB:  
    
   [Note: the MIB includes all associations for the particular CE in the 
   case of a CE MIB, same for FE MIBs (if any), or all associations in 
   the NE in the case of a NE MIB]  
    
   - Current state of the association:  
    
    UP:   the CE(s) indicated by the CE ID and FE(s) indicated by  
   the FE ID are associated.  
    ESTABLISHING/ATTEMPT: transient state unitl the association is 
   established. See section 3 above for details.  
    
   Note that associations that are not UP and for which no association 
   setup is in progress are NOT listed in the MIB.  
    
   [Note: otherwise how do we decide which old associations to remove 
   from the MIB ?]  
    
   - Hearbeat timers values of the FE and CE for this association.  
    
   - Heartbeat timer settings of the FE and CE for this association:  
    
    ENABLED:  hearbeats are transmitted (by default virtual piggybacking  
   is used)  
    DISABLED: heartbeats are not transmitted  
    
   - Backup information: the FE(s)/CE(s) that are configured to work as  
   backups for this association.  
   [Note: is this necessary, useful ?]  
    
   - Association statistics:  
    Date/time when the association came to the UP state.  
    
   [Note: what about the Number of commands executed or some indications 
   of the ForCES control traffic ?]  
    
    
   [Note: add actual MIB specification] 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module may be considered 
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environment.

   [Note: expand on this if necessary] 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
