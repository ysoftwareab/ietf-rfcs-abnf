  Abstract 
  
   IP Mobility support for IPv4 [RFC3344] defines a short and skippable 
   extension header format intended to extend the Mobile IP extension 
   address space. Based on the format presented in [RFC3344], this 
   draft defines a generalized Mobile IP extension, which SHOULD be 
   used by any Mobile IP entity to exchange information of the network 
   entities like DNS server address, previous Foreign Agent (FA) 
   address, Network Access Identifier (NAI) and/or address of a session 
   manager etc. 
   
1  Introduction 

   This draft uses short and skippable extension header format defined 
   by [RFC3344] and offers a generalized solution to exchange 
   information like address of DNS server, address of previous FA 
   and/or address of a session manager etc.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.  
    
3  Generalized Mobile IP Extension 

   The Mobile IP extension SHALL have the format shown in this section 
   to carry information like IPv4 address, NAI etc. Note that this 
   extension MAY be included as a part of Mobile IP Registration 
   Request or Registration Reply message. If multiple Sub-Types are 
   needed in the same message, the generalized header SHOULD be 
   repeated for each Sub-Type.

   |  Data... 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
   Type 
       IPV4-GENERALIZED-EXT-TYPE=TBD. This extension value will be 
       assigned by IANA from the numbering space defined in [RFC3344] 
       for skippable extensions.
	   
   Length 
       Represents 8-bit unsigned integer (in bytes). Length of the 
       extension includes the extension type and the extension Length 
       fields. This field MUST be set to 1 plus the total length of the 
       Data and Entity-Type fields. 
    
   Sub-Type 
       This field describes the type of entity, whose information is 
       included in Data field. Currently the following types are 
       defined: 
       PRIMARY-DNS = TBD 
       SECONDARY-DNS = TBD 
       PREVIOUS-FOREIGN-AGENT = TBD 
       SESSION-MANAGER = TBD 
    
   Entity-Type 
       This field includes the type of the network entity that inserts 
       the Data field. Currently the following types are defined: 
       HOME-AGENT = TBD 
       FOREIGN-AGENT = TBD 
       MOBILE-NODE = TBD 
    
   Data

       This field is inserted by the network entity mentioned in 
       Entity-Type. This field represents data of the Sub-Type. Note 
       that this data can be IPv4 address, NAI etc. 
	   
4  Processing of Generalized Extension

   When a network entity (mentioned in the extension format under 
   Entity-Type) adds a generalized extension to a Registration message, 
   this extension MUST appear prior to any authentication extensions 
   added by that entity. 
   
5  IANA Considerations 

   This draft defines new Mobile IPv4 extension of types IPV4-
   GENERALIZED-EXT-TYPE as defined in section 3 of this document. This 
   value MUST be assigned by IANA from the Mobile IP numbering space 
   for skippable extensions. Additionally, unique values MUST be 
   assigned to each member of the Sub-Type and Entity-Type fields. 
   
6  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security aspects imposed by this document in 
   addition to the one defined in [RFC3344].
