1.  Introduction

   RFC 6809 [2] specifies the SIP Feature-Caps header field that conveys
   feature-capability indicators that are used to indicate support of
   features and capabilities for SIP entities that are not represented
   by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the Contact header field.
   RFC 6809 [2] also creates a new IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature
   Feature-Capability Indicator Trees", for registering feature-
   capability indicators including a SIP feature-capability indicator
   tree for registering SIP feature-capability indicators that is
   similar to the media feature tag SIP tree defined in RFC 3840 [3].
   To date only one feature-capability indicator, sip.607 (RFC 8197
   [14]) has been included in the SIP feature-capability indicator tree.

   This document populates this SIP tree with some additional feature-
   capability indicators that are based upon those already defined in
   RFC 3840 [3], RFC 4569 [4], RFC 5768 [5], RFC 5688 [6] and RFC 6913
   [7] and also defines an additional SIP feature-capability indicator
   "Contact-features" that allows an intermediary to indicate a contact
   address and the capabilities supported by that intermediary if SIP
   Requests are sent to that contact address.

2.  Motivation

   SIP sessions often involve intermediaries (typically acting as
   B2BUAs) that in addition to forwarding SIP requests and responses can
   also act as UAs to perform more complex manipulations of the session.
   Examples of such intermediaries include IP PBXs (Internet Protocol
   Private Branch Exchanges), Telephony Call Feature Application Servers
   and Session Transfer Anchor Points.  Often the manipulations of the
   session by the intermediary are initiated by one of the UAs in the
   session sending a request (such as REFER request) to the intermediary
   to for example transfer the session or create a conference.
   Additionally UAs may also need to subscribe to events related to the
   session with the intermediary accepting such subscriptions and
   providing the notification of event state changes.

   Typically such functionality has been achieved by sending such REFER
   and SUBSCRIBE requests within the established dialog for the session,
   with the intermediary then intercepting and processing the REFER or
   SUBSCRIBE request rather than forwarding it to the remote UAS.
   However such dialog reuse has been problematic and RFC 6665 [8] has
   deprecated dialog reuse (except for legacy interoperability).
   However, in order to avoid reusing the same dialog as the session and
   achieve equivalent functionality when interacting with intermediaries
   using for instance REFER request requires that the UA obtain the
   Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) of the intermediary and also
   know that the intermediary supports the relevant capabilities such as
   the required SIP methods (i.e.  REFER) as well as the needed SIP
   extensions, (such as target dialog extension specified in RFC 4538 in
   [9]).

   Typically B2BUAs have acted as two UAs back-to-back with the Contact
   URI being the URI of the B2BUA.  However this means that GRUU of the
   UA is overwritten by the B2BUA and the meaning of the Contact header
   field parameters becomes obscure.  Do the Contact header field
   parameters reflect the capabilities of the Contact address (i.e. the
   B2BUA) or do they reflect the capabilities of the remote UA?  If they
   reflect the capabilities of the B2BUA then the identification of the
   capabilities of the remote UA have been lost.  If they reflect the
   capabilities of the remote UA then they falsely identify that the
   B2BUA contact address has the capabilities of the remote UA.

   Another use case for B2BUAs is in control of Application Level
   Gateways (ALGs).  These ALGs are controlled by SIP intermediaries
   that act as routing B2BUs and perform media functions such as IP
   address translation, transcoding, and media policing.  Such ALGs may
   only support some media types while blocking others.  It is useful if
   the media types that are allowed can be communicated to other
   entities in the SIP signaling so that fruitless attempts to establish

Internet-Draft          SIP Capability Indicators              June 2018


   sessions with media types that will not be allowed are not
   attempted.Such functionality is required by 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia
   Subsystem) to avoid unnecessary failed session establishment
   attempts.

   What is needed is a way for intermediaries to pass the remote UA's
   contact address and capabilities transparently in the Contact header
   field while being able to indicate their own contact address (i.e
   GRUU) and associated capabilities to the UA.

   RFC 6809 [2] provides that addresses of intermediaries can be
   communicated as a value of an associated feature-capability
   indicator.  What is needed is a feature capability indicator to
   communicate the contact address GRUU (Globally Routable User Agent
   URI of the intermediary along with the associated media feature-
   capability indicators tags representing the capabilities supported by
   that of the intermediary if SIP Requests are sent to that contact
   address.  The feature-capability indicators for communicating SIP
   related capabilities (e.g. supported SIP Methods and extensions) also
   need to be registered in the SIP tree in order to allow an
   intermediary to indicate the SIP features it supports when forwarding
   SIP requests or the media capabilities it supports as an ALG.

3.  SIP Feature-Capability indicators

   This document defines a new Feature-Capability indicator in the SIP
   tree:

                     sip.contact

   The sip.contact Feature-Capability indicator provides a GRUU as the
   contact address of the intermediary along with a list of all the
   media feature tags representing the capabilities of the intermediary
   supported by that intermediary if SIP Requests areent to that contact
   address.

   The following media feature tags from RFC 3840 [3]", RFC 4569 [4],
   RFC 5768 [5], RFC 5688 [6] and RFC 6913 [7] are considered to be
   useful to also be defined as Feature-Capability indicators:

        sip.audio
      sip.application
      sip.data
      sip.control
      sip.video
      sip.text
      sip.message
      sip.ice
      sip.app-subtype
      sip.fax

   An intermediary that includes at least feature capability indicator
   of one of the above media capabilities SHOULD include all the feature
   capability indicators for the media it will allow.  The absence of a
   media capability from the list of feature capability indicators MAY
   be interpreted by another entity as indicating that this media is not
   allowed.  The lack of indication of any of the above media
   capabilities SHOULD be interpreted as inconclusive information about
   what media is allowed or not allowed.

   The following media feature tags from RFC 3840 [3], RFC 4235 [10] and
   RFC 5626 [11] are currently NOT considered to be useful to be defined
   as Feature-Capability indicators since they do not represent stream
   types likely to be implemented by an intermediary:

           sip.automata
           sip.class
           sip.mobility
           sip.actor

           sip.methods
           sip.extensions
           sip.schemes
           sip.isfocus

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in RFC 3840 [3] and RFC 6809 [2] apply to
   the use of Feature-capability indicators in the SIP tree.
