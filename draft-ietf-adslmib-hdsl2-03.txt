1.  Abstract

This document defines an experimental portion of the Management
Information Base (MIB) MIB module for use with network management
protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes
objects used for managing HDSL2 and SHDSL interfaces.

This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant 
to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 
definitions.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
    purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
    Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
    STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
    The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
    2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
    first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
    described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
    message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
    protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
    RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is

INTERNET-DRAFT            HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE MIB              October 2000

    called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
    RFC 2574 [12].

o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
    first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
    described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
    operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
    [13].

o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
    and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
    2575 [15].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].

2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object
type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we
often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
the object type.

3.  Introduction

This document describes an SNMP MIB for managing HDSL2/SHDSL Lines.
The MIB is intended to be compatible with both the SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.
These definitions are based upon the specifications for the HDSL2 and
SHDSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in ANSI 
T1E1.4/2000-006 [18] and ITU G.991.2 (ex G.SHDSL) [19].

INTERNET-DRAFT            HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE MIB              October 2000

The MIB will eventually be located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 
transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 1213 [20] and 
RFC 2863 [21]) section of this document.  Until approved by the IETF, 
vendors may also choose to support it under the experimental tree.

NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: please replace the above paragraph with the
following paragraph when appropriate:

The MIB is located in the MIB tree under MIB-2 transmission, as
discussing in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 1213 [20] and RFC 2863 [21])
section of this document.

3.1.  Relationship of the HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB with Standard MIBs

This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs 
described in RFCs and in various degrees of "standardization".
Specifically, MIB-2 as presented in RFC 1213 [20] and RFC 2863 [21]
is discussed.

3.1.1  General MIB-2 Integration (RFCs 1213 and 2863)

The HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [21]. The
IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to HDSL2 and SHDSL:

IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    ...
SYNTAX INTEGER {
    ...
    hdsl2 (168), -- High Bit-Rate DSL, 2nd generation
    shdsl (169), -- Multirate HDSL2
    ...
    }

This MIB will be accessed through the transmission subtree as shown:

hdsl2ShdslInterface  ::= { transmission xxx }
NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: please replace the xxx with an assigned number

3.1.2  Usage of ifTable

The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate
for this interface type.  Most such tables extend the ifEntry table,
and are indexed by ifIndex.

The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group in
RFC 2863 [21], and are not duplicated in the HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB.

===================================================================
    ifIndex                  Interface index.

    ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB [21].

    ifType                   hdsl2(168) or shdsl(169).

                             (This is fixed at 1552000 for HDSL2 lines)

                             with zero length.

    ifHighSpeed              Set as appropriate.
                             (For HDSL2 lines, this is fixed at 2)

    ifConnectorPresent       Set as appropriate.

4.4.  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

For SNR Margin, Loop Attenuation, ES, SES, CRC anomalies, LOSWS, and
UAS, there are event counters, current 15-minute and one (up to 96)
15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as
current and one (up to 30) previous 1-day interval-counter(s). Each 
current 15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold trap.

Unlike RFC 2493 [22] and RFC 2662 [23], there is no representation
in the MIB for invalid buckets.  In those cases where the data for
an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent should
not report the interval.

There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however
some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with
quarter hours. Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
day intervals with the start of a day.

Counters are not reset when an xU is reinitialized, only when the
agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
the scope of this MIB).

4.5.  Profiles

As a managed node can handle a large number of xUs, (e.g., hundreds
or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every 
xU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned 
identically; with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the 
provisioning process, this MIB makes use of profiles.  A profile is a

INTERNET-DRAFT            HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE MIB              October 2000

set of parameters that can be shared by multiple lines using the same 
configuration.

The following profiles are used in this MIB:

o   Span Configuration Profiles - Span configuration profiles contain
    parameters for configuring HDSL2/SHDSL spans.  They are defined in
    the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.  Since span configuration
    parameters are only applicable for SHDSL, the support for span 
    configuration profiles is optional for HDSL2 interfaces.
    
o   Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration Profiles - These profiles
    contain parameters for configuring alarm thresholds for HDSL2/
    SHDSL segment endpoints.  These profiles are defined in the 
    hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.

Implementations will enable the manager to dynamically create and
delete profiles as needed. The index of each profile is a locally-
unique administratively assigned name for the profile having the
textual convention `SnmpAdminString' (RFC 2571 [1]).

One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
profile (e.g., hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile = `silver') by
setting its hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile objects to the value of
this profile. If a change is made to the profile, all lines that refer
to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.  Before a profile
can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first unreferenced
from all associated lines.

Implementations must provide a default profile whose name is `DEFVAL'
for each profile type.  The values of the associated parameters will be
vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document. Before a
line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be automatically
used by setting hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile and
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile to `DEFVAL' where appropriate.

Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the
profile name and profile row status in each of the four profile tables.

Changes to alarm profiles MUST take effect immediately.  Changes to
non-alarm profiles MAY be deferred until the next restart (hard reset
or soft restart) of the units on the line.  Vendors MAY choose to have
the non-alarm profile changes take effect immediately. Alarm profiles
are those profile settings found in the
hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.  Non-alarm profiles are those
profile settings found in the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfTable and
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.

4.6.  Traps

The ability to generate the SNMP traps coldStart/WarmStart (per [21])
which are per agent (e.g., per DSLAM in such a device), and linkUp /
linkDown (per [21]) -- which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2/SHDSL line)
is required.

INTERNET-DRAFT            HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE MIB              October 2000

A linkDown trap may be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC Anomaly,
LOSWS, or UAS event occurs.  At this operational point, a manager can
use hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus for additional detailed information.
The corresponding linkUp trap MAY be sent when all link failure
conditions are cleared.

The traps defined in this MIB are for initialization failure and for
the threshold crossings associated with the following events: ES, SES,
CRC Anomaly, LOSWS, and UAS.  Each threshold has its own
enable/threshold value. When that value is 0, the trap is disabled.

The hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all
outstanding error conditions associated with a particular Segment
Endpoint.  Note that since status of remote endpoints is obtained via
the EOC, this information may be unavailable for units that are
unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.  Therefore, not all
conditions may always be included in its current status.

Two alarm conditions, SNR Margin Alarm and Loop Attenuation Alarm,
are organized in a manner slightly different from that implied in 
the EOC specifications.  In the MIB, these alarm conditions are
tied to the two thresholds hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin and
hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation found in the 
hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.  In the EOC, the alarm
conditions associated with these thresholds are per-unit.  In the
MIB, these alarm conditions are per-endpoint.  For terminal units,
this has no impact.  For repeaters, this implies an implementation
variance where the agent in the terminal unit is responsible for
detecting a threshold crossing.  As the reporting of a repeater
detected alarm condition to the polling terminal unit occurs in 
the same EOC message as the reporting of the current SNR Margin 
and Loop Attenuation values, it is anticipated that this will have
very little impact on agent implementation.

A threshold trap occurs whenever the corresponding current 15-minute
interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the threshold
value. One trap may be sent per interval per interface. Since the
current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 15 minutes, if the
condition persists, the trap may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
For example, to get a trap whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at
most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1. The
agent will generate a trap when the event originally occurs.

Note that the NMS may receive a linkDown trap, as well, if enabled. At
the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current
interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold and the trap will
be sent again.

DESCRIPTION
    "This MIB module defines a collection of objects for
    managing HDSL2/SHDSL lines.  An agent may reside at 
    either end of the line, however the MIB is designed 
    to require no management communication between the 
    modems beyond that inherent in the low-level EOC line 
    protocol as defined in ANSI T1E1.4/2000-006 (for HDSL2 
    lines), or in ITU G.991.2 (for SHDSL lines)."

Hdsl2ShdslPerfCurrDayCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
        "A counter associated with interface performance
        measurements in a current 1-day (24 hour) measurement
        interval.

        The value of this counter starts at zero at the
        beginning of an interval and is increased when
        associated events occur, until the end of the
        1-day interval.  At that time the value of the
        counter is stored in the previous 1-day history
        interval, if available, and the current interval
        counter is restarted at zero.

        In the case where the agent has no valid data available
        for this interval the corresponding object
        instance is not available and upon a retrieval
        request a corresponding error message shall be
        returned to indicate that this instance does
        not exist (for example, a noSuchName error for
        SNMPv1 and a noSuchInstance for SNMPv2 GET
