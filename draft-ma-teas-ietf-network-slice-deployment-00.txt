1.  Introduction

   Network Slicing is considered as an important mechanism to provide
   different services and customers with the required network
   connectivity, resources and performance characteristics over a shared
   network.  [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] describes network
   slicing in the context of networks built from IETF technologies, and
   discusses the general framework of IETF network slices.

   component technologies for providing enhanced VPN services, by
   utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and Traffic
   Engineering (TE) technologies and adds characteristics that specific
   services or customers require above traditional overlay VPNs.  VPN+
   is delivered using a VPN overlay and an underlying Virtual Transport
   Network (VTN) which has a set of dedicated or shared resources and is
   associated with a customized logical network topology in the underlay
   network.  A centralized network controller can be used for the
   creation and operation of the VTNs, and the mapping of the enhanced
   VPN services to the appropriate VTNs.  The enhanced VPN (VPN+)
   mechanism can be used for the realization of IETF network slices.

   Although the concept of network slicing is firstly introduced for the
   5G, the use cases of IETF network slices are not limited to 5G.
   Operators have started the deployment of IETF network slices based on
   VPN+ in their networks for different service scenarios.  This
   document introduces several deployment cases of IETF network slices
   in operator networks.  Some considerations about the IETF network
   slice deployments are also collected.

3.1.  Network Slicing for Multi-Industrial Network

   China Telecom NingXia has deployed a dedicated SRv6 based network to
   carry multiple industrial services.  The three major types of service
   in the network are: Healthcare service, Education service and
   Broadband services, and the operator plans to migrate a set of
   industrial and governmental services from dedicated private networks
   or Multi-Service Transport Platform (MSTP) networks to this IP based
   multi-industrial network.  With the help of network slicing, services
   of different industries can be isolated from each other, so that the
   performance of each service can be guaranteed, and the cost of
   maintaining and expanding the dedicated private networks for each
   industry can be reduced.

   In order to provide the required resource and security isolation
   between the health care, education and broadband services, three
   virtual transport networks (VTNs) are created in the network.  All
   the VTNs share the same IGP instance, while each VTN is defined with
   a logical topology using different link administrative groups (i.e.
   color), and is allocated with a set of dedicated bandwidth resources
   on each involved physical link using the virtual sub-interface
   mechanism.  In a VTN, each link is assigned with a SRv6 End.X SID to
   identify the sub-interface used for packet forwarding.  With more
   industrial and governmental customers migrate to this network, more
   VTNs with dedicated network resources will be created.

   Multiple L3VPNs belonging to the same industry are provisioned in the
   corresponding VTN.  For example, the VTN created for the health care
   services is used to support the VPNs for the connection between
   hospitals belonging to the medical consortium, and the VPNs for
   connecting the hospitals and the insurance systems in the healthcare
   cloud.  The VPN traffic mapped to a VTN is steered into the set of
   virtual sub-interfaces of the VTN based on the corresponding SRv6
   End.X SIDs.

   A centralized network controller is responsible for the management of
   the VTN and the VPNs.  This includes the topology and resource
   planning of VTN, the VTN creation, the mapping of VPN services to the
   VTN, and the computation of SRv6 TE paths based on the service
   constraints and the topology and resource attributes of the VTN.  The
   controller also collects the traffic statistics and performance
   information of the VTNs and the VPN services to enable the network
   slice services visualization and ensure the service SLAs are always
   met.

3.2.  Network Slicing for Fixed-Mobile Convergence

   China Mobile Hong Kong (CMHK) has deployed network slices in their
   SR-MPLS based Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) network, which is used
   to carry the mobile services, the enterprise private line services
   and the residential broadband services together.  Each type of
   service has different traffic characteristics and performance
   requirements, thus independent network planning and operation for
   each service type is required.

   Currently three VTNs are created for mobile service, enterprise
   service and the residential service respectively.  Depends on the new
   service requirement of 5G, More VTNs may be created for 5G critical
   services in the future.  According to the operator's network
   planning, each VTN is allocated with a set of dedicated bandwidth
   resources using either virtual sub-interface or Flexible Ethernet
   (FlexE) interface mechanism.  All the VTNs share the same IGP
   instance, while the links belonging to different VTNs are assigned
   with different link administrative groups (i.e. color).  In a VTN,

   each link is assigned with an SR-MPLS Adj-SID to identify the sub-
   interface or FlexE interface used for packet forwarding.

   Multiple VPNs (EVPN, L3VPN and L2VPN) belonging to the one of the
   three major service types are mapped to the corresponding VTN.  For
   example, the VTN created for the enterprise private line services is
   used to support the VPNs of a group of enterprise customers.  The VPN
   traffic mapped to a VTN is steered into the set of virtual sub-
   interfaces or FlexE interfaces allocated to the VTN based on the
   corresponding SR-MPLS Adj-SIDs.

   A centralized network controller is responsible for the management of
   the VTN and the VPNs.  This includes the topology and resource
   planning of VTN, the VTN creation, the mapping of VPN services to the
   VTN, and the computation of SRv6 TE paths based on the service
   constraints together with the topology and resource attributes of the
   VTN.  The controller also collects the traffic statistics and
   performance information of the VTNs and the VPN services to enable
   the network slice services visualization and ensure the service SLAs
   are always met.

4.  Network Slice Deployment Considerations

   Based on the network slice deployment cases collected in section 2,
   this section describes some of the operators' considerations about
   network slice deployment.

4.1.  Isolation

   Network slicing is introduced to operators' network to meet the
   connectivity and performance requirements of different services or
   customers.  Since many services or customers are migrated from their
   own dedicated networks to network slices, it is expected that
   services or customers carried by a network slice will not be affected
   by any other traffic in the network, thus the resource, policy and
   security isolation from other services becomes a typical requirement.

   Operators have considered the usage of several forwarding plane
   mechanisms, such as FlexE interface or virtual sub-interfaces to
   allocate different set of network resources for the VTNs used for
   different services or customers.  The services or customers which do
   not have specific requirement on resource or security isolation may
   be provisioned as separated VPNs, while these VPNs can be aggregated
   and mapped to a shared VTN with a set of aggregated network
   resources.

4.2.  Topology and Connection Types

   According to the deployment scenarios of network slices, there can be
   different requirements on the topology and connection type of the
   network slices.  When a network slice is provided for a particular
   service type or for a particular industry, the network slice usually
   covers a network scope similar to the scope of the physical network,
   and there are usually a large number of end points attached to the
   network slice, which requires meshed multipoint-to-multipoint
   connectivity between them.  When a network slice is provided for a
   specific private line service customer, the network slice could have
   a customized topology covering a portion of the physical network, and
   usually has a small number of end points attached, in this case the
   network slice may be expressed as a set of point-to-point
   connections.

   The suitable mechanisms to define the topology of the VTN and build
   the connectivity needed by network slice service streams.  For
   example, the administrative groups (i.e. color) can be used by a
   centralized controller to specify the topology of a VTN and compute
   the constraint paths for network slice services in the VTN.  The
   Distributed control plane based mechanism for topology definition and

Internet-Draft        IETF Network Slice Deployment         October 2021


   the constraint path computation may be used for network slices which
   require meshed connectivity between a large number of end points.

4.3.  Scalability

   As shown in several IETF network slice deployments, the number of
   VTNs at the initial stage can be small (e.g. less than 10).  While
   there are also cases in which hundreds of network slices are needed
   for industrial and premium private line customers.  It is expected
   that the number of VTNs required in the future could be at the
   hundreds or even thousands level.  Thus the scalability
   considerations and optimization mechanisms as described in
   [I-D.dong-teas-enhanced-vpn-vtn-scalability] need to be considered to
   allow the deployment of a larger number of network slices in the
   network in future.

4.3.1.  Data Plane Scalability

   The current deployment of network slices are mainly based on SR-MPLS
   or SRv6 data plane, with which each VTN is allocated with a separate
   group of SR SIDs, and the SIDs are associated with a group of
   dedicated network resources
   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments].  This provides a practical
   approach to deliver IETF network slices to meet the requirements in
   the early stage.  While with the number of the required VTNs
   increases, the increasing amount of SR SIDs will bring challenges
   both to the forwarding tables and to the network management and
   operation.  It is expected that the mechanisms with dedicated VTN-ID
   encapsulation as defined in [I-D.dong-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id] could
   help to reduce the number of SR SIDs needed, and simplify the large
   scale network slice provisioning and management.

4.4.  Automation

   The centralized network controller plays an important role in the
   life cycle management of network slices.  With the number of network
   slices increases, it is necessary that the planning, creation,
   monitoring and the optimization of IETF network slices can be
   automated to reduce the burden in the network slice management and
   operation.

   For example, in a network where multiple IETF network slices are
   deployed, when the bandwidth utilization of one VTN reaches a
   specific threshold, there are two possible approaches for the VTN
   capacity expansion.  The first approach is to expand the capacity of
   the physical network, which usually can take a long time.  The second
   approach is to adjust the resource allocation of different VTNs based
   on the utilization ratio.  The network controller can provide the

   monitoring and visualization of the resource utilization of the VTNs
   and VPNs, and gives recommendations about the optimal resource
   adjustment strategy to the network operator.
