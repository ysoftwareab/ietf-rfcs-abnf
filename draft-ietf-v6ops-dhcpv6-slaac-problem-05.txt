   DHCPv6/SLAAC Interaction Problems on Address and DNS Configuration
                draft-ietf-v6ops-dhcpv6-slaac-problem-05

Abstract

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Protocol includes an ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement (RA) message.  The RA message contains three flags,
   indicating the availability of address auto-configuration mechanisms
   and other configuration.  These are the M, O, and A flags.  These
   flags by definition are advisory, not prescriptive.

   This document describes divergent host behaviors observed in popular
   operating systems.  It also discusses operational problems that
   divergent behaviors might cause.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 [RFC2460] hosts invoke Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861]
   procedures in order to discover which auto-configuration mechanisms
   are available to them.  The following is a list of auto-configuration
   mechanisms:

   o  DHCPv6 [RFC3315]

   o  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862]

   ND specifies an ICMPv6 [RFC4443] Router Advertisement (RA) message.
   Routers periodically broadcast the RA message to all on-link nodes.
   They also unicast RA messages in response to solicitations.  The RA
   message contains:

   o  an M (Managed) flag

   o  an O (OtherConfig) flag

   o  zero or more Prefix Information (PI) Options

   The M flag indicates that addresses are available from DHCPv6.  The O
   flag indicates that other configuration information (e.g., DNS-
   related information) is available from DHCPv6.  The PIO (Prefix
   Information Option) includes a prefix, an A (Autonomous) flag and
   other fields.  The A flag indicates that the prefix can be used for
   SLAAC.  The M and O flags are advisory, not prescriptive (although A
   flag is also advisory in definition in standard, it is quite
   prescriptive in implementations).  For example, the M flag indicates
   that addresses are available from DHCPv6.  It does not indicate that
   hosts are required to acquire addresses from DHCPv6.  Similar
   statements can be made about the O flag.

   Because of the advisory definition of the flags, in some cases
   different operating systems appear divergent behaviors.  This
   document analyzes possible divergent host behaviors might happen
   (some of the possible divergent behaviors are already observed in
   popular operating systems) and the operational problems might caused
   by divergent behaviors.

2.  The M, O and A Flags

   This section briefly reviews how the M, O and A flags are defined in
   [RFC4861].

2.1.  Flags Definition

   o  M (Managed) Flag

         As decribed in [RFC4861], "When set, it indicates that
         addresses are available via Dynamic Host Configuration
         Protocol".

   o  O (Otherconfig) Flag



Liu, et al.              Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6/SLAAC Interact Problems            July 2015


         "When set, it indicates that other configuration information is
         available via DHCPv6.  Examples of such information are DNS-
         related information or information on other servers within the
         network."  [RFC4861]

         Besides, [RFC4861]also defines "If neither M nor O flags are
         set, this indicates that no information is available via
         DHCPv6" .

   o  A (Autonomous) Flag

         A flag is defined in the PIO, "When set indicates that this
         prefix can be used for stateless address configuration as
         specified in [RFC4862].".

2.2.  Flags Relationship

   Per [RFC4861], "If the M flag is set, the O flag is redundant and can
   be ignored because DHCPv6 will return all available configuration
   information.".

   M/O flags semantics are independent of A flag's.  The M/O flags
   indicate that addresses or other configuration are available from
   DHCPv6, regardless of the A flag setting.  Vice versa, The A flag
   indicates that the prefix can be used by SLAAC, regardless of the M/O
   flags settings.

3.  Behavior Ambiguity Analysis

   The flags definition ambiguity means, on interpreting the same
   messages, different hosts might behave differently.  Thus it could be
   un-controlled or un-predictable for administrators on some
   operations.  The ambiguity is summarized as the following aspects.

   1) Dependency between DHCPv6 and RA

      In standards, behavior of DHCPv6 and Neighbor Discovery protocols
      is specified respectively.  But it is not clear that whether there
      should be any dependency between them.  More specifically, it is
      unclear whether RA (with M=1) is required to trigger DHCPv6; in
      other words, It is unclear whether hosts should initiate DHCPv6 by
      themselves If there are no RAs at all.

   2) Overlapped configuration between DHCPv6 and RA

      When address and DNS configuration are both available from DHCPv6
      and RA, it is not clear how to deal with the overlapped




Liu, et al.              Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6/SLAAC Interact Problems            July 2015


      information.  Should the hosts accept all the information?  Which
      one should be in the higher priority?

      For DNS configuration, [RFC6106] clearly specifies "In the case
      where the DNS options of RDNSS and DNSSL can be obtained from
      multiple sources, such as RA and DHCP, the IPv6 host SHOULD keep
      some DNS options from all sources" and "the DNS information from
      DHCP takes precedence over that from RA for DNS queries"
      (Section 5.3.1 of [RFC6106]).  But for address configuration,
      there's no such guidance.

   3) Interpretation on Flags Transition

      When flags are in transition, e.g. the host is already SLAAC-
      configured, then M flag changes from FALSE to TRUE, it is not
      clear whether the host should start DHCPv6 or not; or vise versa,
      the host is already both SLAAC/DHCPv6 configured, then M flag
      change from TRUE to FALSE, it is also not clear whether the host
      should turn DHCPv6 off or not.

      Transition might caused by the same source that changes the
      previous configuration; or cause by another source which has
      different configuration.

   4) Relationship between Address Configuring Method and Address
   Lifetime

      When one address configuration method is off, that is, the A flag
      or M flag changes from TRUE to FALSE, it is not clear whether the
      host should immediately release the corresponding address(es) or
      just retain it(them) until expired.

   5) Relationship between the Flags

      The semantics of the flags seems not totally independent, but the
      standards didn't clearly clarify it.  For example, can A flag
      influence the behavior of O flag?  (Specifically, when A and M
      flags are FALSE and O flag is TRUE, it is not clear whether the
      host should initiate a stand-alone stateless DHCPv6 session.)

   Divergent behaviors on all the five aspects have been observed among
   some popular operating systems as described in Section 4 below.

4.  Observed Divergent Host Behaviors

   The authors tested several popular operating systems in order to
   determine what behaviors the M, O and A flag elicit.  In some cases,
   the M, O and A flags elicit divergent behaviors.  The table below

   characterizes those cases.  For test details, please refer to
   Appendix A.

   The divergence contains two aspect: one is regarding to address auto-
   configuration; the other is regarding to DNS configuration.

                             Moreover, the RDNSS from router 1 has
                             higher priority than the one from DHCPv6.

                             obtained from the DHCPv6 server. It retains
                             both. It only gets "Domain Search list"
                             from the DHCPv6 server-no RDNSS

                             also does not lose any information obtained
                             from DHCPv6. When it gets RAs from the
                             first router again, the situation does not
                             change (IPv6 addresses from both the DHCPv6
                             and SLAAC process are retained, but RDNSS
                             information only from the DHCPv6 server).

                 Divergent Behaviors on DNS Configuration

5.  Operational Problems

   This section describes operational issues caused by the divergent
   behaviors, described above.

5.1.  Inappropriate Sources

   Some operating systems base their decision to acquire configuration
   information upon inappropriate sources.  For example, some operating
   systems acquire other configuration information if M=0, O=1, and A=1,
   but not if M=0, O=1 and A=0.  In other words, on some operating
   systems, it is impossible to acquire other information from DHCPv6
   (stateless DHCPv6 configuration) unless addresses are acquired from
   either DHCPv6 or SLAAC.

5.2.  Renumbering Issues

   According to [RFC6879] a renumbering exercise can include the
   following steps:

   o  Causing hosts that have acquired addresses from one auto-
      configuration mechanism to release those addresses and acquire new
      addresses from another auto-configuration mechanism

   o  Causing hosts that have acquired addresses from one auto-
      configuration mechanism to release those addresses and acquire new
      addresses from the same auto-configuration mechanism

   o  Causing hosts that have acquired addresses from one auto-
      configuration mechanism to retain those addresses and acquire new
      addresses from another auto-configuration mechanism

   Ideally, these steps could be initiated by broadcasting RA message
   onto the subnetwork that is being renumbered.  Sadly, this is not
   possible, because the RA message may elicit a different behavior from
   each host.  According to Section 4, renumbering operations would have
   the following limitations:





Liu, et al.              Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6/SLAAC Interact Problems            July 2015


   o  When M flag is turned off, some operating systems release DHCPv6
      acquired addresses immediately, while other will retain then until
      they expire.  This means a flash switch from DHCPv6 to SLAAC would
      happen on some hosts.  Normally, the "make-before-break" approach
      proposed in [RFC4192] is considered better than flash renumbering.

   o  On some operating systems, if a host has acquired addresses from
      SLAAC, it is impossible to acquire additional addresses from
      DHCPv6.  This may be required as part of a renumbering operation.

6.  Security Considerations

   (Note: the security considerations for specific operating systems are
   based on the detailed test results as described in Appendix A.)

   An attacker, without having to install a rogue router, can install a
   rogue DHCPv6 server and provide IPv6 addresses to Windows 8.1
   systems.  This can allow her to interact with these systems in a
   different scope, which, for instance, is not monitored by an IDPS
   system.

   If you want to perform MiTM using a rogue DNS while legitimate RAs
   with the O flag set are sent to enforce the use of a DHCPv6 server,
   you can spoof RAs with the same settings with the legitimate prefix
   (in order to remain undetectable) but advertising YOUR (attacker's)
   DNS using RDNSS.  In this case, Fedora 21, Centos 7 and Ubuntu 14.04
   will use the rogue RDNSS (advertised by the RAs) as a first option.

   Fedora 21 and Centos 7 behaviour cannot be explored for a MiTM attack
   using a rogue DNS information either, since the one obtained by the
   RAs of the first router has a higher priority.

   The behaviour of Fedora 21, Centos 7 and Windows 7 can be exploited
   for DoS purposes.  A rogue IPv6 router not only provides its own
   information to the clients, but it also removes the previous obtained
   (legitimate) information.  The Fedora and Centos behaviour can also
   be exploited for MiTM purposes by advertising rogue RDNSS by RAs
   which include RDNSS information.

Appendix A.  Test Results

   The authors from two orgnizations tested different scenarios
   independent of each other.  The following text decribes the two test
   sets respectively.

A.1.  Test Set 1

A.1.1.  Test Environment

   The test environment was replicated on a single server using VMware.
   For simplicity of operation, only one host was run at a time.
   Network elements were as follows:

   o  Router: Quagga 0.99-19 soft router installed on Ubuntu 11.04
      virtual host

   o  DHCPv6 Server: Dibbler-server installed on Ubuntu 11.04 virtual
      host

   o  Host 1: Window 7 / Window 8.1 Virtual Host

   o  Host 2: Ubuntu 14.04 (Linux Kernel 3.12.0) Virtual Host

   o  Host 3: Mac OS X v10.9 Virtual Host

   o  Host 4: IOS 8.0 (model: Apple iPhone 5S, connected via wifi)

A.1.2.  Address Auto-configuration Behavior in the Initial State

   The bullet list below describes host behavior in the initial state,
   when the host has not yet acquired any auto-configuration
   information.  Each bullet item represents an input and the behavior
   elicited by that input.

   o  A=0, M=0, O=0

      *  Windows 8.1 acquired addresses and other information from
         DHCPv6.

      *  All other hosts acquired no configuration information.

   o  A=0, M=0, O=1

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6/SLAAC Interact Problems            July 2015


      *  Windows 8.1 acquired addresses and other information from
         DHCPv6.

      *  Windows 7, OSX 10.9 and IOS 8.0 acquired other information from
         DHCPv6.

      *  Ubuntu 14.04 acquired no configuration information.

   o  A=0, M=1, O=0

      *  All hosts acquired addresses and other information from DHCPv6.

   o  A=0, M=1, O=1

      *  All hosts acquired addresses and other information from DHCPv6.

   o  A=1, M=0, O=0

      *  Windows 8.1 acquired addresses from SLAAC and DHCPv6.  It also
         acquired non-address information from DHCPv6.

      *  All the other host acquired addresses from SLAAC

   o  A=1, M=0, O=1

      *  Windows 8.1 acquired addresses from SLAAC and DHCPv6.  It also
         acquired other information from DHCPv6.

      *  All the other hosts acquired addresses from SLAAC and other
         information from DHCPv6.

   o  A=1, M=1, O=0

      *  All hosts acquired addresses from SLAAC and DHCPv6.  They also
         acquired other information from DHCPv6.

   o  A=1, M=1, O=1

      *  All hosts acquired addresses from SLAAC and DHCPv6.  They also
         acquired other information from DHCPv6.

   As showed above, four inputs result in divergent behaviors.

A.1.3.  Address Auto-configuration Behavior in State Transitions

   The bullet list below describes behavior elicited during state
   transitions.  The value x can represents both 0 and 1.

   o  Old state (M = x, O = x, A = 1) , New state (M = x, O = x, A = 0)
      (This means a SLAAC-configured host, which is regardless of DHCPv6
      configured or not, receiving A in transition from 1 to 0. )

      *  All the hosts retain SLAAC addresses until they expire

   o  Old state (M = 0, O = x, A = 1), New state (M = 1, O = x, A = 1)
      (This means a SLAAC-only host receiving M in transition from 0 to
      1.)

      *  Windows 7 acquires addresses from DHCPv6, immediately.

      *  Ubuntu 14.04/OSX 10.9/IOS 8.0 acquires addresses from DHCPv6
         only if the SLAAC addresses are allowed to expire

      *  Windows 8.1 was not tested because it always acquire addresses
         from DHCPv6 regardless of the M flag setting.

   o  Old state (M = 1, O = x, A = x), New state (M = 0, O = x, A = x)
      (This means a DHCPv6-configured host receiving M in transition
      from 1 to 0.)

      *  Windows 7 immediately released the DHCPv6 address

      *  Windows 8.1/Ubuntu 14.04/OSX 10.9/IOS 8.0 keep the DHCPv6
         addresses until they expire

   o  Old state (M = 1, O = x, A = 0), New state (M = 1, O = x, A = 1)
      (This means a DHCPv6-only host receiving A in transition from 0 to
      1.)

      *  All host acquire addresses from SLAAC

   o  Old state (M = 0, O = 1, A = x), New state (M = 1, O = 1, A = x)
      (This means a Stateless DHCPv6-configured host [RFC3736], which is
      regardless of SLAAC configured or not, receiving M in transition
      from 0 to 1 with keeping O=1 )

      *  Windows 7 acquires addresses and refreshes other information
         from DHCPv6

      *  Ubuntu 14.04/OSX 10.9/IOS 8.0 does nothing

      *  Windows 8.1 was not tested because it always acquire addresses
         from DHCPv6 regardless of the M flag setting.

   o  Old state (M = 1, O = 1, A = x), New state (M = 0, O = 1, A = x)

      *  Windows 7 released all DHCPv6 addresses and refreshes all
         DHCPv6 other information.

      *  Windows 8.1/Ubuntu 14.04/OSX 10.9/IOS 8.0 does nothing

A.2.  Test Set 2

A.2.1.  Test Environment

   This test was built on real devices.  All the devices are located on
   the same link.

   o  A DHCPv6 Server and specifically, a DHCP ISC Version 4.3.1
      installed in CentOs 6.6.  The DHCPv6 server is configured to
      provide both IPv6 addresses and RDNSS information.

   o  Two routers Cisco 4321 using Cisco IOS Software version 15.5(1)S.

   o  The following OS as clients:

      *  Fedora 21, kernel version 3.18.3-201 x64

      *  Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, kernel version 3.13.0-44-generic (rdnssd
         packet installed)

      *  CentOS 7, kernel version 3.10.0-123.13.2.el7

      *  Mac OS-X 10.10.2 Yosemite 14.0.0 Darwin

      *  Windows 7

      *  Windows 8.1

A.2.2.  Address/DNS Auto-configuration Behavior of Using Only One IPv6
        Router and a DHCPv6 Server

   In these scenarios there is two one router and, unless otherwise
   specified, one DHCPv6 server on the same link.  The behaviour of the
   router and of the DHCPv6 server remain unchanged during the tests.

   Case 1: One Router with the Management Flag not Set and a DHCPv6
   Server

   o  Set up

      *  One IPv6 Router with M=0, A=1, O=0 and an RDNSS is advertised

      *  A DHCPv6 server on the same link advertising IPv6 addresses and
         RDNSS

   o  Results

      *  Fedora 21, MAC OS-X, CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 get an IPv6
         address and an RDNSS from the IPv6 router only.

      *  Windows 7 get an IPv6 address from the router only, but they do
         not get any DNS information, neither from the router nor from
         the DHCPv6 server.  They also do not get IPv6 address from the
         DHCPv6 server.

      *  Windows 8.1 get an IPv6 address from both the IPv6 router and
         the DHCPv6 server, despite the fact that the Management flag
         (M) is not set.  They get RDNSS information from the DHCPv6
         only.

   Case 2: One Router with Conflicting Parameters and a DHCPv6 Server

   o  Set up

      *  One IPv6 Router with M=0, A=1, O=1 and an RDNSS is advertised

      *  A DHCPv6 server on the same link advertising IPv6 addresses and
         RDNSS

   o  Results

      *  Fedora 21, Centos 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 get IPv6 address using
         SLAAC only (no address from the DHCPv6 server).

         +  Fedora 21, Centos 7 get RDNSS from both the RAs and the
            DHCPv6 server.  The RDNSS obtained from the router has a
            higher priority though.

         +  Ubuntu 14.04 gets an RDNSS from the router, and a "domain
            search list" information from the DHCPv6 server - but not
            RDNSS information.

      *  MAC OS-X also gets RDNSS from both, IPv6 address using SLAAC
         (no IPv6 address from the DHCPv6 server) but the RDNSS obtained
         from the DHCPv6 server is first (it has a higher priority).
         However, the other obtained from the RAs is also present.

      *  Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 obtain IPv6 addresses using SLAAC and
         RDNSS from the DHCPv6 server.  They do not get IPv6 address
         from the DHCPv6 server.  Compare the Windows 8.1 behaviour with
         the previous case.

   Case 3: Same as Case 2 but Without a DHCPv6 Server

   o  Set up

      *  One IPv6 Router with M=0, A=1, O=1 and an RDNSS is advertised

      *  no DHCPv6 present

         they do not get RDNSS information.

      *  MAC OS-X, Fedora 21, Centos 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 get an IPv6
         address using SLAAC and RDNSS from the RAs.

   Case 4: All Flags are Set and a DHCPv6 Server is Present

   o  Set up

      *  One IPv6 Router with M=1, A=1, O=1 and an RDNSS is advertised

      *  A DHCPv6 server on the same link advertising IPv6 addresses and
         RDNSS

   o  Results

      *  Fedora 21 and Centos 7:

         +  They get IPv6 address both from SLAAC and DHCPv6 server.

         +  They get RDNSS both from RAs and DHCPv6 server.

         +  The DNS of the RAs has higher priority.

      *  Ubuntu 14.04:

         +  It gets IPv6 address both using SLAAC and from the DHCPv6
            server.

         +  It gets RDNSS from RAs only.

      *  Windows 7:

         +  They get nothing (neither IPv6 address nor RDNSS) from any
            source (RA or DHCPv6).

A.2.3.  Address/DNS Auto-configuration Behavior of Using Two IPv6 Router
        and a DHCPv6 Server

   these scenarios there are two routers on the same link.  At first,
   only one router is present (resembling the "legitimate router)",
   while the second one joins the link after the clients first
   configured by the RAs of the first router.  Our goal is to examine
   the behaviour of the clients during the interchange of the RAs from
   the two different routers.

   Case 7: Router 1 Advertising M=0, O=0 and RDNSS, and then Router 2
   advertising M=1, O=1 while DHCPv6 is Present

   o  Set up

      *  Initially:

         +  One IPv6 router with M=0, O=0, A=1 and RDNSS advertised and
            15 seconds time interval of the RAs

      *  After a while (when clients are configured by the RAs of the
         above router):

         +  Another IPv6 router with M=1, O=1, no advertised prefix
            information, and 30 seconds time interval of the RAs.

         +  A DHCPv6 server on the same link providing IPv6 addresses
            and RDNSS.

   o  Results

      *  MAC OS-X and Ubuntu 14.04:

         +  Initially they get address and RDNSS from the first router.

         +  When they receive RAs from the second router, they never get
            any information (IPv6 address or RDNSS) from the DHCPv6
            server.

      *  Windows 7:

         +  Initially they get address from the first router - no RDNSS.

         +  When they receive RAs from the second router, they never get
            any information (IPv6 address or RDNSS) from the DHCPv6
            server.

      *  Fedora 21 and Centos 7:

         +  Initially they get IPv6 address and RDNSS from the RAs of
            the first router. o

         +  When they receive an RA from router 2, they also get an IPv6
            address and RDNSS from the DHCPv6 server while retaining the
            ones (IPv6 address and RDNSS) obtained from the RAs of the
            first router.  The RDNSS obtained from the first router has
            a higher priority than the one obtained from the DHCPv6
            server (probably because it was received first). o

         +  When they receive again RAs from the first router, they
            lose/forget the information (IPv6 address and RDNSS)
            obtained from the DHCPv6 server.

      *  Windows 8.1:

         +  Initially, they get just an IPv6 address from the first
            router 1 - no RDNSS information (since they do not implement
            RFC 6106).

         +  When they receive RAs from the second router, then they also
            get an IPv6 address from the DHCPv6 server, as well as RDNSS
            from it.  They do not lose the IPv6 address obtained by the
            first router using SLAAC.

         +  When they receive RA from the first router, they retain all
            the obtained so far information (there isn't any change).

   Case 8: (Router 2) Initially M=1, O=1 and DHCPv6, then 2nd Router
   (Router 1) Rogue RAs Using M=0, O=0 and RDNSS Provided

            IPv6 address and RDNSS from the DHCPv6 server while
            retaining the ones obtained from the RAs of the second
            router.  Moreover, the RDNSS from router 1 has higher
            priority than the one from DHCPv6.

      *  Ubuntu 14.04:

         +  At first, it gets information (IPv6 address and RDNSS) from
            the DHCPv6 server.

         +  When it receives RAs from the second router, it also gets
            information from it, but it does not lose the information
            obtained from the DHCPv6 server.  It retains both.  It only
            gets "Domain Search list" from the DHCPv6 server-no RDNSS
            information.

         +  When it receives RAs from the first router, there is no
            change; it retains all the obtained information.

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6/SLAAC Interact Problems            July 2015


      *  Windows 7:

         +  Initially they get IPv6 address and RDNSS from the DHCPv6
            server.

         +  When they get RAs from the second router, they lose this
            information (IPv6 address and RDNSS obtained from the DHCPv6
            server) and they get only SLAAC addresses using the RAs of
            the second router-no RDNSS.

         +  When they receive RAs from the first router again, they get
            RDNSS and IPv6 address from the DHCPv6 server, but they also
            keep the SLAAC addresses.

      *  Windows 8.1:

         +  Initially they get information (IPv6 address and RDNSS) from
            the DHCPv6 server.

         +  When they receive RAs from the second router, they never get
            any information from them.

      *  MAC OS-X:

         +  Initially it gets information (IPv6 address and RDNSS) from
            the DHCPv6 server.

         +  When it gets RAs from the second router, it also gets a
            SLAAC IPv6 address but no RDNSS information from the RAs of
            this router.  It also does not lose any information obtained
            from DHCPv6.

         +  When it gets RAs from the first router again, the situation
            does not change (IPv6 addresses from both the DHCPv6 and
            SLAAC process are retained, but RDNSS information only from
            the DHCPv6 server).
