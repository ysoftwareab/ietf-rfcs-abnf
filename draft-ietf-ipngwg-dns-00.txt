Abstract

   This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain
   Name System to support hosts running IP version 6 (IPv6).  The
   changes include a new resource record type to store an IPv6 address,
   a new domain to support lookups based on an IPv6 address, and updated
   definitions of existing query types that return Internet addresses as
   part of additional section processing.  The extensions are designed
   to be compatible with existing applications and, in particular, DNS
   implementations themselves.

INTERNET-DRAFT           IPv6 DNS Extensions                 March 1995


1.  INTRODUCTION


   Current support for the storage of Internet addresses in the Domain
   Name System (DNS)[1,2] cannot easily be extended to support IPv6
   addresses[3] since applications assume that address queries return
   32-bit IPv4 addresses only.

   To support the storage of IPv6 addresses we define the following
   extensions:

        A new resource record type is defined to map a domain name to an
        IPv6 address.

        A new domain is defined to support lookups based on address.

        Existing queries that perform additional section processing to
        locate IPv4 addresses are redefined to perform additional sec-
        tion processing on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.


   The changes are designed to be compatible with existing software.
   The existing support for IPv4 addresses is retained.



2.  NEW RESOURCE RECORD DEFINITION AND DOMAIN


   A new record type is defined to store a host's IPv6 address.  A host
   that has more than one IPv6 address must have more than one such
   record.



2.1.  AAAA record type


   The AAAA resource record type is a new record specific to the Inter-
   net class that stores a single IPv6 address.

   The value of the type is 28 (decimal).

2.2.  AAAA data format


   An IPv6 address is encoded in the data portion of an AAAA resource
   record in network byte order (high-order byte first).



2.3.  AAAA query


   An AAAA query for a specified domain name in the Internet class
   returns all associated AAAA resource records in the answer section of
   a response.

   A type AAAA query does not perform additional section processing.



2.4.  Textual format of AAAA records


   The textual representation of the data portion of the AAAA resource
   record used in a master database file is the textual representation
   of a IPv6 address as defined in [3].



2.5.  IP6.INT Domain


   A special domain is defined to look up a record given an address. The
   intent of this domain is to provide a way of mapping an IPv6 address
   to a host name, although it may be used for other purposes as well.
   The domain is rooted at IP6.INT.

   An IPv6 address is represented as a name in the IP6.INT domain by a
   sequence of nibbles separated by dots with the suffix ".IP6.INT". The
   sequence of nibbles is encoded in reverse order, i.e. the low-order
   nibble is encoded first, followed by the next low-order nibble and so
   on.  Each nibble is represented by a hexadecimal digit.  For example,
   the inverse lookup domain name corresponding to the address

       4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab

   would be

   b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.4.0.0.0.3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.INT.




3.  MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING QUERY TYPES


   All existing query types that perform type A additional section pro-
   cessing, i.e. name server (NS), mail exchange (MX) and mailbox (MB)
   query types, must be redefined to perform both type A and type AAAA
   additional section processing. These new definitions mean that a name
   server must add any relevant IPv4 addresses and any relevant IPv6
   addresses available locally to the additional section of a response
   when processing any one of the above queries.



4.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS


   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
