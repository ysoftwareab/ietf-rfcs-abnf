Abstract 

   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a 
   consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has 
   been developed and is currently being deployed.  RFC 3471 [RFC3471] 
   has defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has 
   significance between two neighbors".  However, in a network composed

1. Introduction 

   As described in [RFC3945], Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS from 
   supporting only packet (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces 
   and switching to also include support for four new classes of 
   interfaces and switching: Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-
   Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber-
   Switch Capable (FSC).  A functional description of the extensions to

   MPLS signaling needed to support new classes of interfaces and 
   switching is provided in [RFC3471]. 

   This document presents details that are specific to the use of GMPLS 
   with a new generation of Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) equipment.  
   Technologies such as Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplex 
   (ROADM) operate at the wavelength switching level.  As such, the 
   wavelength is important information that is necessary to set up a 
   wavelength LSP successfully.

       Figure 1 Interconnecting ROADMs and PXCs between two domains 

   Consider the architecture described in Figure 1.  This architecture 
   shows two domains A and B.  In domain A, there are two wavelength 
   switches, connected through WDM.  So is the case in domain B. At the 
   interface between domains A and B is a battery of G.709 transponders.  
   These transponders are operated in domain A.  The wavelengths coming 
   from domain B to the G.709 transponders are considered alien 
   wavelengths.  G.709 Transponders can support tunable lasers on both 
   sides and as is seen in the figure, only one node needs to provide 
   the G.709 interfacing capability.  The alien wavelength is a narrow 
   band optical signal provided by a 3rd party node.  This setup 
   simplifies the network design vs. the use of transponders on each of 
   the domain A and domain B sides. 

   It is expected that a network design tool will compute wavelength 
   paths based on a number of optical constraints as well as wavelength 
   availability.  The computation and communication of the results of

   the computation are outside the scope of this draft.  The results of 
   the computation can be used as Explicit Route Object (ERO) for 
   signaling.   

   In the scenario of Figure 1, consider the setting up of a 
   bidirectional LSR from ingress switch 1 to egress switch 4.  A 
   certain wavelength (lambda-i) will be used in domain A up to the 
   G.709 transponder, whose tunable laser in domain A will be tuned to 
   lambda-i.  A Path message will be used for the signaling.  The Path 
   setup will continue downstream to switch 4.  The tunable laser facing 
   downstream at the G.709 transponder need not be tuned immediately.  
   Note that the Path message may contain a Label Set in the Path 
   message to indicate the tuning range of the laser but that's not a 
   requirement.  The nodes in domain B select a different wavelength 
   (lambda-i') for domain B.  The transponder ultimately needs to know 
   the wavelength it should tune to in the direction of the egress 
   switch 4.  The egress will then send back a Resv message toward 
   switch 1.  The Resv message will carry the wavelength information 
   (lambda-i') to the G.709 transponder using the Label object.   

   This label allows the correct tuning of the lasers of the G.709 
   transponders in addition to being able to switch the correct 
   wavelength. 

   While previously, wavelength label information was only required 
   intra-domain, the label contents need to be used inter-domain in this 
   case. 

   In addition, for the intra-domain case, there are more motivations 
   for standardizing the wavelength label including: 

   1. Label Set:  A Label Set object may be used to limit the label 
      choices of a downstream node (section 3.5 of RFC 3471).  This 
      Label Set object needs to carry one of the labels defined in 
      section 3.2 of that same document, i.e. port, wavelength label or 
      waveband label.  In order to be able to generate that wavelength 
      information, it is important to have a common understanding of the 
      wavelength information.  

   2. Not using a standardized label would add undue burden on the 
      operator to enforce policy as each manufacturer may decide on a 
      different representation and therefore each domain may have its 
      own label formats. 

   3. Manual provisioning may lead to misconfiguration if domain-
      specific labels are used.

2. Changes from draft-shiba-ccamp-gmpls-lambda-labels-01 

   o  This draft is an update with a new first author. 

   o  Added co-author 

   o  Added an interoperability scenario that GMPLS should support 

   o  Added a section that describes the assumed network model 

   o  Removed advertising function in this draft as the routing part 
      needs to be thought through more fully 

3. Operator Requirements on Label Identification 

   We list some operator requirements in this section. 

   1. A wavelength label SHOULD be standardized in order to allow 
      interoperability between multiple domains; otherwise appropriate 
      existing labels are identified in support of wavelength 
      availability. 

   2. The ITU-T frequency grid specified in [G.694.1] for Dense WDM 
      (DWDM) and wavelength information in [G.694.2] for Coarse WDM 
      (CWDM) SHOULD be used by LSC LSRs when setting up LSPs. 

   3. Labels SHOULD be stable and not allow for rounding errors  

   4. An operator MAY want to advertise wavelength availability in the 
      network 

   5. Care SHOULD be taken if advertising the wavelength availability in 
      order to reduce impact on the existing OSPF-TE. 

   6. To decrease the probability of operators' error or difficulties, 
      it is RECOMMENDED that advertising using OSPF-TE/ISIS-TE be 
      standardized to simplify management  

   7. Existing labels should be still utilized appropriately even if 
      wavelength availability is advertised. 

4. Assumed network model 

   Figure 1 depicts an all-optically switched network consisting of 
   different vendor's optical network domains. Vendor A's network is a 
   ring topology that consists of ROADM or WXC, and vendor B's network 
   is a mesh topology consisting of PXCs and DWDMs.  In this case, the

   use of standardized wavelength label information is quite 
   significant.  It is an important constraint when conducting CSPF 
   calculation for RSVP-TE signaling.

5. Label Related Formats 

   To deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time 
   domains, several new forms of "label" have been defined in [RFC3471]. 
   This section contains clarifications for the Wavelength label and 
   Label Set definition specific for LSC LSRs. 

5.1. Wavelength Labels 

   In section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471], a Wavelength label is defined to 
   have significance between two neighbors, and the receiver may need to 
   convert the received value into a value that has local significance.

Internet-Draft     Generalized Labels for LSC LSRs         October 2006 
    

   LSC equipment uses multiple wavelengths controlled by a single 
   control channel.  In such case, the label indicates the wavelength to 
   be used for the LSP.  This document proposes to standardize the 
   wavelength label.  As an example of wavelength values, the reader is 
   referred to [G.694.1] which lists the frequencies from the ITU-T DWDM 
   frequency grid.  The same can be done for CWDM technology by using 
   the wavelength defined in [G.694.2]. 

   Since the ITU-T DWDM grid is based on nominal central frequencies, we 
   will indicate the appropriate table, the channel spacing in the grid 
   and a value n that allows the calculation of the frequency.  That 
   value can be positive or negative. 

   The frequency is calculated as such in [G.694.1]: 

   Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz) 

   Where 

      n is an integer (positive, negative or 0) 

      Channel spacing is defined to be 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 THz 

   For the other example of the case of the ITU-T CWDM grid, the spacing 
   between different channels was defined to be 20nm, so we need to pass 
   the wavelength value in nm in this case.  Examples of CWDM 
   wavelengths are 1271, 1291, etc. nm. 

   The tables listed in [G.694.1] and [G.694.2] are not numbered and 
   change with the changing frequency spacing as technology advances, so 
   an index is not appropriate in this case. 

5.1.1. DWDM Wavelength Label 

   For the case of DWDM, the information carried in a Wavelength label 
   is: 

    0                   1                   2                   3
