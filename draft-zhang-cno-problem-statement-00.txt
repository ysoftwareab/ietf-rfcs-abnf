               Problem Statement of Core Network Overlay
                draft-zhang-cno-problem-statement-00.txt

Abstract

   With the convergence of computing, storage and network, especially
   the maturity of data center technology, it becomes a trend that ISP
   would like to deploy the computing and storage resources in the
   network, so that the optimized resource utilization as well as the
   value-added service can be provided.  The data centers deployed in
   the network can provide the runtime environment and resource to
   optimize ICP services with various edge service proxies, such as CDN
   servers and distributed Trackers.  Meanwhile, based on data centers
   ISP can provide all kinds of value-added services in the IP based
   network.  CNO (Core Network Overlay)is an ISP-controlled overlay
   network constructed on top of the core network which is proposed as a
   solution to large-scale data distribution in the Internet.  It can
   provide the transfer service for data distribution and switching in
   the core network for the ICP and its edge service proxies.  Because
   the CNO nodes are trustworthy (controlled by ISP), stable and have a
   simple economic model (without any participation of end users and
   ICPs), various overlay based data distribution methods are easier to
   be applied and standardized with CNO.  This draft presents the
   definition of the conceptions and terms about CNO.

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement of Core Network Overlay  November 2009


1.  Introduction

   Internet video reached 31 percent by the end of 2008 (not including
   the amount of video exchanged through P2P file sharing) and Cisco
   forecasts that the sum of all forms of video will account for close
   to 90 percent of consumer traffic by 2012 [Cisco].  Including video
   application, large-scale data distribution becomes more popular in
   Internet.  Although P2P technique could effectively support large-
   scale file sharing and streaming media distribution applications in
   Internet, it faces with the challenges of improvement in utility
   efficiency of network resources and avoid harm to ISP's benefit.
   Some prior work like P4P [P4P] and AUTO [RFC5693] utilize the network
   information provided by ISPs to select optimal peers and reduce
   cross-domain traffic, but the instability of peer nodes and lack of
   pricing model continues to hinders P2P from becoming a standard
   transfer service to users.  The mechanism which efficiently supports
   large-scale data distribution SHOULD effectively resolve the conflict
   of interest among users, ISP and ICP.  And it should have a
   relatively stable service capacity.

   With the convergence of computing, storage and network, especially
   the maturity of data center technology, it becomes a trend that ISP
   makes use of its computing and storage resources to optimize resource
   utilization and provide value-added service by deploying service
   infrastructure in the network.  We define CNO (Core Network Overlay)
   mainly based on the following observations. (1) End-To-End data
   distribution in Internet traverses edge network where end users
   locate and core network operated by ISPs, while ISPs are only
   concerned with the problem of core network's resource optimization.
   (2) In order to provide users with better service quality and enhance
   their competitiveness, ICP is inclined to deploy service proxies
   (ESP: Edge Service Proxy) (e.g., CDN servers) at the network edge
   adjacent to users. (3) The network layer technology itself (e.g., IP
   Multicast) is difficult to provide data distribution services for the
   whole Internet.

   Based on the above observation, we claim that (1) ISP has an
   incentives to deploy data centers in the network and build runtime
   environment for the ICP's ESP Because ICP has the willingness to
   deploy more ESP based on ISP's resource. (2) The deployment of ESP
   partitions the data distribution in Internet into the core and edge
   network implementation.  Data distribution in the core network is
   carried out among servers and ESPs of each ICP, while data
   distribution in the edge network is realized among ESPs and end users
   of each ICP.  CNO's idea is to establish overlay on top of the core
   network through the combination of ISP's computing and storage
   capacity in the network.  CNO provides ICPs with data switch service
   in the core network as well as optimizes the usage of core network

   resources.  Under the framework of CNO-based transport service, ICP
   only focus on the management of the data content it owns and for the
   ESPs how to enhance service quality to end users at the edge network.


2.  Definitions

   The following terms have special meaning in the definition of Core
   Network Overlay (CNO) problem.

   Core network: network which ISPs invest to construct and manage,
   typically including transit ISP's network and local ISP's network.

   Edge network: network which users invest to construct and manage,
   e.g., enterprise network and campus network.

   Overlay: Overlay refers to the network built above underlay network.

   CNO: overlay network built above the core IP network.

   NSI (Network Service Infrastructure): NSI refers to the network
   service infrastructure which has a certain computing and storage
   capacity.  NSI is usually implemented as ISP's data center and can
   also be embedded in the service plane of routers.

   ESP: An ESP refers to a program which runs above NSI and provides
   data distribution service for edge users.  It's usually deployed by
   ICP.

   OVEN (OVErlay Node): OVEN is a CNO node which runs above NSI.  This
   program not only provides data transfer service above the core
   network for ESP but also implements routing of CNO network as a
   router.


3.  Design Issues

3.1.  Reference Model

   By the deployment of NSI, ISP can build overlay network above the
   core network for content distribution.  Because OVEN is controlled by
   ISP and relatively stable, the problem of unpredictable join and exit
   seldom occurs.  Meanwhile, since the scope of nodes is limited, it's
   convenient to implement routing, forwarding and other mechanisms.
   CNO's consumer is ICP's ESP instead of normal end users, so pricing
   and security issues are easier to settle.

   CNO's reference model is shown in Figure 1.  OVEN provides ESP with

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement of Core Network Overlay  November 2009


   the interface of data transfer service, and also realizes forwarding
   and routing functions of CNO.  Multiple ESPs can host in one NSI and
   OVEN can provide different ESPs with diverse transfer services.  For
   instance, ESP1 and ESP2 hosting on A is respectively service program
   for CDN and live video service program.  OVEN1 offers ESP1 non real-
   time data transfer and offers ESP2 real-time data transfer.  Because
   of the differences among transfer service, CNO charges diverse prices
   for ICPs, and chooses distinct overlay transfer mechanisms according
   to the transfer's demand.  Based on the satisfaction of ESP's needs,
   CNO optimizes the resources utility of the core network.

3.2.  CNO's Impact on Each Party

3.2.1.  Impact on ISP

   ISP needs to invest in the construction of NSI in the network and
   deploy OVEN above it.  The benefits ISP obtains mainly include three
   aspects.  First, ISP sells its resources to ESP for supporting ICP's
   operation.  Second, ISP charges ICP for value-added services provided
   by CNO.  Third, resource optimization of the core network is achieved
   by OVEN independently without the influence of end users and ICPs.

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement of Core Network Overlay  November 2009


3.2.2.  Impact on ICP

   ICP purchases NSI's computing and storage resources from ISP and pays
   for the data transfer service.  The benefits they obtain include two
   aspects.  The first is to reduce infrastructure investment and
   operation costs.  For instance, CDN providers simply need purchase
   resources of NSI instead of deploying servers globally.  This makes
   ICP more focus on the management of content itself.  The second is
   for ICP to quickly deploy ESP in close proximity to the end users.
   ESP can provide users with better quality services and enhance ICP's
   competitiveness.

3.2.3.  Impact on End-User

   CNO is transparent to end users.  As the ESP is deployed by ICP close
   to users, users will get better service.

3.3.  Scope of Work

   We recommend that the study includes the establishment of CNO
   network, routing and traffic engineering.  Currently, various data
   distribution methods based on overlay can be standardized under the
   framework of CNO.  The communication protocol among ESPs and how to
   provide services for end users is not within the scope of our
   discussion.

3.4.  Influences on Internet Evolution

   To some extent, CNO is a intermediate state of Internet evolution.
   The development and deployment of network-layer technology among
   NSIs, e.g. multicast, QoS guarantee, multipath and traffic
   engineering, is an ultimate means to solve the problem of large-scale
   data distribution.  Besides, the evolution process that data
   dissemination transforms from CNO to network-layer-based technology
   is transparent to ESPs and end users.


4.  Problems

4.1.  Interest Relationship among ISPs

   Although the deployment of CNO isolates the interests between users
   and ICPs, but how to balance interest relationship among ISPs needs
   further study.







Zhang, et al.             Expires May 14, 2010                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement of Core Network Overlay  November 2009


4.2.  Relationship with End-to-End

   The relationship between CNO and end-to-end design philosophy
   requires further study [End-to-End].


5.  Related Researches

5.1.  Tussle

   We propose CNO to resolve tussle among various parties of Internet,
   and address the problem that the diverse mechanisms which the
   interests of different Internet players conflict with each other.
   Moreover, CNO is also in pursuit of the traditional objectives, such
   as the enhancement of reliability and optimization of network load.
   We follow the design principle [Tussle] of how to deal with tussle.
   First of all, the modular design is needed to the borders.  CNO is
   introduced to separate user's application type from data distribution
   mechanism and QoS guarantee provided by CNO.  In addition, CNO
   support various parties to express their wishes via choice.  Users
   can choose whether to utilize ESP to improve user experience.  ICP
   may choose whether to make use of the resource provided by NSI to
   improve the quality of service.  ISP can also choose whether to
   deploy NSI.  Likewise, there is tussle issue of service pricing in
   CNO.

5.2.  ISP Post Offices

   Each domain reaches the peak of network load at different time.  By
   the deployment of storage Post Office ISP can time-shift traffic
   [Hotnets08].  That is to move DT traffic from peak to non-peak time
   in order to reduce core network!_s bottleneck load.  NSI can also
   adopt this mechanism to alleviate the tension of bandwidth.

5.3.  JUNOS

   Considering how to deploy services in IP network, James Kelly
   [PRESTO'09.JUNOS] pointed out that JUNOS SDK tools can be utilized to
   provide third-party software with programmable interface of packet
   processing.  In addition, it also supports the integration of multi-
   party components to form a common service platform, thus services
   plane can be deployed in Juniper routers.  From this paper, it can be
   concluded that network equipment vendors have begun to consider
   create service function of router in which our proposed ESP of CNO
   can hosts.

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement of Core Network Overlay  November 2009


5.4.  Programmable Overlay Router

   Bruce [PRESTO'09.POR] proposed to establish overlay with the support
   of programmable router provided by ISP.  Through this overlay, ISP
   can make better use of network topology and status information to
   control network resources.  Authors believe that ISP can provide
   diverse service by means of overlay that is a great power to drive
   ISP deploy overlay.  The paper names this overlay service-routing
   layer and recommend the built-in function directly support the
   application development.  In our CNO, services provided by service-
   routing layer can be implemented in OVEN as a common function which
   can be called by ESP.  This can optimize each CP's service quality
   and improve network status.

5.5.  Data Center

   Traditional data center is server clusters deployed by ICP to support
   data access requests from a large number of users.  Our proposed NSI
   is established by ISP in the network to serve each ICP, and actually
   indirectly serve users under the schedule of ESP.  In addition to
   traditional data storage capabilities, NSI also needs to provide
   other functions like peer selection.  In respect to cost, data center
   located at the edge network needs to control its scale.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security issues brought by CNO is what we need take into
   consideration.
