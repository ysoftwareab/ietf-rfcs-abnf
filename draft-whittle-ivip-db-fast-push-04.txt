                    Ivip Mapping Database Fast Push
                 draft-whittle-ivip-db-fast-push-04.txt

Abstract

   draft-whittle-ivip-db-fast-push-03 was relevant to Ivip before the
   introduction (2010-02-26) of Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM).
   While these techniques might be of interest for other purposes, they
   are no longer part of Ivip.  This -04 version is simply a notice to
   this effect.  Please see draft-whittle-ivip-drtm.

1.  Introduction

   As noted in the Abstract, this -04 version is a notice that the
   system described in -03 and earlier versions of this ID are no longer
   part of Ivip.

   The use or RUAS organisations and a single global inverted tree of
   Replicators - driving query servers in ISP and other networks which
   store the full database of mapping for all micronets - is replaced by
   a more distribued DTRM system.
