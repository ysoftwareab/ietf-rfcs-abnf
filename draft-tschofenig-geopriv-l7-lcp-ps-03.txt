Abstract

   This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and
   captures discussions for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration
   Protocol (LCP).  This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain
   location information, by value or by reference, from a Location
   Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network.  The
   obtained location information can then be used for a variety of
   different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be used as
   input to the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) or to
   convey location within SIP to other entities.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and
   captures discussions for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration
   Protocol (LCP).  The protocol has two purposes:

   o  It is used to obtain location information from a special node,
      called the Location Information Server (LIS).

   o  It enables the end host to obtain a reference to location
      information.  This reference can take the form of a subscription
      URI, such as a SIP presence URI, an HTTP/HTTPS URI, or any others.

   The need for these two functions can be derived from the scenarios
   presented in Section 3.

   This document splits the problem space into separate parts and
   discusses them in separate subsections.  Section 4 discusses the
   challenge of discovering the Location Information Server in the
   access network.  Section 5 compares different types of identifiers
   that can be used to retrieve location information.  The concept of
   subscription URIs is described in Section 7.  Digitally signing
   location information and the perceived benefits are covered in
   Section 8.  A list of requirements for the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location
   Configuration Protocol can be found in Section 9.  This work is
   heavily influenced by security considerations.  Hence, almost all
   sections address security concerns.  A list of desired security
   properties can be found in Section 10 together with a discussion
   about possible threat models.

   This document does not describe how the access network provider
   determines the location of the end host.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1],
   with the qualification that unless otherwise stated these words apply
   to the design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol.

   We also use terminology from [2] and [3].

3.  Scenarios

   The following network types are within scope:

   o  DSL/Cable networks, WiMax-like fixed access

   o  Airport, City, Campus Wireless Networks, such as 802.11a/b/g,
      802.16e/Wimax

   o  3G networks

   o  Enterprise networks

   We illustrate a few examples below.

3.1.  Fixed Wired Environment

   The following figure shows a DSL network scenario with the Access
   Network Provider and the customer premises.  The Access Network
   Provider operates link and network layer devices (represented as
   Node) and the Location Information Server (LIS).

                          Figure 1: DSL Scenario

   The customer premises consists of a router with a Network Address
   Translator with Port Address Translation (NAPT) and a DHCP server as
   used in most Customer Premises Networks (CPN) and the Network
   Termination Equipment (NTE) where Layer 1 and sometimes Layer 2
   protocols are terminated.  The router in the home network (e.g.,
   broadband router, cable or DSL router) typically runs a NAPT and a
   DHCP server.  The NTE is a legacy device and in many cases cannot be
   modified for the purpose of delivering location information to the

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   end host.  The same is true of the device with the NAPT and DHCP
   server.

   It is possible for the NTE and the home router to physically be in
   the same box, or for there to be no home router, or for the NTE and
   end host to be in the same physical box (with no home router).  An
   example of this last case is where Ethernet service is delivered to
   customers' homes, and the Ethernet NIC in their PC serves as the NTE.

   Current Customer Premises Network (CPN) deployments frequently show
   the following characteristics:

   1.  CPE = Single PC

       1.  with Ethernet NIC [PPPoE or DHCP on PC]; there may be a
           bridged DSL or cable modem as NTE, or the Ethernet NIC might
           be the NTE

       2.  with USB DSL or cable modem [PPPoA, PPPoE, or DHCP on PC]

       Note that the device with NAPT and DHCP of Figure 1 is not
       present in such a scenario.

   2.  One or more hosts with at least one router [DHCP Client or PPPoE,
       DHCP server in router; VoIP can be soft client on PC, stand-alone
       VoIP device, or Analog Terminal Adaptor (ATA) function embedded
       in router]

       1.  combined router and NTE

       2.  separate router with NTE in bridged mode

       3.  separate router with NTE [NTE/router does PPPoE or DHCP to
           WAN, router provides DHCP server for hosts in LAN; double NAT

   The majority of fixed access broadband customers use a router.  The
   placement of the VoIP client is mentioned to describe what sorts of
   hosts may need to be able to request location information.  Soft
   clients on PCs are frequently not launched until long after bootstrap
   is complete, and are not able to control any options that may be
   specified during bootstrap.  They also cannot control whether a VPN
   client is operating on the PC.

3.2.  Moving Network

   An example of a moving network is a "WIMAX-like fixed wireless"
   scenario that is offered in several cities, like New Orleans, Biloxi,
   etc., where much of the communications infrastructure was destroyed



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   due to a natural disaster.  The customer-side antenna for this
   service is rather small (about the size of a mass market paperback
   book) and can be run off battery power.  The output of this little
   antenna is a RJ-45 Ethernet jack.  A laptop can be plugged into this
   Ethernet jack.  The user would then run a PPPoE client to connect to
   the network.  Once the network connection is established, the user
   can run a SIP client on the laptop.

   The network-side antenna is, for example, connected through ATM to
   the core network, and from there to the same BRASs that serve regular
   DSL customers.  These Broadband Remote Access Servers (BRASs)
   terminate the PPPoE sessions, just like they do for regular DSL.

   The laptop and SIP client are, in this case, unaware that they are
   "mobile".  All they see is an Ethernet connection, and the IP address
   they get from PPPoE does not change over the coverage area.  Only the
   user and the network are aware of the laptop's mobility.

   Further examples of moving networks can be found in busses, trains,
   airplanes.

   Figure 2 shows an example topology for a moving network.

4.  Discovery of the Location Information Server

   When an end host wants to retrieve location information from the LIS
   it first needs to discover it.  Based on the problem statement of
   determining the location of the end host, which is known best by
   entities close to the end host itself, we assume that the LIS is
   located in the access network.  Several procedures have been
   investigated that aim to discovery the LIS in such an access network.

   DHCP-based Discovery:

      In some environments the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol might
      be a good choice for discovering the FQDN or the IP address of the
      LIS.  In environments where DHCP can be used it is also possible
      to use the already defined location extensions.  In environments
      with legacy devices, such as the one shown in Section 3.1, a DHCP
      based discovery solution is not possible.


   DNS-based Discovery:

      With this idea the end host obtains its public IP address (e.g.,
      via STUN [4]) in order to obtain its domain name (via the usual
      reverse DNS lookup).  Then, the SRV or NAPTR record for that
      domain is retrieved.  This relies on the user's public IP address
      having a DNS entry.


   Redirect Rule:

      A redirect rule at a device in the access network, for example at
      the AAA client, will be used to redirect the Geopriv-L7 signalling
      messages (destined to a specific port) to the LIS.  The end host
      could then discover the LIS by sending a packet to almost any
      address (as long it is not in the local network).  The packet
      would be redirected to the respective LIS being configured.  The
      same procedure is used by captive portals whereby any HTTP traffic
      is intercepted and redirected.


   Multicast Query:

      An end node could also discover a LIS by sending a multicast
      request to a well-known address.  An example of such a mechanism
      is multicast DNS (see [5] and [6]).

   The LIS discovery procedure raises deployment and security issues.
   When an end host discovers a LIS,

   1.  it does not talk to a man-in-the-middle adversary, and

   2.  it needs to ensure that the discovered entity is indeed an
       authorized LIS.

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


5.  Identifier for Location Determination

   The LIS returns location information to the end host when it receives
   a request.  Some form of identifier is therefore needed to allow the
   LIS to determine the current location of the target or a good
   approximation of it.

   The chosen identifier needs to have the following properties:

   Ability for end host to learn or know the identifier:

      The end host MUST know or MUST be able to learn the identifier
      (explicitly or implicitly) in order to send it to the LIS.
      Implicitly refers to the situation where a device along the path
      between the end host and the LIS modifies the identifier, as it is
      done by a NAT when an IP address based identifier is used.


   Ability to use the identifier for location determination:

      The LIS MUST be able to use the identifier (directly or
      indirectly) for location determination.  Indirectly refers to the
      case where the LIS uses other identifiers locally within the
      access network, in addition to the one provided by the end host,
      for location determination.


   Security properties of the identifier:

      Misuse needs to be minimized whereby off-path adversary MUST NOT
      be able to obtain location information of other hosts.  A on-path
      adversary in the same subnet SHOULD NOT be able to spoof the
      identifier of another host in the same subnet.

   The problem is further complicated by the requirement that the end
   host should not be aware of the network topology and the LIS must be
   placed in such a way that it can determine location information with
   the available information.  As shown in Figure 1 the host behind the
   NTE/NAPT-DHCP device is not visible to the access network and the LIS
   itself.  In the DSL network environment some identifier used at the
   NTE is observable for by the LIS/access network.

   The following list discusses frequently mentioned identifiers and
   their properties:

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   Host MAC address:

      The host MAC address is known to the end system, but not carried
      over an IP hop.


   ATM VCI/VPI:

      The VPI/VCI is generally only seen by the DSL modem.  Almost all
      routers in the US use 1 of 2 VPI/VCI value pairs:  0/35 and 8/35.
      This VC is terminated at the DSLAM, which uses a different VPI/VCI
      (per end customer) to connect to the ATM switch.  Only the network
      provider is able to map VPI/VCI values through its network.  With
      the arrival of VDSL, ATM will slowly be phased out in favor of
      Ethernet.


   Switch/Port Number:

      This identifier is available only in certain networks, such as
      enterprise networks, typically available via proprietary protocols
      like CDP or, in the future, 802.1ab.


   Cell ID:

      This identifier is available in cellular data networks and the
      cell ID might not be visible to the end host.


   Authenticated User Identity:

      In DSL networks the user credentials are, in many cases, only
      known by the router and not to the end host.  To the network, the
      authenticated user identity is only available if a network access
      authentication procedure is executed.  In case of roaming it still
      might not be available to the access network since security
      protocols might provide user identity confidentiality and thereby
      hide the real identity of the user allowing the access network to
      only see a pseudonym or a randomized string.


   Host Identifier:

      The Host Identifier introduced by the Host Identity Protocol [7]
      allows identification of a particular host.  Unfortunately, the
      network can only use this identifier for location determination if
      the operator already stores an mapping of host identities to

      location information.  Furthermore, there is a deployment problem
      since the host identities are not used in todays networks.


   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA):

      The concept of a Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) was
      introduced by [8].  The basic idea is to put the truncated hash of
      a public key into the interface identifier part of an IPv6
      address.  In addition to the properties of an IP address it allows
      a proof of ownership.  Hence, a return routability check can be
      omitted.


   Network Access Identifiers:

      A Network Access Identifier [9] is only used during the network
      access authentication procedure in RADIUS [10] or Diameter [11].
      Furthermore, in a roaming scenario it does not help the access
      network to make meaningful decisions since the username part might
      be a pseudonym and there is no relationship to the end host's
      location.


   Unique Client Identifier

      The DSL Forum has defined that all devices that expect to be
      managed by the TR-069 interface be able to generate an identifier
      as described in DSL Forum TR-069v2 Section 3.4.4.  It also has a
      requirement that routers that use DHCP to the WAN use RFC 4361
      [12] to provide the DHCP server with a unique client identifier.
      This identifier is, however, not visible to the end host with the
      assumption of a legacy device like the NTE.  If we assume that the
      LTE can be modified then a number of solutions come to mind
      including DHCP based location delivery.


   IP Address:

      The end host's IP address may be used for location determination.
      This IP address is not visible to the LIS if the end host is
      behind one or multipel NATs.  This is, however, not a problem
      since the location of a host that is located behind a NAT cannot
      be determined by the access network.  The LIS would in this case
      only see the public IP address of the NAT binding allocated by the
      NAT, which is the correct behavior.  The property of the IP
      address for a return routability check is attractive as well to
      return location information only to a device that transmitted the

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


      request.  The LIS receives the request and provides location
      information back to the same IP address.  If an adversary wants to
      learn location information from an IP address other than its own
      IP address then it would not see the response message (unless he
      is on the subnetwork or at a router along the path towards the
      LIS) since the LIS would return the message to the address where
      it came from.

      On a shared medium an adversary could ask for location information
      of another host using its IP address.  The adversary would be able
      to see the response message since he is sniffing on the shared
      medium unless security mechanisms (such as link layer encryption)
      is in place.  With a network deployment as shown in Section 3.1
      with multiple hosts in the Customer Premise being behind a NAT the
      LIS is unable to differentiate the individual end points.  For
      WLAN deployments as found in hotels, as shown in as shown in
      Section 3.3, it is possible for an adversary to eavesdrop data
      traffic and subsequently to spoof the IP address in a query to the
      LIS to learn more detailed location information (e.g., specific
      room numbers).  Such an attack might, for example, compromise the
      privacy of hotel guests.  Note that DHCP would suffer from the
      same problem here unless each node uses link layer security
      mechanism.

      Return routability checks are useful only if the adversary does
      not see the response message and if the goal is to delay state
      establishment.  If the adversary is in a broadcast network then a
      return routability check alone is not sufficient to prevent the
      above attack since the adversary will observe the response.

6.  Virtual Private Network (VPN) Considerations

   To establish a VPN, a VPN client uses a particular VPN protocol to
   create a tunnel to a VPN server.  VPNs can be established using a
   variety of protocols (e.g., IPsec, L2TP).  The protocol used to
   establish the VPN does not impact LIS discovery or location
   acquisition.

   VPN characteristics that can impact LIS discovery or acquiring a
   location from a LIS include the relationship of the VPN client to the
   communications application (e.g., VoIP phone), and whether the VPN
   server requires the device with the VPN client to send all outbound
   IP traffic across the VPN.

6.1.  VPN Tunneled Internet Traffic

   Any form of LIS discovery that would work without the VPN being
   established, will also be able to work after the VPN has been
   established.  The DNS method of LIS discovery requires a device to
   discover the proper IP address for discovering and querying the LIS.
   Some devices may be expected to operate in a number of different
   networks, including corporate networks, hotspots, home networks, and
   protected networks by way of a VPN.  The appropriate IP address to
   use for LIS discovery may vary depending on the network.

   It may be useful for such devices to do a reverse DNS lookup, LIS
   discovery request, and LIS query for all IP addresses they can
   determine for themselves.  When all LISs involved in these queries
   are properly configured, only one of these queries should be expected
   to succeed.  LISs should not be configured to provide a location for
   an IP address that may be used by many geographically dispersed
   users, or when the LIS has no way to determine the geographic
   location of the device using the IP address.

   This form of VPN will not interfere with queries to the LIS, once the
   LIS has been discovered.  It will also not interfere with location
   dereferencing.

6.2.  VPN Client and End Point Physically Co-Located

   If LIS discovery and queries are done prior to establishing the VPN,
   then the VPN will not interfere.  For this reason, it is highly
   desirable for devices that may support communications applications to
   do location acquisition shortly after initial bootstrap, and prior to
   establishing any VPN.  As the communication application may not be
   running prior to establishing the VPN, it is best if the
   communication application is not responsible for location
   acquisition.



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   Once a VPN has been established, the device should not permit
   location acquisition to be attempted.  Location acquisition done
   after a VPN is established will either fail, or provide the wrong
   location.

   If the device does allow attempts at location acquisition after
   establishing the VPN, these attempts should fail.  LIS discovery
   through DHCP, Redirect, and Multicast methods would fail due to lack
   of support by the VPN server (it is undesirable for a VPN server to
   support LIS discovery).  For DNS discovery, the device might know a
   variety of IP addresses, such as the IP address obtained at bootstrap
   (which may be public or private, depending on whether the device is
   behind a NAT), the VPN IP address, and an IP address the VPN provider
   uses for Internet traffic through its firewall.  RDNS of private LAN
   addresses will fail.  Success for RDNS of the VPN address would
   depend on whether there are entries in the VPN provider's DNS server.
   If RDNS of the VPN IP address succeeds, and the VPN provider has a
   LIS in their network, LIS discovery of the VPN network's LIS should
   succeed.  It is desirable for a LIS that may get queries from devices
   entering the network through a VPN, to provide an error response to
   location queries that use such IP addresses.  The LIS should not be
   configured to return a location for these IP addresses.

   RDNS of public IP addresses should generally succeed (assuming the
   VPN provider's DNS allows for these queries to succeed).  For IP
   addresses used to connect the VPN network to the Internet, the
   returned domain of RDNS would be the owner of that IP address, which
   is either the VPN provider or its ISP.  If the domain is that of the
   VPN provider, the VPN provider may or may not have a DNS LIS entry
   associated with that domain.  If there is a LIS, that LIS should not
   be configured to return a location for its public IP addresses.  If
   an ISP owns the domain of the VPN's public IP address, the device
   will discover the ISP's LIS, and that LIS will return the location
   where traffic from that IP address enters the access network.  If the
   device knows its public IP address, and RDNS and LIS discovery
   succeeded, the LIS would not provide location information (assuming
   the LIS would not be able to authenticate the device through means
   other than return routability).  The message that reached the LIS
   would not be using (in the IP Header) an IP address from its domain.

   If the private network allows traffic to go to the Internet,
   dereferencing of a location reference will work.

6.3.  VPN Client and End Point Physically Separated

   In this case, it is possible for the device with the VPN client to
   participate in the location acquisition process, and to provide
   location to end devices.  If the VPN client device does participate,



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   then it must acquire location information before setting up its VPN.

   If the VPN client device that participates in location acquisition is
   also the DHCP server for the LAN, then it would be able to either
   provide its location by DHCP, or provide itself as the LIS by DHCP.
   If this device names itself as the DNS server for devices in the LAN,
   then it could support RDNS for LAN addresses and provide itself as
   the LIS.  If it says it is the LIS, then it must be able to respond
   to LIS queries for location acquisition.  This device would also be
   able to support Redirect or Multicast methods of LIS determination.

   If the VPN client device does not participate in location
   acquisition, then location acquisition will either fail or provide
   the wrong location, with the same results as described in section X.2
   for a device that attempts location acquisition after establishing a
   VPN.

   If the private network allows traffic to go to the Internet,
   dereferencing of a location reference will work.

7.  Location-by-Reference and Location Subscriptions

   In mobile wireless networks it is not efficient for the end host to
   periodically query the LIS for up-to-date location information.
   Furthermore, the end host might want to delegate the task of
   retrieving and publishing location information to a third party, such
   as a presence server.  Finally, in some deployments the network
   operator might not want to make location information available to the
   end hosts.

   These usage scenarios motivated the introduction of the location-by-
   reference concept.  Depending on the type of reference, such as HTTP/
   HTTPS or SIP presence URI, different operations can be performed.
   While an HTTP/HTTPS URI can be resolved to location information, a
   SIP presence URI provides further benefits from the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY
   concept that can additionally be combined with location filters [13].

   Figure 4 shows the assumed communication model:


     +--------+ Dereferencing +-----------+
     |        | Protocol (3)  |           |
     |  LIS   +---------------+ Location  |

     +---+----+               |           |
         |                    +----+------+

    | Target / +--
    | End Host |
    +----------+

                       Figure 4: Communication Model

   Note that there is no requirement for using the same protocol in (1)
   and (3).

   The following list describes the location subscription idea:

   1.  The end host discovers the LIS.





Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   2.  The end host sends a request to the LIS asking for a location-by-
       reference, as shown in (1) of Figure 4.

   3.  The LIS responds to the request and includes a location object
       together with a subscription URI.

   4.  The Target puts the subscription URI into a SIP message as
       described in [14] forwards it to a Location Recipient, as shown
       in (2) of Figure 4.  The Location Recipient subscribes to the
       obtained subscription URI (see (3) of Figure 4) and potentially
       uses a location filter (see [13]) to limit the notification rate.

   5.  If the Target moves outside a certain area, indicated by the
       location filter, then the Location Recipient will receive a
       notification.

   Note that the Target may also act in the role of the Location
   Recipient whereby it would subscribe to its own location information.
   For example, the Target obtains a subscription URI from the
   Geopriv-L7 protocol.  It subscribes to the URI in order to obtain its
   currently location information, which then serves as input to a LoST
   query (see [15]) in order to acquire the service boundary (e.g., PSAP
   boundary).  The service boundary indicates the region where the
   device can move without the need to re-query since the returned
   answer remains unchanged.  The Target uses this service boundary to
   location filters an updates the subscription.  If the Target moves
   outside a certain area, indicated by the location filter, it will
   receive a notification and knows that re-querying LoST to obtain a
   new service boundary is necessary.

   For location-by-reference, the LIS needs to maintain a list of
   randomized URIs for each host, timing out these URIs after the
   reference expires.  References need to expire to prevent the
   recipient of such a URL from being able to (in some cases)
   permanently track a host.  Furthermore, this mechanism also offers
   garbage collection capability for the LIS.

   Location references must prevent adversaries from obtaining the
   Target's location.  There are at least two approaches:  The location
   reference contains a random component and allows any holder of the
   reference to obtain location information.  Alternatively, the
   reference can be public and the LIS performs access control via a
   separate authentication mechanism, such as HTTP digest or TLS client
   side authentication, when resolving the reference to a location
   object.

8.  Preventing Faked Location based DoS Attacks

   This section describes a possible security threat in emergency
   related location conveyance and subsequently discusses
   countermeasures to overcome the threat.

8.1.  Security Threat

   Consider an end host that wants to act maliciously and creates its
   own location object with faked location information and uses this
   information in a subsequent SIP communication.  In case of an
   emergency call the other communication partner, the Public Safety
   Answering Point (PSAP) operator, would use the information
   potentially without having a further possibility to verify the
   received location information.  Emergency personnel would be sent to
   the indicated location noticing that there is no incident.

   Hence, the PSAP operator, and the Location Recipient in general,
   would like to ensure that the provided location information is
   genuine, accurate and fresh to avoid taking wrong actions, such as
   dispatching emergency personnel to a wrong location.

   There seems to be a need for preventing location forgery, replay and
   substitution attacks, which are all forms of sending a location which
   is deliberately not that of the end host.  As shown below, various
   forms of countermeasures are possible to mitigate these attacks.
   Although some aspects are within the scope of the Geopriv-L7 Location
   Configuration Protocol (LCP), which is between a LIS and an Target,
   some aspects refer to other protocols, as shown in Figure 4.  For
   example, in an emergency call, the PSAP (as a Location Recipient)
   wishes to verify that the location is indeed that of the calling
   party.  Further, the Geopriv-L7 LCP is not the only protocol that
   could be used by an end host to acquire its location.  Therefore, the
   topic of signatures on the location information was deemed out of
   scope.  The subsequent discussion about countermeaures aims to
   capture the state of the discussions and illustrates the complexity
   in the overall design.

8.2.  Discussion about Countermeasures

   The goal of the above-described mechanism is to prevent prank calls
   and, in case of emergency services, unnecessary first-responder
   dispatch.  As such, it is a mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
   denial of service attacks.  The benefit of a digital signature
   created by the LIS and covering the location information (plus some
   other fields) is to treat a missing or invalid signature as suspect
   during the call.  The call would be treated differently in the sense
   that more questions might be asked (if an interaction with a human



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   person is possible).  In case of emergency services, the call might
   get ranked differently if certain criteria are not fulfilled and if
   the PSAP operator is confronted with a massive amount of calls
   without the possiblity to respond to all of them.

8.2.1.  Signed Location Information

   One of the proposed countermeasures is to sign location information
   by the LIS before it is sent to the end host whereby the signed
   location information is verified by the final Location Recipient
   rather than the Target.  This prevents the Target from tampering with
   the received location information since the digital signature would
   become invalid.  The Location Recipient would be able to verify the
   source of the location information.  Since the number of nodes that
   may play the role of a Location Recipient is large it is difficult to
   utilize a pre-shared secret key based infrastructure.  Hence, a
   public key based infrastructure is required but authorization still
   remains challenging.

   This solution approach is challenging when a PIDF-LO [16] has to be
   signed (instead of location information only) since the PIDF-LO
   contains more than just location information, such as "entity"
   attribute of the 'presence' element, and usage-rules (e.g.,
   'retransmission-allowed', 'retention-expires', 'ruleset-reference',
   'note-well').

   The value for the "entity" attribute of the 'presence' element is, in
   many cases, not known to the L2/L3 provider.  If the LIS signs some
   layer-2/layer-3 (e.g., PPP/RADIUS/NAI) identity as entity URI, it
   will unlikely be the SIP URI.

   To prevent adversaries from reusing an eavesdropped signed location
   object it is necessary to include additional information when
   generating the digital signature.  For example, a timestamp and a
   validity field are useful to prevent certain replay attacks.
   Furthermore, the "entity" attribute may be included in the digital
   signature of a PIDF-LO with the following semantic:  When using the
   signed location object (e.g., in SIP or another higher layer
   protocol), the Target needs to authenticate to the Location Recipient
   using the same identity carried in the "entity" attribute of the
   'presence' element of the signed PIDF-LO.  Using SIP, for example, a
   SIP proxy server could assert the entity URI corresponding to the
   Target using the SIP identity mechanism.

   Including the layer 7 identity into the "entity" attribute of the
   'presence' element poses a privacy problem since the access network
   provider can now see an identity that is in use.  Hence, the LIS and
   possibly unauthorized listeners (if there's no privacy protection)



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   find out where the L7 entity is located, rather than just the
   location information.

   With regard to the ability for an adversary to replay an eavesdropped
   a signed location object, the following two approaches need to be
   considered:

   1.  A signed PIDF-LO with the L7 identity included, conveyed without
       confidentiality protection from the Target to the Location
       Recipient, and

   2.  A signed PIDF-LO, without the L7 identity, conveyed with
       confidentiality protection from the Target to the Location
       Recipient.

   Note that in both cases confidentiality protection for the
   communication between the LIS and the Target is provided. (2) has the
   same security properties as (1) in terms of the ability of somebody
   else to steal and re-use the PIDF-LO ("location theft") (assuming the
   Location Recipient and the Target are honest).

   An adversary might, for example, want to perform a replay attack by
   eavesdropping the signed location object.  If the LIS includes
   additional attributes, such as a timestamp and the validity time, the
   vulnerability can be reduced although not entirely prevented.  The
   reason for an adversary to still be able to replay the location
   information is that there is no verifiable identifier is associated
   with the signed location information.  For example, the LIS might
   include the IP address of the end host to the signed location object.
   Spoofing the IP address is, however, relatively easy.  Moreover, the
   IP address that is used to associate the location information cannot
   be verified by the LR since the IP address can be modified
   legitimately (e.g., NAT reasons) or might not be seen due to
   tunneling techniques (e.g., VPN, Mobile IP).

   Ideally, an "identifier" with the property of being non-spoofable by
   an adversary and verifiable by the LR when it receives a signed
   location object, which will ensure that the submitted location
   information is actually sent by the claimed end host and not
   replayed.  One such verifiable identifier is a public key, the serial
   number of a certificate, a hash of a public key (in the sense of
   Purpose-Built-Keys or Cryptographically-Generated-Addresses) or the
   value of a hash chain.  We call this identifier, key identifier or
   keyID for short.

   In more details, the end host provides this identifier to the LIS and
   it is signed together with location information.  The following steps
   are executed:



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   1.  The end host interacts with the LIS to obtain its location
       information.  The communication is secured using Transport Layer
       Security.  This request carries the keyID.  In this example, we
       use a keyID that represents the hash of a public key.  The LIS
       ties the received keyID to the location object and signs it.

   2.  The LIS returns the signed location object that includes the
       keyID to the requesting end host.

   3.  Whenever the end host wants to distribute its location
       information to a LR, it attaches location information to a SIP
       message as described in [14].  The end host computes a digital
       signature over the SIP header fields and signed location object
       (as, for example, envisioned by SIP Identity [17]) with the
       private key that corresponds to the hashed public key found in
       the signed location object.

   4.  This message is sent to the LR.

   5.  The LR receives the message and it performs the following steps:

       *  It retrieves the public key.

       *  It computes the hash over the public key and compares it with
          the value in the key identifier included in the signed
          location object.

       *  It verifies the digital signature and thereby ensures that the
          end host is indeed in possession of the private key
          corresponding to the obtained public key.

       *  It verifies the digital signature protecting the location
          information and checks whether it was signed by a trusted
          access provider.

   Even if an adversary eveasdrops the communication between the end
   host and the LR it cannot successfully replay a signed location
   object since it does not know the private key corresponding to the
   hashed public key found in the signed location information.  The
   achieved security protection might even be stronger in context of
   CGAs.

8.2.2.  Authenticated Calls

   In many cases, authenticated calls, i.e., verifying the callers
   identity, are at least as useful as location signing since it
   establishes accountability for later prosecution.




Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires April 26, 2007               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   If most of the legitimate calls are authenticated in some way, then
   it is possible, under attack conditions only, to give "dubious" calls
   lower priority or to have them go through some sort of turing test.
   As an example, PSAP operators do not want to reject emergency calls
   regardless of how they look like, but if the alternative is wasting
   90% of the resources on bogus calls (and thus leaving many legitimate
   callers stranded) and not handling the unlucky unauthenticated, the
   expected outcome is better if you can separate.  This is the standard
   "triage" model used in emergency medicine.

   If somebody places a signed (known-third-party VSP-authenticated)
   call, there is at least the possibility of catching a malicious
   caller and the number of such calls is limited.  Thus, there are only
   legitimate calls left

   o  that use end system location determination (e.g., GPS, manual
      configuration);

   o  that have no (known) VSP;

   o  that are not signed in some other way

   In general, it is necessary to separate authentication from charging.
   There is no reason for tying authentication, authorization and
   charging together for this particular context.  For example,
   certificates can be used, for example, for emergency service without
   being subscribed to either a VSP or ISP.

8.2.3.  Location-by-Reference

   The concept of location-by-reference was described in Section 7.  The
   properties of location signing are very similar (if not equal) to the
   properties of the location-by-reference concept when the Location
   Recipient only authenticates the LIS (but not vice-versa).  Both
   mechanisms allow the Location Recipient to authenticate the LIS (and
   potentially the access network provider).

   There are also a few drawbacks with the location signing and the
   location-by-reference concept:

   o  Location signing has very limited utility if the number of signing
      parties is very large

   o  Location signing has very limited utility for commercial
      transactions.  Commercial entities do not care whether a customer
      lies about their location, as long as they can make you pay for
      the service you asked for.

   Authenticated calls also have their disadvantage since they require
   end-host or end-user certificates, which creates a deployment burden,
   unless mechanisms similar to SIP Identity [18] are used.
   Furthermore, authenticated calls do not prevent attacks where the
   location information was obtained unsecured from a LIS and an
   adversary in the access network was able to tamper with the in-flight
   location information.

9.  Requirements

   The following requirements and assumptions have been identified:

   Requirement L7-1: Identifier Choice

      The LIS MUST be presented with a unique identifier of its own
      addressing realm associated in some way with the physical location
      of the end host.

      An identifier is only appropriate if it is from the same realm as
      the one for which the location information service maintains
      identifier to location mapping.


   Requirement L7-2: Mobility Support

      The GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol MUST support a
      broad range of mobility from devices that can only move between
      reboots, to devices that can change attachment points with the
      impact that their IP address is changed, to devices that do not
      change their IP address while roaming, to devices that
      continuously move by being attached to the same network attachment
      point.


   Requirement L7-3: Layer 7 and Layer 2/3 Provider Relationship

      The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
      MUST NOT assume a business or trust relationship between the
      provider of application layer (e.g., SIP, XMPP, H.323) provider
      and the access network provider operating the LIS.


   Requirement L7-4: Layer 2 and Layer 3 Provider Relationship

      The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
      MUST assume that there is a trust and business relationship
      between the L2 and the L3 provider.  The L3 provider operates the
      LIS and needs to obtain location information from the L2 provider
      since this one is closest to the end host.  If the L2 and L3
      provider for the same host are different entities, they cooperate
      for the purposes needed to determine end system locations.

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   Requirement L7-5: Legacy Device Considerations

      The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
      MUST consider legacy residential NAT devices and NTEs in an DSL
      environment that cannot be upgraded to support additional
      protocols, for example to pass additional information through
      DHCP.


   Requirement L7-6: VPN Awareness

      The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
      MUST assume that at least one end of a VPN is aware of the VPN
      functionality.  In an enterprise scenario, the enterprise side
      will provide the LIS used by the client and can thereby detect
      whether the LIS request was initiated through a VPN tunnel.


   Requirement L7-7: Network Access Authentication

      The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
      MUST NOT assume prior network access authentication.


   Requirement L7-8: Network Topology Unawareness

      The design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol
      MUST NOT assume end systems being aware of the access network
      topology.  End systems are, however, able to determine their
      public IP address(es) via mechanisms such as STUN [4] or NSIS
      NATFW NSLP [19] .

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Capabilities of the Adversary

   As common elsewhere, several kinds of attackers can be distinguished.
   As always, Alice is the "good guy" and Trudy the attacker.  Attackers
   can be:

   o  off-path, i.e., it cannot see packets between Alice and the LIS;

   o  on-path, i.e., can see such packets.

   On-path attackers may be:

   o  passive, i.e., can only observe;

   o  semi-active, i.e., can inject packets with a bogus IP address, but
      cannot prevent the delivery of packets from the end system or
      modify these packets;

   o  active, i.e., can inject and modify packets at will.

10.2.  Threats

   When the reference to location information is communicated to the
   Location Recipient then on-path adversaries can eavesdrop the
   signaling communication together with the reference.  Furthermore,
   the end-to-end communication might involve SIP proxies and they may
   not be trustworthy.  Hence, they can eavesdrop the reference and
   misuse it (by resolving it).

   Untrusted proxies that are involved in the communication lead to a
   requirement for the Target to selectively grant access to already
   known and trusted Location Recipients.

   The following list presents threats specific to location information
   handling:

   Place-Shifting (PS):

      Trudy pretends to be at an arbitrary location.


   Time-Shifting (TS):

      Trudy pretends to be at a location she was a while ago.

Internet-Draft      Geopriv L7 LCP; Problem Statement       October 2006


   Location-Theft (LT):

      Trudy observes Alice's location and replays it as her own location
      object.


   Location-Identity-Theft (LIT):

      Trudy observes Alice's location and her identity (e.g., presence
      identity) and replays it.


   Location-Swapping (LS):

      Trudy' and Trudy'', located at different locations, can collude
      and swap location objects and pretend to be in each other's
      location.

   Table 1 shows the different threats and the applicability of proposed
   countermeasures.

   -: Functionality not necessary to accomplish the desired
      functionality.

   X: Functionality needed to prevent threat.

10.3.  Requirements

   The following requirements are placed on the location-by-value
   approach:

   o  No conclusion was reached whether a PIDF-LO or just location
      information has to be signed.

   o  No conclusion was reached whether location information should be
      signed.

   o  No conclusion was reached what could be signed.

   The following requirements are placed on the location-by-reference
   approach:

   o  The reference MUST be valid for a limited amount of time.

   o  The reference MUST be hard to guess, i.e., it MUST contain a
      cryptographically random component.

   o  The reference MUST NOT contain any information that identifies the
      user, device or address of record

   o  The Location Recipient MUST be able to resolve the reference more
      than once (i.e., there is no implicit limit on the number of
      dereferencing actions).

   o  Possessing a reference to location information allows a Location
      Recipient to repeately obtain the latest information about the
      Target with the same granularity.

   o  The Target MUST be able to resolve the reference itself.
