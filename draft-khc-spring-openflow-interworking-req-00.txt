               SPRING OpenFlow Interworking Requirements
           draft-khc-spring-openflow-interworking-req-00.txt

Abstract

   This draft reviews the use cases and lists the requirements for
   interworking (IW) between OpenFlow (OF) and Segment routing (SR).
   Although the details and specifics of IW depend on both the
   architecture and framework, there are some common requirements.  We
   specify those common requirements and show a simple architecture
   framework.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through a controlled set of
   instructions, called segments, by pre-pending the packet with an SR
   header.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
   service-based.  A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or
   global within an SR domain.  Segment Routing allows one to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chaining while
   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the Segment
   Routing domain

   The Segment Routing architecture is described in
   ([I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing]) The Segment Routing control
   plane is agnostic to the data plane, and hence it can be applied to
   both MPLS (and its many variants) and IPv6.

   OpenFlow is a communications protocol and open interface defined
   between the control and forwarding layers([OpenFlow]).  It allows
   direct access to and manipulation of the forwarding plane of network
   devices such as switches and routers, both physical and virtual
   (hypervisor-based).

   This document introduces several scenarios and discusses the
   interworking between segment routing and openflow.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Data Center (DC) Inter-connection

   Modern day DCs are increasingly utilizing Openflow protocol now,
   while the WAN network keeps maintaining the traditional IP/MPLS
   network.  Therefore, there exits a need for interworking between
   OpenFlow and the traditional IP/MPLS network.  This scenario
   discusses how to control the inter-DC flow based on the SDN
   architecture and segment routing technology.

   As shown in Figure 1, the data center is controlled by one or several
   OF controllers, and all the switches and routers support flow
   forwarding.  The switches and routers communicate with OF controller
   by OpenFlow protocol.  The router is the layer 3 gateway for that
   data center.  The IP/MPLS network between the data centers support
   segment routing technology.  The segment routing label stacks are
   encapsulated in the edge routers of the data center.

   The security app and Traffic Engineering app are the application
   layer.  They communicate with controller through north bound
   interface.  If there are some policies, such as TE App, or security
   App and policy App for the inter-flow forwarding, the Apps download
   the service decision to the controller to result into forwarding
   instance, and the forwarding instances are downloaded to the gateway
   router of the data center to or from the forwarding label stack.

   o  OF-based DCI-Req-8: The interworking function should support OAM
      functions that is needed to manage SPRING and OF.

4.  OpenFlow Based WAN Control

   Figure 2 shows an SDN based WAN control scenario.  The controller is
   introduced to the WAN network.  The controller should support an
   externally visible Discovery Service and a Routing Service.  The
   Discovery Service is responsible for bootstrapping and configuring
   the network, discovering node-capabilities, discovering and
   maintaining the topology graph, providing statistics and
   troubleshooting services and finally implementing an API for the
   Routing Service as well as external requests.  The Routing Service is
   responsible for default routing on the configured network using
   Segment Routing principles like Node Segments and ECMP.  It should
   also support capabilities allowing for Policy Routing, Traffic
   Engineering and Steering.

   The transit routers (Route 2 and Router 3) are only responsible for
   MPLS label forwarding.  The SR forwarding tables could be built by
   the controller or the IGP protocols
   ([I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions])
   ([I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions]).

4.1.  List of Req. for OF-based SDN WAN

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-1: Controller may be multiple in WAN.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-2: The controller should support Discovery
      Service, Routing Service, and Forwarding Services.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-3: The Discovery Service should support
      bootstrapping and configuring the network, discovering node-
      capabilities and topology, statistics and troubleshooting
      services, and an API for the Routing Service.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-4: The Routing Service should support default
      routing on the configured network using Segment Routing principles
      like Node Segments and ECMP.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-5: The Routing Service should also support
      Policy Routing, Traffic Engineering and Steering.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-6: Forwarding tables should be maintained by
      the controller, but could be built by IGP protocol and the Routing
      Service.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-7: Routing Service and Discovery Service
      should support high availability.

   o  OF-based-SDN-WAN-Req-8: The ECMP-based path placement and explicit
      path mechanisms for WAN should be supported.

5.  Interworking of OpenFlow and BGP Edge Routers

   There are four PEs, two of them (PE1 and PE3) support Openflow
   protocol, and the other two(PE2 and PE4) support traditional BGP
   protocol as shown in Figure 3.  The routes on the PE2 and PE4 are
   reflected to PE1 and PE3 through the BGP route reflector.  For
   unified control and interoperability the OF controller needs to
   interpret the route control messages from the BGP route reflector/
   controller, and vice versa.  The details of the interface and the
   messages that need to be exchanged between OF Controller and BGP
   Route Reflector/Controller need to be determined (future work).

   We introduce an OF controller in the network and an application layer
   server.  The Apps in the Server can have visibility to the routes
   from BGP RR as the figure shows.  This makes it feasible to export
   the route to OF controller.  The OF controller make its forwarding
   decision based on the route exported from application and the
   application policy.  The forwarding decision is made of label stack
