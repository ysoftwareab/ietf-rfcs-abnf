Internet-Draft         WiMAX Diameter Applications            April 2009


Abstract

   This document registers a set of IANA Applications and Diameter
   Command Codes to be used in new vendor-specific Diameter applications
   defined for the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
   (WiMAX).  These new Diameter applications are defined for the
   interaction of the Access Serving Network Gateway (ASNGW) with the
   AAA and the Policy and Charging Control infrastructure in the
   Connectivity Serving Network (CSN) and between the Home Agent (HA)
   and AAA servers.  Applications and related commands are also defined
   to support Location Based Services.

1.  Introduction

   Release 1.0 of the WiMAX Forum network architecture utilizes RADIUS
   [RFC2865] based Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
   protocols.  Release 1.5 introduce Diameter [RFC3588] AAA protocols.

   As part of this architecture, the interfaces based on the Diameter
   protocol requires the definition of the following Diameter
   applications:

   WiMAX Network Access Authentication and Authorization Diameter
   Application(WNAAADA)

      This application authenticates, authorizes, network access of
      devices between the ASN-GW and the Diameter Server in the CSN.
      Part of the authorization includes IP and QoS bootstrapping.

   WiMAX Network Accounting Diameter Application(WNADA)

      This application is used for accounting purposes between the
      ASN-GW or Home Agent and the Accounting server.

   WiMAX MIP4 Diameter Application(WM4DA)

      This application is used to authenticate and authorize Mobile IPv4
      service between the Home Agent and the Diameter server.

   WiMAX MIP6 Diameter Application(WM6DA)

      This application is used to authenticate and authorize Mobile IPv6
      service between the Home Agent and the Diameter server.

   WiMAX DHCP Diameter Application(WDDA)

      This application is used to obtain keys used to secure DHCP
      interactions between the DHCP Relay and the DHCP Server.

   WiMAX-Location-Authentication-Authorization Diameter
   Application(WLAADA)

      This application is used to authenticate and authorize location
      requester seeking location information about a specific WiMAX
      devices.

   WiMAX-Location-Authentication-Authorization Diameter
   Application(WLAADA)

      This application is used to authenticate and authorize location

      requester seeking location information about a specific WiMAX
      devices.  As well, the application supports command for fetching
      measurement reports from the ASN.

   WiMAX-Policy-and-Charging-Control-R3-Policies Diameter
   Application(WiMAX PCC-R3-P)

      This application is used for the policy and charging control in a
      WiMAX network when WiMAX PCRF and ASN are interacting.

   WiMAX-Policy-and-Charging-Control-R3-OFfline-Charging Diameter
   Application(WiMAX PCC-R3-OFC)

      This application is used for Diameter based offline charging in
      WiMAX networks when the ASN interacts with the CSN.

   WiMAX-Policy-and-Charging-Control-R3-OFfline-Charging-Prime Diameter
   Application(WiMAX PCC-R3-OFC')

      This application is used for Diameter based offline charging in
      WiMAX networks when AAA provides accounting records to an OFCS.

   WiMAX-Policy-and-Charging-Control-R3-Online-Charging Diameter
   Application(WiMAX PCC-R3-OC)

      This application is used for Diameter based online charging in
      WiMAX networks when the ASN interacts with the Online Charging
      System (OCS).

13.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].

   This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined
   in the Diameter Base specification [RFC3588].  Section 11 of
   [RFC3588] (IANA Considerations) details the assignment criteria.

   IANA is requested to allocate the following Vendor Specific
   Application code values as per section 11.3 of [RFC3588] :

14.  Security Considerations

   This document describes command codes used in applications which
   build on top of the Diameter base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this
