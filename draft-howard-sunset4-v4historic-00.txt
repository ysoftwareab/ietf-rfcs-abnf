Abstract

   IPv4 has been superseded by IPv6, and is therefore Historic.

1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC2026], "The Internet Standards Process":

      4.2.4 Historic

      A specification that has been superseded by a more recent
      specification or is for any other reason considered to be obsolete
      is assigned to the "Historic" level.

      Note: Standards track specifications normally must not depend on
      other standards track specifications which are at a lower maturity
      level or on non standards track specifications other than
      referenced specifications from other standards bodies.  (See
      Section 7.)

   IPv4 [RFC791] has been superseded by the more recent IPv6
   specification [RFC2460bis].  The IPv6 document specifically says, "IP
   version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of the Internet Protocol, designed
   as the successor to IP version 4 (IPv4) [RFC791]."

   RFC791 is therefore Historic.

   IPv4 has inherent limitations which can not be mitigated; the IETF
   has therefore developed a new protocol without these limitations.
   Current and future work builds on IPv6, making it better for every
   purpose than the old protocol.

   The use of IPv4 is deprecated.  The term "deprecated" is used to
   indicate a feature, characteristic, or practice that should be
   avoided, in this case because it is being superseded by a newer
   protocol.  The term does not indicate that the practice is harmful,
   but that there will be no further development in IPv4, and therefore
   those using the old version are advised to transition to the newer
   version.

2.  Implications

   Moving an Internet Standard to the Historic maturity level does not
   mean that it cannot be used.  It does mean that any Standards Track
   RFC with a Normative reference to RFC791 is Historic.  This is
   appropriate: any RFC defining IPv4 options is Historic.

   In addition, some RFCs that refer to RFC791, such as [RFC1035]
   "DOMAIN NAMES - IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION" which defines A and
   IN-ADDR.ARPA, will be Updated By this document, but are not Historic.
   Other documents with incidental references to RFC791 should not be
   affected.  Documents requiring updates are appropriate for [draft-
   ietf-sunset4-gapanalysis].

   The IETF does not update Historic RFCs.  Therefore, the IETF will no
   longer work on IPv4 technologies, including transition technologies.

   The term "IP," without address family specified, is assumed to mean
   "IPv6."

3.  Security Considerations

   It is possible that bugs inherent to IPv4 will yet be discovered.
   Being Historic, the IETF will not further update IPv4.  Therefore,
   for security reasons, the use of IPv6 exclusively is recommended.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not direct IANA to alter its processes for
   allocating IPv4 addresses according to its processes.  This is
   unlikely to be a significant activity for long.
