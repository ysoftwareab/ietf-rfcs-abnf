        Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data Frames in CAPWAP
                 draft-ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel-09

Abstract

   Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) defines a
   specification to encapsulate a station's data frames between the
   Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).
   Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either
   locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP data
   channel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments encapsulating
   data frames to an entity other than the AC (for example to an Access
   Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to
   use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the
   Access Router.  This document defines extension to CAPWAP protocol
   for supporting this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel
   encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP
   to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from
   the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation
   types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may advertise support
   for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery and join
   process and AC may select one of the supported alternate tunnel
   encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.

1.  Introduction

   Service Providers are deploying very large Wi-Fi deployments (ranging
   from hundreds of thousands of Access Points, APs (referred to as WTPs
   in CAPWAP terminology) to millions of APs.  These networks are
   designed to carry traffic generated from mobile users.  The volume in
   mobile user traffic is already very large and expected to continue
   growing rapidly.  As a result, operators are looking for scalable
   solutions that can meet the increasing demand.  The scalability
   requirement can be met by splitting the control/management plane from
   the data plane.  This enables the data plane to scale independent of
   the control/management plane.  This specification provides a way to
   enable such separation.

   CAPWAP ([RFC5415], [RFC5416]) defines a tunnel mode that describes
   how the WTP handles the data plane (user traffic).  The following
   types are defined:

   o  Local Bridging: All data frames are locally bridged.
   o  802.3 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.3
      format.
   o  802.11 Tunnel: All data frames are tunneled to the AC in 802.11
      format.

   Figure 1 describes a system with Local Bridging.  The AC is in a
   centralized location.  The data plane is locally bridged by the WTPs
   leading to a system with centralized control plane with distributed
   data plane.  This system has two benefits: 1) reduces the scale
   requirement on data traffic handling capability of the AC and 2)
   leads to more efficient/optimal routing of data traffic while
   maintaining centralized control/management.

            Figure 1: Centralized Control with Distributed Data

   The AC handles control of WTPs.  In addition, the AC also handles the
   IEEE 802.11 management traffic to/from the stations.  There is CAPWAP
   Control and Data Channel between the WTP and the AC.  Note that even
   though there is no user traffic transported between the WTP and AC,
   there is still a CAPWAP Data Channel.  The CAPWAP Data Channel
   carries the IEEE 802.11 management traffic (like IEEE 802.11 Action
   Frames).

   Figure 2 shows a system where the tunnel mode is configured to tunnel
   data frames between the WTP and the AC either using 802.3 Tunnel or
   802.11 Tunnel configurations.  Operators deploy this configuration
   when they need to tunnel the user traffic.  The tunneling requirement
   may be driven by the need to apply policy at the AC or a legal
   requirement to support lawful intercept of user traffic.  This
   requirement could be met in the locally bridged system (Figure 1) if
   the access router implemented the required policy.  However, in many
   deployments the operator managing the WTP is different than the
   operator managing the Access Router.  When the operators are
   different, the policy has to be enforced in a tunnel termination
   point in the WTP operator's network.

            Figure 2: Centralized Control and Centralized Data

   The key difference with the locally bridged system is that the data
   frames are tunneled to the AC instead of being locally bridged.
   There are two shortcomings with system in Figure 2. 1) They do not
   allow the WTP to tunnel data frames to an endpoint different from the
   AC and 2) They do not allow the WTP to tunnel data frames using any
   encapsulation other than CAPWAP (as specified in Section 4.4.2 of
   [RFC5415]).

   Figure 3 shows a system where the WTP tunnels data frames to an
   alternate entity different from the AC.  The WTP also uses an
   alternate tunnel encapsulation such as such as L2TP, L2TPv3, IP-in-
   IP, IP/GRE, etc.  This enables 1) independent scaling of data plane
   and 2) leveraging of commonly used tunnel encapsulations such as
   L2TP, GRE, etc.

   The WTP may support widely used encapsulation types such as L2TP,
   L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IP/GRE, etc.  The WTP advertises the different
   alternate tunnel encapsulation types it can support.  The AC
   configures one of the advertised types.  As shown in the figure there
   is a CAPWAP control and data channel between the WTP and AC.  The
   CAPWAP data channel carries the stations' management traffic as in
   the case of the locally bridged system.  The main reason to maintain
   a CAPWAP data channel is to maintain similarity with the locally
   bridged system.  The WTP maintains three tunnels: CAPWAP Control,
   CAPWAP Data, and another alternate tunnel for the data frame.  The
   data frames are transported by an alternate tunnel between the WTP
   and a tunnel termination point such as an Access Router.  This
   specification describes how the alternate tunnel can be established.
   The specification defines message elements for the WTP to advertise
   support for alternate tunnel encapsulation, the AC to configure
   alternate tunnel encapsulation, and for the WTP to report failure of
   the alternate tunnel.

   The alternate tunnel encapsulation also supports the third-party WLAN
   service provider scenario (i.e.  Virtual Network Operator, VNO).
   Under this scenario, the WLAN provider owns the WTP and AC resources,
   while the VNOs can rent the WTP resources from the WLAN provider for
   network access.  The AC belonging to the WLAN service provider
   manages the WTPs in the centralized mode.

   As shown in Figure 4, VNO 1&2 don't possess the network access
   resources, however they provide services by acquiring resources from
   the WLAN provider.  Since a WTP is capable of supporting up to 16
   Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs), the WLAN provider may provide
   network access service for different providers with different SSIDs.
   For example, SSID1 is advertised by the WTP for VNO1; while SSID2 is
   advertised by the WTP for VNO2.  Therefore the data traffic from the
   user can be directly steered to the corresponding access router of
   the VNO who owns that user.  AC can notify multiple AR addresses for
   load balancing or redundancy.

   The above example describes how the alternate tunnel encapsulation
   may be established.  When the WTP joins the AC, it should indicate
   its alternate tunnel encapsulation capability.  The AC determines
   whether an alternate tunnel configuration is required.  If an
   appropriate alternate tunnel type is selected, then the AC provides
   the alternate tunnel encapsulation message element containing the
   tunnel type and a tunnel-specific information element.  The tunnel-
   specific information element, for example, may contain information
   like the IP address of the tunnel termination point.  The WTP sets up
   the alternate tunnel using the alternate tunnel encapsulation message
   element.

   Since AC can configure a WTP with more than one AR available for the
   WTP to establish the data tunnel(s) for user traffic, it may be
   useful for the WTP to communicate the selected AR.  To enable this,
   the IEEE 802.11 WLAN Configuration Response may contain the AR list
   element containing the selected AR.

   On detecting a tunnel failure, WTP SHALL forward data frames to the
   AC and discard the frames.  In addition, WTP may dissociate existing
   clients and refuse association requests from new clients.  Depending
   on the implementation and deployment scenario, the AC may choose to
   reconfigure the WLAN (on the WTP) to a local bridging mode or to
   tunnel frames to the AC.  When the WTP detects an alternate tunnel
   failure, the WTP informs the AC using a message element, WTP
   Alternate Tunnel Fail Indication (defined in this specification).  It
   MAY be carried in the CAPWAP Station Configuration Request message
   which is defined in [RFC5415].

   The WTP also needs to notify the AC of which AR(s) are unavailable.
   Particularly, in the VNO scenario, the AC of the WLAN service
   provider needs to maintain the association of the AR addresses of the
   VNOs and SSIDs, and provide this information to the WTP for the
   purpose of load balancing or master-slave mode.

   The message element has a status field that indicates whether the
   message denotes reporting a failure or the clearing of the previously
   reported failure.

   For the case where AC is unreachable but the tunnel end point is
   still reachable, the WTP behavior is up to the implementation.  For
   example, the WTP could either choose to tear down the alternate
   tunnel or let the existing user's traffic continue to be tunneled.

      values for the key tunnel types and defines the most common
      message elements.  It is anticipated that message elements for the
      other protocols (like L2TPv3, etc.) will be defined in other
      specifications in the future.

3.3.  IEEE 802.11 WTP Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication

   The Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element is sent by
   the WTP to inform the AC about the status of the Alternate Tunnel.
   It MAY be included in the CAPWAP Station Configuration Request
   message.  For the case where WTP establishes data tunnels with
   multiple ARs (e.g., under VNO scenario), the WTP needs to notify the
   AC of which AR(s) are unavailable.  The message element contains the
   following fields:

      of which AR(s) are unavailable.

4.  Alternate Tunnel Types

4.1.  CAPWAP based Alternate Tunnel

   If the CAPWAP encapsulation is selected by the AC and configured by
   the AC to the WTP, the Info Element field defined in Section 3.2
   SHOULD contain the following information:

   o  Access Router Information: IPv4 address or IPv6 address of the
      Access Router for the alternate tunnel.
   o  Tunnel DTLS Policy: The CAPWAP protocol allows optional protection
      of data packets using DTLS.  Use of data packet protection on a
      WTP is not mandatory but determined by the associated AC policy
      (This is consistent with the WTP behavior described in [RFC5415]).
   o  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy: It is used to specify how the
      CAPWAP data channel packet are to be tagged for QoS purposes (see
      [RFC5416] for more details).
   o  CAPWAP Transport Protocol: The CAPWAP protocol supports both UDP
      and UDP-Lite (see [RFC3828]).  When run over IPv4, UDP is used for
      the CAPWAP data channels.  When run over IPv6, the CAPWAP data
      channel may use either UDP or UDP-lite.

   The message element structure for CAPWAP encapsulation is shown in
   Figure 9:

4.2.  PMIPv6 based Alternate Tunnel

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) (defined in [RFC5213]) based user plane
   can also be used as alternate tunnel encapsulation between the WTP
   and the AR.  In this scenario, a WTP acts as the Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) function that manages the mobility-related signaling
   for a station that is attached to the WTP IEEE 802.11 radio access.
   The Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) function is at the AR.  If PMIPv6 UDP
   encapsulation is selected by the AC and configured by the AC to a
   WTP, the Info Element field defined in Section 3.2 SHOULD contain the
   following information:

   o  Access Router (acts as LMA) Information: IPv4 or IPv6 address for
      the alternate tunnel endpoint.

   The message element structure for PMIPv6 encapsulation is shown in
   Figure 10:

4.3.  GRE based Alternate Tunnel

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (defined in [RFC2784]) mode based user
   plane can also be used as alternate tunnel encapsulation between the
   WTP and the AR.  In this scenario, a WTP and the access routers
   represent the two end points of the GRE tunnel.  If GRE encapsulation
   is selected by the AC and configured by the AC to a WTP, the Info
   Element field defined in Section 3.2 SHOULD contain the following
   information:

   o  Access Router Information: IPv4 or IPv6 address for the alternate
      tunnel endpoint.
   o  GRE Key Information: The Key field is intended to be used for
      identifying an individual traffic flow within a tunnel [RFC2890].

5.  Alternate Tunnel Information Elements

   This section defines the various elements described in Section 4.1,
   Section 4.2, and Section 4.3.

   These information elements can only be inluded in the Alternate
   Tunnel Encapsulations Type message element, and the IEEE 802.11 WTP
   Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element as their sub-
   elements.

5.1.  Access Router Information Elements

   The Access Router Information Elements allow the AC to notify a WTP
   of which AR(s) are available for establishing a data tunnel.  The AR
   information may be IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.This information
   element SHOULD be contained whatever the tunnel type is.

   The following are the Access Router Information Elements defined in
   this specification.  The AC can use one of them to notify the
   destination information of the data tunnel to the WTP.  The Elements
   containing the AR IPv4 address MUST NOT be used if an IPv6 data

5.2.  Tunnel DTLS Policy Element

   The AC distributes its DTLS usage policy for the CAPWAP data tunnel
   between a WTP and the AR.  There are multiple supported options,
   represented by the bit field below as defined in AC Descriptor
   message elements.  The WTP MUST abide by one of the options for
   tunneling user traffic with AR.  The Tunnel DTLS Policy Element obeys
   the definition in [RFC5415].  If there are more than one ARs
   information provided by the AC for reliability reasons, the same
   Tunnel DTLS Policy (see Figure 14) is generally applied for all
   tunnels associated with the ARs.  Otherwise, Tunnel DTLS Policy MUST
   be bonding together with each of the ARs, then WTP will enforce the
   independent tunnel DTLS policy for each tunnel with a specific AR.

   Reserved: A set of reserved bits for future use.  All implementations
   complying with this protocol MUST set to zero any bits that are
   reserved in the version of the protocol supported by that
   implementation.  Receivers MUST ignore all bits not defined for the
   version of the protocol they support.

   A: If A bit is set, there is an AR information associated with the
   DTLS policy.  There may be an array of pairs binding DTLS policy
   information and AR information contained in the Tunnel DTLS Policy
   Element.  Otherwise, the same Tunnel DTLS Policy (see Figure 14) is
   generally applied for all tunnels associated with the ARs configured
   by the AC.

   D: DTLS-Enabled Data Channel Supported (see [RFC5415]).

   C: Clear Text Data Channel Supported (see [RFC5415]).

   R: A reserved bit for future use (see [RFC5415]).

5.3.  IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy Element

   In 802.11 networks, IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy Element is used
   to specify how the WTP apply the QoS tagging policy when receiving
   the packets from stations on a particular radio.  When the WTP sends
   out the packet to data channel to the AR(s), the packets have to be
   tagged for QoS purposes (see [RFC5416]).

   The IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy abides the IEEE 802.11 WTP
   Quality of Service defined in Section 6.22 of [RFC5416].

   If there are more than one ARs information provided by the AC for
   reliability reasons, the same IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy (see
   Figure 15) is generally applied for all tunnels associated with the
   ARs.  Otherwise, IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy MUST be bonding
   together with each of the ARs, then WTP will enforce the independent
   tunnel IEEE 802.11 Tagging Mode Policy for each tunnel with a
   specific AR.

5.4.  CAPWAP Transport Protocol Element

   The CAPWAP data tunnel supports both UDP and UDP-Lite (see
   [RFC3828]).  When run over IPv4, UDP is used for the CAPWAP data
   channels.  When run over IPv6, the CAPWAP data channel may use either
   UDP or UDP-lite.  The AC specifies and configure the WTP for which
   transport protocol is to be used for the CAPWAP data tunnel.

   The CAPWAP Transport Protocol Element abides the definition in
   Section 4.6.14 of [RFC5415].

   Transport: The transport to use for the CAPWAP Data channel.  The
   following enumerated values are supported:

   1 - UDP-Lite: The UDP-Lite transport protocol is to be used for the
   CAPWAP Data channel.  Note that this option MUST NOT be used if the
   CAPWAP Control channel is being used over IPv4 and AR address is IPv4
   contained in the AR Information Element.

   2 - UDP: The UDP transport protocol is to be used for the CAPWAP Data
   channel.

5.5.  GRE Key Element

   If a WTP receives the GRE Key Element in the Alternate Tunnel
   Encapsulation message element for GRE selection, the WTP MUST insert
   the GRE Key to the encapsulation packet (see [RFC2890]).  An AR
   acting as decapsulating tunnel endpoint identifies packets belonging
   to a traffic flow based on the Key value.

   The GRE Key Element field contains a four octet number defined in
   [RFC2890].

5.6.  IPv6 MTU Element

   If AC has chosen a tunneling mechanism based on IPv6, it SHOULD
   support the minimum IPv6 MTU requirements [RFC2460].  This issue is
   described in [I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels].  AC SHOULD inform the WTP
   about the IPv6 MTU information in the "Tunnel Info Element" field.

   o  <IANA-1>.  This specification defines the Supported Alternate
      Tunnel Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.1.  This
      elements needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message
      Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for
      this element needs to be between 1 and 1023 (see Section 15.7 in
      [RFC5415]).
   o  <IANA-2>.  This specification defines the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element in Section 3.2.  This element
      needs to be registered in the existing CAPWAP Message Element Type
      registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The Type value for this element
      needs to be between 1 and 1023.
   o  <IANA-3>.  This specification defines the IEEE 802.11 WTP
      Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element in
      Section 3.3.  This element needs to be registered in the existing
      CAPWAP Message Element Type registry, defined in [RFC5415].  The
      Type value for this element needs to be between 1024 and 2047.
   o  Alternate Tunnel-Types Registry: This specification defines the
      Alternate Tunnel Encapsulations Type message element.  This
      element contains a field Tunnel-Type.  The namespace for the field
      is 16 bits (0-65535).  This specification defines values, zero (0)
      through six (6) and can be found in Section 3.2.  Future
      allocations of values in this name space are to be assigned by
      IANA using the "Specification Required" policy.  IANA needs to
      create a registry called CAPWAP Alternate Tunnel-Types.  The
      registry format is given below.

        Tunnel-Type           Type Value   Reference
        CAPWAP                0            [RFC5415],[RFC5416]

        GTPv1-U               6            [3GPP TS 29.281]

   o  Alternate Tunnel Sub-elements Registry: This specification defines
      the Alternate Tunnel Sub-elements.  Currently, these information
      elements can only be inluded in the Alternate Tunnel
      Encapsulations Type message element, and the IEEE 802.11 WTP
      Alternate Tunnel Failure Indication message element as their sub-
      elements.  These information elements contains a Type field.  The
      namespace for the field is 16 bits (0-65535).  This specification
      defines values, zero (0) through six (6) in Section 5.  This
      namespace is managed by IANA and assignments require an Expert
      Review.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces three new CAPWAP WTP message elements.
   These elements are transported within CAPWAP Control messages as the
   existing message elements.  Therefore, this document does not
   introduce any new security risks to the control plane compared to
   [RFC5415] and [RFC5416].  In the data plane, if the encapsulation
   type selected itself is not secured, it is suggested to protect the
   tunnel by using known secure methods, such as IPSec.
