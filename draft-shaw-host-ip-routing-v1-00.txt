Abstract

This document specifies an additional ip routing technique.

A host will use a route table to determine how to best transmit a
network datagram packet to the destination host.  The destination
address is compared to a locally maintained routing table to determine
the specific gateway.  The best route and/or lowest metric is used to
determine the gateway to use to reach the destination host.  A default
gateway is used if no matches are found in the routing table.

This type of routing works when there is only one route to the
destination address.  A problem is encountered when a computer is
connected to more than one network.  All of the destination networks
must be defined in the routing table to properly route the request
back to the originating host.  The default gateway will not always be
able to route to the destination address.  This consumes routing
resources when the routing table is significantly large and
impossible when dealing with the world wide Internet.

This diagram describes today's environment when the user networks
are not known and all traffic relies on the default gateway.
The incoming traffic will come in from both networks but the
response will go out only on the single network.  A failure in
a switch or router on the response network would make the system
unusable even though the other network is available.

Furthermore, when hosts are connected to more than one network, as in
web servers with dual ISP access, the return route is always to the
default gateway.  Therefore the return traffic may go out a different
ISP than the way it entered the network.

Solution

This memo proposes using the source address to route
traffic back out the same network it came in.  This problem is 
currently being addressed in a number of ways.  One of them being
the use of "Hide" in firewalls and devices with similar capabilities
like proxies.  The hosts see the destination address as the firewall
or proxy and can route using the IP routing table.

Many products produce reports about a web servers usage.  It is
important to maintain the originators IP address to produce
accurate reports.  Today's reports will show the originating user as
the firewall or the proxy.

This memo proposes allowing each network to have a default gateway.
This will ensure that any incoming packet will be returned
to the same network.  This will simplify routing tables for hosts
connected to more than one network.  IP will continue to use the
routing table as it does today.  This change will only occur if the
default gateway is used and multiple gateways are configured.  IP will
compare the source address of the multiple default gateways to find
the originating network and use the configured gateway.
