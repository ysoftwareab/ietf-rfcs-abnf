1.  Introduction

   BGP [RFC4271] speakers have many default settings which need to be
   revisited as part of improving the routing ecosystem.  There is a
   need to provide guidance to BGP implementers for the default
   behaviors of a well functioning Internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks
   [RFC7908] are part of the problem, but software defects and operator
   misconfigurations are just a few of the attacks on Internet stability
   we aim to address.

   Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route
   announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.  This practice
   dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators were
   permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to
   reach each other.  As the Internet has become more densely
   interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses
   significant risks to Internet routing.

   This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the
   explicit configuration of a BGP import and export policy for any
   External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or
   confederation boundaries in a base router or VPN instances.  When
   this solution is implemented, BGP speakers do not accept or send
   routes without policies configured on EBGP sessions.

2.  Solution Requirements

   The following requirements apply to the solution described in this
   document:

   o  Software MUST consider any routes ineligible for route selection
      (section 9.1.1 [RFC4271]), if no import policy was configured for
      the EBGP peer.

   o  Software MUST NOT advertise any routes to an EBGP peer, if no
      export policy was configured.

   o  Software SHOULD fall back to an "import nothing" and "export
      nothing" mode following failure of internal components, such as a
      policy engine.

   o  Software MUST operate in this mode by default.

   o  Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this
      security capability.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document addresses a basic routing security flaw caused by
   permissive default routing policy configurations.  Operators need
   implementers to address this problem with more secure defaults to
   mitigate collateral damage on Internet routing.  Inadvertent or
   adversarial advertisements cause business impact that can be
   mitigated by a secure default behavior.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
