Abstract

   The issue concerns auditing financial records from several sources
   over time. To validate proper legal money usage and flow is a
   difficult task. Each financial institution has non-common reporting
   methods. Seek to create a common export record to merge transactions
   and easily sort by date , time , and institution. The first goal is
   to create a traceability file of transactions. The second goal is to
   create a "simple" standard record for "anyone" to sift and sort
   records.

1. Introduction

   Audit Financial Records

   Each day numerous financial records and transactions occur. People
   are put in charge as guardians or trustees for the young or old ,
   who cannot handle their own affairs. Additional people may be called
   upon after the fact to validate and audit prior actions.

   All financial instutions have unique and different reporting
   methods. There is no single tool or method to extract a "common"
   data format. Institution A may have PDF files , Institution B may
   have XLS files. Institution C may only have paper reports. To sow
   these records together is a large manual task. The man is working
   for the machine.

   Eliminate having the user reinventing the wheel each time an audit
   is required , or manually key stroking data. Automate the process of
   gathering data into a uniform method.

3. Explain New Record Type and Function

   Create common record for any user.

   Target the intended audience !
   Think as a non-computer expert. Think of non-computer people that do
   jobs ; such as accounting , law enforcement , lawyers , judges ,
   banks , credit unions , estate management , and family relatives.
   Think of simple computer users that who want to manipulate data.
   There are numerous standards for computer data , e.g. iCal , vCard.

   A common record type for auditing financial transactions is needed.
   A record that will span time , time zones , dates and currencies.

   If there is a set of records from Instution A , and another set from
   Instution B. Each will provide data that points back to the other
   instution.

   Record set:
   Record Owner A has Affiliate B
         ( source points forward to destination )
   Record Owner B has Affiliate A
         ( destination points back to source )

   Records should net out.

   The left side of the handshake is always the record owner , the
   right side is always the affiliate.

   The record is a constant format , only the handshake flag flips
   direction to indicate source and destination.

   Who owns the record ? The reporting instution is the record owner of
   the data. The affiliate is the other half of the transaction.
   How did the money move in or out and by what method ?

   This new proposed record will show the process and direction of how
   the money moved. All the data should be available in today's
   environment.

   The audit question is: Where did the cash go ?

   |  Constant record format from the record owner provides:         |
   |        a) The instution numbers crisscross:                     |
   |           fields (09,10) crisscross fields (13,14)              |
   |           for a given transaction (GUID).                       |
   |        b) The Handshake Flags (11) nets out.                    |
   |           The source always points to the destination.          |
   |        c) The Gain Loss Flags (12) net out.                     |
   |        d) Since this netted out and both instutions             |
   |           are known - assume proper money flow.                 |
   |        e) If there are extra unexplained transactions at        |
   |           the destination or a missing destination then         |
   |           further investigation is required.                    |
   |        f) Get additional accounts and records as needed.        |

4. Prototype Data

   Below are several screens (RFC ASCII figures) that display a
   potential solution. Each record has date and time stamp information
   and other data. The key is to have the creator of the record as the
   first instution (left). Then the affiliate instution (right) as the
   handshake. Each transaction has an initiator and a receiver. If both
   instutions create the same format record , it becomes a simple
   crisscross reference match.

   Counter - Field Name

5. File Naming

   Since there might be several years of records requested ,
   there is a need for a specific naming convention of the
   downloaded files and the amount of data.

   Each file will contain data for only one full year:
   from - January 01 , or start date of account.

   Security Considerations

   There are numerous security concerns. We are dealing with people's
   accounts and records. Preferred method to transfer the data is have
   the instutions send an email to the requester. Requester opens the
   email , then clicks a link and an automatic download of all files is
   started. The link should be valid for a maximum of four (4) days.
   The files (data) on the host should be available for thirty (30)
   days ; then destroyed.


   IANA Considerations

   IANA should create a new code "AUKC" to identify the record type.


   Conclusions

   If this standard is adopted numerous manhours (time) and expense
   (money) could be saved. There would be a single universal tool to
   preform consistent audits of the flow of cash (money).
   People doing the auditing could expedite the findings. This would
   assist law enforcement and the courts to find and resolve issues
   rapidly. "Punish the guilty". This would stop the creation of
   different methods and reports ; one common solution could fit all
   future data inquires.

   History Lesson: I spent the last year auditing two (2) niece-like
   girl 's information:
               for six (6) years of data -
                     of two (2) bank accounts each
                     of one (1) stock account each
                     of Federal and State Income Taxes each
                     of Social Security Accounts each
                     of Fillings with the State Court for Minors each
   There were:
   ( 2 girls x 6 years ) x ( 2 bank + stock + 2 tax + SS + minors )
   for a total of:
   ( 12 girl-years x 7 accounts ) = 84 girl-year-account record sets.

   It's all been a manual process to create data records and
   manufacture keys and sub-keys. A many months long process could have
   been finished in weeks.




   Now , I respectively submit this RFC to create a standard record.
   And , ask the expert computer people to assist in its creation and
   implementation. Need help to take a complex process and make into a
   simple user-friendly gathering , merging ; and sorting and filtering
   operation.
