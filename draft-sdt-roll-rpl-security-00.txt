                     draft-sdt-roll-rpl-security-00

Abstract

   This document presents a security design for RPL: IPv6 Routing
   Protocol for Low Power and Lossy networks.  The effort builds upon
   previous work on routing security and adapts the security assessments
   to the issues specific to RPL.  With the threat model, the security
   objectives and required services are identified.  These assessments
   then provide the basis of the security recommendations for
   incorporation into RPL.

Internet-Draft           Security Design for RPL              March 2010


1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].


2.  Introduction

   The IETF ROLL working group is in the process of defining a routing
   protocol, RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], for IPv6 routing over LLNs.  RPL
   builds routes in the form of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic
   Graphs (DODAGs).  RPL may be categorized as a distance-vector
   protocol, in which routes are exchanged among neighbors, as opposed
   to a link-state protocol, in which local link states are flooded to
   all routing participants.

   This document serves as a repository for the security design for RPL.
   It will evolve as the ROLL effort progresses, and in conjunction with
   the work on RPL, it is meant to be eventually merged with the RPL
   RFC.  The following section considers the threats to RPL.  The
   security objectives as well as the required services are given in
   Section 4.  Section 5 describes how to realize the required security
   services.  Section 6 considers issues that have system implications
   for the implementation of RPL security.


3.  Operating Domains and Threats

   Applying the approach outlined in [I-D.tsao-roll-security-framework],
   Figure 1 gives a level-1 data flow diagram representation of RPL to
   show the "assets" and "points of access" that may be vulnerable and
   need to be protected for the RPL routing protocol.

                    Figure 1: Data Flow Diagram of RPL

   From Figure 1, it is seen that threats to the proper operation of RPL
   can be realized through attacks on its DIO, DIS, and DAO control
   message exchanges, as well as on the control information the protocol
   places into the user data flow in the form of the IPv6 Flow Label.
   Note that as shown in Figure 1 RPL uses multicast in addition to
   unicast for control exchanges, thus likely requiring a more complex
   process for key management.  The support for multicast key management
   is outside the scope of the routing protocol.

4.  Security Requirements

   The fundamental security objective for RPL is to ensure proper
   functioning in the presence of adversaries.  More specific immediate
   objectives can be derived through the framework provided in Section 6
   of [I-D.tsao-roll-security-framework]; the base requirements stated
   there concern message integrity, authenticity and liveliness of the
   principals of a connection, and protection of message replay.  The
   framework also recognized that message encryption may be desirable.
   Based on the framework analysis, the security objectives for RPL are
   formulated as below (securing DIS messages and Flow Labels is not yet
   fully considered in this revision of the document).

   RPL security features shall ensure that:

   1.  the received DIO, DIS, and DAO messages are not modified during
       transportation;

   2.  participants of the DIO, DIS, and DAO message exchanges are
       authentic;

   3.  the received DIO, DIS, and DAO messages are not retransmissions
       of previous messages;

   4.  the content of the DIO, DIS, and DAO messages may be made to be
       legible to only authorized entities.

   In meeting the above objectives, the following services are initially
   chosen:

   1.  integrity protection of the DIO and DAO messages;

   2.  authentication of the participants of the DIO and DAO message
       exchanges;

   3.  anti-replay protection of the received DIO and DAO messages;

   4.  encryption of the content of the DIO and DAO messages.

   As pointed out in [I-D.tsao-roll-security-framework] pointed out that
   it is also necessary to allow adaptation of the security services
   afforded to the particular constraints of the deployment environment.
   However the current security design begins with a focus on the
   requirement to implement RPL security features directly as part of
   the routing protocol.  No consideration in therefore currently given
   to capabilities that may be supported by other communications layers
   of the applicable network.  Following completion of the RPL-specific
   security design consideration shall be given to how the required

Internet-Draft           Security Design for RPL              March 2010


   security features can be met through security at other communication
   layers (for example, through IEEE 802.15.4 link layer security),
   without the redundancy that would be negatively affect LLNs.  The
   following section thus considers the manner in which to afford the
   required security services are directly implemented as part of RPL.


5.  Security Design

   This section describes the security design for RPL.

5.1.  Options

   The design specifies options to make the afforded services flexible
   with regard to their incorporation within RPL or other communications
   layer.  The following is an initial outline of the elements to be
   incorporated.

   1.  Message Specification

       a.  Use an admin field in the DIO and DAO to indicate the actual
           protection provided.  This will include the ability to
           indicate that no protection (authenticity, encryption, etc.)
           is applied

       b.  Use sub-option fields in the DIO and DAO to carry security
           information

       c.  Securing DIS messages and Flow Labels with forwarded traffic
           is TBD

   2.  Security Algorithm

       a.  The basic mechanism for protecting integrity and verifying
           authenticity of DIO and DAO packets will be AES128/CCM* with
           four byte MIC and optional payload encryption.

   3.  Security Mechanisms

       a.  Require two base security options

           (1)  no security

           (2)  shared, instance-wide key generated using PRNG at the
                time that the sessions are created

Internet-Draft           Security Design for RPL              March 2010


       b.  Include two additional options

           (1)  pairwise-shared keys generated using PRNG at the time
                that the sessions are created

           (2)  digital signature based

       c.  Initial authentication to create a session would come from

           (1)  no authentication

           (2)  pre-configured, instance-wide join key with no access
                control list

           (3)  pre-configured, instance-wide join key with access
                control list

           (4)  pre-configured join key unique to the MAC ID of the node

           (5)  public key certificate

   The mechanisms for out-of-band pre-configuration are out of scope for
   RPL; [I-D.oflynn-6lowapp-bootstrapping] addresses this issue.

5.2.  Implementation

   The options given in Section 5.1 are realized through extending the
   DIO and DAO bases defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], adding a security
   suboption, and applying security operations on all suboption payload
   of the DIO and DAO messages.

5.2.1.  Basic Packet Structure

   The DIO and DAO messages defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] consist of a
   base and suboptions.  The base is an always-present container.
   Figure 2 shows the DIO base.

5.2.2.  Security Header

   It is proposed to extend the DIO and DAO bases to contain a security
   header field that indicates the applied security suites and carries
   auxiliary security materials, e.g. nonce and IV.  The details of the
   various suites and corresponding security materials are to be
   developed in later revisions.

5.2.3.  Security Suboption

   It is proposed to add a security suboption for common use in the DIO
   and DAO messages to contain the message authentication code when
   message authentication is applied.  When present, the security option
   will be the last suboption of the message.  There may be ways to
   reduce the overhead of using the suboption as a carrier of the
   message authentication code; further consideration will be given in
   later revisions.


6.  Discussions

   For reason of trust binding, it is desirable to be able to assume a
   globally unique device identifier for RPL nodes, such as EUI-64.

   For devices that have a clock on board, timeliness may be provided
   with a single flow mechanism.  In contrast, one can realize this by
   using cryptographic challenge-response protocols, but these involve
   two or more flows.  Support for either approach should be a function
   of network capability.

   It is desirable that security I/O parameter passing for RPL is
   compatible with layer-2, e.g., structure of keying material.  In this
   regard, 802.15.4e would be a good candidate reference model.
