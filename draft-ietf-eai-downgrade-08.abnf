   Encapsulating a header field in a "Downgraded-" header field is
   defined as:
   1.  Generate new "Downgraded-" header whose value is the original
       header field value.
   2.  Encode the generated header field value according to [RFC2047]
       with charset='UTF-8'.  To preserve space characters, the whole
       header field value which include space characters SHOULD be
       encoded.
   3.  Remove the original header field.
