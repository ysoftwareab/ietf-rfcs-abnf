                 draft-li-lsr-isis-hierarchical-isis-01

Abstract

   The IS-IS routing protocol was originally defined with a two level
   hierarchical structure.  This was adequate for the networks at the
   time.  As we continue to expand the scale of our networks, it is
   apparent that additional hierarchy would be a welcome degree of
   flexibility in network design.

   This document defines IS-IS Levels 3 through 8.

1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS routing protocol IS-IS [ISO10589] currently supports a two
   level hierarchy of abstraction.  The fundamental unit of abstraction
   is the 'area', which is a (hopefully) connected set of systems
   running IS-IS at the same level.  Level 1, the lowest level, is
   abstracted by routers that participate in both Level 1 and Level 2.

   Practical considerations, such as the size of an area's link state
   database, cause network designers to restrict the number of routers
   in any given area.  Concurrently, the dominance of scale-out
   architectures based around small routers has created a situation
   where the scalability limits of the protocol are going to become
   critical in the foreseeable future.

   The goal of this document is to enable additional hierarchy within
   IS-IS.  Each additional level of hierarchy has a multiplicative
   effect on scale, so the addition of six levels should be a

   significant improvement.  While all six levels may not be needed in
   the short term, it is apparent that the original designers of IS-IS
   reserved enough space for these levels, and defining six additional
   levels is only slightly harder than adding a single level, so it
   makes sense to expand the design for the future.

   The modifications described herein are designed to be fully backward
   compatible and have no effect on existing networks.  The
   modifications are also designed to have no effect whatsoever on
   networks that only use Level 1 and/or Level 2.

   Section references in this document are references to sections of IS-
   IS [ISO10589].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  PDU changes

   In this section, we enumerate all of the redefinitions of protocol
   header fields necessary to add additional levels.

2.1.  Circuit Type

   In the fixed header of some IS-IS PDUs, a field is named 'Reserved/
   Circuit Type' (Section 9.5).  The high order six bits are reserved,
   with the low order two bits indicating Level 1 (bit 1) and Level 2
   (bit 2).

   This field is renamed to be 'Circuit Type'.  The bits are redefined
   as follows:

   1.  Level 1

   2.  Level 2

   3.  Level 3

   4.  Level 4

   5.  Level 5

   6.  Level 6

   7.  Level 7

Internet-Draft             Hierarchical IS-IS                  June 2019


   8.  Level 8

   The value of zero (no bits set) is reserved.  PDUs with a Circuit
   Type of zero SHALL be ignored.

   The set bits of the Circuit Type MUST be contiguous.  If bit n and
   bit m are set in the Circuit Type, then all bits in the interval
   [n:m] must be set.

2.2.  PDU Type

   The fixed header of IS-IS PDUs contains an octet with three reserved
   bits and the 'PDU Type' field.  The three reserved bits are
   transmitted as zero and ignored on receipt.  (Section 9.5)

   To allow for additional PDU space, this entire octet is renamed the
   'PDU Type' field.

3.  Additional PDUs

3.1.  Level n LAN IS to IS hello PDU (Ln-LAN-HELLO-PDU)

   The 'Level n LAN IS to IS hello PDU' (Ln-LAN-HELLO-PDU) is identical
   in format to the 'Level 2 LAN IS to IS hello PDU' (Section 9.6),
   except that the PDU Types are defined as follows:

      Level 3 (L3-LAN-HELLO-PDU): AA3

      Level 4 (L4-LAN-HELLO-PDU): AA4

      Level 5 (L5-LAN-HELLO-PDU): AA5

      Level 6 (L6-LAN-HELLO-PDU): AA6

      Level 7 (L7-LAN-HELLO-PDU): AA7

      Level 8 (L8-LAN-HELLO-PDU): AA8

3.2.  Level n Point-to-point IS to IS hello PDU (Ln-P2P-HELLO-PDU)

   The 'Point-to-point IS to IS hello PDU' (Section 9.7) is used on
   Level 1 and Level 2 circuits.  Legacy systems will not expect the
   circuit type field to indiate other levels, so a new PDU is used if
   the circuit supports other levels.  The additional PDU is the 'Level
   n Point-to-point IS to IS hello PDU' (Ln-P2P-HELLO-PDU) and has PDU
   Type TTT with the same format.  Both PDUs may be used on the same
   circuit.

4.  IS-IS Area Identifier TLV

   The Area Identifier TLV is added to IS-IS to allow nodes to indicate
   which areas they participate in.  Area Identifiers are locally
   administered 32 bit numbers.  The format of the TLV is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | TLV Type      | TLV Length    |     Level     |   Area        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                 Identifier                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      TLV Type: ZZZ

      TLV Length: 7

      Level: The level number of the area.

      Area Identifier: The identifier associated with the area.

   The Area Identifier TLV may appear in IIHs or in LSPs.  When the Area
   Identifier TLV appears in a PDU, it indicates that the system is
   participating in the specified area at the indicated level.  When the
   Area Identifier TLV appears in a IIH, the receiving system MUST NOT
   form an adjacency unless an Area Identifier TLV corresponds to the
   receiver's own Area Identifier for the given level.

5.  New Flooding Scopes

   For levels 3-8, all link state information, PSNPs, and CSNPs are
   relayed in conformance with RFC 7356 [RFC7356].  Additional flooding
   scopes are defined for each new level, for both circuit flooding
   scope and level flooding scope.  Level flooding scopes are defined
   for both Standard and Extended TLV formats.  The list of additional
   flooding scopes is:

6.  Inheritance of TLVs

   All existing Level 2 TLVs may be used in the corresponding Level 3
   through Level 8 PDUs.  When used in a Level 3 through Level 8 PDU,
   the semantics of these TLVs will be applied to the Level of the
   containing PDU.  If the original semantics of the PDU was carrying a
   reference to Level 1 in a Level 2 TLV, then the semantics of the TLV
   at level N will be a reference to level N-1.  The intent is to retain
   the original semantics of the TLV at the higher level.

7.  Relationship between levels

   The relationship between Level n and Level n-1 is analogous to the
   relationship between Level 2 and Level 1.

   Wells for their helpful comments.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes many requests to IANA, as follows:

9.1.  PDU Type

   The existing IS-IS PDU registry currently supports values 0-31.  This
   should be expanded to support the values 0-255.  The existing value
   assignments should be retained.  Value 255 should be reserved.

9.2.  New PDUs

   IANA is requested to allocate values from the IS-IS PDU registry for
   the following:

      L3-LAN-HELLO-PDU: AA3

      L4-LAN-HELLO-PDU: AA4

      L5-LAN-HELLO-PDU: AA5

      L6-LAN-HELLO-PDU: AA6

      L7-LAN-HELLO-PDU: AA7

      L8-LAN-HELLO-PDU: AA8

      Ln-P2P-HELLO-PDU: TTT

   To allow for PDU types to be defined independent of this document,
   the above values should be allocated from the range 32-254.

9.3.  New TLVs

   IANA is requested to allocate values from the IS-IS TLV registry for
   the following:

10.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security issues.  Security of routing
   within a domain is already addressed as part of the routing protocols
   themselves.  This document proposes no changes to those security
   architectures.
