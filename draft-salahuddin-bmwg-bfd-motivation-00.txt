     Abstract 

        This  document  describes  the  motivation  for  benchmarking  the 
        Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. The BFD protocol 
        is a relatively new protocol intended to detect failures in the 
        bidirectional path between two network elements, with potentially 
        very  low  latency  [BFD,  BFD-GEN].  The  BFD  protocol  is  being 
        implemented by several vendors and is being deployed extensively by 
        the  service  providers.  Hence,  it  is  imperative  that  common 
        understanding  is  established  for  performance  and  conformance 
        benchmarks as well as interoperability.  This draft seeks to generate

        interest on this topic in the working group. If there is sufficient 
        interest on this topic, drafts that address the Methodology and 
        Terminology for the BFD protocol could be proposed; before BMWG could 
        make this an official working group item.

     Internet-Draft     Motivation for Benchmarking           February 2007 
                       BFD Protocol Implementations 
       
     1. Introduction 

        An increasingly important requirement of networking equipment is the 
        ability to detect a forwarding failure between two systems in order 
        to  establish  alternative  paths  more  quickly.  The  BFD  protocol 
        addresses this need by providing low-overhead and short-duration 
        detection of failures in the path between two network elements. Both 
        rapid-detection   and   low-overhead   are   open   to   individual 
        interpretation, in terms of what they entail and how to verify them. 
        So, it is important to establish a benchmarking framework for this 
        protocol.  

        An additional goal of the BFD protocol is to provide a single 
        mechanism that can be used for liveliness detection over any media, 
        at any protocol layer and with a wide range of detection time and 
        overhead. This capability makes it further necessary to have a set of 
        guidelines that are well understood and clearly defined to benchmark 
        the key attributes of the BFD protocol. 

        The BFD protocol is also being proposed for multi-hop virtual links 
        like MPLS LSPs, AToM VCs and others [BFD-MPLS, BFD-MHOP]. This is 
        another area which needs to be characterized and benchmarked for 
        comparison with the single-hop behavior of an implementation. 

        For reasons mentioned above, this document is being put forward to 
        initiate discussion on the topic and invite comments. In the process 
        generating enough interest that may result in future documents that 
        address the benchmarking needs, scenarios, procedures and terminology 
        of the BFD protocol.  

        A set of key benchmarks and use cases are also discussed in this 
        document. 
      
      
     2. Existing definitions 

        For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template 
        for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are 
        indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference. 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
        this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
         
        The reader is encouraged to be familiar with the commonly used BFD 
        terms, some of which are defined in the appendix.

     3. Key BFD Benchmarks 

       3.1. Detection Time 

        Shortest detection time supported for a certain scale deployment. 

       3.2. Mode of operation 

        The mode of operation currently enabled on the device (Demand mode 
        vs. Asynchronous mode). 

       3.3. Echo function capability 

        Whether or not a device under test (DUT) can initiate and respond to 
        the Echo function request. 

       3.4. Control Plane Independence 

        Ability of an implementation to continue to operate when there is a 
        disruption in the control plane. 

       3.5. Minimum Rx Interval supported 

        This is the interval at which a DUT is capable of receiving control 
        messages from the BFD session peer. 

       3.6. Minimum Tx Interval supported 

        This benchmark describes the smallest interval between 2 transmitted 
        BFD control messages that a device is capable of supporting. 

       3.7. Minimum Echo Rx Time 

        This is the minimum interval between received BFD Echo packets that a 
        system is capable of supporting. 

       3.8. Max number of BFD sessions supported 

        The number of BFD sessions that can be simultaneously supported by 
        the DUT. 

       3.9. Multi-Hop BFD sessions 

        This benchmark verifies the capability of an implementation to 
        support multi-hop BFD adjacency.

       3.10. Authentication Support 

        This benchmark verifies if the authentication is supported or not, 
        and if it is supported, what types of authentication are supported. 

         

     4. Key BFD Use Scenarios 

           0 – AtoM VCs 

           1 – L3VPNs 

           2 – TE Tunnels 

           3 – Routing Protocols 

           4 – GRE/L2TPv3 

         

     5. Security Considerations 

        Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of the 
        Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not 
        performed on devices or systems connected to operating networks.
