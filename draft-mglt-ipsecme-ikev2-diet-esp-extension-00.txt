  Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) extension for the ESP Header
                       Compression (EHC) Strategy
             draft-mglt-ipsecme-ikev2-diet-esp-extension-00

Abstract

   ESP Header Compression (EHC) reduces the ESP overhead by compressing
   ESP fields.  Compression results from a coordination of various EHC
   Rules designed as EHC Strategies.  An EHC Strategy may require to be
   configured with some configuration parameters.

   When a Security Association (SA) is enabling EHC, the two peers need
   to agree which EHC Strategy is applied as well as its associated
   configuration parameters.

   This document describes an extension of IKEv2 that enables two peers
   to agree on a specific EHC Strategy as well as its associated
   configuration parameters.

2.  Terminology

   This section defines terms and acronyms used in this document.

   - EHC Strategy :   EHC Strategy is a generic term defined in
         [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp] that defines the way EHC Rules are
         coordinated.

   - Designated EHC Strategy:   the specific EHC Strategy agreed between
         the two peers.  [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp] defines Diet-ESP as
         an EHC Strategy and other may be defined in the future.  This
         document only considers Diet-ESP but provides negotiation
         mechanisms so future EHC Strategies may also be negotiated.

         associated EHC Strategy Configuration Parameters.  This will
         typically include a specific designation as well as specific
         configuration parameters.  The parameters are designated as EHC
         Strategy Configuration Parameter (Parameter)

   - EHC Strategy Configuration Parameter (Parameter):   describes the
         configuration parameters associated to a specific EHC Strategy.
         The Parameters includes the EHC Strategy as well as
         configuration parameters.

   - EHC Strategy Configuration Parameter Attributes (Attribute):
            designates the necessary attributes associated to each
            Parameter exchanged in order to agree on the EHC Strategy
            Configuration Parameter.  This document considers two type
            of attributes: the Range Attribute that indicates a range
            for a given Parameter, and the Value Attribute that
            indicates a fixed value associated to a Parameter.

      - Range Attribute:   the payload that indicates a supported range
            of values on an specific EHC Strategy Configuration
            Parameter.  In this document, all Parameters are associated
            a specific Range Attribute.

      - Value Attribute:  the payload that indicates a value of an
            specific EHC Strategy Configuration Parameter.  In this
            document, all Parameters are associated a specific Value
            Payload.

3.  Introduction

   ESP Header Compression (EHC) [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp] reduces the
   ESP overhead by compressing ESP fields.  Compression results from a
   coordination of various EHC Rules performed by the EHC Strategy.  The
   EHC Strategy may require to be configured with some configuration
   parameters designated as EHC Strategy Configuration Parameter (or
   simply Parameter).

   When a Security Association (SA) is enabling EHC the two peers needs
   to agree which EHC Strategy strategy is applied as well as its
   associated configuration parameters.

   This document describes an extension of IKEv2 that enables two peers
   to agree on a specific EHC Strategy as well as its associated
   Parameters.

4.  Protocol Overview

   EHC Strategies are configured on a per-SA basis and need to be agreed
   between the two peers.  An EHC Strategy is agreed when peers have
   agreed on the EHC Strategy as well as its associated Parameters.

   For example, [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp] defines an EHC Strategy
   called as Diet-ESP which requires the following Parameters to be set:
   udplite_coverage, tcp_lsb, tcp_options, tcp_urgent, esp_sn_lsb,
   esp_spi_lsb, esp_align.

   The negotiation of the EHC Strategy as well as its Parameters is
   performed via the EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload exchange.

   When the initiator is willing to negotiate an EHC Strategy for a
   given SA, it sends a single EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload in
   its IKE_AUTH and CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.  This Notify Payload
   indicates the support to negotiate EHC Strategies.  In addition, the
   Notify Payload MAY indicates with a Range Attribute, the supported
   values for each Parameter, including the Designated EHC Strategy.  If
   the initiator does not have any restriction regarding a specific
   Parameter, there is no need to provide an Range Value associated to
   that Parameter.

   Currently, the only defined EHC Strategy is Diet-ESP, and the
   EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload indicates the support for Diet-
   ESP unless Diet-ESP is explicitly excluded by the Range Attribute.
   In the future, when other EHC Strategies will be defined, the support
   of that new Designated EHC Strategy will need to be explicitly
   announced with its associated Range Attribute.  Other Parameters MAY
   also have their own associated Range Attribute.  Note that if
   multiple EHC Strategies that share a given Parameter, the Range
   Attribute is applied for all designated EHC Strategies.  In other
   words, it is not possible to have a given Parameter associated with
   different values depending on the EHC Strategy.

   Upon receiving the IKE_AUTH and CREATE_CHILD_SA with a
   EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload, a receiver that does not
   support this extension or that is not willing to activate EHC ignores
   the Notify Payload and the negotiation continues as a standard ESP
   negotiation.  If the responder supports EHC Strategy negotiation and
   chooses to apply a supported EHC Strategy to the negotiated SA, it
   reads all Range Attributes and selects a Designated EHC Strategy as
   well as specific values for each Parameter associated to the
   Designated EHC Strategy.  The responder enables EHC for the
   negotiated SA and responds with an EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify
   Payload which indicates the selected Parameters' values using Value
   Attributes.  The responder MAY send a Value Attribute that

Internet-Draft                  ESP IKEv2                   October 2017


   corresponds to all selected Parameters.  On the other hand, the
   responder MAY also send only the Value Attribute of Parameters whose
   value differs from the default value.  In fact each EHC Strategy
   defines default values for each Parameters.

   In some cases, the supported values provided by the initiator may not
   match those of the responder, and so EHC cannot be activated.  The
   responder may want to indicate the supported range provided by the
   initiator were not acceptable by responding with a
   EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER.  The initiator MAY carry Range
   Attributes in order to indicates what it supports.

   Upon receiving a EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload back, the
   initiator reads the Value Attributes and checks the Parameters match
   the supported range.  The initiator may configure the EHC Strategy
   with the provided parameters or abort the negotiation with a Delete
   Payload as specified in section 3.11 of [RFC7296].

   Upon receiving a EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER Notify Payload,
   the initiator may use the regular ESP or delete the SA.  When the SA
   is deleted, the initiator is expected to restart a negotiation
   providing contraints that respect those of the responder.

                             Protocol Overview

5.  Notify Payload

   Figure 1 illustrates the Notify Payload packet format as described in
   section 3.10 of [RFC7296], used for both EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED and
   EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER Notify Payloads.

   Both EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED and EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER
   Notify Payloads are used during the IKE_AUTH and CREATE_CHILD_SA.
   The sender is expected to send only a single payload.  When multiple
   payloads are received, the receiver MAY consider the first one and
   MUST ignore the remaining ones.

   The fields Next Payload, Critical Bit, RESERVED, and Payload Length
   are defined in [RFC7296].  Specific fields defined in this document
   are:

   - Protocol ID (1 octet):  set to zero.

   - SPI Size (1 octet):  set to zero.

   - Notify Message Type (2 octets):  Specifies the type of notification
         message.  It is set to <TBA1 by IANA> for the
         EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED and <TBA2 by IANA>.for
         EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER.

5.1.  EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload

   The EHC_STRATEGY_SUPPORTED Notify Payload indicates the supported EHC
   Strategies.

   When sent by the initiator, it MAY contain Range Attributes (see
   Section 7.1).  A responder not understanding a Range Attribute MUST
   ignore it.  This is intended to ease the negotiation of new EHC
   Strategies with new Parameters.  It is its responsibility to
   understand the Parameters associated to the negotiated EHC Strategy.

   When sent by the responder, it MAY contain Value Attributes (see
   Section 7.2).  An initiator not understanding a Value Payload MUST
   NOT create the SA and SHOULD send a Delete Payload to the responder
   as described in section 3.11 of [RFC7296].

5.2.  EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER Notify Payload

   The EHC_STRATEGY_UNACCEPTABLE_PARAMETER Notify Payload indicates the
   responder supports of EHC Strategy negotiation but was not able to
   configure it due to the constraints provided by the initiator.  The
   responder MAY insert Range Attributes (see Section 7.1) to inform the
   initiator of its supported ranges.

   The responder has configured the SA without enabling the EHC.  Upon
   receiving the Notify Payload, the initiator MAY accept the SA without
   EHC.  It MAY also Delete the SA as described in section 3.11 of
   [RFC7296] and renegotiate the SA, considering the responder's
   supported ranges.

6.  EHC Strategy Configuration Parameters

   This document only considers Diet-ESP, which requires the following
   Parameters to be agreed by the two peers: esp_align, esp_spi_lsb,
   esp_spi_sn, tcp_urgent, tcp_options, tcp_lsb, udplite_coverage.  In
   addition, in order to enable future EHC Strategies, the following
   parameter has been introduce to designate the agreed EHC Strategy:
   ehc_strategy.  Figure 2 lists these Parameters with description and
   associated values.

   In addition, each of these parameter is associated to a default
   value.  The default value is considered unless other values are
   specified by the responder.  The associated default value is
   specified in Figure 2.

7.  EHC Strategy Configuration Parameter Attributes

   For each of these Parameters, the initiator or responder may indicate
   acceptable values of these Parameters.  Such constraints are
   expressed with the Range Attributes.  Each Parameters has its
   corresponding payload which carries the minimum and maximum
   acceptable values associated to the parameters (see Section 7.1).

   Similarly, for each of these Parameters, the responder needs to be
   able to provide the selected value associated to the Parameter.  Each
   of these Parameters' value can be expressed by via the Value
   Attribute.  Each parameter has a corresponding payload which carries
   the associated value (see Section 7.2).

   The Range Attribute and Value Attribute use the format of the
   Transform Attribute of section 3.3.5 of [RFC7296] represented in
   Figure 3.  The fields are described in [RFC7296].

                         Figure 4: Attribute Type

7.1.  Range Attribute

   The Parameter's value of ehc_strategy, esp_align, esp_spi_lsb,
   esp_sn_lsb, tcp_urgent, tcp_options, tcp_lsb and udplite_coverage is
   coded on 1 byte, so the Attribute Data of the Range Attribute is 2
   byte long and the Attribute Length is set to 4.  The first byte
   indicates the minimal acceptable value, while the second byte
   indicates the maximal value.

   Similarly, udplight_coverage is coded on 2 bytes, so the Attribute
   Data of the Range Attribute is 4 byte long, and Attribute Length is
   set to 6.

7.2.  Value Attribute

   The Parameters ehc_strategy, esp_align, esp_spi_lsb, esp_sn_lsb,
   tcp_urgent, tcp_options and tcp_lsb the Attribute Data is codes on 1
   byte, and Attribute Length is set to 3.

   Similarly, udplight_coverage is coded on 2 bytes, so the Attribute
   Data of the Value Attribute is 2 byte long and the Attribute Length
   is set to 4.
