Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008


1.  Introduction

   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] provides an
   identifier mapping mechanism to map E.164 numbers [ITU.E164.2005] to
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986].  One of the primary
   concepts of ENUM is the definition of "Enumservices", which allows
   for providing different URIs for different applications of said
   mapping mechanism.  The registration procedures for "ordinary"
   Enumservices have been specified in "IANA Registration of
   Enumservices: Guide, Template and IANA Considerations"
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   However, the IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered a need for
   IANA registrations of experimental and trial Enumservices
   (X-Enumservices).

   The X-Enumservice registration is intended to allow people to use the
   template for ordinary Enumservices to describe what X-Enumservice
   strings exist in NAPTR Resource Records and to describe how they are
   used, but not (yet) to require a full IETF review and change control.

   This is needed as some trials use URI schemes that are not
   registered, and so cannot be used in "ordinary" Enumservice
   registrations.  Also, until trials have been completed, it may not be
   appropriate to produce an "ordinary" Enumservice registration
   document, as Enumservice syntax details, use and issues of security
   and/or privacy may not have been analyzed fully at that point.

   This document specifies a new IANA registry for X-Enumservices.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   For the purpose of this document, 'Registration Document' and
   'Registration' refer to a specification that defines an X-Enumservice
   and proposes its registration following the procedures outlined
   herein.


3.  Registration Requirements

   The Requirements outlined in Section 3 "Registration Requirements" of
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] also apply to X-Enumservices
   registrations, unless specified differently in this document.

4.  X-Enumservice Creation Cookbook

   The guidelines in Section 4 "Enumservice Creation Cookbook" of
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] also apply to X-Enumservices
   registrations, unless specified differently in this document.


5.  Required Sections and Information

   In addition to the sections required for an RFC as outlined in
   "Instructions to RFC Authors" [I-D.rfc-editor-rfc2223bis], there are
   several sections that MUST appear in an X-Enumservice Registration
   Document.  These sections are specified in Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   A Registration Document for an X-Enumservice is similar to a
   "ordinary" Enumservice registration as described in
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].  The only differences are for the
   "IANA Registration" section, where Section 5.1 of this document
   applies.

   The following terms SHOULD begin with a capital letter, whenever they
   refer to the IANA Registration:
   o  Class
   o  Type
   o  Subtype
   o  URI Scheme

   Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] contains an XML2RFC
   template that can be used to create Internet Drafts and RFCs by means
   described on <http://xml.resource.org/>.  This XML2RFC template
   contains a prototype for most of these sections.

5.1.  IANA Registration

   The field names "Enumservice Class", and "Enumservice Type",
   "Enumservice Subtype" are different in IANA Registrations for
   X-Enumservices, namely the fields are prefixed by "X-" resulting in
   "X-Enumservice Class", "X-Enumservice Type", and "X-Enumservice
   Subtype"


   o  X-Enumservice Class:

      This field contains the Class of the X-Enumservice as defined in
      Section 4.2. of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] and it's value
      MUST be one of those listed in Section 5.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] (without quotes).

Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008



         e.g.
         Protocol-based

   o  X-Enumservice Type:

      The Type of the X-Enumservice.  All Types SHOULD be listed in
      lower-case.  The choice of Type depends on the X-Enumservice
      Class.  Please find further instructions in Section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

      The Type of an X-Enumservice MUST be prefixed with "x-".

         e.g.
         "x-foo"

      Note: Put the Type string between double quotes.

   o  X-Enumservice Subtype:

      The Subtype of the X-Enumservice.  All Subtypes SHOULD be listed
      in lower-case.  The choice of Subtype depends on the X-Enumservice
      Class.  Please find further instructions in Section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

         e.g.
         "bar"

         e.g.
         N/A

      Note: Put the Subtype string between double quotes.

      Note: Many X-Enumservices do not require a Subtype; use "N/A" in
      this case.

      Note: As stated above, where a given X-Enumservice Type has
      multiple Subtypes, there MUST be a separate 'IANA Registration'
      section for each Subtype.

   o  URI Scheme(s):

      The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] Schemes that are
      used with the X-Enumservice.  The selection of URI Schemes often
      depends on the X-Enumservice Class, Type, and/or Subtype.  Please
      find further instructions in Section 4. of
      [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008


      The URI Schemes, which are used with an X-Enumservice do not
      necessarily need to be documented in an IETF document.  If a
      publicly referenceable document is available it MUST be referenced
      in the Registration Document.  In case there is no publicly
      referenceable document, the URI Scheme MUST be sufficiently
      described in the Registration Document.

         e.g.
         'bar', 'sbar'

      Note: Do not put a colon after a URI Scheme and put each URI
      Scheme between single quotes.  If there is more than one URI
      Scheme, use a comma as separator.

      Note: A client cannot choose a specific ENUM record in a record
      set based on the URI Scheme - the selection is only based on
      'Type' and 'Subtype'.

   o  Functional Specification:

      The Functional Specification describes how the X-Enumservice is
      used in connection with the URI to which it resolves.

      This section quite depends on how much publicly available
      documentation about the service already exists.

         e.g.
         This X-Enumservice indicates that the resource identified can
         be addressed by the associated URI in order to foo the bar.
         [...]

      Where the terms used are non-obvious, they should be defined in
      the Registration Document, or a reference to an external document
      containing their definition should be provided.

   o  Security Considerations:

      An internal reference to the 'Security Considerations' section of
      a given Registration Document.

         e.g.
         See Section 10

   o  Intended Usage:

      One of the following values (without quotes):

      *  "EXPERIMENTAL": Indicates that the X-Enumservice is intended
         for experimental use, and that it's scope is not limited to a
         certain environment.

      *  "TRIAL": Indicates that the X-Enumservice is intended for trial
         use, and that it's scope MAY be limited to a participants of a
         trial.

      *  "OBSOLETE": Indicates that the X-Enumservice has been declared
         obsolete (Section 11.5) and is not to be used in new
         deployments.  Applications SHOULD however expect to encounter
         legacy instances of this X-Enumservice.

         e.g.
         EXPERIMENTAL

   o  Registration Document(s):

      A *unique* reference to the X-Enumservice Registration Document.

         e.g.
         [RFC 9999]

         e.g.
         [RFC 7777] (Obsoleted by RFC 8888)
         [RFC 8888] (Updated by RFC 9999)
         [RFC 9999]

         e.g.
         [International Telecommunications Union, "X-Enumservice
         Registration for Foobar", ITU-F Recommendation B.193, Release
         73, Mar 2008.]

   o  Author(s):

      The author(s) of the X-Enumservice Registration.

         e.g.
         John Doe, Jane Dale

      Note: If there is more than one author, use a comma as separator.

      Note: Do not put email addresses to author(s) field of an IANA
      registration.

   o  Further Information:

      Any other information the author(s) deem(s) interesting.

         e.g.
         See Section 3

         e.g.
         N/A

      Note: Use "N/A", if there is no content for this field.


6.  The Process of Registering New X-Enumservices

   The process of registering new X-Enumservices is the same as for
   "ordinary" Enumservices as specified in Section 6 "The Process of
   Registering New Enumservice" of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].


7.  Expert Review

7.1.  Expert Selection Process

   The same (pool of) experts as appointed for "ordinary" Enumservice
   registrations (see Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide])
   is also responsible for X-Enumservice registrations.

7.2.  Review Guidelines

   Generally, the Expert Review process of an Enumservice MUST follow
   the guidelines documented in Section 3.3 of "Guidelines for Writing
   an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC5226].

   Expert review for X-Enumservices is conducted the same way as defined
   for ordinary Enumservice registrations
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].  However, the barriers for
   approval are lower.

   Expert review for X-Enumservices for will include an initial
   evaluation of whether this specification will have issues in
   transferring to an ordinary Enumservice registration (for example, if
   it uses an unregistered URI scheme, or that the security and privacy
   analysis is incomplete at this stage).  It will also indicate whether
   the use of this X-Enumservice will clash with any other
   (X-)Enumservices or cause damage to other compliant ENUM components.

   Expert reviews for X-Enumservices do not normally result in
   rejection, unless its use will cause serious negative impact to ENUM,
   DNS or the Internet.  However, authors SHOULD address issues raised
   during expert review in an update of the Registration Document,

Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008


   before a new X-Enumservice is added to the IANA registry.

   The results of such an expert review MUST be appended to the
   Registration Document and will be recorded along with the
   specification itself.

   The Expert Review process of X-Enumservices SHOULD also regard
   Section 7.2 "Review Guidelines" of
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

7.3.  Appeals

   Appeals against Expert Review decisions follow the normal IETF appeal
   process as described in section 7 of [RFC5226] and section 6.5 of
   [RFC2026].


8.  Revision of Pre-Existing X-Enumservice RFCs

   At this point in time there are no pre-existing X-Enumservice
   Registrations.


9.  Extension of Existing X-Enumservice Registrations

   Extensions of existing X-Enumservice Registrations follow the same
   specifications as for "ordinary" Enumservice registrations, which are
   outlined in Section 9 "Extension of Existing Enumservice
   Registrations" of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].


10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Considerations Regarding this Document

   Since this document does not introduce any technology or protocol,
   there are no security issues to be considered for this document
   itself.

10.2.  X-Enumservice Security Considerations Guideline

   [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] already outlines security considerations
   affecting ENUM as a whole.  X-Enumservice Registration Documents do
   not need and SHOULD NOT repeat considerations already listed there,
   but they SHOULD include a reference to that section.

   ENUM refers to resources using pre-existing URI Schemes and
   protocols.  X-Enumservice Registration Documents do not need and

Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008


   SHOULD NOT repeat security considerations affecting those protocols
   and URI Schemes itself.

   However, in case that the inclusion of those protocols and URI
   Schemes into ENUM specifically introduces new security issues, those
   issues MUST be covered in the 'Security Considerations' section of
   the Registration Document.


11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will insert a new registry "X-Enumservice Registrations"
   according to (this) Section 11, which will complement the registry
   for "ordinary" Enumservice registrations as specified in Section 11
   "IANA Considerations" of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   It is noted that the process described herein applies only to
   X-Enumservice registrations (i.e. the registration process of
   "ordinary" Enumservices is beyond the scope of this document).

11.1.  IANA Registration Template

   The IANA registration template consists of the following fields that
   are specified in Section 5.1:


   o  X-Enumservice Class:

   o  X-Enumservice Type:

   o  X-Enumservice Subtype:

   o  URI Scheme(s):

   o  Functional Specification:

   o  Security Considerations:

   o  Intended Usage:

   o  Registration Document(s):

   o  Author(s):

   o  Further Information:

   Note: In the case where a particular field has no value, 'N/A' (Not
   Applicable) MUST be used.  This case especially may occur where a

Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008


   given Type has no Subtypes, or if there is no "Further Information".

11.2.  Location

   Approved X-Enumservice registrations are published in the IANA
   repository "X-Enumservice Registrations", which is proposed to be
   located at the following URI:
   < http://www.iana.org/assignments/x-enum-services >.

   At this repository only the filled IANA Registration Template as
   listed in Section 11.1 and specified in Section 5.1 is published.

   Where the Registration Document is NOT an RFC, IANA MUST hold an
   escrow copy of that Registration Document.  Said escrow copy will act
   as the master reference for that X-Enumservice Registration.

   In order to help the users, IANA should place HTML links between the
   repositories "Enumservice Registrations" and "X-Enumservice
   Registrations" at appropriate places.

11.3.  Structure

   IANA maintains the X-Enumservice repository sorted in alphabetical
   order.  The first sort field is Type, the second is Subtype.

   Each X-Enumservice starts with a caption, which is composed of Type
   and Subtype, separated by a colon; e.g. if the Type is "foo" and the
   Subtype "bar", the resulting caption is "foo:bar".

11.4.  Registration Procedure

   Whenever a proposal for a new X-Enumservice is submitted, IANA will
   take care of the 'Expert Review' process according to "Guidelines for
   Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC5226].

   Provided that the X-Enumservice has obtained the necessary approval
   of the expert(s), and the Registration Document is published, IANA
   will register the X-Enumservice, i.e. add the X-Enumservice to the
   IANA "X-Enumservice Registrations" registry (see also Section 11.2).

11.5.  Change Control

   For X-Enumservices Registrations published as an RFC, change control
   stays with the IETF via the RFC publication process.

   Change control of X-Enumservices Registrations not published as an
   RFC (i.e. according the process described herein) is done by "Expert
   Review" and "Specification Required" according to [RFC5226].

Internet-Draft     IANA Registration of X-Enumservices          May 2008


   X-Enumservice registrations MUST NOT be deleted.  An X-Enumservice
   that is believed no longer appropriate for use, can be declared
   obsolete by publication of a new X-Enumservices Registrations
   document changing its "Intended Usage" field to "OBSOLETE"; such
   X-Enumservices will be clearly marked in the lists published by IANA.

   Updates of any X-Enumservice Registrations MUST follow the guidelines
   described in this document.

11.6.  Restrictions

   As stated in Section 3.2 "Naming Requirements" of
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide], any identifying tag of any
   Enumservice MUST NOT be set to nor start with "E2U".  Any Enumservice
   registration requests covered by these restrictions MUST be rejected
   by IANA, and the 'Expert Review' process SHOULD NOT be initiated.

   Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] contains examples
   for Enumservice registrations.  Therefore, IANA MUST NOT register an
   Enumservice with Type or Subtype set to "foo", "bar", or "sbar",
   unless the Expert(s) explicitly confirm an exception.
