     Abstract 
      
      This document has been created to raise the question of inter-
      domain measurements and data exchange between ISPs. The goal of 
      this questionnaire is to find out what the main concerns are, 
      and whether and how an inter-domain collaboration would be 
      beneficial for the community.

   1. Introduction 
   
     Internet Service Providers (ISPs) usually monitor their own 
     networks. They are interested in information on resource usage, 
     traffic load, network quality, traffic anomalies for 
     applications like QoS monitoring, fault diagnosis, anomaly or 
     intrusion detection, and troubleshooting.  
      
     Some applications like inter-provider SLA validation, or DDoS 
     detection and prevention, need (or at least can greatly profit 
     from) data measured in more than one administrative domain. 
     Currently, ISPs have minimal or no information at all about the 
     characteristics and performance of networks outside their own 
     administrative domain. 
       
     The question we try to address with this draft is to which 
     extent different ISPs are willing to cooperate in order to 
     provide results they cannot obtain by only monitoring their own 
     network. We try to understand what is currently limiting the 
     inter-domain exchange of measurements, and whether, or to which 
     extent, this is linked with research or technical issues.

  2. Terminology 
      
     Domain  
          A domain is a group of computers and devices on a network 
          that are administered as a unit with common rules and 
          procedures. 
      
     Observation Point  
          An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP 
          packets can be observed.  Examples include: a line to which 
          a probe is attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-
          based LAN, a single port of a router, or a set of 
          interfaces (physical or logical) of a router.  
      
     Inter-domain measurement 
          A measurement involving multiple Observation points that do 
          not belong to the same domain. 
      
     Active measurement 
          An active measurement injects test traffic into the network 
          in order to measure network or path characteristics.  
      
     Passive measurement  
          Passive measurement is based on already existing traffic. 
          It provides information about characteristics of the real 
          current traffic in the observed network. 
      
     Interception 
          Interception means a passive measurement where an ISP looks 
          at characteristics derived from the content of traffic 
          generated by customers. The content is the part of the 
          datagram that is only of interest to the people/systems at 
          the end of the communications. For example, to try to 
          accurately identify peer-to-peer traffic by looking at 
          header-data. 
           
           
           
  3. Questionnaire 
      
     This section contains questions on inter-domain information 
     exchange. They have been grouped with respect to the main area 
     they refer to: measurement, security, privacy, and data 
     anonymisation. 
     The goal of this questionnaire is to collect information on the 
     real needs of inter-domain cooperation and the feelings the ISPs 
     have on the matter. The results should allow researchers to 
     evaluate the feasibility of their approaches and standardization 
     bodies to find out people∆s interest on this topic.
