2. General issues

  The RESCAP working group charter sets out the motivation and goals
  for the RESCAP protocol:

  A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the
  Internet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and
  destinations.  However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or
  characteristics to a given resource identifier and subsequently
  assessing those attributes or characteristics has not been
  specified and deployed.

  A particularly important resolution service of this general type is
  one which, when given a mail address identifying a particular mail
  recipient, will return a series of attributes describing the
  capabilities of that recipient.  This differs from a directory
  service in that no searching or other advanced query operations are
  involved.

  RESCAP consists of two protocol parts:

  o  a general resolution protocol that will translate resource
     identifiers to a list of attributes.

  o  an administrative model and update protocol that can be used to
     set up and maintain the information the resolution protocol
     accesses.

  The service resulting from the combination of these two protocols
  must meet the following goals:

  (0)  The resolution protocol must be highly scalable, as the intent
       is to deploy it very widely.

  (1)  Resolution protocol and server overhead must be very low, as
       some applications will make very heavy use of it.

  (2)  Identifiers input to the resolution service are to be
       formatted as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) containing
       one or more DNS domains.  Note that mail addresses can be
       presented as mailto: URIs to meet this requirement.








Klyne                       Internet draft                    [Page 4]
RESCAP Scenarios                                         9 January 200
<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


  (3)  Facilities to support inheritance within the attribute store
       will be essential, as the number of identifiers may be very
       large.  Specifically, mechanisms are required for
       administrators to set default values for members of their
       administrative domains.

  (4) Existing protocols will be profiled for use as part of this
       service whenever possible rather than developing new
       protocols. In particular:

       (a)  The DNS must be used as the first step in the resolution
            service.  As the URIs under consideration here contain a
            DNS domain name, this provides for effective delegation
            of resolution activities.

       (b)  Existing DNS record types such as SRV and NAPTR will be
            used if feasible, to ease deployment.

       (c)  An existing administrative model and maintenance protocol
            will be used if feasible.  Possible candidates for this
            include ACAP and LDAPv3.  The protocol and security model
            by which a user can update his or her own attributes must
            be covered.  The means to register and extend the set of
            attributes must be specified.


3. Scenarios

  This section summarizes some intended uses for the RESCAP protocol.
  Resource metadata and security threats are simply listed here, with
  more extensive descrptions provided in the following sections.

3.1 Mail user agent capability discovery

  It can be very useful for a mail sender to have some knowledge of a
  receiver's user agent before a message is sent.  This kind of
  information is difficult to discover by any other means, and mail
  users are often forced to resort to ad-hoc out-of-band means to
  learn how to best prepare a message for a given recipient.

  Type of resource:

  o  a mailbox, identified by a 'mailto:' URL [1, 2].

  Type of metadata:

  o  Media feature expression

  o  Security options






Klyne                       Internet draft                    [Page 5]
RESCAP Scenarios                                         9 January 200
<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


  o  MIME handling options

  o  General capabilities and preferences

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access or disclosure

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Data mining

3.2 Resource metadata access

  Web and other data resources may have associated metadata (URCs?).
  A combination of DNS and RESCAP protocols might be used to access
  this resource metadata.

  HTTP might be used instead of RESCAP, but the RESCAP goals suggest
  two possible advantages over HTTP:  lightweight access for small
  items of information that are accessed frequently, and the RESCAP
  administrative model suggests a possibility for easier
  administration of metadata for metadata about a family of related
  resources.

  Following this line, RESCAP may find a role in efficient URN
  resolution (using DNS NAPTR and related records [22] to locate a
  suitable RESCAP server).

  Type of resource:

  o  Web and ftp data

  o  [[[Others?]]]

  Type of metadata:

  o  Resource URLs

  o  Media feature expressions

  [[[List other kinds of metadata returned]]]

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Firewall configuration disclosure





Klyne                       Internet draft                    [Page 6]
RESCAP Scenarios                                         9 January 200
<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


3.3 Resource replica locations

  Popular web and FTP resources are often replicated on different
  servers for fault tolerance and load sharing.  Given a URL for one
  copy of a resource, RESCAP might be used to find another copy.

  [[[NOTE:  DNS NAPTR, etc., might be better used for this purpose]]]

  Type of resource:

  o  Anything with a URL or URI.

  Type of metadata:

  o  Resource location information

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Firewall configuration disclosure

3.4 Alternative or associated URLs

  A network resource may have associated or alternative URLs.  For
  example, to access the resource using a different protocol, to
  access different versions of a resource or to access associated
  information about a resource.

  Type of resource:

  o  Anything with a URL or URI.

  Type of metadata:

  o  Resource location information

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Firewall configuration disclosure









Klyne                       Internet draft                    [Page 7]
RESCAP Scenarios                                         9 January 200
<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


3.5 Capabilities at a telephone number

  Convergence between the Internet and telephone networks is leading
  to resources and endpoints accessed from the Internet being
  identified by telephone numbers.  A simple telephone number does
  little to indicate the kinds of service available at that endpoint,
  or the protocols that may be used to access the facilities
  provided.

  In some cases, communication with an endpoint identified by a
  telephone number may take place entirely over the Internet, in
  which case it is necessay to know which Internet protocols should
  be employed (e.g. H.323, SIP, Internet fax, VPIM, etc.).

  Type of resource:

  o  Communication service endpoints tradtionally associated with the
     telephone network:  voice, voice messaging, fax, etc.

  Type of metadata:

  o  Media feature expression

  o  Security options

  o  MIME handling options

  o  General capabilities and preferences

  o  [[[Access billing information???]]]

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access or disclosure

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Data mining

  o  Traffic analysis

3.6 Public key distribution

  To conduct secure communications with a given endpoint, a suitable
  public key for that endpoint may be needed.  RESCAP could be one
  useful way to publish public key information.

  Type of resource:

  o  Any communication endpoint





Klyne                       Internet draft                    [Page 8]
RESCAP Scenarios                                         9 January 200
<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


  Type of metadata:

  o  Security options

  Security threats:

  o  The usual issues associated with public key distribution.

3.7 Recognized certification authorities

  In the absence of an X.509 style global root for authorizing public
  keys, one of the challenges to securing communication with public
  key cryptography is to find a certification authority (CA) that is
  directly or indirectly trusted by both parties.

  Having each party publish details of the CAs that it recognizes may
  help in establishing a chain of trust between the communicating
  parties.

  Type of resource:

  o  Any communication endpoint

  Type of metadata:

  o  X.509 Certification Authorities

  [[[What is PGP equivalent?]]]

  Security threats:

  o  The usual issues associated with public key distribution.

  o  Exposure of potentially weak security

3.8 Internet fax capabilities

  Internet fax uses e-mail protocols to emulate a fax-like service
  within the Internet e-mail environment.  One problem with this is
  that the endpoint identification and capability exchange associated
  with traditional facsimile is not provided by the e-mail protocols.
  RESCAP may provide an alternatuve way to access such information,
  particularly with respect to receiver capabilities.

  Even if the proposed content negotiation framework is deployed,
  using RESCAP to obtain capability information cam optimize the
  process by reducing the number of occasions on which additional
  message round trips will be needed.

<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


  Type of resource:

  o  a mailbox, identified by a 'mailto:' URL [1, 2].

  Type of metadata:

  o  Level of Internet fax support (e.g. "simple", "extended", "full",
     "none").

  o  Media feature expression

  o  Security options

  o  MIME handling options

  o  General capabilities and preferences

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access or disclosure

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Data mining

3.9 VPIM voice messagiong capabilities

  VPIM uses e-mail protocols to transfer voice messages within the
  Internet e-mail environment.  RESCAP may provide a way to access
  vital information about VPIM receiver caabilities.

  Type of resource:

  o  a mailbox, identified by a 'mailto:' URL [1, 2].

  Type of metadata:

  o  Level of VPIM support (e.g. "V2", "IVM", support for message
     privacy options such as "do not forward").

  o  Media feature expression (especially for indicating supported
     audio codecs).

  o  Security options

  o  MIME handling options

  o  General capabilities and preferences







Klyne                       Internet draft                   [Page 10]
RESCAP Scenarios                                         9 January 200
<draft-ietf-rescap-scenarios-01.txt>


  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access or disclosure

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Data mining

3.10 IPP printer capabilities

  IPP uses a protocol modeled on HTTP to transfer print images for
  remote printing, and to control the print process.

  Although IPP allows printer capabilities to be interrogated, RESCAP
  might be used as a more efficient way to find such information,
  particularly in a phase of printer discovery.

  Type of resource:

  o  IPP printer, identified by an 'ipp:' URL (String)

  Type of metadata:

  o  IPP capability informaton

  o  Other resource metadata

  Security threats:

  o  Unauthorized access

  o  Response spoofing

  o  Firewall configuration disclosure

3.11 Presence protocol supplementary information

  There has been much discussion both within and outside the IMPP
  working group about the use of a presence protocol to distribute
  capability information.  A problem is that it cxan be difficult to
  know how far it is reasonable to go in adding supplementary
  information to what should be a very lightweight indication of
  "available/not-available" presence informaton.

  One way to address this problem is to restrict the presence
  information to genuine dynamic status information, and to use
  RESCAP to access any (less dynamic) supplementary information about
  a contact point described by presence information.

5. RESCAP security threats

  In considering security for RESCAP, note that the general
  presumtpion is that the information being provided is public.  But
  completely unrestricted access may be inappropriate because that
  would create an exposure to privacy invasion through data mining
  activities.  Also, there may be requirements to disclose some
  information only within a closed community.

  [[[The rest of this section has yet to be fleshed out]]]

5.1 Unauthorized access or disclosure

  Access controls

5.2 Response spoofing

5.3 Traffic analysis

5.4 Data mining (privacy)

5.5 Firewall configuration disclosure

5.6 Denial of service


6. Security considerations

  [[[Additional points?]]]

6.1 Authentication

  Note that there are a number of diferent authentication cases to be
  considered:

  o  Server to client

  o  Client to server

  o  Request to server

  o  Response to client


7. Acknowledgements

  The initial list of scenarios was largely culled from an informal
  meeting of RESCAP working group participants, and from Paul
  Hoffman's RESCAP profile for mail user agents.
