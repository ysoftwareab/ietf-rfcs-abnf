Abstract

   The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
   supporting multiple types of authentication methods.  In the most
   common deployment scenario, an EAP peer and server authenticate each
   other through an authenticator; the server sends one of the master
   session keys to the authenticator so that the peer and the
   authenticator can establish a security association for per-packet
   access enforcement.  It is desirable to not repeat the entire process
   of authentication when the peer moves to another authenticator.  This

1.  Introduction

   The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
   for transport of methods that authenticate two parties; the
   authentication is either one-way or mutual.  The primary purpose is
   network access control, and a key generating method is recommended to
   enforce access control: The EAP keying hierarchy defines two keys
   that are derived at the top level - the master session key (MSK) and
   the extended MSK (EMSK).  In the most common deployment scenario, an
   EAP peer and server authenticate each other through a third party
   known as the authenticator.  The authenticator or an entity
   controlled by the authenticator enforces access control.  After
   successful authentication, the server transports the MSK to the
   authenticator; the authenticator and the peer derive transient
   session keys (TSK) using the MSK as the authentication key or a key
   derivation key and use the TSK for per-packet access enforcement.
   EMSK usage is defined in [1].  Its primary purpose is to derive usage
   specific root keys (USRKs).  Among the proposed use cases for USRKs
   is efficient Re-authentication between the peer and the server
   through a different authenticator.

   When a peer moves from one authenticator to another, it is desirable
   to avoid full EAP authentication.  The full EAP exchange with another
   run of the EAP method takes several round trips and significant time
   to complete, causing delays in handoff times.  Some methods specify
   the use of state from the initial authentication to optimize Re-
   authentications by reducing the computational overhead, but method-
   specific Re-authentication takes at least 2 roundtrips in most cases
   (e.g., [6]).  It is also important to note that most methods do not
   offer support for Re-authentication.  Thus, it is beneficial to have
   efficient Re-authentication support in EAP rather than in individual
   methods.

   One of the EAP lower layers, IEEE 802.11, provides a mechanism for
   efficient Re-authentication in a limited setting, by introducing a
   two-level key hierarchy.  The EAP authenticator is collocated with
   what is known as an R0 Key Holder (R0-KH); it receives the MSK from
   the EAP server as usual.  A pairwise master key (PMK-R0) is derived
   from the second half (last 32 octets) of the MSK.  Subsequently, the
   R0-KH derives an R1-PMK to be handed out to the attachment point of
   the peer.  When the peer moves from one R1-KH to another, a new
   PMK-R1 is generated by the R0-KH and handed out to the new R1-KH.
   The transport protocol used between the R0-KH and the R1-KH is not
   specified at the moment.

   In some cases, a mobile may seldom move beyond the domain of the
   R0-KH (the Extended Service Set, ESS in 802.11) and this model works
   well.  A full EAP authentication is repeated when the PMK-R0 expires.



Narayanan & Dondeti      Expires April 22, 2007                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   However, in general cases mobiles may roam beyond the domain of R0-
   KHs (or EAP authenticators), and the latency of full EAP
   authentication remains an issue.

   Furthermore, in the 802.11r architecture, the R0-KH may actually be
   located close to the edge, thereby creating a vulnerability: If the
   R0-KH is compromised, all PMK-R1s derived from the corresponding PMK-
   R0s will also be compromised.

   Another consideration is that there needs to be a key transfer
   protocol between the R0-KH and the R1-KH: in other words, there is
   either a star configuration of security associations between each key
   holder and a centralized entity that serves as the R0-KH, or if the
   first authenticator is the default R0-KH, there will be a full-mesh
   of security associations between all authenticators.  Neither option
   is desirable.

   In other lower layers, key sharing across authenticators is sometimes
   used as a practical solution to lower handoff times.  In that case,
   compromise of any authenticator results in compromise of several more
   EAP sessions than for instance in case of 802.11r based systems.

   In conclusion, there is a need to design an efficient EAP Re-
   authentication mechanism that allows a fresh key to be established
   between the peer and an authenticator without having to execute the
   EAP method again.  The EAP Re-authentication problems statement is
   described in detail elsewhere [7].

   This document provides a means of performing EAP Efficient Re-
   authentication.  EAP-ER is a protocol that supports EAP method
   independent Re-authentication for a peer that has valid, unexpired
   key material from a previously performed EAP authentication.  The
   protocol and the key hierarchy required for EAP-ER is described in
   this document.

   addition, this document uses the following terms:

      rRK - Re-authentication root Key, derived from the EMSK

      rIK - Re-authentication Integrity Key, derived from the rRK.

      rMSK - Re-authentication MSK.  This is a per-authenticator key,
      derived from the rRK.


3.  EAP-ER Overview

   The first time the peer attaches to an authenticator, it performs a
   full EAP exchange with the EAP server; as a result an MSK is
   distributed to the authenticator.  The MSK is then used by the
   authenticator and the peer to generate TSKs as needed.  At the time
   of the initial EAP exchange, the peer and the server also derive an
   EMSK.  From the EMSK, a Re-authentication Root Key (rRK) is derived.
   The rRK is only available to the peer and server and is never handed
   out to any other entity.  Further, a Re-authentication Integrity Key
   (rIK) is derived from the rRK; the peer uses the rIK to provide proof
   of possession while performing an EAP-ER exchange at a later time.
   The rIK is also never handed out to any entity and is only available
   to the peer and server.

   At the time of the first EAP exchange, the peer may obtain a
   server-id (either from the EAP method or via an out-of-band mechanism
   from the server) for use in a subsequent exchange.  The EAP-ER
   protocol supports explicit bootstrapping using which a server ID can
   be obtained by the peer at the end of a successful full EAP exchange.
   Alternatively, the peer may simply use a key name to identify the
   full EAP session.  Particularly, when the EAP state is duplicated
   among the different backend entities, a server ID is not required.
   The server caches the rRK and rIK for the peer, along with a key
   name.

   When the peer subsequently identifies a target authenticator that
   supports EAP-ER, it performs an EAP-ER exchange; the exchange itself
   may happen when the peer attaches to a new authenticator supporting
   EAP-ER, or prior to attachment.  The peer may initiate the EAP-ER
   exchange by itself, or in response to an EAP Request Identity from
   the new authenticator.

   EAP-ER introduces two new messages: the peer sends an EAP Re-auth
   Initiate message; it includes peer-id and the server-id and/or a
   temporary NAI based on the rIK name, and a sequence number for replay
   protection.  The EAP Re-auth Initiate message is integrity protected
   with the rIK.  The authenticator routes this message to the server
   indicated by the server-id.  If the server-id is not present, the
   message may be routed based on the peer-id or the temporary NAI or



Narayanan & Dondeti      Expires April 22, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   both.  The server uses the peer-id and/or the rIK name to lookup the
   rIK.  If a server-id is present, the Authenticator MUST use that
   identity in the AAA message so that AAA proxies route the message to
   the correct server.  If the server-id is not present, the
   Authenticator uses NAI-based routing.  The server, after verifying
   proof of possession of the rIK, and freshness of the message, derives
   a Re-authentication MSK (rMSK) from the rRK, using the sequence
   number and the peer-id as additional inputs.

   In response to the EAP Re-auth Initiate message, the server sends an
   EAP Re-auth Finish message; this message is integrity protected with
   the rIK.  The server transports the rMSK along with this message to
   the authenticator.  The rMSK is transported in a manner similar to
   the MSK transport along with the EAP Success message in a full EAP
   exchange.

   The peer verifies the replay protection and the origin of the
   message.  It then uses the sequence number in the EAP Re-auth Finish
   message, and other parameters (locally available to the peer and
   hence not transported) to compute the rMSK.  The lower layer TSK
   generation mechanism is ready to be triggered after this point.


4.  Design Goals

   The following are the design goals for the Re-authentication
   protocol.

   o  The protocol must be independent of the lower layer used to carry
      EAP.

   o  The protocol must be EAP method independent.

   o  The protocol must satisfy the AAA key management requirements
      specified in [8].

   o  The protocol should employ a simple and extensible key hierarchy.

   o  The protocol should not interfere with the currently defined fast
      transition mechanisms in IEEE 802.11r.

   o  The protocol should be compatible with AAA protocols (RADIUS and
      Diameter).

   o  The protocol should involve no more than one roundtrip to the EAP
      or AAA server.

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   o  The protocol must not preclude the use of the CAPWAP protocol.

   o  It must be feasible to execute this protocol between a peer and a
      target authenticator via a current authenticator, on lower layers
      that allow it.


5.  EAP-ER Key Hierarchy

   We define a key hierarchy for EAP-ER, rooted at the EMSK, and derived
   as a result of a full EAP exchange.  This document derives a Usage
   Specifc Root Key (USRK) in accordance with [1] for EAP-ER.  The USRK
   designated for Re-authentication is the Re-authentication root key
   (rRK).

   The rRK is used to derive a rIK and one or more rMSKs.  The rRK and
   rIK have the same lifetime as the EMSK.  The figure below shows the
   EMSK key hierarchy with the rRK, rIK and rMSKs.

5.1.  Key Derivation

5.1.1.  rRK Derivation and Properties

   The rRK is derived from the EMSK using the prf+ operation defined in
   RFC4306 [4] as follows.

   rRK = prf+ (K, S), where,

      K = EMSK and

      S = rRK Label

   The rRK Label is an IANA-assigned ASCII string "EAP Re-authentication
   Root Key" assigned from the USRK Key Label name space in accordance

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   with [1].  This document specifies IANA registration for the rRK
   label above.

   The PRF used MAY be the same as that used by the EAP method - using
   the PRF from the EAP method provides algorithm agility.  Otherwise,
   the default PRF used is HMAC-SHA-256.

   Along with the rRK, a unique rRK name is derived to identify the rRK.

   The rRK name is derived as follows.

   rRK_name = NDF-64( EAP Session-ID, rRK Label )

   where NDF-64 is the first 64 bits from the output of the name
   derivation function (NDF).  The NDF is a hash function, also
   indicated in the EAP Re-auth message.  When it is not explicitly
   specified, SHA-256 is the NDF.  The EAP Session-ID is the session-id
   of the full EAP exchange used to derive the EMSK used to derive the
   rRK.

   The rRK has the following properties.

   o  The length of the rRK MUST at least be equal to the length of the
      MSK derived by the corresponding EAP session.

   o  The rRK is to be used only as a root key for Re-authentication and
      never used to directly protect any data.

   o  The rRK is only used for derivation of rIK and rMSK as specified
      in this document.

   o  The rRK must remain on the peer and the server and MUST NOT be
      transported to any other entity.

   o  The rRK is cryptographically separate from any other USRK derived
      from the EMSK.

   o  The lifetime of the rRK is the same as that of the EMSK.  The rRK
      is expired when the EMSK expires and removed from use at that
      time.

5.1.2.  rIK Derivation and properties

   The Re-authentication Integrity Key (rIK) is used for integrity
   protecting the EAP-ER exchange.  This serves as the proof of
   possession of valid keying material from a previous full EAP exchange
   by the peer to the server.

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   The rIK is derived from the rRK as follows.

   rIK = prf+ (rRK, "Re-authentication Integrity Key")

   The PRF used MAY be the same as that used by the EAP method - using
   the PRF from the EAP method provides algorithm agility.  Otherwise,
   the default PRF used is HMAC-SHA-256.

   The rIK name is derived as follows.

   rIK_name = prf-64 (rRK, "rIK Name")

   where prf-64 is the first 64 bits from the output of the PRF.  The
   PRF is the same as that used in the derivation of the rIK.  The
   default PRF is HMAC-SHA-256.

   Unlike the rRK_name, the EAP session ID is not used to derive the
   rIK_name.  This is done in order to avoid any collisions with USRK
   names.  The key label used for USRKs is IANA registered, while the
   string "rIK Name" is not.  Given that a key is involved in the
   derivation, we use a PRF in place of the NDF, a hash.

   The rIK has the following properties.

   o  The length of the rIK depends on the MAC algorithm used in
      protecting the EAP-ER exchange.  The MAC algorithm used may be
      specified in the EAP ER message sent by the peer.  The default MAC
      algorithm is HMAC-SHA-256.

   o  The rIK is only used for authentication of the EAP-ER exchange as
      specified in this document.

   o  The rIK MUST NOT be used to derive any other keys.

   o  The rIK must remain on the peer and the server and MUST NOT be
      transported to any other entity.

   o  The rIK is cryptographically separate from any other keys derived
      from the rRK.

   o  The lifetime of the rIK is the same as that of the EMSK.  The rIK
      is expired when the EMSK expires and removed from use at that
      time.

5.1.3.  rMSK Derivation and Properties

   The rMSK is derived at the peer and server and delivered to the
   authenticator.  The rMSK is derived following an EAP-ER protocol
   exchange.

   The rMSK is derived from the rRK as follows.

   rMSK = prf+ (rRK, SEQ), where

   The SEQ is the sequence number sent by the peer in the EAP Re-auth
   Initiate message.

   The PRF may be specified in the EAP Re-auth message.  The default PRF
   used is HMAC-SHA-256.

   The rMSK name is derived as follows.

   rMSK_name = prf-64 (rRK, "rMSK Name")

   where prf-64 is the first 64 bits from the output of the PRF.  The
   PRF may be specified in the EAP Re-auth message.  The default PRF
   used is HMAC-SHA-256.

   For the same reasons as in rIK_name, the rMSK name is also not
   derived from the EAP Session ID.

   The rMSK has the following properties:

   o  The length of the rMSK MUST be the same as that of the MSK derived
      earlier in the EAP session at the time of the full EAP exchange.
      This is done so that lower layers can employ the secure
      association protocol with the rMSK as they do with the MSK.

   o  The rMSK is delivered to the authenticator and is used for the
      same purposes that an MSK is used at an authenticator.

   o  The rMSK is cryptographically separate from any other keys derived
      from the rRK.

   o  The lifetime of the rMSK is less than or equal to that of the rRK.
      It MUST NOT be greater than the lifetime of the rRK.

   o  If a new rRK is derived, subsequent rMSKs must be derived from the
      new rRK.  Previously delivered rMSKs may still be used until the
      expiry of the lifetime.

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   o  A given rMSK MUST NOT be shared by multiple authenticators.


6.  Protocol Description

   The EAP-ER protocol results in a key shared between an EAP peer and a
   new/target EAP authenticator based on an EAP exchange between the EAP
   peer and the EAP server that occurred via a previous authenticator.
   Essentially, this protocol allows key material based on an earlier
   authentication to be delivered to a new authenticator without another
   execution of an EAP method.  Further, this protocol finishes in a
   single roundtrip from the EAP peer to the server and satisfies the
   guidance for AAA key management of [8].  Next, it is independent of
   the lower layer, and EAP methods.  Finally, it is feasible to execute
   this protocol between a peer and a target authenticator via a current
   authenticator, on lower layers that allow it.

6.1.  EAP ER Bootstrapping

   The first time the peer attaches to an authenticator, it performs a
   full EAP exchange, which results in the MSK being distributed to the
   authenticator.  The MSK is then used by the authenticator for the
   same purpose as defined by specific lower layers.  At the time of the
   initial EAP exchange, the peer and the server also derive an EMSK.
   Next, the peer and the server derive the rRK and the rIK as soon as
   the EMSK is available with the anticipation that EAP-ER may be used
   by the peer if it plans to move to a new authenticator.  The rIK name
   is also derived to serve as the index to the rIK to process EAP-ER
   messages.

   We identify two types of bootstrapping for EAP-ER: explicit and
   implicit bootstrapping.  There are at least two scenarios to consider
   for Re-authentication.  When the Re-auth messages are routed to the
   target domain, they may or may not be routed to the server that holds
   the rRK and the rIK.  This is not an issue when there is a single EAP
   server in the domain or when the EAP state is synchronized across all
   servers in the domain.  In that case, the EAP peer does not need to
   know the identity of the server that holds the Re-authentication
   keys.  There is also the case of the peer knowing the server id
   through other means, say via the EAP method or through out of band
   mechanisms.  In those cases, EAP-ER bootstrapping is implicit.  The
   peer initiates an EAP-ER exchange only when it moves from one
   authenticator to another.

   The peer may initiate an explicit EAP-ER bootstrapping exchange if
   the server id is not available or if it is not known that the server
   id is valid or when it is not known that the EAP server state is
   synchronized.  In this case, the peer initiates the EAP Re-auth

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   exchange, with the bootstrapping flag turned on, immediately after
   the full EAP authentication finishes.  The following steps summarize
   the process:

   o  The peer sends the EAP Re-auth Initiate message with the
      bootstrapping flag turned on.  It is recommended that the
      authenticator hold on to the state (e.g., called station id in
      RADIUS) that allows all messages of a full EAP conversation to be
      routed to the same server.  The EAP Re-auth Initiate message
      contains one or more TLVs containing identification information to
      assist the authenticator further in routing the message to the
      appropriate server -- in this case to the server that holds the
      EMSK, rRK and rIK.

      *  It is mandatory to send the rIKname either by itself, or as
         part of an NAI.  The authenticator may use the NAI to route the
         EAP Re-auth Bootstrap Initiate message.

      *  When the rIKname is not in the form of an NAI, the peer-id may
         be included.  The peer-id may be in the form of a pseudonym for
         identity privacy.

   o  In addition to the identities, the message contains a sequence
      number for replay protection, a crypto-suite, and an integrity
      checksum.  The crypto-suite indicates the PRF and the
      authentication algorithm.  The integrity checksum indicates that
      the message originated at the claimed entity, the peer indicated
      by the peer-id, or the rIK holder.

   o  When an EAP-ER capable authenticator receives EAP Re-auth Initiate
      message from a peer, it looks for local EAP forwarding state
      corresponding to the peer's lower layer address and forwards the
      message accordingly.  This forwarding is similar to that of
      messages of an EAP conversation.  It is RECOMMENDED that an EAP-ER
      capable authenticator store that forwarding information for a
      finite amount of time after the EAP Success message has been sent
      to the peer.

      *  In the absence of forwarding state, the authenticator parses
         the message for the server-id.  If that is present, the message
         is forwarded via AAA to that server.

      *  If a server-id is not present, the authenticator parses the EAP
         Re-auth Initiate message to locate the rIKname, and if the
         rIKname is in the NAI form, uses that domain name to forward
         the message.

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


      *  Otherwise, it finds the peer-id and uses the realm portion of
         the peer-id to route the EAP message to the appropriate server.

   o  Upon receipt of an EAP Re-auth Initiate message, the server
      verifies the origin authentication of the message by looking up
      the rIK.  Next, it verifies whether the message is fresh or a
      replay by evaluating whether the received sequence number is equal
      to or greater than the expected sequence number for that rIK.  If
      any of the checks fail, the server send an EAP Re-auth Finish
      message with the relevant error value.  This error MUST NOT have
      any correlation on any EAP Success message that may have been
      received by the authenticator and the peer earlier.  If the
      message is well-formed and valid, the EAP server prepares the EAP
      Re-auth Finish message.  The bootstrap flag is set to indicate
      that this is a bootstrapping exchange and an rMSK is not derived.
      The message contains the following fields:

      *  one or more server identities so that the peer can reach an EAP
         server for Re-authentication through authenticators other than
         the initial authenticator.  It is plausible that no server-id
         TLVs exist in the EAP Re-auth Finish message.  In that case, it
         is assumed that server side state is replicated in all the EAP
         servers in the corresponding domain.

      *  A sequence number for replay protection.

      *  The rIKname so that the peer can correctly identify the rIK to
         verify the integrity and origin authentication of the Finish
         message.

      *  An authentication tag to prove that the EAP Re-auth Finish
         message originates at a server that possesses the relevant rIK.

      *  In the bootstrapping case, the server MUST NOT send an MSK
         along with the EAP Re-auth Finish message.

6.2.  EAP ER protocol

   When a peer that has an active rRK and rIK identifies a new/target
   authenticator that supports EAP-ER, it may perform an EAP-ER exchange
   either in advance or when it attaches to the new authenticator
   supporting EAP-ER.  EAP-ER is typically a peer-initiated exchange,
   consisting of an EAP Re-auth Initiate and an EAP Re-auth Finish
   message.

   It is plausible for the network to trigger the EAP Re-authentication
   process however.  When an EAP-ER capable authenticator sends an EAP
   Request Identity the peer may in response initiate the EAP Re-

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


   authentication exchange.

   Notes on authenticator state machine:

   The authenticator state machine needs to be modified to consider the
   EAP Re-authentication exchange as a "response" to the EAP Request
   Identity and transfer the state machine to follow the EAP Re-
   authentication exchange and determine Success or Failure of the
   exchange based on whether the EAP Re-auth Finish message is a Success
   or Failure.  The authenticator MUST consider that it has received a
   response to the EAP Request Identity and cancel the corresponding
   retransmission timer.

   Notes on Operational Considerations at the Peer:

   EAP-ER requires that the peer maintain retransmission timers for
   reliable transport of EAP Re-authentication messages.  The
   reliability considerations of Section 4.3 of RFC 3748 apply with the
   peer as the retransmitting entity.

   The EAP-ER protocol has the following steps:

      The peer sends an EAP Re-auth Initiate message including one or
      more identity TLVs: the rIKname, and optionally the peer-id and/or
      the server-id; also included are the peer's rIK sequence number,
      and a crypto-suite indicating the cryptographic algorithms used.
      The message is integrity protected with the rIK.

      The authenticator routes the EAP Re-auth Initiate message to the
      server indicated by the server-id.  If the server-id is not
      present, the peer-id MUST be used to route the message if that is
      present.  If neither the server-id nor the peer-id are present,
      the rIKname MUST be in the form of an NAI and that is used to
      forward the message via AAA.

      The server uses the rIKname to lookup the rIK.  It first verifies
      whether the sequence number is equal to or greater than the
      expected sequence number.  The server then proceeds to verify the
      integrity of the message using the rIK, thereby verifying proof of
      possession of that key by the peer.  If the verifications fail,
      the server sends a EAP Re-auth Finish message with a Failure
      indication.  Otherwise, it computes an rMSK from the rRK using the
      sequence number as the additional input to the key derivation.

      The server then sends an EAP Re-auth Finish message containing the
      rIK sequence number and the rIK name.  The sequence number MUST be
      same as the received sequence number.  The local copy of the
      sequence number is incremented by 1.  The EAP Re-auth Finish



Narayanan & Dondeti      Expires April 22, 2007                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


      message is also integrity protected with the rIK.  The server may
      include the server-id with this message.

      The server transports the rMSK along with this message to the
      authenticator.  The rMSK is transported in a manner similar to the
      MSK transport along with the EAP Success message in a regular EAP
      exchange.

      The peer looks up the sequence number to verify whether it is
      expecting a EAP Re-auth Finish message with that sequence number.
      It then looks up the rIK name and verifies the integrity of the
      message.  This also verifies the proof of possession of the rIK at
      the server.  If the verifications fail, the peer logs an error and
      stops the process; otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.

      The peer uses the sequence number to compute the rMSK.

      The lower layer secure association protocol can be triggered at
      this point.

6.3.  New EAP Messages

   Two new EAP messages are defined for the purpose of EAP-ER: EAP Re-
   auth Initiate and EAP Re-auth Finish.  The packet format for these
   messages follows the EAP packet format defined in RFC3748 [3].

         The Identifier field is one octet.  The Identifier field MUST
         be the same if a Re-auth Initiate packet is retransmitted due
         to a timeout while waiting for a Finish message.  Any new (non-
         retransmission) Initiate message MUST use a new Identifier
         field.

         The Identifier field of the Re-auth Finish message MUST match
         that of the currently outstanding Re-auth Initiate message.  A
         Peer or Authenticator receiving a Re-auth Finish message whose
         Identifier value does not match that of the currently
         outstanding Re-auth Initiate message MUST silently discard the
         packet.

         In order to avoid confusion between new EAP Re-auth Initiate
         messages and retransmissions, the peer must choose a an
         Identifier value that is different from the previous Initiate
         message, especially if that exchange has not finished.  It is
         RECOMMENDED that the authenticator clear EAP Re-auth state
         after 300 seconds.

      Type

         This field indicates the Type of EAP Re-authentication packet
         and is one octet in size.  A single Type MUST be specified for
         each EAP Re-authentication packet.  Two types are defined in
         this document - Initiate and Finish.

      Type-Data

         The Type-Data field varies with the Type of Re-authentication
         packet.

   The EAP Re-authentication response packet contains the parameters

      Flags: The rightmost bit is used as the bootstrapping flag.  If
      the flag is turned on, the message is a bootstrap message.  All
      other bits are set to zero on transmission and ignored on
      reception.

      SEQ: A 16-bit sequence number is used for replay protection.  The
      SEQ number field is initialized to zero.

      TVs or TLVs: In the TV payloads, there is a 1-octet type payload
      and a value with type-specific length.  In the TLV payloads, there
      is a 1-octet type payload and a 1-octet length payload.  The
      length field indicates the length of the value expressed in number
      of octets.

         rIK name: This is carried in a TV payload.  The Type is 1 and
         the value is a 64-bit field computed as specified in Section
         Section 5.1.2 and is used to identify the rIK with which the
         EAP ER messages are protected.

         rIK name as NAI: This is carried in a TLV payload.  The Type is
         2.  The NAI is variable in length, not exceeding 256 octets.

         Peer-Id: This is a TLV payload.  The Type is 3.  The Peer-Id is
         the NAI of the peer, and is variable in length, not exceeding
         256 octets.  The authenticator may use the Peer-Id to route the
         EAP packet.  However, the preferred field for this purpose is
         the server-Id.

         Server-Id: This is a TLV payload.  The Type is 4.  The
         Server-Id is the FQDN of the server; it is variable in length,
         not exceeding 256 octets.  Other types of server IDs such as IP
         addresses may be considered in future revisions of the draft.
         EAP ER capable authenticators SHOULD use this field to route

         the EAP Re-auth Initiate Packet.  If local policy dictates
         otherwise, the packet may be routed based on the peer-Id.

      Crypto Suite: This field indicates the integrity and if necessary
      the encryption algorithm used for EAP ER.  Key lengths and output
      lengths are either indicated or are obvious from the crypto suite
      name.

      Authentication Tag: This field contains the integrity checksum
      over the EAP ER packet.  The length of the field is indicated by
      the Crypto Suite.

6.3.1.1.  Peer Operation

   When an EAP ER capable peer receives an EAP Request Identity message
   from an Authenticator, it checks to see if it has valid EAP state
   from a previous EAP authentication.  If the peer has state from a
   previous authentication, and if it knows that the Authenticator is
   EAP ER capable, it sends an EAP Re-auth Initiate message instead of
   an EAP Response Identity message.  The peer may, upon attachment to
   an authenticator send an EAP Re-auth Initiate message in an
   unsolicited manner.

6.3.1.2.  Authenticator Operation

   An EAP ER capable Authenticator looks for the server ID in the EAP
   Re-auth Initiate message to route the packet to the correct server.
   This is the RECOMMENDED mode of operation.

   The Authenticator's local policy may dictate that the message be
   routed based on the peer's NAI, also available in the EAP Re-auth
   Initiate message.

   The peer's domain may be available as part of the rIKName.

   The Authenticator sends the message just as it forwards other EAP
   messages to the EAP server.

6.3.1.3.  Server Operation

   The server uses the following steps in processing EAP Re-
   authentication messages:

      The server uses the rIKname to lookup the rIK.  It first verifies
      whether the sequence number is equal to or greater than the
      expected sequence number.  The server then proceeds to verify the
      integrity of the message using the rIK, thereby verifying proof of
      possession of that key by the peer.  If the verifications fail,



Narayanan & Dondeti      Expires April 22, 2007                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


      the server sends a EAP Re-auth Finish message with a Failure
      indication.  Otherwise, it computes an rMSK from the rRK using the
      sequence number.

      The server then sends an EAP Re-auth Finish message containing the
      rIK sequence number, and the rIK name; this message is also
      integrity protected with the rIK.  The server may include one or
      more server-ids with this message.  The server-id is for the peer
      to use to send future EAP-ER messages.

      The server transports the rMSK along with this message to the
      authenticator.  The rMSK is transported in a manner similar to the
      MSK transport along with the EAP Success message in a regular EAP
      exchange.

6.3.2.  EAP Re-auth Finish Packet

   The EAP Re-auth Finish packet contains the parameters shown in Figure
   Figure 4 :

6.3.2.1.  Authenticator Operation

   The Authenticator Operation is similar to that in processing an EAP
   success message.  It extracts the rMSK just as it does an MSK from a
   AAA message containing an EAP success packet.

6.3.2.2.  Peer Operation

   The peer uses the following steps in processing a EAP Re-auth Finish
   message:





Narayanan & Dondeti      Expires April 22, 2007                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


      The peer first checks if the identifier in the EAP Re-auth Finish
      message is the expected value.

      The peer then checks to see if the sequence number in the received
      message is the same as the sequence number in the EAP Re-auth
      Initiate message; otherwise it logs an error.

      Next, it uses the rIK name to lookup the appropriate rIK and
      verifies the integrity of the message.  If the verification
      succeeds, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it logs an
      error.

      The peer then uses the sequence number and the peer-id to compute
      the rMSK.

      The lower layer secure association protocol can be triggered at
      this point.

6.4.  Replay protection

   For replay protection, EAP ER uses sequence numbers.  The sequence
   number is initialized to zero in both directions.  In the first EAP
   Re-auth Initiate message, the peer uses the sequence number zero or
   higher.  Note that the when the sequence number rotates, the rIK must
   be changed.  The EAP server expects a sequence number of zero or
   higher.  When the server receives an EAP Re-auth Initiate message, it
   uses the same sequence number in the EAP Re-auth Finish message.  It
   increments the expected sequence number by 1.

   If the EAP peer sends an EAP Re-auth Initiate message, but does not
   receive a response, it retransmits the request (with no changes to
   the message itself) a pre-configured number of times before giving
   up.  However, it is plausible that the server itself may have
   responded to the message and it was lost in transit.  Thus the EAP
   peer MUST increment the sequence number and use the new sequence
   number to send subsequent EAP Re-authentication messages.


7.  Security Considerations

   This section provides an analysis of the protocol in accordance with
   the AAA key management requirements specified in [8].

      Cryptographic Algorithm Independence

         The EAP-ER protocol satisfies this requirement.  The algorithm
         chosen by the peer for the PRF used in key derivaiton as well
         as for the MAC generation is indicated in the EAP Re-



Narayanan & Dondeti      Expires April 22, 2007                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                   EAP-ER                     October 2006


         authentication Response message.  If the chosen algorithms are
         unacceptable, the EAP server returns an EAP Failure message in
         response.  Only when the specified algorithms are acceptable,
         the server proceeds with derivation of keys and verification of
         the proof of possession of relevant keying material by the
         peer.  A full blown negotiation of algorithms cannot be
         provided in a single roundtrip protocol.  Hence, while the
         protocol provides algorithm agility, it does not provide true
         negotiation.

      Strong, fresh session keys

         EAP-ER results in the derivation of strong, fresh keys that are
         unique for the given session.  An rMSK is always derived on-
         demand when the peer requires a key with a new authenticator.
         Both the peer and the server contribute nonces that are used in
         the rMSK derivation.  Further, the compromise of one rMSK does
         not result in the compromise of a different rMSK at any time.

      Limit key scope

         The scope of all the keys derived by EAP-ER are well defined.
         The rRK and rIK are never shared with any entity and always
         remain on the peer and the server.  The rMSK is provided only
         to the authenticator through which the peer performs the EAP-ER
         exchange.  No other authenticator is authorized to use that
         rMSK.

      Replay detection mechanism

         For replay protection of EAP ER messages, a sequence number
         associated with the rIK is used.  The sequence number is
         maintained by the EAP peer and the server, and initialized to
         zero when the rIK is generated.  The peer increments the
         sequence number by one after it sends an EAP ER Re-
         authentication message.  The server increments the sequence
         number when it receives and responds to the message.

      Authenticate all parties

         The EAP-ER protocol provides mutual authentication of the peer
         and the server.  Both parties need to possess the keying
         material resulted from a previous EAP exchange in order to
         successfully derive the required keys.  Also, both the EAP Re-
         authentication Response and the EAP Re-authentication
         Information messages are integrity protected so that the peer
         and the server can verify each other.

      Keying material confidentiality

         The peer and the server derive the keys independently using
         parameters known to each entity.  The rMSK is sent to the
         authenticator via the AAA protocol.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
         AAA protocol be protected using IPsec or TLS so that the key
         can be sent encrypted to the authenticator.

      Confirm ciphersuite selection

         The same ciphersuite used as a result of the EAP session to
         which a particular EAP-ER exchange corresponds is used after
         the EAP-ER exchange as well.  The EAP method executed during
         the full EAP exchange is responsible for confirming the
         ciphersuite selection.

      Prevent the Domino effect

         The compromise of one peer does not result in the compromise of
         keying material held by any other peer in the system.  Also,
         the rMSK is meant for a single authenticator and is not shared
         with any other authenticator.  Hence, the compromise of one
         authenticator does not lead to the compromise of sessions or
         keys held by any other authenticator in the system.  Hence, the
         EAP-ER protocol allows prevention of the domino effect by
         appropriately defining key scopes.

      Bind key to its context

         All the keys derived for EAP-ER are bound to the appropriate
         context using appropriate key labels.  Also, the rMSK is bound
         to the peer and server IDs.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA registration of a new EAP Code: 5 Re-
   authentication.  The new code value is defined for the purpose of
   EAP-ER.


9.  Acknowledgments

   In writing this draft, we benefited from discussing the problem space
   and the protocol itself with a number of folks including, Bernard
   Aboba, Jari Arkko, Sam Hartman, Russ Housley, Joe Salowey, and Jesse
   Walker.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that they endorse
   the protocol or verified the correctness of it.
