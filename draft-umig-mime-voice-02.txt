     Changes From the previous version

     1) Discussion about interoperation between this profile and AMIS-
     Digital was deleted.  Such a gateway is outside the scope of this
     document.

     2) The Text/Signature body part was dropped in favor of a simpler
     mechanism for Spoken-Name support.  Spoken name will be contained as
     an additional audio/* segment in a multipart.

     Work toward Text/Signature will continue in conjunction with Internet
     Directory services but is not expected to be completed in the near
     term.

     3) The document was edited to reflect a clearer notion of what the
     role of this profile is.

     4) IANA Registration of Audio/32KADPCM and Multipart/VM is now
     included as an appendix.

     5) The general level of requirement was reduced.  Support of the
     binary SMTP extensions is now listed as recommended.

     6) Discussion of forwarded messages was added.

     7) The status of the SMTP TURN command was changed to discouraged.  It
     is not clear how the TURN command should function within the ESMTP
     framework.

  1. Abstract

     A class of special-purpose computers has evolved to provide voice
     messaging services.  These machines generally interface to a telephone
     switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services.
     Traditionally, messages sent to a non-local machine are transported

     using analog networking protocols based on DTMF signaling and analog
     voice playback.  As the demand for networking increases, there is a
     need for a standard high-quality digital protocol to connect these
     machines.  The following document is a profile of the Internet
     standard MIME and ESMTP protocols for use as a digital voice
     networking protocol.

     This profile is based on an earlier effort in the Audio Message
     Interchange Specification (AMIS) group to define a voice messaging
     protocol based on X.400 technology.  This protocol is intended to
     satisfy the user requirements statement from that earlier work with
     the industry standard ESMTP/MIME mail protocol infrastructures already
     used within corporate internets.  This profile will be called the
     voice profile in this document.

     Scope and Design Goals

     MIME is the Internet multipurpose, multimedia messaging standard.
     This document explicitly recognizes its capabilities and provides a
     mechanism for the exchange of various messaging technologies including
     voice and facsimile.

     This document specifies a profile of the TCP/IP multimedia messaging
     protocols for use by special-purpose voice processing platforms.
     These platforms have historically been special-purpose computers and
     often do not have facilities normally associated with a traditional
     Internet Email-capable computer.  This profile is intended to specify
     the minimum common set of features and functionaly for conformant
     systems.

     The voice profile does not place limits on the use of additional media
     types or protocol options.  However, systems which are conformant to
     this profile should not send messages with features beyond this
     profile unless explicit per-destination configuration of these
     enhanced features is provided.  Such configuration information could
     be stored in a directory, though the implementation of this is a local
     matter.

     The following are typical restrictions of voice messaging platform
     which were considered in creating this baseline profile.

     1)Text messages are not normally received and often cannot be
     displayed or viewed.  They can often be processed only via advanced
     text-to-speech or text-to-fax features not currently present in these
     machines.

     2)Voice mail (VM) machines usually act as an integrated Message
     Transfer Agent and a User Agent.  The VM is responsible for final
     delivery, and there is no relaying of messages.  RFC 822 header fields
     may have limited use in the context of the simple messaging features
     currently deployed.

     3)VM message stores are generally not capable of preserving the full
     semantics of an Internet message.  As such, use of a VM for general

     Internet Draft         MIME Voice Profile            March 21, 1995


     message forwarding and gatewaying is not supported.  Storage of
     "Received" lines and "Message-ID" may be limited.

       Nothing in this document precludes use of a general purpose email
     gateway from providing these services.  However, severe performance
     degradation may result if the email gateway does not support the ESMTP
     options recommended by this document.

       Internet-style mailin
     Distribution lists are implemented as local alias lists.

       There is generally no human operator.  Error reports must be
     machine-parsable so that helpful responses can be given to users whose
     only access mechanism is a telephone.

       The system user names are often limited to 16 or fewer numeric
     characters.  Alpha characters are not generally used for mailbox
     identification as they cannot be easily entered from a telephone
     terminal.

     It is a goal of this effort to make as few restrictions and additions
     to the existing Internet mail protocols as possible while satisfying
     the user requirements for interworking with current voice messaging
     systems.  This goal is motivated by the desire to increase the
     accessibility to digital messaging by enabling the use of proven
     existing networking software for rapid development.

     This specification is intended for use on a TCP/IP network, however,
     it is possible to use the SMTP protocol suite over other transport
     protocols.  The necessary protocol parameters for such use is outside
     the scope of this document.

     This profile is intended to be robust enough to be used in an
     environment such as the global Internet with installed base gateways
     which do not understand MIME.  It is expected that a messaging system
     will be managed by a system administrator who can perform TCP/IP
     network configuration.  When using facsimile or multiple voice
     encodings, it is expected that the system administrator will maintain
     a list of the capabilities of the networked mail machines to reduce
     the sending of undeliverable messages due to lack of feature support.
     Configuration, implementation and management of this directory listing
     capabilities is a local matter.

     This specification is a profile of the relevant TCP/IP Internet
     protocols.  These technologies, as well as the specifications for the
     Internet mail protocols, are defined in the Request for Comment (RFC)
     document series.  That series documents the standards as well as the
     lore of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  This document should be read with
     the following RFC documents: RFC 821, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol;
     RFC 822, Standard for the format of ARPA Internet Messages; RFC 1521
     and RFC 1522, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions; RFC 1651, RFC
     1652, and RFC 1653, SMTP Service Extensions (ESMTP); and RFC 1034 and
     RFC 1035, Domain Name System. Where additional functionality is
     needed, it will be defined in this document or in an appendix.

     Protocol Restrictions

     This protocol does not limit the number of recipients per message.
     Where possible, implementations should not restrict the number of
     recipients in a single message.  It is recognized that no
     implementation supports unlimited recipients, and that the number of
     supported recipients may be quite low, However, ESMTP currently does
     not provide a mechanism for indicating the number of supported
     recipients.

     This protocol does not limit the maximum message length.  Implementors
     should understand that some machines will be unable to accept
     excessively long messages.  A mechanism is defined in the RFC 1425
     ESMTP extensions to declare the maximum message size supported.

     The message size indicated in the ESMTP SIZE command is in bytes, not
     minutes.  The number of bytes varies by voice encoding format and must
     include the MIME wrapper overhead.  If the length must be known before
     sending, an approximate translation into minutes can be performed if
     the voice encoding is known.

     Message Format Profile

     The voice profile is based on and is consistent with the TCP/IP Email
     Protocol Suite with newly standardized options for enhanced
     functionality and performance. This section is an overview and profile
     of the necessary protocols as applied to the voice messaging
     environment.

      Message Addressing Formats

     RFC 822 and SMTP addressing uses the domain name system.  This naming
     system has two components: the local part, used for username or
     mailbox identification; and the host part, used for machine or node
     identification.  These two components are separated by the commercial
     "@" symbol.

     The local part of the address is an ASCII string uniquely identifying
     a mailbox on a destination system.  The local part is a printable
     string containing the mailbox ID of the originator or recipient.
     Administration of this space is expected to conform to national or
     corporate private telephone numbering plans.  While alpha characters
     and long mailbox identifiers are permitted, most voice mail networks
     rely on numeric mailbox identifers to retain compatability with the
     limited 10 digit telephone keypad.

     The domain part of the address is a hierarchical global name for all
     machines.  For participation in the international Internet network or
     for integration within a corporate internet, each VM machine is
     required to have a unique domain name.  In the domain name system, a
     name is registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).
     The IANA may delegate the management of a branch of the naming space
     to a company or service provider.

     For example, a compliant message may contain the address
     2145551212@mycompany.com. It should be noted that while the example
     mailbox address is based on the North American Numbering Plan, any
     other corporate numbering plan can be used.  The use of the domain
     naming system should be transparent to the user.  It is the
     responsibility of the VM to lookup the fully-qualified domain name
     (FQDN) based on the address entered by the user.  The mapping of
     dialed address to VM destination is generally accomplished through
     implementation-specific means.

     Mapping of the FQDN to a specific network destination is generally
     performed by the Domain Name System.  For networks with a small number
     of machines, a locally-maintained host table database can be used as a
     simpler alternative.

     Special addresses are provided for compatibility with the conventions
     of the Internet mail system and to facilitate testing.  These
     addresses do not use numeric local addresses, both to conform to
     current Internet practice and to avoid conflict with existing numeric
     addressing plans.  Some special addresses are as follows:

     Internet Draft         MIME Voice Profile            March 21, 1995


     Postmaster@domain

     By convention, a special mailbox named "postmaster" should exist on
     all systems.  This address is used for diagnostics and should be
     checked regularly by the system manager. This mailbox is particularly
     likely to receive text messages, which is not normal on a voice
     processing platform; the specific handling of these messages is a
     individual implementation choice.

     Loopback@domain

     A special mailbox name named "loopback" should be designated for
     loopback testing.  All messages sent to this mailbox must be returned
     back to the sender as a new message.  The originating address should
     be "postmaster".

     Because VMs may use alpha-numeric addresses, these two addresses are
     RESERVED so they do not conflict with any internal addressing plan.
     Internal to VM, a specific numeric address for DTMF entry can be
     mapped to "loopback".

     Note that without network level authentication, the loopback address
     can be used to routing messages through a third-party VM to spoof
     another device or to avoid toll charges.  It is recommended that the
     loopback feature be disabled except when testing the networking
     between machines.

      Message Header Fields

     Internet messages contain a header information block.  This header
     block contains information required to identify the sender, the list
     of recipients, the message send time, and other information intended
     for user presentation.  Except for specialized gateway and mailing
     list cases, headers do not indicate delivery options for the transport
     of messages.

     RFC 822 defines a set of standard message header fields.  This set is
     extended in several RFCs.

     Note that the specific order of header lines is not specified.  The
     order cannot be expected to be preserved when sent through
     intermediate gateways.  The following header fields must be supported.

     From

     The originator's fully-qualified domain address (a mailbox number
     followed by the fully-qualified domain name).  The user listed in this
     field should be presented in the voice message envelope as the
     originator of the message.

     It is recommended that all messages contain the text personal name of
     the sender in a quoted phrase if available.  The name must be in the
     form "last, first, mi." From [822]

     Internet Draft         MIME Voice Profile            March 21, 1995


     Example:

       From: "User, Joe S." <2145551212@mycompany.com>

     To

     The recipient's fully-qualified domain address.  There may be one or
     more To: fields in any message.

     It is recommended that all addressees contain the text personal name
     of the recipient, if known, in a quoted phrase.  The name must be in
     the form "last, first, mi." From [822]

     Example:

       To: "User, Sam S." <2145551213@mycompany.com>

     Cc

     Additional recipients' fully-qualified domain address. Many VM systems
     are not capable of storing or reporting the full list of recipients to
     the receiver.  Systems conformant to this profile may discard the CC
     list of incoming messages as necessary.  Systems conformant to this
     profile should provide a complete list of recipients when possible.

     It is recommended that all addressees contain the text personal name
     of the recipient, if known, in a quoted phrase.  The name must be in
     the form "last, first, mi." From [822]

     Example:

       To: "User, Sam S." <2145551213@mycompany.com>

     Date

     The date, time, and time zone in which the message was sent by the
     originator, or the time specified by the originator if the message is
     scheduled for deferred delivery.  Conforming implementations should be
     able to convert RFC 822 date and time stamps into local time.  If the
     VM reports message-sent time, the value in the Date field should be
     used, not the time the message was received at the destination system.
     From [822]

     Example:

       Date: Wed, 28 Jul 93 10:08:49 PST

     Presentation of seconds and the day of the week is optional.

     Sender

     The actual address of the originator if the message is sent by an
     agent on behalf of the author indicated in the From: field.  Support
     for this field cannot be assumed when talking to a voice system and

     should only be generated by a conforming implementation with per-
     destination configuration.

     The Sender field often contains the name of an Internet-style mailing
     list administrator and is the destination address for reporting errors
     if the ESMTP MAIL FROM address is not available.  While it may not be
     possible to save this information in some VM machines, discarding this
     information or the ESMTP MAIL FROM address will make it difficult to
     send an error message to the proper destination. From [822]

     Message-id

     A unique per-message identifier.  This value is not required to be
     stored on the receiving system.  This identifier may be used for
     tracking, auditing, and returning read-receipt reports.  From [822]

     Example:

       Message-id: <12345678@mycompany.com>

     Received

     Special-purpose trace information added to the beginning of a RFC 822
     message by message transport agents (MTA).  This is the only header
     permitted to be added by an MTA.  Information in this header is useful
     for debugging when using an ASCII message reader or a header parsing
     tool. A conforming system must add Received headers when acting as a
     gateway and must not remove them.  These headers may be ignored or
     deleted when the message is received at the final destination. From
     [822]

     MIME Version

     The MIME-Version header indicates that the message is conformant to
     the MIME message format specification.  This header must be present in
     any conforming message.  Systems conformant to this profile will
     include a comment with the words "(Voice 1.0)". From [MIME]

     Example:

       MIME-Version: 1.0 (Voice 1.0)

     Content-Type

     The content-type header declares the type of content enclosed in the
     message.  One of the allowable contents is multipart, a mechanism for
     bundling several message components into a single message.  The
     allowable contents are specified in the next section of this document.
     From [MIME]

     Content-Transfer-Encoding

     Because Internet mail was initially specified to carry only 7-bit US-
     ASCII text, it may be necessary to encode voice and fax data into a

     Vaudreuil                Expires 9/1/95                    [Page 8]
     Internet Draft         MIME Voice Profile            March 21, 1995


     representation suitable for that environment.  The content-transfer-
     encoding header describes this transformation if it is needed. From
     [MIME]

     Sensitivity

     The sensitivity header, if present, indicates the requested privacy
     level.  The case-insensitive values "Personal" and "Private" are
     specified. If no privacy is requested, this field is omitted.

     If a Sensitivity header is present in the message, a conformant system
     is prohibited from forwarding this message to any other user.  If the
     receiving system does not support privacy and the sensitivity is one
     of "Personal" or "Private", the message must be returned to the sender
     with an appropriate error message indicating that privacy could not be
     assured and that the message was not delivered.

     Importance

     Indicates the requested priority to be given by the receiving system.
     The case-insensitive values "low", "normal" and "high" are specified.
     If no special importance is requested, this header may be omitted and
     the value assumed to be "normal".  This field can be used to order
     messages in a recipient's mailbox and is equivalent to the AMIS-
     Digital Priority indication. From [X400]

     Subject

     The subject field is often provided by email systems but is not widely
     supported on Voice Mail platforms. This field may be generated by a
     conforming implementation and may be discarded if present.

    3 Message Content Types

     MIME is a general-purpose message body format that is extensible to
     carry a wide range of body parts.  The basic protocol is described in
     [MIME]. MIME also provides for encoding binary data so that it can be
     transported over the 7-bit text-oriented SMTP protocol.  This
     transport encoding is independent of the audio encoding designed to
     generate a binary object.

     MIME defines two transport encoding mechanisms to transform binary
     data into a 7 bit representation, one designed for text-like data
     ("Quoted-Printable"), and one for arbitrary binary data ("Base-64").
     While Base-64 is dramatically more efficient for audio data, both will
     work.  Where binary transport is available, no transport encoding is
     needed, and the data can be labled as "Binary".

     An implementation in conformance with this profile should send audio
     data in binary form when binary message transport is available.  When
     binary transport is not available, implementations must encode the
     message as Base-64.  The detection and decoding of "Quoted-Printable",
     "7bit", and "8bit" must also be supported in order to meet MIME

     requirements and to preserve interoperability with the fullest range
     of possible devices.

     The following content types are identified for use with this profile.
     Note that each of these contents can be sent individually in a message
     or wrapped in a multipart message to send multi-segment messages.

     Message/RFC822 (REQUIRED)

     MIME requires support of the Message/RFC822 message encapsulation body
     part.  This body part is used in the Internet to forward complete
     messages within a multipart/mixed message.  Processing of this body
     part entails trivial processing to unencapsulate/encapsulate the
     message.  Systems conformant to this profile but should not send this
     body part but must accepted if in conformance with basic MIME.
     Specific handling depends on the platform, and interpretation of this
     content-type is left as an implementation decision. From [MIME]

     Text/Plain (REQUIRED)

     MIME requires support of the basic text/plain content type.  This
     content type has no applicability within the voice messaging
     environment and should not be sent.  Specific handling depends on the
     platform, and interpretation of this content-type is left as an
     implementation decision. From [MIME]

     Multipart/Mixed (REQUIRED)

     MIME provides the facilities for enclosing several body parts in a
     single message. Multipart/Mixed may be used for sending multi-segment
     voice messages, that is, to preserve across the network the
     distinction between an annotation and a forwarded message.  Conformant
     systems must accept multipart/mixed body parts.  Systems are permitted
     to collapse such a multi-segment message into a single segment if
     multi-segment messages are not supported on the receiving machine.
     From [MIME]

     Message/Notification (REQUIRED)

     This MIME body part is used for sending machine-parsable delivery
     status notifications. From [NOTIFY]

     Multipart/Report (REQUIRED)

     The Multipart/Report is used for enclosing a Message/Notification body
     part and any returned message content.  This body type is a companion
     to Message/Notification.  From [NOTIFY2]

     Audio/32KADPCM (REQUIRED)

     CCITT Recommendation G.721 [G721] describes the algorithm recommended
     for conversion of a 64 KB/s A-law or u-law PCM channel to and from a
     32 KB/s channel.  The conversion is applied to the PCM stream using an
     Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) transcoding

     technique. This algorithm will be registered with the IANA for MIME
     use under the name Audio/32KADPCM.

     Support of Audio/32KADPCM is required for conformance with this
     profile.

     Proprietary Voice Formats (OPTIONAL)

     Proprietary voice encoding formats or other standard formats may be
     supported under this profile provided a unique identifier is
     registered with the IANA prior to use.  These encodings should be
     registered as sub-types of Audio.  The use of unregistered content-
     type values is strongly discouraged.

     Use of any other encoding except Audio/32KADPCM reduces
     interoperability in the absence of explicit manual system
     configuration.  A system conformant to this profile will not send
     proprietary voice formats without explict configuration.

     Multipart/VM (OPTIONAL)

     This new MIME multipart structure provides a mechanism for packaging
     the senders spoken name, a spoken subject and, the message.  The
     multipart provides for the packaging of three segments, the first is
     the spoken name, the second is a spoken subject, and the third is the
     message itself.  Forwarded messages can be created by simply nesting
     multiparts (this is also possible with Multipart/Mixed if spoken name
     or spoken subject is not present).  This type is defined in an
     appendix to this document.

     An implementation conformant to this profile will use Audio/32KADPCM
     by default.  Use of any other encoding except Audio/32KADPCM reduces
     interoperability in the absence of explicit manual system
     configuration.  A system conformant to this profile will not send
     other voice formats without explict configuration.

     Message Transport Protocol

     Messages are transported between VM machines using the Internet
     Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP).  All information
     required for proper delivery of the message is included in the ESMTP
     dialog.  This information, including the sender and recipient
     addresses, is commonly referred to as the message "envelope".  This
     information is equivalent to the message control block in many analog
     voice networking protocols.

     ESMTP is a general-purpose messaging protocol, designed both to send
     mail and to allow terminal console messaging.  Simple Mail Transport
     Protocol (SMTP) was originally created for the exchange of US-ASCII 7-
     bit text messages.  Binary and 8-bit text messages have traditionally
     been transported by encoding the messages into a 7-bit text-like form.
     [ESMTP] was recently published and formalized an extension mechanism
     for SMTP, and subsequent RFCs have defined 8-bit text networking,
     binary networking, and extensions to permit the declaration of message
     size for the efficient transmission of large messages such as multi-
     minute voice mail.

     A command streaming extension for high performance message
     transmission has been defined.  [PIPE] This extension reduces the
     number of round-trip packet exchanges and makes it possible to
     validate all recipient addresses in one operation.  This extension is
     optional but recommended.

     The following sections list ESMTP commands, keywords, and parameters
     that are required and those that are optional.

  5.1 ESMTP Commands

     HELO (REQUIRED)

     Base SMTP greeting and identification of sender.  This command is not
     to be sent by conforming systems unless the more-capable EHLO command
     is not accepted.  It is included for compatibility with general SMTP
     implementations.  From [SMTP]

     MAIL FROM (REQUIRED)

     Originating mailbox.  This address contains the mailbox to which
     errors should be sent.  This address may not be the same as the
     message sender listed in the message header fields if the message was
     gatewayed or sent to an Internet-style mailing list.  From [SMTP]

     RCPT TO (REQUIRED)

     Recipient's mailbox.  This field contains only the addresses to which
     the message should be delivered for this transaction.  In the event
     that multiple transport connections to multiple destination machines
     are required for the same message, this list may not match the list of
     recipients in the message header.  From [SMTP]

     Internet Draft         MIME Voice Profile            March 21, 1995


     DATA (REQUIRED)

     Initiates the transfer of message data.  This command is required to
     be supported but should only be used in the event the binary mode
     command BDAT is not supported.  From [SMTP]

     TURN (DISCOURAGED)

     Requests a change-of-roles, that is, the client that opened the
     connection offers to assume the role of server for any mail the remote
     machine may wish to send.  This command is useful to poll for
     messages.

     (Note the security implications of using the turn command to fetch
     mail queued for another destination.  This fetching is possible
     because of the lack of authentication of the sending VM by the
     protocol). From [SMTP]

     QUIT (REQUIRED)

     Requests that the connection be closed.  If accepted, the remote
     machine will reset and close the connection.  From [SMTP]

     RSET (REQUIRED)

     Resets the connection to its initial state.  From [SMTP]

     VRFY (OPTIONAL)

     Requests verification that this node can reach the listed recipient.
     While this functionality is also included in the RCPT TO command, VRFY
     allows the query without beginning a mail transfer transaction.  This
     command is useful for debugging and tracing problems.  From [SMTP]

     (Note that the implementation of VRFY may simplify the guessing of a
     recipient's mailbox or automated sweeps for valid mailbox addresses,
     resulting in a possible reduction in privacy.  Various implementation
     techniques may be used to reduce the threat, such as limiting the
     number of queries per session.)  From [SMTP]

     EHLO (REQUIRED)

     The enhanced mail greeting that enables a server to announce support
     for extended messaging options.  The extended messaging modes are
     discussed in a later section of this document.  From [ESMTP]

     BDAT (REQUIRED)

     The BDAT command is an alternative to the earlier DATA command.  The
     BDAT command provides for binary transport and does not require
     encoding voice data into 7-bit line-limited formats.

     All other commands must be recognized and an appropriate error code
     returned if not supported.   From [BIN]

      ESMTP Keywords

     STREAMING (OPTIONAL)

     The "STREAMING" keyword indicates ability of the receiving SMTP to
     accept pipelined SMTP commands.  From [PIPE]

     SIZE (REQUIRED)

     The "SIZE" keyword provides a mechanism by which the receiving SMTP
     can indicate the maximum size message supported.  From [SIZE]

     CHUNKING (REQUIRED)

     The "CHUNKING" keyword indicates that the receiver will support the
     high-performance binary transport mode.  Note that CHUNKING can be
     used with any message format and does not imply support for binary
     encoded messages.  From [BIN]

     BINARYMIME (REQUIRED)

     The "BINARYMIME" keyword indicates that the receiver SMTP can accept
     binary encoded MIME messages.  Note that CHUNKING mode must be
     supported for this option, but CHUNKING does not mean that binary
     messages can be supported.  From [BIN]

     NOTIFY (REQUIRED)

     The "NOTIFY" keyword indicates that the receiver SMTP will accept
     explicit delivery status notification requests. From [DSN]

    3 ESMTP Parameters - MAIL FROM

     BINARYMIME

     The current message is a binary encoded MIME messages.  From [BIN]

    4 ESMTP Parameters - RCPT TO

     NOTIFY

     The conditions under which a delivery report should be sent. From
     [DSN]

     RET

     Whether the content of the message should be returned. From [DSN]

     Management Protocols

     The Internet protocols provide a mechanism for the management of VM
     machines, from the management of the physical network through the
     management of the message queues.  SNMP should be supported on a
     compliant message machine.

     The digital interface to the VM and the TCP/IP protocols should be
     managed by the standard network Management Information Bases (MIBs).
     MIB II provides basic statistics and reporting of the TCP/IP protocol
     performance and statistics.  Media-specific MIBs are available for
     X.25, Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, Frame Relay, and other network
     technologies.  This MIB provides necessary information to diagnose
     faulty hardware, overloaded network conditions, and excessive traffic
     conditions from a remote management station.

     Management of the machine resources and message queue monitoring based
     on the host MIB and the Message and Directory MIB is recommended.

     Required Parameters: None
     Optional Parameters: None

     Encoding Considerations: Any encoding necessary for transport may be
     used.

     CCITT Recommendation G.721 [G721] describes the algorithm recommended
     for conversion of a 64 KB/s A-law or u-law PCM channel to and from a
     32 KB/s channel.  The conversion is applied to the PCM stream using an
     Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) transcoding
     technique.

     No header information shall be included before the audio data. When
     this subtype is present, a sample rate of 8000 Hz and a single channel
     is assumed.

     13.    Appendix - Multipart/VM

     Mime type name: Multipart
     Mime Sub-Type name: Spoken-NameVM
     Required Parameters: Boundary
     Optional Parameters: None
     Encoding Considerations: Quoted-Printable and Base-64 are prohibited.



     The syntax of a Multipart/VM  is identical to the Multipart/Mixed
     content type.  The VM  content-type contains three body parts.  The
     first is an audio segment conatining the spoken name of the
     originator, the second is an audio segment containing a spoken
     subject, and the third is the voice message itself.  Forwarded voice
     messages can be created by simply nesting multiparts .

     The spoken name segment shall contain the name of the message sender
     in the voice of the sender.  The length of the spoken name segment
     must not exceed 12 seconds.  If no spoken name is available, the
     segment must still be present but may be empty.

     The spoken subject segment shall contain the subject of the message
     sender in the voice of the sender.  The length of the spoken subject
     segment must not exceed 20 seconds.  If no spoken subject segment is
     available, the segment must still be present but may be empty.

     The voice message body part may contain any arbitrary content
     including a multipart/mixed collections of body parts, though will
     typically be an audio segment.

     The default handling of the multipart/VM  shall be to voice the
     spoken-name segment and then the spoken-subject prior to displaying or
     voicing the remainder of the message.
