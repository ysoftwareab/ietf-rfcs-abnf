     Terminology

     The terminology defined in [IPv6-TUNNEL] is used at a large  extent
     throughout  this  document.  Several additional definitions for bi-
     directional tunneling follow:


     bi-directional tunnel

          a tunnel in which tunnel data  traffic  takes  place  in  both
          directions,  e.g.,  direct  direction, from the entry-point to
          the exit-point node, and reverse  direction,  from  the  exit-
          point node to the entry-point node.


     direct tunnel

          the term is used with a bi-directional tunnel, to identify the
          direct  tunnel  path, e.g., the tunnel from the entry-point to
          the exit-point node.


     reverse tunnel

          the term is used with a bi-directional tunnel, to identify the
          reverse  tunnel  path, e.g., the tunnel from the exit-point to
          the entry-point node.


     tunnel entry

          synonim for the tunnel entry-point node [IPv6-Tunnel]


     tunnel exit

          synonim for the tunnel exit-point node [IPv6-Tunnel]

1. Introduction


   In conformance with [IPv6-TUNNEL], IPv6 tunneling is a technique  for
   establishing a "virtual link" between two IPv6 nodes for transmitting
   data packets as payloads of IPv6 packets (see Fig.1). From the  point
   of view of the two nodes, this "virtual link", called an IPv6 tunnel,
   appears as a point to point link on which IPv6 acts like a link-layer
   protocol.    The  two  IPv6  nodes  play  specific  roles.  One  node
   encapsulates original packets  received  from  other  nodes  or  from
   itself  and forwards the resulting tunnel packets through the tunnel.
   The other node decapsulates the received tunnel packets and  forwards
   the  resulting  original packets towards their destinations, possibly
   itself. The encapsulator node is called the tunnel entry-point  node,
   and  it is the source of the tunnel packets. The decapsulator node is
   called the tunnel exit-point, and it is the destination of the tunnel
   packets.

   This document defines extensions to the model and generic  mechanisms
   for  IPv6  encapsulation  of  Internet  packets specified in "Generic
   Packet   Tunneling  in  IPv6"  [IPv6-TUNNEL].  These  extensions  are
   related  to  the character of the data traffic in the tunnel, as well
   as the tunnel configuration performed at the end-nodes of the tunnel.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL,   REQUIRED,  RECOMMENDED,
   SHALL,  SHALL  NOT,  SHOULD,  SHOULD  NOT   are  to be interpreted as
   defined in RFC 2119.


2. Uni-Directional, and Bi-Directional Tunnels

   Configuring an IPv6 tunnel involves in principle the following  basic
   operations:


   "At the Tunnel Entry-Point"

   The enabling/configuring  of  the  mechanism  that  will  encapsulate
   packets  originated  or  forwarded by the node, and forward them into
   the tunnel.  This likely  may,  but  not  exclusively,  or  uniquely,
   involve:


   o  The creation/configuration  of  a  pseudo  or  logical  interface,
      called  "tunnel" interface, on the top or as an "off-spring" of an
      existent "parent" interface, which can be a physical interface, or
      another  tunnel  interface.   In the former case, original packets
      are  encapsulated  before  being  transmiited  onto  the  physical

INTERNET-DRAFT      Bi-Directional Tunneling in IPv6      July 14, 19100


      interface.  In  the  latter  case,  the tunnel is a nested tunnel:
      tunnel  packets  will  be  encapsulated  in  tunnel  packets,  but
      uiltimately  will  be transmiited on the physical interface [IPv6-
      Tunnel].


   o  The tunnel interface has an attached  routing  table  entry,  that
      determines  the  redirection  of  IP  packets  onto  the  "parent"
      interface, which ultimately is a  physical interface.


   o  A node,  which  is  down-stream  for  the  traffic  that  will  be
      tunneled,  and where the tunnel traffic must end, is configured as
      tunnel exit. The tunnel exit is  specified  by  ways  of  an  IPv6
      address. This is the address that will be filled in as destination
      address in the IPv6 tunnel header [IPv6-Tunnel].


   o  The  configuring of the tunnel entry address that will be used  as
      source  address of the tunnel packets. This address will be filled
      in the IPv6 tunnel header as the source address [IPv6-Tunnel].

      Note: The operations  specified   above  have  a  protocol  engine
      implementation  characteristic.  It  is the uni-direcional and bi-
      directional behavior that are  to  be  standardized  and  not  the
      mechanisms  through which they are achieved. An implementation may
      have different ways in which the same functionality is achieved.


   "At the Tunnel Exit-Point"


   o  Enable tunnel packet decapsulation. Tunnel exit-point  nodes  need
      not  explicitly  know that they are the exit-point of a particular
      tunnel. However, a tunnel-exit point node needs the capability  of
      decapsulating  tunnel  packets,  therefore if such a capability is
      provided with  an  enable/disable  switch,  the  switch  muast  be
      toggled onto the "enable" position.


   These basic configuration operations  affect  the  traffic  from  the
   entry-point  node  to  the  exit-point  node, that is packets will be
   tunneled in one direction, from the entry-point  node  to  the  exit-
   point  node. Packets transmiited in reverse direction, from the exit-
   point node to the entry-point node are not tunneled.  This is  giving
   the  tunnel the characteristic of a "uni-directional" mechanism.  For
   instancfe in Fig.1, Node B sio the entry-point node  in  the  tunnel,
   and  node C is the exit-point from the tunnel, and the tunnel traffic

              Fig.1 Tunnel

   To  tunnel  the  reverse  traffic,  the  basic  tunnel  configuration
   operations  specified  above  or their equivalent must be repeated in
   reverse direction, that is, a tunnel interface must be configured  on
   the  exit-point  node and the decapsulation of tunnel packets must be
   enabled on the tunnel entry-point node.  In  Fig.2,  this  additional
   configuration  adds  to  Node  B,  which was an entry-point node, the
   characteristic of an exit-point node,  and  conversely,  to  NOde  C,
   which  was  an  exit-point node, the characteristic of an entry-point
   node.

   In conclusion, bi-directional  tunneling  is  achieved   in  fact  by
   merging  two  unidirectional  mechanisms,  that  is,  configuring two
   tunnels, a "direct" tunnel, and a "reverse" tunnel, each in  opposite
   direction to the other -- the entry-point node of the "direct" tunnel
   is the exit-point node of  the  "reverse"  tunnel  (see  Fig.2).   By
   default a tunnel is a "direct" tunnel.

                  Tunnel from Node C to Node B

              Fig.2 Bi-directional Tunneling Mechanism

   It is important to note that by the nature of IP routing,  in case it
   relies  on  the  dynamic  routing protocols mechanisms to forward the
   tunnel packets, a bi-directional tunnel, if it has more than one hop,
   will  have  most likely an asymmetric characteristic. That means that
   there is no guarantee that the "reverse" traffic will follow  hop  by
   hop the reverted "direct" path. It is likely that to ensure a perfect
   symmetry, that is a "reverse" path identical to the "direct" path  in
   reverse,  it  is  either necessary to configure statically the routes
   each router in the tunnel to forward "reverse" tunnel packets on  the
   reverted  direct path, either to use traffic engineering, like strict
   source routing by inserting IPv6 routing headers to force the reverse
   traffic strictly on the reverted direct path.


3.  IPv6 Tunnel Type State Variable


   More configuration operations can be performed on  the  tunnel  entry
   and  tunnel  exit nodes besides the basic configuration operations to
   control or affect the tunnel traffic. For  instance  a  node  can  be
   attached  filtering  options with each tunnel, to enable traffic from
   particular nodes, and disable or drop traffic from others.

   The configuration of a tunnel entry  or  exit  node  is  captured  in
   several state variables [IPv6-Tunnel]. The Tunnel type state variable
   is introduced to indicate the type of control that is applied to  the

   traffic  in  a  tunnel.  It  indicates  the  uni-directional  or  bi-
   directional character of the data traffic in the tunnel, as  well  as
   the  extent  of  tunnel  configuration  at  the  entry-node to filter
   traffic flows.

   The tunnel type can be one of the following:

   - "uni-directional",

   - "bi-directional".

   - "symmetric bi-direcional"


3.1    IPv6 Tunnel Type -- Uni-Directional


   A "uni-directional"  tunnel  is  a  tunnel  that  meets  all  of  the
   following criteria:

   - a node which is placed ahead of  other  nodes  on  the  path  of  a
     traffic  flow  is  configured as the Tunnel Entry node (see Section
     above).

   - the node specified as exit node in the configuring  of  the  tunnel
     entry, is enabled the tunnel packet decaspulating.

   These criteria qualify the tunnel as a "direct"  tunnel  between  the
   tunnel entry and tunnel exit.

   Note: In conformance with its definition, a "uni-directional  tunnel"
   allows  tunnel packet traffic only in one direction, that is, it acts
   as a uni-directional virtual link. This MUST be  considered  in  case
   Neighbor Discovery mechanisms [ND-Spec] are to be used.


3.2  IPv6 Tunnel Type -- Bi-Directional


   A "bi-directional" tunnel is a tunnel that meets all of the following
   criteria:

   - a "direct" tunnel is configured between two nodes.

   - a "reverse" tunnel is configured between the "direct" tunnel  entry
     end exit.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Bi-Directional Tunneling in IPv6      July 14, 19100


   A "bi-directional" tunnel, allows tunnel  traffic  to  flow  in  both
   directions,  but  it  is  likely that it will behave as an asymmetric
   link, since the direct path may  contain  different  nodes  than  the
   reverse  one.  The bi-directional and asymmetrical characteristics of
   MUST be considered if Neighbor Discovery [ND-Spec] mechanisms are  to
   be used.


3..2.1 IPv6 Tunnel Type -- Symmetric Bi-Directional


   A "symmetric bi-directional" tunnel is a  bi-direcional  tunnel  that
   meets all of the following criteria:

   - the reverse path is identical with the reverted direct path.

   This  can  be  achieved  through  various  means,  such   as   static
   configuration of the routing tables of the the routers in the reverse
   tunnel, or inserting a routing header  that  will  force  the  tunnel
   packets  on  the  reverse  tunnel on a path identical to the reverted
   direct path.

   Note: A "symmetrical bi-directional" tunnel, allows tunnel traffic to
   flow  in  both directions, on paths that contain the same nodes, that
   is the reverse path is identcal with reverted direct  path.  The  bi-
   directional  and  symmetrical  characetristics  MUST be considered if
   Neighbor Discovery [ND-Spec] mechanisms are to be used.

9. Security Considerations


   The  security  considerations  of   [IPv6-Tunnel]   apply   to   this
   specification as well.

   An IPv6 tunnel can be secured by securing the IPv6 path  between  the
   tunnel  entry-point  and  exit-point node. The security architecture,
   mechanisms, and services are described in [IPsec-Arch], [IPsec-Auth],
   and  [IPsec-Encr].  A  secure  IPv6  tunnel  may act as a gateway-to-
   gateway secure path as described in [IPsec-Encr].

   For a secure IPv6 tunnel, in addition  to  the  mechanisms  described
   earlier in this document, the entry-point node of the tunnel performs
   security algorithms on the packet and prepends as part of the  tunnel
   headers one or more security headers in conformance with [IPv6-Spec],
   [IPsec-Arch], and [IPsec-Auth], or [IPsec-Encr].

   The exit-point  node  of  a  secure  IPv6  tunnel  performs  security
   algorithms and processes the tunnel security header[s] as part of the
   tunnel headers processing described earlier, and in conformance  with
   [IPsec-Arch], and [IPsec-Auth], or [IPsec-Encr].  The exit-point node
   discards the tunnel security header[s] with the rest  of  the  tunnel
   headers after tunnel headers processing completion.

   The degree of integrity, authentication, and confidentiality and  the
   security  processing  performed on a tunnel packet at the entry-point
   and exit-point node of a secure IPv6 tunnel depend  on  the  type  of
   security  header  -  authentication  (AH)  or  encryption (ESP) - and
   parameters configured in the Security  Association  for  the  tunnel.
   There  is no dependency or interaction between the security level and
   mechanisms applied to the tunnel packets and the security applied  to
   the  original  packets  which are the payloads of the tunnel packets.
   In case of nested tunnels, each inner tunnel may have its own set  of
   security  services, independently from those of the outer tunnels, or
   of those between the source and destination of the original packet.
