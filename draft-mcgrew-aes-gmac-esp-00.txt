Abstract

   This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) as an IPsec Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) mechanism to provide data origin
   authentication, but not confidentiality.  GMAC is based on the
   Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation, and can be efficiently
   implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and
   above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of AES GMAC mode (AES-GMAC) as an
   IPSec ESP mechanism for data origin authentication.  We refer to this
   method as AES-GMAC-ESP.  It is a companion to the AES Galois/Counter
   Mode ESP  [GCM-ESP], which provides authentication as well as
   confidentiality.  AES-GMAC-ESP is intended for cases in which
   confidentiality is not desired.  Like GCM, GMAC is efficient and
   secure, and is amenable to high-speed implementations in hardware.
   AES-GMAC-ESP is designed so that the incremental cost of implementing
   it, given an implementation is AES-GCM-ESP, is small.

   This document does not cover implementation details of GCM or GMAC.
   Those details can be found in [GCM], along with test vectors.

2.  AES-GCM

   GMAC is a block cipher mode of operation providing data origin
   authentication.  It is defined in terms of the GCM authenticated
   encryption operation as follows.  The GCM authenticated encryption
   operation has four inputs: a secret key, an initialization vector
   (IV), a plaintext, and an input for additional authenticated data
   (AAD).  It has two outputs, a ciphertext whose length is identical to
   the plaintext, and an authentication tag.  GMAC is the special case
   of GCM in which the plaintext has a length of zero.  The (zero-
   length) ciphertext output is ignored, of course, so that the only
   output of the function is the Authentication Tag. In the following,
   we describe how the GMAC IV and AAD are formed from the ESP fields,
   and how the ESP packet is formed from the plaintext and
   authentication tag.

   ESP also defines an IV.  For clarity, we refer to the AES-GMAC IV as
   a nonce in the context of AES-GMAC-ESP.  The same nonce and key
   combination MUST NOT be used more than once.

   Since reusing an nonce/key combination destroys the security
   guarantees of AES-GMAC mode, it can be difficult to use this mode
   securely when using statically configured keys.  For safety's sake,
   implementations MUST use an automated key mangement system, such as
   the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409], to ensure that this
   requirement is met.

3.  ESP Payload Data

   The ESP Payload Data is comprised of an eight-octet Authentication
   Initialization Vector (IV) followed by the Authenticated Payload.
   The payload field, as defined in [RFC2406], is structured as shown in
   Figure 1.

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    |                            (8 octets)                         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                                                               |
    ~                Authenticated Payload (variable)               ~
    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Figure 1: The AES-GMAC ESP Payload, when no  encryption is used.

   The Authenticated Payload field consists of the ESP Payload field as
   defined by the encryption transform.  When AES-GMAC-ESP is used in
   the absence of encryption, that is, with NULL encryption [RFC2410],
   then the Authenticated Payload contains the data described by the ESP
   Next Header field.  When AES-GMAC-ESP is used in the presence of an
   ESP encryption transform that uses an IV, the encryption IV appears
   within the Authenticated Payload.

      Rationale: In ESP encryption takes place before authentication on
      the sender side, and authentication takes place first on the
      receiver side.  Because of this ordering, the Authentication IV
      preceeds the encryption IV.


3.1  Initialization Vector (IV)

   The AES-GMAC-ESP IV field MUST be eight octets.  For a given key, the
   IV MUST NOT repeat.  The most natural way to meet this requirement is
   to set the IV using a counter, but implementations are free to set
   the IV field in any way that guarantees uniqueness, such as a linear
   feedback shift register (LFSR).  Note that the sender can use any IV
   generation method that meets the uniqueness requirement, without
   coordinating with the receiver.

4.  Nonce Format

   The nonce passed to the AES-GMAC authentiation algorithm has the
   following layout:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                          Figure 2: Nonce Format

   The components of the nonce are as follows:

   Salt
      The salt field is a four-octet value that is assigned at the
      beginning of the security association, and then remains constant
      for the life of the security association.  The salt SHOULD be
      unpredictable (i.e., chosen at random) before it is selected, but
      need not be secret.  We describe how to set the salt for a
      Security Association established via the Internet Key Exchange in
      Section 9.1.

   Initialization Vector
      The IV field is described in section Section 3.1.

5.  AAD Construction

   Data integrity and data origin authentication is provided for the
   SPI, (Extended) Sequence Number, Authenticated Payload, Padding, Pad
   Length, and Next Header fields.  This is done by including those
   fields in the AES-GMAC Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) field.
   Two formats of the AAD are defined: one for 32-bit sequence numbers,
   and one for 64-bit extended sequence numbers.  The format with 32-bit
   sequence numbers is shown in Figure 3, and the format with 64-bit
   extended sequence numbers is shown in Figure 4.

7.  Differences with AES-GCM-ESP

   In this section we highlight the differences between this
   specification and AES-GCM-ESP.  The essential difference is that in
   this draft, the AAD consists of the SPI, Sequence Number, and ESP
   Payload, and the AES-GCM plaintext is zero-length, while in AES-GCM-
   ESP, the AAD consists only of the SPI and Sequence Number, and the
   AES-GCM plaintext consists of the ESP Payload.  These differences are
   illustrated in Figure 5.  This figure shows the case in which the
   Extended Sequence Number option is not used.  When that option is
   exercised, the Sequence Number field in the figure would be replaced
   with the Extended Sequence Number.

        Figure 5: Differences between AES-GMAC-ESP and AES-GCM-ESP.

   Importantly, AES-GMAC-ESP is *not* equivalent to AES-GCM-ESP with
   encryption "turned off".  However, the computations performed in both
   cases are very nearly identical, because of the structure of the
   GHASH function [GCM] that is used to compute the ICVs.  The only
   place where these computations differ is in the final GF(2^128)
   multiplication, where the lengths of the Plaintext and AAD inputs are
   taken into account.

8.  Packet Expansion

   The IV adds an additional eight octets to the packet and the ICV adds
   an additional 16 octets.  These are the only sources of packet
   expansion, other than the 10-13 bytes taken up by the ESP SPI,
   Sequence Number, Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields (if the
   minimal amount of padding is used), and any expansion due to the ESP
   encryption transform.

9.  IKE Conventions

   This section describes the conventions used to generate keying
   material and salt values for use with AES-GMAC-ESP using the Internet
   Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409] protocol.  The identifiers and
   attributes needed to negotiate a security association using AES-GMAC-
   ESP are also defined.

9.1  Keying Material and Salt Values

   IKE makes use of a pseudo-random function (PRF) to derive keying
   material.  The PRF is used iteratively to derive keying material of
   arbitrary size, called KEYMAT.  Keying material is extracted from the
   output string without regard to boundaries.

   The size of the KEYMAT for the AES-GMAC-ESP MUST be four octets
   longer than is needed for the associated AES key.  The keying
   material is used as follows:

   AES-GMAC-ESP with a 128 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each AES-GMAC key is 20 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit AES key, and the remaining four
      octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

   AES-GMAC-ESP with a 192 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each AES-GMAC key is 28 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit AES key, and the remaining four
      octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

   AES-GMAC-ESP with a 256 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each AES GMAC key is 36 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit AES key, and the remaining four
      octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.


9.2  Phase 1 Identifier

   This document does not specify the conventions for using AES-GMAC for
   IKE Phase 1 negotiations.  For AES-GMAC to be used in this manner, a
   separate specification is needed, and an Encryption Algorithm
   Identifier needs to be assigned.  Implementations SHOULD use an IKE
   Phase 1 cipher which is at least as strong as AES-GMAC.  The use of
   AES CBC [RFC3602] with the same key size as used by AES-GMAC-ESP is
   RECOMMENDED.

9.3  Phase 2 Identifier

   For IKE Phase 2 negotiations, IANA has assigned <TBD> as the ESP

   Transform Identifier for AES-GMAC with an eight-byte explicit IV.

9.4  Key Length Attribute

   Since the AES supports three key lengths, the Key Length attribute
   MUST be specified in the IKE Phase 2 exchange [RFC2407].  The Key
   Length attribute MUST have a value of 128, 192 or 256.

10.  Test Vectors

   Appendix B of [GCM] provides test vectors that will assist
   implementers with AES-GMAC.

11.  Security Considerations

   GMAC is provably secure against adversaries that can adaptively
   choose plaintexts, ICVs and the AAD field, under standard
   cryptographic assumptions (roughly, that the output of the underlying
   cipher under a randomly chosen key is indistinguishable from a
   randomly selected output).  Essentially, this means that, if used
   within its intended parameters, a break of GMAC implies a break of
   the underlying block cipher.  The proof of security is available in
   [GCMP].

   The most important security consideration is that the IV never repeat
   for a given key.  In part, this is handled by disallowing the use of
   AES-GMAC when using statically configured keys, as discussed in
   Section 2.

   When IKE is used to establish fresh keys between two peer entities,
   separate keys are established for the two traffic flows.  If a
   different mechanism is used to establish fresh keys, one that
   establishes only a single key to protect packets, then there is a
   high probability that the peers will select the same IV values for
   some packets.  Thus, to avoid counter block collisions, ESP
   implementations that permit use of the same key for protecting
   packets with the same peer MUST ensure that the two peers assign
   different salt values to the security association (SA).

   The other consideration is that, as with any block cipher mode of
   operation, the security of all data protected under a given security
   association decreases slightly with each message.

   To protect against this problem, implementations MUST generate a
   fresh key before processing 2^64 blocks of data with a given key.
   Note that it is impossible to reach this limit when using 32-bit
   Sequence Numbers.

   Note that, for each message, GMAC calls the block cipher only once.

12.  Design Rationale

   This specification was designed to be as similar to the AES-GCM ESP
   [GCM-ESP] as possible.  We re-use the design and implementation
   experience from that specification.

13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned three ESP transform numbers for use with AES GMAC:
   "TBD1" for AES-128 GMAC, "TBD2" for AES-192 GMAC, "TBD3" for AES-256
   GMAC.

14.  Acknowledgements

   Our discussions with Fabio Maino and David Black significantly
   improved this specification.  This work is closely modeled after AES-
   GCM, which itself is closely modeled after Russ Housley's AES-CCM
   transform [CCM-ESP].  Additionally, the GCM mode of operation was
   originally conceived as an improvement to the CWC mode [CWC] in which
   Doug Whiting and Yoshi Konoho paricipated; this work provided the
   first unencumbered block cipher mode capable of supporting high-speed
   authenticated encryption.  We express our thanks to Fabio, David,
   Russ, Doug, and Yoshi.
