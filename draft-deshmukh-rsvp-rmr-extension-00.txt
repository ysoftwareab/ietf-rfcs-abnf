Abstract

   Rings are the most common topology in access and aggregation
   networks.  However, the use of MPLS as the transport protocol for
   rings is very limited today.  draft-ietf-mpls-rmr-02 describes a
   mechanism to handle rings efficiently using MPLS.  This document
   describes the extensions to the RSVP protocol for signaling MPLS
   label switched paths in rings.

1.  Introduction

   This document extends RSVP-TE [RFC3209] to establish label-switched
   path (LSP) tunnels in the ring topology.  Rings are auto-discovered
   using the mechanisms mentioned in the [draft-ietf-mpls-rmr-02].
   Either IS-IS [RFC5305] or OSPF[RFC3630] can be used as the IGP for
   auto-discovering the rings.

   After the rings are auto-discovered, each ring node knows its
   clockwise (CW) and anticlockwise (AC) ring neighbors and its ring
   links.  All of the express links in the ring also get identified as
   part of the auto-discovery process.  At this point, every node in the
   ring informs the RSVP protocol to begin the signaling of the ring
   LSPs.

   Section 2 covers the terminology used in this document.  Section 3
   presents the RSVP protocol extensions needed to support MPLS rings.
   Section 4 describes the procedures of RSVP LSP signaling in detail.

2.  Terminology

   A ring consists of a subset of n nodes {R_i, 0 <= i < n}.  We define
   the direction from node R_i to R_i+1 as "clockwise" (CW) and the
   reverse direction as "anti-clockwise" (AC).  As there may be several
   rings in a graph, we number each ring with a distinct ring ID RID.

                        Figure 1: Ring with 8 nodes

   The following terminology is used for ring LSPs:

   Ring ID (RID):  A non-zero number that identifies a ring; this is
      unique in some scope of a Service Provider's network.  A node may
      belong to multiple rings.

   Ring node:  A member of a ring.  Note that a device may belong to
      several rings.

   Node index:  A logical numbering of nodes in a ring, from zero upto
      one less than the ring size.  Used purely for exposition in this
      document.

   Ring neighbors:  Nodes whose indices differ by one (modulo ring
      size).

   Ring links:  Links that connect ring neighbors.

   Express links:  Links that connect non-neighboring ring nodes.

   MP2P LSP:  Each LSP in the ring is a multipoint to point LSP such
      that LSP can have multiple ingress nodes and one egress node.

3.  RSVP Extensions

   Since the procedures of signaling ring LSPs will be different from
   the signaling of regular RSVP LSPs, a new C-Type is defined here for
   the SESSION object.  This new C-Type will help to clearly

Internet-Draft           RSVP Extensions for RMR               July 2016


   differentiate ring LSPs from regular LSPs.  In addition, new flags
   are introduced in the SESSION object to represent the ring direction
   of the corresponding Path message.

                              SESSION Object

   Ring anchor node address:   IPv4 address of the anchor node.  Each
      anchor node creates a LSP addressed to itself.

   MBB ID:   A 16-bit identifier used in the SESSION.  This "Make-
      before-break" (MBB) ID is useful for graceful ring changes.  If a
      new node is being added to the ring or some existing node goes
      down and we have to signal a smaller ring, in those cases, anchor
      node creates a new tunnel with a different "MBB ID".

   Ring ID:   A 32-bit number that identifies a ring; this is unique in
      some scope of a Service Provider's network.  This number remains
      constant throughout the existence of ring.

   Ring Flags:   For each ring, the anchor node starts signaling of a
      ring LSP.  Ring LSP RL_i, anchored on node R_i, consists of two
      counter-rotating unicast LSPs that start and end at R_i.  One LSP
      will be in the clockwise direction and other LSP will be in the
      anti-clockwise direction.  A ring LSP is "multipoint": any node
      R_j can use RL_i to send traffic to R_i; this can be in either the
      CW or AC directions, or both (i.e., load balanced).  Two new flags
      are defined in the SESSION object which define the ring direction
      of the corresponding Path message.

   ClockWise(CW) Direction  0x01:   This flag indicates that the
      corresponding Path message is traveling in the ClockWise(CW)
      direction along the ring.

Internet-Draft           RSVP Extensions for RMR               July 2016


   Anti-ClockWise(AC) Direction  0x02:   This flag indicates that the
      corresponding Path message is traveling in the Anti-ClockWise(AC)
      direction along the ring.

3.2.  SENDER_TEMPLATE,FILTER_SPEC Objects

   There will be no changes to the SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTER_SPEC
   objects.  The format of the above 2 objects will be similar to the
   definitions in RFC 3209.  [RFC3209] Only the semantics of these
   objects will slightly change.  This will be explained in section
   Section 4.5 below.

4.  Ring Signaling Procedures

   A ring node indicates in its IGP updates the ring LSP signaling
   protocols that it supports.  This can be LDP and/or RSVP-TE.
   Ideally, each node should support both.  If the ring is configured
   with RSVP as the signaling protocol, then once a ring node R_i knows
   the RID, its ring links and directions, it kicks off ring RSVP LSP
   signaling automatically.

4.1.  Differences from regular RSVP-TE LSPs

   Ring LSPs differ from regular RSVP-TE LSPs in several ways:

   1.  Ring LSPs (by construction) form a loop.

   2.  Ring LSPs are multipoint-to-point.  Any ring node can inject
   traffic into a ring LSP.

   3.  The bandwidth of a ring LSP can change hop-to-hop.

   4.  Ring LSPs are protected without the use of bypass or detour LSPs.
   Ring LSP protection is akin to SONET/SDH ring protection.

4.2.  LSP signaling

   After the ring auto-discovery process, each anchor node creates a LSP
   addressed to itself.  This ring LSP contains of a pair of counter-
   rotating unicast LSPs.  So, for a ring containing N nodes, there will
   be 2N total LSPs signaled.

   There is no need for ERO object in the Path message.  The Path
   message for ring LSPs has the following format:

        <Path Message> ::=  <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                                <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                                <TIME_VALUES>
                                <LABEL_REQUEST>
                                [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                                <sender descriptor list>

        <sender descriptor list> ::= <sender descriptor>|
                                         <sender descriptor list> <sender descriptor>
        <sender descriptor> ::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>



   The anchor node creates 2 Path messages traveling in opposite
   directions.  The SESSION format MUST be as per the description in
   Section 3.1.  The anchor node which creates the LSP will insert it's
   own address in the "Ring node anchor address" field of the SESSION
   object.  So effectively, the Path messages are addressed to the
   originating node itself.

   The SESSION flags of these 2 Path messages are different.  The Path
   message sent to the CW neighbor MUST have the CW flag set in the
   SESSION object to signal the LSP going in the clockwise direction.
   The Path message sent to the AC neighbor MUST have the AC flag set to
   signal the LSP in the anti-clockwise direction.  The details for
   signaling over express links will be given in a future version.

   When an incoming Path message is received at the ring node R_i, it
   consults the results of auto-discovery to find the appropriate ring
   neighbor.  If the incoming Path message has CW direction flag set,
   then R_i sends a Path message to its CW ring neighbor (and vice
   versa).  Thus, there is no need of ERO in the Path message.  The Path
   message is routed locally at each ring based on the ring auto-
   discovery calculations.

   The RESV message for ring LSPs also uses the new RING_IPv4 SESSION
   object.  When the Path message originated from the anchor node R_i
   reaches back to R_i, R_i generates a Resv message.  Note that this
   means that anchor node is both Ingress and Egress for the Path
   message.  The Resv message copies the same ring flags as received in
   the corresponding Path message.  So, a Resv message for a CW LSP goes
   in the AC direction (unlike the Path message, which goes CW).  This
   is done to correctly match Path and corresponding Resv messages at
   transit ring nodes.  Upon receiving Resv message with CW flag set,
   the ring node will forward the Resv message to its AC neighbor.

   Each ring node R_i allocates CW and AC labels for each ring LSP RL_k.
   As the signaling propagates around the ring, CW and AC labels are



Deshmukh & Kompella      Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           RSVP Extensions for RMR               July 2016


   exchanged.  When R_i receives CW and AC labels for RL_k from its ring
   neighbors, primary and fast reroute (FRR) paths for RL_k are
   installed at R_i.

   Consider the following three nodes of the ring, and their signaling
   interactions for LSP RL_5 originating from anchor node R5:


                            P5_CW ->     P5_CW ->
                            Q5_CW <-     Q5_CW <-
            ... ------ R7 --------- R8 --------- R9 ------ ...
                            P5_AC <-     P5_AC <-
                            Q5_AC ->     Q5_AC ->

   P corresponds to the Path message and Q corresponds to the Resv
   message.

   Also, since ring LSPs are MP2P in nature, each ring node SHOULD also
   signal a Path message towards anchor node.  The procedure for that is
   as follows:

   When a ring node R5 receives a Path message initiated by anchor node
   R1(for anchor lsp "lsp1"), R5 SHOULD make a copy of the received Path
   message for "lsp1".  R5 then modifies the sender-template object from
   the copied Path message for "lsp1".  In the sender-template object,
   R5 uses the sender address as the loopback address of node R5 and
   lsp-id = X.  R5 then forwards this new Path message to it's ring
   neighbor.  The original anchor Path message has sender address as
   loopback address of R1 and lsp-id = X.

   So at this point, there will be 2 different path messages existing
   for lsp1 First Path message will be for the anchor LSP with sender
   address = node R1.  Second Path message will be for the ring LSP with
   sender address = node R5.

   When node R1 receives this modified Path message, it replies with the
   Resv message containing the same label it advertised for the original
   anchor lsp "lsp1".  The SESSION object of the Resv message will also
   exactly match with the received Path message.  Only the FILTER_SPEC
   object in the Resv message will have the sender address as loopback
   of node R5.  As this Resv message propagates back towards R5, all the
   transit nodes also send the same label that they have allocated for
   the original anchor lsp "lsp1".  So no new label routes get installed
   as part of signaling for this ring lsp.  The anchor LSP and all of
   their associated ring LSPs share label routes.  The label actions are
   described below in Section 4.3.

Internet-Draft           RSVP Extensions for RMR               July 2016


4.3.  Protection

   In the rings, there are no protection LSPs -- no node or link bypass
   LSPs, no standby LSPs and no detours.  Protection is via the "other"
   direction around the ring, which is why ring LSPs are in counter-
   rotating pairs.  Protection works in the same way for link, node and
   ring LSP failures.

   Since each ring LSP is a MP2P LSP, any ring node can inject traffic
   onto a LSP whose anchor might be a different ring node.  To achieve
   the above, an ingress route will be installed as follows at every
   ring node J, for a given ring-LSP with anchor Rk (say 1.2.3.4).


            1.2.3.4  ->  (Push CL_J+1,K, NH: R_J+1)       # CW
                     ->  (Push AL_J-1,K, NH: R_J-1)       # AC

                     CL = Clockwise label
                     AL = Anti-Clockwise label


   Traffic will either be load balanced in the CW and AC directions or
   the traffic will be sent on just CW or AC lsp based on parameters
   such as hop-count, policy etc.

   Also, 2 transit routes will be installed for the anchor LSP
   transiting from node Rj as follows:


            CL_J,K ->  SWAP(CL_J+1,K,  NH: R_J+1)              #CW
                   ->  SWAP(AL_J-1,K , NH: R_J-1)              #AC

                       CL = Clockwise label
                       AL = Anti-Clockwise label
                       CW NH has weight 1, AC NH has higher-weight.


            AL_J,K -> SWAP(AL_J-1,K , NH: R_J-1)  #AC
                   -> SWAP(CL_J+1,K,  NH: R_J+1)  #CW

                       CL = Clockwise label
                       AL = Anti-Clockwise label
                       AC NH has weight 1, CW NH has higher weight.



   Suppose a packet headed in anti-clockwise direction towards R5 and it
   arrives at node R8.  Lets say that now R8 learns there is a link

Internet-Draft           RSVP Extensions for RMR               July 2016


   failure in the AC direction.  R8 reroutes this packet back onto the
   clockwise direction.  This reroute action is pre-programmed in the
   LFIB, to minimize the time between detection of a fault and the
   corresponding recovery action.

   At this time, R8 also sends a notification to R7 that the AC
   direction is not working, so that R7 can similarly switch traffic to
   the CW direction.  These notification SHOULD propagate CW until each
   traffic source on the ring CW of the failure uses the CW
   direction.For RSVP-TE, this notification is sent in the form of
   PathErr message.

   To provide this notification, the ring node detecting failure SHOULD
   send a Path Error message with error code of "Notify" and an error
   value field of ("Tunnel locally repaired").  This Path Error code and
   value is same as defined in RFC 4090[RFC4090] for the notification of
   local repair.

   Note that the failure of a node or a link will not necessarily affect
   all ring LSPs.  Thus, it is important to identify the affected LSPs
   and only switch the affected LSPs.

4.4.  Ring changes

   A ring node can go down resulting in a smaller ring or a new node can
   be added to the ring which will increase the ring size.  In both of
   the above cases, the ring auto-discovery process SHOULD kick in and
   it SHOULD calculate a new ring with the changed ring nodes.

   When the ring auto-discovery process is complete, IGP will signal
   RSVP to begin the MBB process for the existing ring LSPs.  For this
   MBB process, the anchor node will create a new Path message with a
   different "MBB ID" in the SESSION object.  All other fields in the
   SESSION Object will remain same as the existing Path message(before
   the ring change).

   This new Path message will then propagate along the ring neighbors in
   the same way as the original Path message.  Each ring neighbor SHOULD
   forward the Path message to it's appropriate neighbor based on the
   new auto-discovery calculations.

   For the ring links which are common between the old and new LSPs, the
   LSPs will share resources(SE style reservation) on those ring links.
   Note that here we are using MBB_ID in the SESSION object to share
   resources instead of the LSP_ID in the SENDER_TEMPLATE Object(which
   is used in RSVP-TE for sharing resources as described in RFC 3209
   [RFC4090]).  The LSP_ID use is reserved for a different functionality

4.5.  Bandwidth management

   For RSVP-TE LSPs, bandwidths may be signaled in both directions.
   However, these are not provisioned either; rather, one does "reverse
   call admission control".  When a service needs to use an LSP, the
   ring node where the traffic enters the ring attempts to increase the
   bandwidth on the LSP to the egress.  If successful, the service is
   admitted to the ring.

               Figure 2: BW Management in Ring with 8 nodes

   Let's say that Ring node R5 wants to increase the BW for the LSP
   whose egress is at node R1.  To achieve this BW increase, Ring node
   R5 has to increase BW along the LSP anchored at node R1(say lsp1).

   R5 makes a copy of the existing ring Path message for lsp1.  R5 then
   modifies the sender-template object from the copied Path message for
   "lsp1".  In the sender-template object, R5 uses the sender address as
   the loopback address of node R5 and lsp-id = X+1.  R5 also modifies
   the TSPEC object which represents the BW increase/decrease in this
   new Path message.  R5 then forwards this new Path message to it's
   ring neighbor.  Note that R5 MUST also continue signaling the
   original anchor Path message received from ring node R1 for lsp1.
   The original anchor Path message has sender address as loopback
   address of R1.

   Now, let's say, node 5 wants to increase BW again for lsp1, then R5
   adds a new SENDER_TEMPLATE object in the existing Path message for
   "lsp1" with sender address as loopback of node 5 and lsp-id = X+2.
   So at this point, there will be 2 different path messages existing
   for lsp1 First Path message will be for the anchor LSP with sender
   address = node 1.  Second Path message will contain 2 SENDER_TEMPLATE
   objects as [node5, lsp-id = X+1] and [node5, lsp-id =X+2].

   Similarly, if node R6 wants to increase the BW for "lsp1", it SHOULD
   create a new Path message containing SENDER_TEMPLATE object with

   sender address = loopback of node 6 and lsp-id = Y+1.  Thus, the LSP-
   ID field is local to each sender node along the ring.

   If sufficient BW is available all the way towards ring node R1, then
   this new Path message reaches node R1.  R1 generates a Resv message
   with the correct FILTER_SPEC object corresponding to the received
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object.  This Resv message will also have the correct
   FLOWSPEC object as per the requested bandwidth.

   If sufficient BW is not available at some downstream (say node R9),
   then ring node R9 SHOULD generate a PathErr message with the
   corresponding Sender Template Object.  When node R5 receives this
   PathErr message, R5 understands that the BW increase was not
   successful.  Note that the existing established bandwidths for lsp1
   are not affected by this new PathErr message.

   When ring node R5 no longer needs the BW reservation, then ring node
   R5 SHOULD originate a PathTear message with the appropriate Sender
   Template Object as described above.  Every downstream node SHOULD
   then remove bandwidth allocated on the corresponding link on receipt
   of this PathTear message.

   Also, note that as part of this BW increase or decrease process, any
   ring node does not actually change any label associated with the LSP.
   So, the label remains same as it was signaled initially when the
   anchor LSP came up.

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not anticipated that either the notion of MPLS rings or the
   extensions to various protocols to support them will cause new
   security loopholes.  As this document is updated, this section will
   also be updated.
