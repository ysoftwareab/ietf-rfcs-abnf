Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the structure of the IETF Administrative
   Support Activity (IASA) as an IETF-controlled activity housed within
   the Internet Society (ISOC) legal umbrella.  It defines the roles and
   responsibilities of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
   (IAOC), the IETF Administrative Director (IAD), and ISOC in the
   fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It
   also defines the membership and selection rules for the IAOC.

   The IETF undertakes its technical activities as an ongoing, open,
   consensus-based process.  This document defines an administrative
   support structure intended to be responsive to the administrative
   needs of the IETF technical community, and describes how that support
   structure fits under ISOC's organizational umbrella.  This document
   does not affect the ISOC-IETF working relationship as it relates to
   standards development or the communication of technical advice
   relevant to the policy and educational goals of ISOC.

   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) provides the
   administrative structure required to support the IETF standards
   process and to support the IETF's technical activities.  As of the
   time at which this document was written, this included the work of
   IETF working groups, the IESG, the IAB, and the IRTF.  Should the
   IETF standards process at some future date come to include other
   technical activities, the IASA shall provide administrative support
   for those activities as well.  Such support includes, as appropriate,
   undertaking or contracting for the work described in
   [RFC3716],including IETF document and data management, IETF meetings,
   and any operational agreements or contracts with the RFC Editor and
   IANA.  The IASA is also ultimately responsible for the financial
   activities associated with IETF administrative support such as
   collecting IETF meeting fees, paying invoices, managing budgets and
   financial accounts, and so forth.

   The IASA is responsible for ensuring that the IETF's administrative
   needs are met, and met well.  The IETF does not expect the IASA to
   undertake the bulk of this work directly; rather, the IETF expects
   the IASA to contract this work from others, and manage these
   contractual relationships to achieve efficiency, transparency and
   cost effectiveness.

   The IASA is distinct from IETF-related technical functions, such as
   the RFC Editor, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and
   the IETF standards process itself.  The IASA has no influence on the
   technical decisions of the IETF or on the technical contents of IETF
   work.  Note, however, that this in no way prevents people who form
   part of the IASA from participating as individuals in IETF technical

   activities.

1.1  Editors' Notes

      Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section prior to
      publication.

   This document is still a work in progress, primarily due to time
   pressure and lack of a clear consensus on some issues.

   In some cases the best way to handle a particular suggestion (in the
   editors' opinion, at any rate) has been to incorporate new text with
   an "Editors' note" which attempts to explain the change.

   The editors request that substantive comments and requested changes
   be sent, one per message, with a clear and meaningful subject line on
   each message, as this will make it easier for the editors to keep
   track of change requests.

1.2  Open Issues

      Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section prior to
      publication.

   Discussion of open issues has progressed quickly enough in recent
   weeks that a summary of the current state of each open issue in this
   document would be obsolete by the time anybody but the editors had a
   chance to see it.  A kind volunteer is now keeping reasonably
   up-to-date status of each known open issue is available in an online
   tracking system:

   URL: https://rt.psg.com

   Username: ietf

   Password: ietf

   Queue: iasa-bcp

   The "status" of each tracked issue is stored in a "custom field"
   named "Discussion".  That status is also mapped onto the system's
   priority field, so you can see it in the list of tickets and so you
   can sort on it.  The mapping is as follows:

   1.  No dicussion

   2.  No consensus

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   1.  The IETF intends to establish a structure (the IASA) in order to
       get IETF administrative functions managed appropriately,
       according to good administrative, fiscal, and management
       principles.  The IASA includes the IAD and the IAOC, and shall be
       housed within ISOC.

   2.  The IAD and IAOC shall not have any authority over the IETF
       standards development activities.  This document does not modify
       ISOC's other roles related to the IETF standard process.

   3.  The IAD and IAOC, in cooperation with the ISOC President/CEO and
       staff, shall develop an annual budget for the IASA.  The budget
       must clearly identify all expected direct and indirect
       expenditures related to the IASA.  ISOC, through its normal
       procedures, shall evaluate and adopt the IASA budget as part of
       ISOC's own budget process and commit to ensuring funds to support
       the approved budget.

   4.  Responsibility for the evaluation, review and negotiation of
       contracts and other IETF administrative and support agreements
       and other expenditures of funds under the IASA shall rest with
       the IAD, operating in accordance with policies and procedures set
       by the IAOC and consistent with ISOC operating policies.

   5.  Once funds or in-kind donations have been credited to the IETF
       accounts, they shall be irrevocably allocated to the support of
       the IETF.

   6.  There shall be a detailed public accounting to separately
       identify all funds available to and all expenditures relating to
       the IETF and to the IASA, including any donations, of funds or
       in-kind, received by ISOC for IETF-related activities.  In-kind
       donations shall only be accepted at the direction of the IAD and
       IAOC.

   7.  The IETF, through the IASA, shall have a perpetual right to use,
       display, distribute, reproduce, modify and create derivatives of
       all data created in support of IETF activities.

   8.  The IASA shall establish a target for a reserve fund to cover
       normal operating expenses and meeting expenses in accordance with
       prudent planning, and ISOC shall work with the IASA to build up
       and maintain the reserve.

   The remainder of this document contains details based on the above
   principles.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


2.3  Community Consensus and Grant of Authority

   The IETF is a consensus-based group, and authority to act on behalf
   of the community requires a high degree of consensus and the
   continued consent of the community.  After a careful process of
   deliberation, a broad-based community consensus emerged to house the
   IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) within the Internet
   Society.  This document reflects that consensus.

2.4  Termination and Change

   Any change to this agreement shall require a similar level of
   community consensus and deliberation and shall be reflected by a
   subsequent Best Current Practice (BCP) document.

2.5  Effective Date for Commencement of IASA

   The procedures in this document shall become operational immediately
   after this document has been approved by the process defined in BCP 9
   [RFC2026] and has been affirmed by a resolution of the ISOC Board of
   Trustees.

3.  Structure of the IASA

   The IASA structure is designed to ensure accountability and
   transparency of the IETF administrative and fiscal activities to the
   IETF community.  The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
   directs and oversees the IASA.  The IAOC consists of volunteers, all
   chosen directly or indirectly by the IETF community, as well as
   appropriate ex officio members from ISOC and IETF leadership.  The
   IAOC shall be accountable to the IETF community for the
   effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the IASA.

   The IASA consists initially of a single full-time ISOC employee, the
   IETF Administrative Director (IAD), who is entitled to act on behalf
   of the IASA at the direction of the IAOC.  The IAD is likely to draw
   on financial, legal and administrative support furnished by ISOC
   support staff or consultants.  Costs for ISOC support staff and
   consultants are allocated based on actual expenses or on some other
   allocation model determined by consultation between the IAOC and
   ISOC.

   Although the IAD is an ISOC employee, he or she works under the
   direction of the IAOC.  The IAD is selected and hired by a committee
   of the IAOC.  The members of this committee are appointed by the
   IAOC, and consist at minimum of the ISOC President and the IETF
   Chair.  This same committee is responsible for setting the IAD's
   initial compensation, reviewing the performance of the IAD



Austein & Wijnen         Expires June 23, 2005                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   periodically, and determining any changes to the IAD's employment and
   compensation.

   In principle, IETF administrative functions should be outsourced.
   The IAD is responsible for negotiating and maintaining such
   contracts, as well as providing any coordination necessary to make
   sure the IETF administrative support functions are covered properly.
   The IAOC is accountable for the structure of the IASA and thus
   decides which functions are to be outsourced.  All outsourcing must
   be via well-defined contracts or equivalent instruments.  Both
   outsourced and in-house functions must be clearly specified and
   documented with well-defined deliverables, service level agreements,
   and transparent accounting for the cost of such functions.

   If the IASA cannot comply with the procedures described in this
   document for legal, accounting or practical reasons, the IAOC shall
   report that fact to the community, along with the variant procedure
   the IAOC intends to follow.  If the problem is a long-term one, the
   IAOC shall ask the IETF to update this document to reflect the
   changed procedure.

3.1  IAD Responsibilities

   The IAD is responsible for working with the IAOC and others to
   understand the administrative requirements of the IETF, and for
   managing the IASA to meet those needs.  This includes determining the
   structure of the IASA effort, establishing an operating budget,
   negotiating contracts with service providers, managing the business
   relationship with those providers, and establishing mechanisms to
   track their performance.  The IAD may also manage other contractors
   or ISOC employees (such as support staff) as necessary, when such
   contractors or employees are engaged in IASA-related work.

   The IAD is responsible for running IASA in an open and transparent
   manner, and for producing regular monthly, quarterly, and annual
   financial and operational updates for IAOC and IETF community review.

   The IAD is responsible for administering the IETF finances, managing
   separate financial accounts for the IASA, and establishing and
   administering the IASA budget.  While ISOC will need to put some
   financial controls in place to protect ISOC's fiscal stability, the
   IAD (with IAOC approval, as appropriate) should have signing
   authority consistent with carrying out IASA work effectively,
   efficiently and independently.  If there are any problems regarding
   the level of financial approval granted to the IAD, the IAOC and ISOC
   shall work out a policy that is mutually agreeable, and shall do so
   within a reasonable timeframe.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   The IAD negotiates service contracts, with input, as appropriate,
   from other bodies, and with review, as appropriate, by the IAOC.  The
   IAOC should establish guidelines for what level of review is expected
   based on contract type, size, cost, or duration.  ISOC executes
   contracts on behalf of the IASA, after whatever review ISOC requires
   to ensure that the contracts meet ISOC's legal and financial
   requirements.

   The IAD is responsible for ensuring that all contracts give IASA and
   the IETF the perpetual right to use, display, distribute, reproduce,
   modify and create derivatives of all data created in support of IETF
   activities.  This is necessary to make sure the IETF has access to
   the data it needs at all times, and to ensure that the IASA can
   change contractors as needed without disrupting IETF work.

   Whenever reasonable, if software is developed under an IASA contract
   it should should remain usable by the IETF beyond the terms of the
   contract.  Some ways of achieving this are by IASA ownership or an
   open source license; an open source license is preferable.  The IAD
   shall decide how best to serve the IETF's interests when making such
   contracts.

   The IAD and IAOC are responsible for making all business decisions
   regarding the IASA.  In particular, the ISOC Board of Trustees shall
   not have direct influence over the choice of IASA contractors or IETF
   meeting sponsors.  This restriction is meant to enforce the
   separation between fund raising and the actual operation of the
   standards process.

   The IAD prepares an annual budget, which is subject to review and
   approval by the IAOC.  The IAD is responsible for presenting this
   budget to the ISOC Board of Trustees, as part of ISOC's annual
   financial planning process.  The IAOC is responsible for ensuring the
   budget's suitability for meeting the IETF community's administrative
   needs, but the IAOC does not bear fiduciary responsibility for ISOC.
   The ISOC Board of Trustees therefore needs to review and understand
   the budget and planned activity in enough detail to carry out their
   fiduciary responsibility properly.  The IASA publishes its complete
   budget to the IETF community each year.

3.2  IAOC Responsibilities

   The IAOC's role is to provide appropriate direction to the IAD, to
   review the IAD's regular reports, and to oversee the IASA functions
   to ensure that the administrative needs of the IETF community are
   being properly met.  The IAOC's mission is not to be be engaged in
   the day-to-day administrative work of IASA, but rather to provide
   appropriate direction, oversight and approval.



Austein & Wijnen         Expires June 23, 2005                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   Therefore, the IAOC's responsibilities are:

   o  To select the IAD and provide high-level review and direction for
      his or her work.  This task should be handled by a sub-committee,
      as described in Section 3.

   o  To review the IAD's plans and contracts to ensure that they will
      meet the administrative needs of the IETF.

   o  To track whether the IASA functions are meeting the IETF
      community's administrative needs, and to work with the IAD to
      determine a plan for corrective action if they are not.

   o  To review the IAD's budget proposals to ensure that they will meet
      the IETF's needs, and review the IAD's regular financial reports.

   o  To ensure that the IASA is run in a transparent and accountable
      manner.  While the day-to-day work should be delegated to the IAD
      and others, the IAOC is responsible for ensuring that IASA
      finances and operational status are tracked appropriately, and
      that monthly, quarterly, and annual financial and operational
      reports are published to the IETF community.

   o  To designate, in consultation with the IAB and the IESG, the
      person or people who carry out the tasks which other IETF process
      documents say are carried out by the IETF Executive Director.

   The IAOC's role is to direct and review, not perform, the work of the
   IAD and IASA.  The IAOC holds periodic teleconferences and
   face-to-face meetings as needed to carry out the IAOC's duties
   efficiently and effectively.

   If there is no IAD or the IAD is unavailable, the IAOC may
   temporarily assign the IAD's duties to individual members of the
   IAOC.

3.3  Relationship of the IAOC to Existing IETF Leadership

   The IAOC is directly accountable to the IETF community for the
   performance of the IASA.  However, the nature of the IAOC's work
   involves treating the IESG and IAB as major internal customers of the
   administrative support services.  The IAOC and the IAD should not
   consider their work successful unless the IESG and IAB are also
   satisfied with the administrative support that the IETF is receiving.

3.4  IAOC Decision Making

   The IAOC attempts to reach all decisions unanimously.  If unanimity

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   cannot be achieved, the IAOC chair may conduct informal polls to
   determine the consensus of the group.  In cases where it is
   necessary, some decisions may be made by voting.  For the purpose of
   judging consensus or voting, only the "voting members" (as defined in
   Section 4) shall be counted.  If voting results in a tie, then IAOC
   chair decides how to proceed with the decision process.

   IAOC decisions are taken by a majority of the non-conflicted IAOC
   members who are available to vote, whether in person or via other
   reasonable means determined to be suitable by the members of the
   IAOC.  The IAOC decides further details about its decision-making
   rules.  These rules will be made public.

   The IAOC shall establish and publish rules to handle conflict of
   interest situations.

   All IAOC decisions shall be minuted, and IAOC minutes shall be
   published regularly.

   If someone believes that the IAOC has violated the IAOC rules and
   procedures, he or she can ask the IETF leadership to investigate the
   matter, using the same procedure as is used for appeals of procedural
   issues in the IETF, starting with the IESG.

   If the IESG, IAB or the ISOC Board of Trustees find that procedures
   have been violated, they may advise the IAOC, but do not have
   authority to overturn or change a decision of the IAOC.

   The IAOC plays no role in appeals of WG Chair, IESG, or IAB
   decisions.

4.  IAOC Membership, Selection and Accountability

   The IAOC shall consist of eight voting members who shall be selected
   as follows:

   o  2 members appointed by the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom);

   o  1 member appointed by the IESG;

   o  1 member appointed by the IAB;

   o  1 member appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees;

   o  The IETF Chair (ex officio);

   o  The IAB Chair (ex officio);




Austein & Wijnen         Expires June 23, 2005                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   o  The ISOC President/CEO (ex officio).

   The IETF Administrative Director also serves, ex officio, as a
   non-voting member of the IAOC.

   The IAOC may also choose to invite liaisons from other groups, but is
   not required to do so; the IAOC decides whether or not to have a
   liaison to any particular group.  Any such liaisons are non-voting.
   Responsibility for selecting the individual filling a particular
   liaison role lies with the body from which the IAOC has requested the
   liaison.

   Appointed members of the IAOC serve two year terms.  IAOC terms
   normally end at the first IETF meeting of a year, just as as IAB and
   IESG terms do.

   The members of the IAOC shall select one of its appointed voting
   members to serve as the chair of the IAOC, with all of the duties and
   responsibilities normally associated with such a position.  The term
   of the IAOC chair shall be one year, with no restriction on renewal.
   The chair of the IAOC may be removed at any time by the affirmative
   vote of two-thirds of the voting members of the IAOC, or as a result
   of his or her departure from the IAOC.

   The chair of the IAOC shall have the authority to manage the
   activities and meetings of the IAOC.  The IAOC Chair has no formal
   duty to represent the IAOC, except as directed by IAOC consensus.

   The two NomCom-appointed IAOC members are chosen using the procedures
   described in RFC 3777 [RFC3777].  For the initial IAOC selection, the
   IESG will provide the list of desired qualifications for these
   positions; in later years, the IAOC will provide this qualification
   list.  The IESG will serve as the confirming body for IAOC
   appointments by the NomCom.

   While there are no hard rules regarding how the IAB and the IESG
   should select members of the IAOC, such appointees need not be
   current IAB or IESG members (and probably should not be, if only to
   avoid overloading the existing leadership).  The IAB and IESG should
   choose people with some knowledge of contracts and financial
   procedures, who are familiar with the administrative support needs of
   the IAB, the IESG, or the IETF standards process.  The IAB and IESG
   should follow a fairly open process for these selections, perhaps
   with an open call for nominations or a period of public comment on
   the candidates.  The procedure for IAB selection of ISOC Board of
   Trustees [RFC3677] might be a good model for how this could work.
   After the IETF gains some experience with IAOC selection, these
   selection mechanisms should be documented more formally.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   Although the IAB, the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees choose some
   members of the IAOC, those members do not directly represent the
   bodies that chose them.  All members of the IAOC are accountable
   directly to the IETF community.  To receive direct feedback from the
   community, the IAOC holds an open meeting at least once per year at
   an IETF meeting.  This may take the form of an open IAOC plenary or a
   working meeting held during an IETF meeting slot.  The form and
   contents of this meeting are left to the discretion of the IAOC
   Chair.  The IAOC should also consider open mailing lists or other
   means to establish open communication with the community.

   IAOC members are subject to recall in the event that an IAOC member
   abrogates his or her duties or acts against the best interests of the
   IETF community.  Any appointed IAOC member, including those appointed
   by the IAB, IESG or ISOC Board of Trustees, may be recalled using the
   recall procedure defined in RFC 3777 [RFC3777].  IAOC members are
   not, however, subject to recall by the bodies that appointed them.

   If a vacancy occurs among the appointed members, this is filled by
   the appointing body for that position according to its procedures.

4.1  Initial IAOC Selection

   The initial IAOC selection will start after this document is approved
   as a BCP by the IESG and accepted by the ISOC Board of Trustees.  The
   IESG, IAB, and ISOC Board of Trustees should make their selections
   within 45-days of BCP approval, and the NomCom should make their
   selections as quickly as possible while complying with the documented
   NomCom procedures.  The IAOC will become active as soon as a majority
   (three or more) of the appointed members have been selected.

   Initially, the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees will make one-year
   appointments, the IAB will make a two-year appointment, and the
   NomCom will make one one-year appointment and one two-year
   appointment.  This will establish a pattern in which approximately
   half of the IAOC is selected each year.

5.  IASA Funding

   The IASA manages money from three sources:

   1.  IETF meeting revenues;

   2.  Designated donations to ISOC (both monetary and in-kind);

   3.  Other ISOC support.

   Note that the goal is to achieve and maintain a viable IETF support



Austein & Wijnen         Expires June 23, 2005                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   function based on available funding sources.  The IETF community
   expects the IAOC and ISOC to work together to attain that goal, and
   recognizes that doing so will require striking some sort of balance.
   For example, dropping the meeting fees to $0 and expecting ISOC to
   pick up the slack would not be viable in the long term, and neither
   would be raising the meeting fees to prohibitive levels in order to
   fund all non-meeting-related activities.

5.1  Divisional Accounting

   For bookkeeping purposes, funds managed by IASA should be accounted
   for in a separate set of accounts which can be rolled-up periodically
   to the equivalent of a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement
   for IASA alone after taking into account the effect of common items
   paid for or received by ISOC as a whole.

5.2  IETF Meeting Revenues

   Meeting revenues are an important source of funds for IETF functions.
   The IAD, in consultation with the IAOC, sets the meeting fees as part
   of the budgeting process.  All meeting revenues shall be credited to
   the appropriate IASA accounts.

5.3  Designated Donations, Monetary and In-Kind

   Donations are an essential component of funding.  The IASA undertakes
   no direct fund-raising activities.  This establishes a practice of
   separating IETF administrative and standards activities from
   fund-raising activities, and helps ensure that no undue influence may
   be ascribed to those from whom funds are raised.

   ISOC shall create and maintain appropriate structures and programs to
   coordinate donations intended to support the work of the IETF, and
   these will include mechanisms for both in-kind and direct
   contributions to the work supported by IASA.  Since ISOC will be the
   sole entity through whom donations may be made to the work of the
   IETF, ISOC shall ensure that those programs are not unduly
   restrictive.  For the benefit of individuals, smaller organizations
   and countries with developing economies, ISOC shall maintain programs
   that allow for designated donations to the IETF.

      Editors' note: Some have suggested we need explicit IETF consensus
      on the above.  So if you do not agree, please speak up ASAP.

      Editors' note: Removed "either using an overhead model or other
      unrestricted donation program." because it is too detailed and
      prescriptive.  Send objections ASAP if you do not agree.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   In-kind resources are owned by the ISOC on behalf of the IETF and
   shall be reported and accounted for in a manner that identifies them
   as such.  Designated monetary donations shall be credited to the
   appropriate IASA accounts.

5.4  Other ISOC Support

   Other ISOC support shall be based on the budget process as specified
   in Section 6.  ISOC shall periodically credit additional funds to the
   IASA accounts to cover anticipated expenditures for that period
   within the yearly budget.

   If ISOC pays any other IETF expenses directly, without transferring
   funds to the IASA, this shall be documented as a footnote to the IASA
   accounts.

5.5  IASA Expenses

   The IASA exists to support the IETF.  Therefore, only expenses
   related to supporting the IETF may be debited from the IASA accounts.

5.6  Operating Reserve

   As an initial guideline and in normal operating circumstances, the
   IASA should have an operating reserve for its activities sufficient
   to cover 6-months of non-meeting operational expenses, plus twice the
   recent average for meeting contract guarantees.  However, the IASA
   shall establish a target for a reserve fund to cover normal operating
   expenses and meeting expenses in accordance with prudent planning.
   Rather than having the IASA attempt to build that reserve in its
   separate accounts, the IASA looks to ISOC to build and provide that
   operational reserve, through whatever mechanisms ISOC deems
   appropriate: line of credit, financial reserves, meeting cancellation
   insurance, and so forth.  Such reserves do not appear
   instantaneously; the goal is to reach this level of reserves within 3
   years after the creation of the IASA.  Such funds shall be held in
   reserve for use by IASA for use in the event of IETF meeting
   cancellation or other unexpected fiscal emergencies.  These reserves
   shall only be spent on IETF support functions.

6.  IASA Budget Process

   While the IASA sets a budget for the IETF's administrative needs, its
   budget process clearly needs to be closely coordinated with ISOC's.
   The specific timeline shall be established each year by IASA and
   ISOC.  As an example, a general annual timeline for budgeting is:





Austein & Wijnen         Expires June 23, 2005                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   July 1: The IAD presents a budget proposal (prepared in consultation
      with ISOC staff) for the following fiscal year, with 3 year
      projections, to the IAOC.

   August 1: The IAOC approves the budget proposal for IETF purposes,
      after any appropriate revisions.  As the ISOC President is part of
      the IAOC, the IAOC should have a preliminary indication of how the
      budget will fit with ISOC's own budgetary expectations.  The
      budget proposal is passed to the ISOC Board of Trustees for review
      in accordance with their fiduciary duty.

   September 1: The ISOC Board of Trustees approves the budget proposal
      provisionally.  During the next 2 months, the budget may be
      revised to be integrated in ISOC's overall budgeting process.

   November 1: Final budget to the ISOC Board for approval.

   The dates described above are examples, and are subject to change.
   They will most likely be modified each year based on the dates of the
   second and third IETF meetings of that year.  They also need to be
   synchronized with the ISOC budgeting process.

   The IAD shall provide monthly accountings of expenses, and shall
   update expenditures forecasts every quarter.  This may require
   adjustment of the IASA budget: if so, the revised budget will need to
   be approved by the IAOC, the ISOC President/CEO and, if necessary,
   the ISOC Board of Trustees.

7.  ISOC Responsibilities for IASA

   Within ISOC, support for the IASA shall meet the following goals:

   Transparency: The IETF community shall have complete visibility into
      the financial and legal structure of the ISOC standards activity.
      In particular, a detailed budget for the entire standards
      activity, quarterly financial reports, and audited annual
      financial reports shall all be available to the IETF community.
      In addition, key contract material and MOUs shall also be publicly
      available.  The IAD and IAOC are responsible for providing regular
      overviews of the state of the IASA to the IETF community.

   Unification: As part of this arrangement, ISOC's sponsorship of the
      RFC Editor, IAB and IESG shall be managed as part of the IASA
      under the IAOC.

   Independence: The IASA shall be distinct from other ISOC activities.
      ISOC will support the IASA through the mechanisms specified in
      this document and its successors.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


   Support: ISOC shall work with the IAD and IAOC to ensure appropriate
      financial support for the IASA, following the mechanisms described
      in this document and its successors.

   Removability: While there is no current plan to transfer the legal
      and financial home of the IASA to another corporation, the IASA
      shall be structured to enable a clean transition in the event that
      the IETF community decides that such a transition is required and
      documents its consensus in a formal document (currently called a
      BCP).  In such a case, the IAOC shall give ISOC a minimum of six
      months notice before the transition formally occurs.  During that
      period, the IAOC and ISOC shall work together to create a smooth
      transition that does not result in any significant service outages
      or missed IETF meetings.  All contracts executed by ISOC on behalf
      of IASA shall either include a clause allowing termination by ISOC
      with six months notice, or shall be transferable to another
      corporation in the event that the IASA transitions away from ISOC.
      Any accrued funds, any IETF-specific intellectual property rights,
      and any IETF-specific data and tools shall also transition to the
      new entity.

   Within the constraints outlined above, all other details of how to
   structure this activity within ISOC (whether as a cost center, a
   department, or a formal subsidiary) shall be determined by ISOC in
   consultation with the IAOC.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the structure of the IETF's administrative
   support activity.  It introduces no security considerations for the
   Internet.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations in the traditional sense.
   However, some of the information in this document may affect how the
   IETF standards process interfaces with IANA, so IANA may be
   interested in the contents.

   document.

A.1  Changes in draft-ietf-iasa-bcp-03.txt

   o  Removed "Closed Issues" section, replaced "Open Issues" section
      with another pointer to the RT ticket queue, since that is now
      more likely to be up-to-date than any list in this document.

   o  Added text that IAOC specifies and publishes rules for conflict
      resolution.  See issue #754.

   o  Changed text on quarterly credits to IASA accounts as per
      discussion in issue #748.  Issue seems not closed yet.

   o  Clarifications in budget process, see issue #749.

   o  Editorial change on wording "rights in data" as per issue #735.

   o  Editorial changes as per issue #727.

      are published.  Issues #714 and #718.

   o  Refined text on removability (BCP doc) as per issue #751.

   o  Removed word "officer" from text, as per issue #731.

   o  Added a 2nd paragraph on IAOC decision making rules.  Issue #746.

      filling in if there is no IAD or when IAD is not available.  Issue
      #744.

   o  Clarified text in 2nd principle.  Issue #730.

   o  Added IETF to Section 2.1.  Issue #743.

   o  Changed wording of 3rd principle in Section 2.2 to make it clearer
      that budget development is an iterative process that happens in



Austein & Wijnen         Expires June 23, 2005                 [Page 20]

      cooperation with ISOC.

   o  Added a principle about the fact that IETF money stays IETF money
      once credited to IETF accounts.

   o  Changed the word "account" into "accounts" at a few places to be
      more in line with the concept of divisional accounting.


A.2  Changes in draft-ietf-iasa-bcp-02.txt

   o  Split issues list into separate lists of open issues and closed
      issues (as seen by the editors).  Removed some inline editors'
      comments when we believed that an issue has been resolved.

   o  Added Section 2.5 on when the procedures in this document become
      effective.

   o  Changed text in Section 5 to state that the goal is a viable IASA
      based on all funding as opposed to just meeting fees and
      designated donations.

   o  Added text to Section 2.2 stating that funds and donations shall
      be irrevocably assigned to IETF.

   o  Removed section on IAD Committees.

   o  Changed the text in Section 4 on IAOC Chair selection and
      responsibilities.  It is now very similar to IAB chair selection
      as in RFC2850.

   o  Various textual clarifications.  This also includes several
      changes of "will" and "should" into "shall".

   o  Moved disclaimer of variance procedure to Section 3 and
      generalized it.

      (should be) based.

   o  Added "Community Consensus and Grant of Authority" (Section 2.3).

   o  Added more acknowledgments (no doubt still incomplete).

   o  Clarified Section 5 and subsections.  Added Editors' note.

   o  Clarified what happens if IAOC voting results in a tie.

   o  Removed "insurance" example in Section 5.4.

   o  Added a reference to ISOC bylaws.

   o  Stop using term "liaison" to mean "non-voting IAOC member";
      instead, spell out which members are voting and which are not.
      Add text allowing IAOC to request non-voting liaisons from other
      bodies.

   o  Various editorial cleanups.


A.4  Changes in draft-ietf-iasa-bcp-00.txt

   o  Modified the text of Section 5.

   o  Added text on Reserve funds.

   o  Made IAB chair a voting member of IAOC; added tie-breaker rule
      that if voting results in equal split, then IAOC chair decides.

   o  Changed 2nd paragraph in "Structure of IASA" section to replace
      the fuzzy term "executive-level" and to be clear about cost
      aspects.

   o  Made it explicit that the IESG's role as a confirming body only
      applies to IAOC appointments made by the NomCom.

   o  Editorial changes at various places in the document.

Internet-Draft             Structure of IASA               December 2004


A.5  Changes in draft-wasserman-iasa-bcp-01.txt

   o  Adjusted the description of the IAD role and reporting structure
      to make it clear that the IAD is expected to serve as
      executive-level management for IASA, with only high-level
      direction (not day-to-day management) from the IAOC.

   o  Removed some troublesome wording regarding termination of the IAD
      by the ISOC President/CEO.

   o  Moved the initial IAOC selection into a separate section and added
      some text describing how and when the initial IAOC will be seated.

   o  Added the concept of IAD committees, largely taken from Leslie
      Daigle's original AdminRest proposal.

   o  Performed some general text editing and clean-up.
