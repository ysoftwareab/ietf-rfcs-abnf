1.  Introduction

   There is a need for standard mechanisms to allow the definition of
   abstract data that is not intended to be implemented as configuration
   or operational state.  The "yang-data" extension statement from RFC
   8040 [RFC8040] is defined for this purpose, however it is limited in
   its functionality.

   The intended use of the "yang-data" extension is to model all or part
   of a protocol message, such as the "errors" definition in ietf-
   restconf.yang [RFC8040], or the contents of a file.  However,
   protocols are often layered such that the header or payload portions
   of the message can be extended by external documents.  The YANG
   statements that model a protocol need to support this extensibility
   that is already found in that protocol.

   This document defines a new YANG extension statement called
   "augment-yang-data", which allows abstract data structures to be
   augmented from external modules, similar to the existing YANG
   "augment" statement.  Note that "augment" cannot be used to augment a
   yang data structure since a YANG compiler or other tool is not
   required to understand the "yang-data" extension.

   The "yang-data" extension from [RFC8040] has been copied here and
   updated to be more flexible.  There is no longer a requirement for

Internet-Draft            YANG Data Extensions              October 2017


   the "yang-data" statement to result in exactly one container object.
   There is no longer an assumption that a yang data structure can only
   be used as a top-level abstraction, instead of nested within some
   other data structure.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  yang data structure: A data structure defined with the "yang-data"
      statement.

1.1.1.  NMDA

   The following terms are defined in the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  and are
   not redefined here:

   o  configuration

   o  operational state

1.1.2.  YANG

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

   o  absolute-schema-nodeid

   o  container

   o  data definition statement

   o  data node

   o  leaf

   o  leaf-list

   o  list

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Restrictions on Conceptual YANG Data

   This document places restrictions on the "yang-data" external
   statements that can be used with the "yang-data" and
   "augment-yang-data" extensions.  The conceptual data definitions are
   considered to be in the same identifier namespace as defined in
   section 6.2.1 of [RFC7950].  In particular, bullet 7:

      All leafs, leaf-lists, lists, containers, choices, rpcs, actions,
      notifications, anydatas, and anyxmls defined (directly or through
      a "uses" statement) within a parent node or at the top level of
      the module or its submodules share the same identifier namespace.

   This means that conceptual data defined with the "yang-data" or
   "augment-yang-data" statements cannot have the same local-name as
   sibling nodes from regular YANG data definition statements or other
   "yang-data" or "augment-yang-data" statements.

   This does not mean a yang data structure has to be used as a top-
   level protocol message or other top-level data structure.  A yang
   data structure does not have to result in a single container.

2.2.  YANG Data Extensions Module

   The "yang-data-ext" module defines the "augment-yang-data" extension
   to augment conceptual data already defined with the "yang-data"
   extension.  The RESTCONF "yang-data" extension has been moved to this
   document and updated.

         message encoding rules, including the content media type.

         The mandatory 'name' parameter value identifies the YANG
         data template that is being defined. It contains the
         template name. This parameter is only used for readability
         purposes. There are no mechanisms to reuse yang-data by
         its template name value.

         This extension is ignored unless it appears as a top-level
         statement. It MUST contain data definition statements
         that result in a set of data definition statements.

         If the yang data template is intended to be used as
         a top-level structure, then the yang data template needs to
         result in a single container, so an instance of the YANG data
         template can thus be translated into an XML instance document,
         whose top-level element corresponds to the top-level container.

         The module name and namespace value for the YANG module using
         the extension statement is assigned to each of the data
         definition statements resulting from the yang data template.
         The name of each data definition statement resulting from
         a yang data template is assigned to a top-level identifier name
         in the data node identifier namespace, according to RFC 7950,
         section 6.2.1.

         The sub-statements of this extension MUST follow the
         'data-def-stmt' rule in the YANG ABNF.

         The XPath document root is the extension statement itself,
         such that the child nodes of the document root are
         represented by the data-def-stmt sub-statements within
         this extension. This conceptual document is the context
         for the following YANG statements:

           - must-stmt
           - when-stmt
           - path-stmt
           - min-elements-stmt
           - max-elements-stmt
           - mandatory-stmt
           - unique-stmt
           - ordered-by
           - instance-identifier data type

         The following data-def-stmt sub-statements are constrained
         when used within a yang-data-resource extension statement.

         It is intended to describe hierarchical data independent
         of protocol context or specific message encoding format.

         This statement has almost the same structure as the
         'augment-stmt'. Data definition statements within this
         statement specify the semantics and generic syntax for the
         additional data to be added to the specific YANG data template,
         identified by the 'path' argument.

         The mandatory 'path' parameter value identifies the YANG
         conceptual data node that is being augmented, represented
         as an absolute-schema-nodeid string.

         This extension is ignored unless it appears as a top-level
         statement. The sub-statements of this extension MUST follow
         the 'data-def-stmt' rule in the YANG ABNF.

         The module name and namespace value for the YANG module using
         the extension statement is assigned to instance document data
         conforming to the data definition statements within
         this extension.

         The XPath document root is the augmented extension statement
         itself, such that the child nodes of the document root are
         represented by the data-def-stmt sub-statements within
         the augmented yang-data statement.

         The context node of the augment-yang-data statement is derived
         in the same way as the 'augment' statement, as defined in
         section 6.4.1 of [RFC7950]. This conceptual node is

           - min-elements-stmt

           - instance-identifier data type

         The following data-def-stmt sub-statements are constrained
         when used within a augment-yang-data extension statement.

           - The list-stmt is not required to have a key-stmt defined.
           - The if-feature-stmt is ignored if present.
           - The config-stmt is ignored if present.

B.1.  uses-yang-data

   Is there a need for a separate grouping and uses mechanism for yang-
   data?  Currently only real grouping-stmt and uses-stmt are used.

B.2.  error-info

   Is there a need for a special-purpose extension to define yang-data
   for the contents of the <error-info> node in NETCONF <rpc-error> and
   RESTCONF <errors> responses?  This node is defined with anyxml so
   there is no way for a YANG tool to use real schema nodes, based on
   the RPC operation being requested or the error-app-tag that is being
   returned.
