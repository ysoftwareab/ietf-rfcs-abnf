Abstract

   RFC2374 "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format" defined
   an IPv6 address allocation structure that includes TLA (Top Level
   Aggregator) and NLA (Next Level Aggregator).  This document replaces
   RFC2374, and makes RFC 2374 and the TLA/NLA structure historic.

INTERNET-DRAFT     IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format      February 2003


1.0 Introduction

   RFC2374 "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format" defined
   an IPv6 address allocation structure that includes TLA (Top Level
   Aggregator) and NLA (Next Level Aggregator).  This document replaces
   RFC2374, and makes RFC 2374 and the TLA/NLA structure historic.


2.0 TLA/NLA Made Historic

   The TLA/NLA scheme has been replaced by a coordinated allocation
   policy defined by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) [IPV6RIR].

   Part of the motivation for obsoleting the TLA/NLA structure is
   technical; for instance, there is concern that TLA/NLA is not the
   technically best approach at this stage of the deployment of IPv6.
   Moreover, the allocation of IPv6 addresses is related to policy and
   to the stewardship of the IP address space and routing table size,
   which the RIRs have been managing for IPv4.  It is likely that the
   RIRs' policy will evolve as IPv6 deployment proceeds.

   The IETF has provided technical input to the RIRs (for example,
   [RFC3177]), which the RIRs have taken into account when defining
   their address allocation policy.

   RFC2374 was the definition of addresses for Format Prefix 001
   (2000::/3) which is formally made historic by this document.  Even
   though currently only 2000::/3 is being delegated by the IANA,
   implementations should not make any assumptions about 2000::/3 being
   special, since the IANA might later be directed to delegate currently
   unassigned parts of the IPv6 address space to the purpose of Global
   Unicast as well.

   The SLA (subnet local aggregator) field in RFC2374 remains in
   function but with a different name in [ARCH].  Its new name is
   "subnet ID".

   This documented replaces RFC2374, "An IPv6 Aggregatable Global
   Unicast Address Format".  RFC2374 will become historic.


3.0 Address Format

   The general format for IPv6 global unicast addresses as defined in
   "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" [ARCH] is as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT     IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format      February 2003


      |         n bits          |   m bits  |       128-n-m bits         |
      +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
      | global routing prefix   | subnet ID |       interface ID         |
      +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+

   where the global routing prefix is a (typically hierarchically-
   structured) value assigned to a site (a cluster of subnets/links),
   the subnet ID is an identifier of a subnet within the site, and the
   interface ID is as defined in section 2.5.1 of [ARCH].

   [ARCH] also requires that all unicast addresses, except those that
   start with binary value 000, have Interface IDs that are 64 bits long
   and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format.  The format of
   global unicast address in this case is:

      |         n bits          | 64-n bits |       64 bits              |
      +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
      | global routing prefix   | subnet ID |       interface ID         |
      +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+

   where the routing prefix is a value assigned to identify a site (a
   cluster of subnets/links), the subnet ID is an identifier of a subnet
   within the site, and the interface ID is in modified EUI-64 format as
   defined in [ARCH].

   An example of the resulting format of global unicast address under
   the 2000::/3 prefix that is currently being delegated by the IANA and
   consistent with the recommendations in RFC3177 is:

      | 3 |     45 bits         |  16 bits  |       64 bits              |
      +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
      |001|global routing prefix| subnet ID |       interface ID         |
      +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
