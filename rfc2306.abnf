N =
           0 = Data contains no lines with incorrect pixel counts or
              regenerated lines  (i.e., computer generated)
           1 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count were regenerated by
              receiving device
           2 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count are in the data  and
              were not regenerated by receiving device (i.e. data
              contains bad scan lines)

FillOrder=1, where bits are not reversed before being stored.
