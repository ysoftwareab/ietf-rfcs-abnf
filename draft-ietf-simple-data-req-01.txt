Abstract

   In any presence application, it is frequently necessary for the user
   to configure a number of pieces of information. Users will need to
   manipulate their presentity list, adding and removing presentities,
   and manipulate their authorization lists, which specify the set of
   users that can subscribe to their presence. In this document, we
   provide a framework and requirements for such data manipulations.

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


1 Introduction

   Consumer-based instant messaging and presence applications typically
   provide a rich set of features. In addition to being able to
   subscribe to, and get notified of, changes in presence, users can
   also configure the operation of the application.

   Most systems allow the user to add or remove users from their "buddy
   list", which we refer to here as a presentity collection. The
   presentity collection is the set of presentities [1] that a user is
   subscribed to. This list is frequently stored on the server, allowing
   the user to generate a single subscription to the entire list. The
   server then "fans out" that subscription too all the presentities on
   the list. Subscription to presentity collections is supported through
   the SIP event notification extension for collections [2]. However, no
   automated means is currently defined to create these lists, add users
   to them, remove users from them, or query for the set of users on the
   list.

   Similarly, most systems support user-defined authorization policies.
   A user can specify which watchers are (or are not) allowed to
   subscribe to their presence, and furthermore, what aspects of their
   presence a watcher is able to see. While SIMPLE [3] systems can
   support such authorization policies, besides human-driven techniques,
   such as web or voice response, there is no automated way to specify
   these policies.

   In this document, we propose a framework and a set of requirements
   for manipulation of presentity collections and authorization
   policies.

2 Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology:

        Presentity Collection: A presentity collection is a set of
             presentities, each of which is identified by a URI. The
             collection itself is identified by a URI (for example,
             sip:myfriends@example.com). Using the SIP event extension
             for collections [2], a watcher can subscribe to the
             presentity collection and learn about the presence state of
             all the presentities in the set.

        Presence Authorization Policy: Presence authorization policy
             refers to the set of directives given to a presence agent
             on what subscriptions to accept, when to generate
             notifications for a subscription, and what information
             should be placed in those notifications.

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


        Acceptance Policy: The component of presence authorization
             policy that determines whether or not to accept a
             subscription from a watcher.

        Notification Policy: The component of presence authorization
             policy that determines when a notification should be sent
             to a watcher.

        Content Policy: The component of presence authorization that
             determines the content of the information provided to a
             watcher in a notification.

        SIMPLE Data Elements: SIMPLE data elements are user specified
             data that determine the behavior of a presence agent. This
             includes presentity collections and presence authorization
             policy.

        Data Manipulation Client: A data manipulation client is a
             protocol agent that reads, writes, and receives
             notifications of changes in SIMPLE data elements.

        Data Manipulation Server: A data manipulation server is a
             protocol agent that receives reads, writes, and sends
             notifications of changes in SIMPLE data elements. The
             server is responsible for the storage of the SIMPLE data
             elements.

3 Framework

   The framework for the the usage and manipulation of SIMPLE data
   elements is shown in Figure 1.


   The data manipulation client (just referred to as the client) uses
   some protocol, whose requirements are specified here, to interact
   with the data manipulation server. Those interactions include
   requests to read a SIMPLE data element, write one, or receive
   notifications in changes to one. The data manipulation server (just
   referred to as the server) mananges a persistent store of the SIMPLE
   data elements, and interacts with the client.

   When a Presence Agent (PA) receives a SIP SUBSCRIBE request [3], it
   may require access to SIMPLE data elements in order to process the
   request. For example, if the subscription is for a presentity
   collection, the PA will need to determine that this is the case, and
   secondly, "expand" the collection, obtaining the list of URIs for
   that collection.

   Figure 1: Framework for Data Manipulation


   If the SUBSCRIBE request is for a presentity, the PA will need to
   obtain the presence authorization policy of that presentity in order
   to process the SUBSCRIBE request.

   In both cases, the PA requires only read access to the data. As a
   result, it obtains it directly from the data store, rather than
   interacting with the server. This, of course, is just a model of the
   system; a real implementation might involve interaction with the

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


   server before reading the data.

   Between the presentity collection and presence authorization policy,
   the presence authorization policy is a far more complicated piece of
   data. The authorization policy can be reasonably split into three
   separate pieces. The first, which we call the acceptance policy,
   determines whether or not to grant a subscription to the subscriber.
   This policy results in a binary decision. The second piece, which we
   call the notification policy, determines when that particular
   subscriber should receive notifications. For example, a subscriber
   might only be permitted to see when I log in or log out of IM, but
   not receive notifications when my phone goes on hook. This is closely
   related to the third piece, which we call the content policy. This
   policy specifies the content of the information present in a
   notification that is sent to a subscriber.

   All of these policies are data that is manipulated by the data
   manipulation protocol.

4 Presentity Collection Manipulation Requirements

   The following are the set of requirements for the protocol between
   the client and the server for the purposes of manipulation presentity
   collections.

        REQ 1: It MUST be possible for the client to create a presentity
             collection and associate it with a URI.

        REQ 2: It MUST be possible for the user to specify the URI for
             the presentity collection when one is created. If the name
             cannot be allocated (because it already exists, for
             example), it MUST be possible to inform the client of the
             failure, and the reason for it.

        REQ 3: It MUST be possible for the server to provide the client
             a URI for the list when one is created, in the case where
             the client does not provide it.

        REQ 4: It MUST be possible to add an entry to the presentity
             collection. Each entry MUST consist of at least a URI, and
             MAY include a display name. It MUST be possible for the
             entry to be any URI that is meaningful in the context of a
             presentity collection. Examples would include a SIP URI or
             pres URI [4].

        REQ 5: It MUST be possible for a presentity collection to
             contain entries which are themselves presentity
             collections.



J. Rosenberg et. al.                                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


        REQ 6: It MUST be possible to remove an entry from the
             presentity collection. If the entry does not exist, it MUST
             be possible for the server to inform the client of this
             fact.

        REQ 7: It MUST be possible to clear all entries from a
             presentity collection.

        REQ 8: It MUST be possible to delete a presentity collection. In
             this context, deleted means that the name of the presentity
             collection is no longer defined, so that subscriptions to
             the list would fail.

        REQ 9: It MUST be possible to query for the set of URIs in a
             particular presentity collection, by providing the URI for
             the presentity collection.

        REQ 10: It MUST be possible for the presentity collection to be
             associated with a list of authorized users. Those
             authorized users are the only ones permitted to manipulate
             the presentity collection.

        REQ 11: It MUST be possible for the presentity collection to be
             associated with a list of users that are authorized to
             subscribe to the list.

        REQ 12: It MUST be possible for a client to store a cached copy
             of the list. This implies that it MUST be possible for the
             server to notify the client of a change in the list. It
             MUST be possible for the client to manipulate the local
             cached copy even when there is no connectivity to the
             server. It MUST be possible to synchronize the cached copy
             with the master copy on the server, when connectivity is
             re-established.

             This particular requirement is crucial for wireless
             systems, where a copy of the list resides ont he handset.
             Without this requirement, a user would not be able to view
             the list, or add a user to it, when they go out of
             coverage.

        REQ 13: It MUST be possible for there to be multiple clients
             with cached copies of the list.

        REQ 14: Manipulations of the presentity collection MUST exhibit
             the ACID property; that is, they MUST be atomic, be
             consistent, durable, and operate independently.

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


        REQ 15: It MAY be possible for the client to batch multiple
             operations (add a presentity, remove a presentity) into a
             single request that is processed atomically.

        REQ 16: It MUST be possible for the server to authenticate the
             client.

        REQ 17: It MUST be possible to use the same database of client
             credentials used with SIP and SIMPLE, with the data
             manipulation protocol.

        REQ 18: It MUST be possible for the client to authenticate the
             server.

        REQ 19: It MUST be possible for message integrity to be insured
             between the client and the server.

        REQ 20: It MUST be possible for confidentiality to be ensured
             between the client and server. As a motivating example, an
             eavesdropper on the protocol could ascertain the set of
             people in my presentity collection, resulting in divulging
             private information.

        REQ 21: It MUST be possible for the protocol to operate through
             an intermediary, such as a proxy.

        REQ 22: It MUST be possible to modify an entry in the presentity
             collection.

        REQ 23: It MUST be possible for the protocol to operate with
             devices with intermittent and low bandwidth connectivity,
             such as wireless data devices.

5 Authorization Policy Manipulation

   The following are the set of requirements for the protocol between
   the client and the server for the purposes of manipulating presence
   authorization policy. The requirements are divided between acceptance
   policy, notification policy, and content policy.

5.1 Acceptance Policy Requirements

        REQ 1: It MUST be possible for the acceptance policy to support
             rejection of the subscription if the watcher is present on
             a specified list of "blocked watchers". When a list is
             checked in this fashion, its referred to as a blocked list.

        REQ 2: It MUST be possible for the acceptance policy to support



J. Rosenberg et. al.                                          [Page 8]

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


             rejection of the subscription if the watcher is not present
             on a specified list of "allowed watchers".

        REQ 3: It MUST be possible for the acceptance policy to support
             making a subscription pending if the watcher is present on
             neither an explicit allowed or blocked list. In that case,
             the watcherinfo package [5] can be used for reactive
             authorization.

        REQ 4: It MUST be possible for the acceptance policy to check
             multiple blocked and allowed lists.

        REQ 5: It MUST be possible for the acceptance policy to support
             rejection of the subscription based on filter information
             provided in the subscription. Filter information allows the
             subscriber to be informed of specific pieces of information
             and receive notifications at specific points in time [6].

        REQ 5.1: It MUST be possible for the policy to be based on the
             status types (for example, the basic status type as defined
             in PIDF [7] requested in the filter.

        REQ 5.2: It MUST be possible for the policy to be based on the
             status values requested in the filter.

        REQ 5.3: It MUST be possible for the policy to be based on
             whether the subscriber has requested, using the filter, to
             receive contact addresses.

        REQ 6: It SHOULD be possible for the policy to be based on the
             time of day.

        REQ 7: It SHOULD be possible for the policy to be based on the
             means by which the authenticated identity of the watcher
             was determined (digest vs. s/mime, for example).

        REQ 8: It SHOULD be possible for the policy to be based on
             whether notifications can be sent encrypted to the
             subscriber.

        REQ 9: It MUST be possible for a subscription to be accepted or
             rejected based on whether the subscriber is on the
             presentity's own buddy list.

        REQ 10: It MUST be possible for the user to manipulate any lists
             that are checked by by the authorization policy (for
             example, the allowed and denied lists). Manipulate means to
             add, remove, modify, read, clear and create and delete.

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


5.2 Notification Requirements

        REQ 1: It MUST be possible for the user to specify that
             notifications are to be sent only when the value of a
             particular status type changes.

        REQ 2: It MUST be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications are to be sent only when a particular status
             type changes to a specified value or set of values.

        REQ 3: It MUST be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications are to be sent only when a particular status
             type changes from a specified value to a specified value
             (i.e., from open to closed).

        REQ 4: It MUST be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications are to be sent only when the value of the
             contact address changes.

        REQ 5: It SHOULD be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications are not, or should be sent on changes in the
             state of the subscription (as opposed to the state of the
             presentity).

        REQ 6: It SHOULD be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications are to be sent based on the filter policy
             present in the SUBSCRIBE request. In that case, the overall
             filter policy would be the composition of the requested
             filter and the filters explicitly specified by the
             presentity.

5.3 Content Requirements

        REQ 1: It MUST be possible for the user to specify that the
             notification should or should not contain a contact
             address.

        REQ 2: It MUST be possible for the user to specify that the
             notification should contain only specific status types
             (such as basic).

        REQ 3: The user MUST be able to specify the specific values of a
             specific status type that the notification should or should
             not contain. Values not permitted must result in the
             omission of that status type. If all status is omitted, the
             tuple must be omitted as well. As an example, a user can
             specify that the notification should include tuples with
             OPEN status, but suppress those with only CLOSED status.

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


        REQ 4: The user MUST be able to specify that the notification
             should only contain information for particular tuples.

        REQ 5: It SHOULD be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications are to be sent based on the filter policy
             present in the SUBSCRIBE request. In that case, the overall
             filter policy would be the composition of the requested
             filter and the filters explicitly specified by the
             presentity.

        REQ 6: It SHOULD be possible for the user to specify that the
             value of a status should be modified for a particular
             subscriber (i.e., the user wants to lie).

        REQ 7: It SHOULD be possible for the user to specify the
             specific presence document to send to a watcher.

        REQ 8: It SHOULD be possible for the user to specify that the
             notifications should be encrypted using S/MIME.

5.4 General Requirements

   These requirements apply to all of the three components of the
   authorization policy.

        REQ 1: It MUST be possible for a client to store a cached copy
             of the policies. This implies that it MUST be possible for
             the server to notify the client of a change in these data.
             It MUST be possible for the client to manipulate the local
             cached copy even when there is no connectivity to the
             server. It MUST be possible to synchronize the cached copy
             with the master copy on the server, when connectivity is
             re-established.

        REQ 2: It MUST be possible for there to be multiple clients with
             cached copies of the data.

        REQ 3: Manipulations of the data MUST exhibit the ACID property;
             that is, they MUST be atomic, be consistent, durable, and
             operate independently.

        REQ 4: It MAY be possible for the client to batch multiple
             operations (add a user to a list, change the script) into a
             single request that is processed atomically.

        REQ 5: It MUST be possible for the server to authenticate the
             client.

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


        REQ 6: It MUST be possible to use the same database of client
             credentials used with SIP and SIMPLE, with the data
             manipulation protocol.

        REQ 7: It MUST be possible for the client to authenticate the
             server.

        REQ 8: It MUST be possible for message integrity to be ensured
             between the client and the server.

        REQ 9: It MUST be possible for confidentiality to be insured
             between the client and server. As a motivating example, an
             eavesdropper on the protocol could ascertain the set of
             people in my allowed list collection, resulting in
             divulging private information.

        REQ 10: It MUST be possible for the protocol to operate through
             an intermediary, such as a proxy.

        REQ 11: It MUST be possible for the protocol to operate with
             devices with intermittent and low bandwidth connectivity,
             such as wireless data devices.

6 Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations associated with the protocol
   whose requirements are defined here.

   The protocol is used to manipulate data that has a signficiant impact
   on the operation of a service provided to a user. In particular, if
   the data is manipulated by an attacker, the attacker can:

        o convey information to subscribers that the presentity wishes
          to keep private;

        o launch denial of service attacks by flooding a subscriber with
          more presence information than they expected;

        o deny service to subscribers or to presentities.

   To prevent these attacks, the protocol has to ensure than only
   authorized users can manipulate the data. Requirements for
   authentication and authorization are defined above.

   Information conveyed in the protocol represents sensitive data. It
   can include the content of presentity collections and lists of
   blocked users, both of which reveal personal preferences of a user
   that they do not wish to convey. As a result, it is necessary that

Internet Draft             Data Requirements           February 23, 2003


   the client authenticate the server, to be sure it is passing this
   information to a trusted entity. It is also necessary for the
   protocol to provide encryption services, so that eavesdroppers cannot
   inspect the data as it passes by.

7 To Do

        o Align this with the ongoing filter work

        o Make sure the requirements are consistent with the final
          protocol mechanism.
