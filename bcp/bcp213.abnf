AD = Administrative Domain (independent autonomous system)
AS = multicast (e.g., content) Application Source
BR = Border Router
I1 = AD-1 and AD-2 multicast interconnection (e.g., MP-BGP)
I2 = AD-2 and EU multicast connection

AD = Administrative Domain (independent autonomous system)
AS = multicast (e.g., content) Application Source
uBR = unicast Border Router - not necessarily multicast enabled;
         may be the same router as BR
BR = Border Router - for multicast
I1 = AD-1 and AD-2 multicast interconnection (e.g., MP-BGP)
I2 = AD-2 and EU multicast connection

AD = Administrative Domain (independent autonomous system)
AS = multicast (e.g., content) Application Source
AR = AMT Relay
AG = AMT Gateway
uBR = unicast Border Router - not multicast enabled;
         also, either AR = uBR (AD-1) or uBR = AG (AD-2)
I1 = AMT interconnection between AD-1 and AD-2
I2 = AD-2 and EU multicast connection

AS = multicast (e.g., content) Application Source
uBR = unicast Border Router - not multicast enabled;
         otherwise, AR = uBR (in AD-1)
AR = AMT Relay
I2 = AMT tunnel connecting EU/G to AR in AD-1 through
        non-multicast-enabled AD-2

uBR = unicast Border Router - not multicast enabled;
         also, either AR = uBR (AD-1) or uBR = AGAR1 (AD-2)
AS = multicast (e.g., content) Application Source
AR = AMT Relay in AD-1
AGAR1 = AMT Gateway/Relay node in AD-2 across peering point
I1 = AMT tunnel connecting AR in AD-1 to gateway in AGAR1 in AD-2
AGAR2 = AMT Gateway/Relay node at AD-2 network edge
I2 = AMT tunnel connecting relay in AGAR1 to gateway in AGAR2
I3 = AMT tunnel connecting EU/G to AR in AGAR2
