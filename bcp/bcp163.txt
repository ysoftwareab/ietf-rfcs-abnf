                        Locally Served DNS Zones

Abstract

   Experience with the Domain Name System (DNS) has shown that there are
   a number of DNS zones that all iterative resolvers and recursive
   nameservers should automatically serve, unless configured otherwise.
   RFC 4193 specifies that this should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA.  This
   document extends the practice to cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for RFC
   1918 address space and other well-known zones with similar
   characteristics.

1.  Introduction

   Experience with the Domain Name System (DNS, [RFC1034] and [RFC1035])
   has shown that there are a number of DNS zones that all iterative
   resolvers and recursive nameservers SHOULD automatically serve,
   unless intentionally configured otherwise.  These zones include, but
   are not limited to, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for the address space
   allocated by [RFC1918] and the IP6.ARPA zones for locally assigned
   unique local IPv6 addresses defined in [RFC4193].

RFC 6303                Locally Served DNS Zones               July 2011


   This recommendation is made because data has shown that significant
   leakage of queries for these namespaces is occurring, despite
   instructions to restrict them, and because it has therefore become
   necessary to deploy sacrificial nameservers to protect the immediate
   parent nameservers for these zones from excessive, unintentional
   query load [AS112] [RFC6304] [RFC6305].  There is every expectation
   that the query load will continue to increase unless steps are taken
   as outlined here.

   Additionally, queries from clients behind badly configured firewalls
   that allow outgoing queries for these namespaces, but drop the
   responses, put a significant load on the root servers (forward zones
   but not reverse zones are configured).  They also cause operational
   load for the root server operators, as they have to reply to
   enquiries about why the root servers are "attacking" these clients.
   Changing the default configuration will address all these issues for
   the zones listed in Section 4.

   [RFC4193] recommends that queries for D.F.IP6.ARPA be handled
   locally.  This document extends the recommendation to cover the
   IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for [RFC1918] and other well-known IN-ADDR.ARPA
   and IP6.ARPA zones for which queries should not appear on the public
   Internet.

   It is hoped that by doing this the number of sacrificial servers
   [AS112] will not have to be increased, and may in time be reduced.

   This recommendation should also help DNS responsiveness for sites
   that are using [RFC1918] addresses but do not follow the last
   paragraph in Section 3 of [RFC1918].

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Effects on Sites Using RFC 1918 Addresses

   For most sites using [RFC1918] addresses, the changes here will have
   little or no detrimental effect.  If the site does not already have
   the reverse tree populated, the only effect will be that the name
   error responses will be generated locally rather than remotely.

   For sites that do have the reverse tree populated, most will either
   have a local copy of the zones or will be forwarding the queries to
   servers that have local copies of the zone.  Therefore, this
   recommendation will not be relevant.

   The most significant impact will be felt at sites that make use of
   delegations for [RFC1918] addresses and have populated these zones.
   These sites will need to override the default configuration expressed
   in this document to allow resolution to continue.  Typically, such
   sites will be fully disconnected from the Internet and have their own
   root servers for their own non-Internet DNS tree.

3.  Changes to Iterative Resolver Behaviour

   Unless configured otherwise, an iterative resolver will now return
   authoritatively (AA=1) name errors (RCODE=3) for queries within the
   zones in Section 4, with the obvious exception of queries for the
   zone name itself where SOA, NS, and "no data" responses will be
   returned as appropriate to the query type.  One common way to do this
   all at once is to serve empty (SOA and NS only) zones.

   An implementation of this recommendation MUST provide a mechanism to
   disable this new behaviour, and SHOULD allow this decision on a zone-
   by-zone basis.

   If using empty zones one SHOULD NOT use the same NS and SOA records
   as used on the public Internet servers, as that will make it harder
   to detect the origin of the responses and thus any leakage to the
   public Internet servers.  It is RECOMMENDED that the NS record
   defaults to the name of the zone and the SOA MNAME defaults to the
   name of the only NS RR's (Resource Record's) target.  The SOA RNAME
   SHOULD default to "nobody.invalid."  [RFC2606].  Implementations
   SHOULD provide a mechanism to set these values.  No address records
   need to be provided for the nameserver.

   Below is an example of a generic empty zone in master file format.
   It will produce a negative cache Time to Live (TTL) of 3 hours.

   @ 10800 IN SOA @ nobody.invalid. 1 3600 1200 604800 10800
   @ 10800 IN NS @

   The SOA RR is needed to support negative caching [RFC2308] of name
   error responses and to point clients to the primary master for DNS
   dynamic updates.

   SOA values of particular importance are the MNAME, the SOA RR's TTL,
   and the negTTL value.  Both TTL values SHOULD match.  The rest of the
   SOA timer values MAY be chosen arbitrarily since they are not
   intended to control any zone transfer activity.

   The NS RR is needed as some UPDATE [RFC2136] clients use NS queries
   to discover the zone to be updated.  Having no address records for
   the nameserver is expected to abort UPDATE processing in the client.

4.  Lists Of Zones Covered

   The following subsections are the initial contents of the IANA
   registry as described in the IANA Considerations section.  Following
   the caveat in that section, the list contains only reverse zones
   corresponding to permanently assigned address space.  The zone name
   is the entity to be registered.

4.1.  RFC 1918 Zones

   The following zones correspond to the IPv4 address space reserved in
   [RFC1918].

                         +----------------------+
                         | Zone                 |
                         +----------------------+
                         | 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA      |
                         | 16.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 17.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 18.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 19.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 20.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 21.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 22.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 23.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 24.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 25.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 26.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 27.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 28.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 29.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 30.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 31.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA  |
                         | 168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA |
                         +----------------------+

4.2.  RFC 5735 and RFC 5737 Zones

   The following zones correspond to those address ranges from [RFC5735]
   and [RFC5737] that are not expected to appear as source or
   destination addresses on the public Internet; as such, there are no
   globally unique names associated with the addresses in these ranges.

RFC 6303                Locally Served DNS Zones               July 2011


   The recommendation to serve an empty zone 127.IN-ADDR.ARPA is not an
   attempt to discourage any practice to provide a PTR RR for
   1.0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA locally.  In fact, a meaningful reverse
   mapping should exist, but the exact setup is out of the scope of this
   document.  Similar logic applies to the reverse mapping for ::1
   (Section 4.3).  The recommendations made here simply assume that no
   other coverage for these domains exists.

         +------------------------------+-----------------------+
         | Zone                         | Description           |
         +------------------------------+-----------------------+
         | 0.IN-ADDR.ARPA               | IPv4 "THIS" NETWORK   |
         | 127.IN-ADDR.ARPA             | IPv4 Loopback NETWORK |
         | 254.169.IN-ADDR.ARPA         | IPv4 LINK LOCAL       |
         | 2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA         | IPv4 TEST-NET-1       |
         | 100.51.198.IN-ADDR.ARPA      | IPv4 TEST-NET-2       |
         | 113.0.203.IN-ADDR.ARPA       | IPv4 TEST-NET-3       |
         | 255.255.255.255.IN-ADDR.ARPA | IPv4 BROADCAST        |
         +------------------------------+-----------------------+

4.3.  Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   The reverse mappings ([RFC3596], Section 2.5 ("IP6.ARPA Domain")) for
   the IPv6 Unspecified (::) and Loopback (::1) addresses ([RFC4291],
   Sections 2.4, 2.5.2, and 2.5.3) are covered by these two zones:

               +-------------------------------------------+
               | Zone                                      |
               +-------------------------------------------+
               | 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.\ |
               |     0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.IP6.ARPA      |
               | 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.\ |
               |     0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.IP6.ARPA      |
               +-------------------------------------------+

   Note: Line breaks and escapes ('\') have been inserted above for
   readability and to adhere to line width constraints.  They are not
   parts of the zone names.

4.4.  IPv6 Locally Assigned Local Addresses

   Section 4.4 of [RFC4193] already required special treatment of:

                             +--------------+
                             | Zone         |
                             +--------------+
                             | D.F.IP6.ARPA |
                             +--------------+

RFC 6303                Locally Served DNS Zones               July 2011


4.5.  IPv6 Link-Local Addresses

   IPv6 Link-Local Addresses as described in [RFC4291], Section 2.5.6
   are covered by four distinct reverse DNS zones:

                            +----------------+
                            | Zone           |
                            +----------------+
                            | 8.E.F.IP6.ARPA |
                            | 9.E.F.IP6.ARPA |
                            | A.E.F.IP6.ARPA |
                            | B.E.F.IP6.ARPA |
                            +----------------+

4.6.  IPv6 Example Prefix

   IPv6 example prefix [RFC3849].

                       +--------------------------+
                       | Zone                     |
                       +--------------------------+
                       | 8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA |
                       +--------------------------+

   Note: 8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA is not being used as an example here.

5.  Zones That Are Out of Scope

   IPv6 site-local addresses (deprecated, see [RFC4291] Sections 2.4 and
   2.5.7), and IPv6 non-locally assigned local addresses ([RFC4193]) are
   not covered here.

   It is expected that IPv6 site-local addresses will be self correcting
   as IPv6 implementations remove support for site-local addresses.
   However, sacrificial servers for the zones C.E.F.IP6.ARPA through
   F.E.F.IP6.ARPA may still need to be deployed in the short term if the
   traffic becomes excessive.

   For IPv6 non-locally assigned local addresses (L = 0) [RFC4193],
   there has been no decision made about whether the Regional Internet
   Registries (RIRs) will provide delegations in this space or not.  If
   they don't, then C.F.IP6.ARPA will need to be added to the list in
   Section 4.4.  If they do, then registries will need to take steps to
   ensure that nameservers are provided for these addresses.







Andrews                   Best Current Practice                 [Page 7]

RFC 6303                Locally Served DNS Zones               July 2011


   IP6.INT was once used to provide reverse mapping for IPv6.  IP6.INT
   was deprecated in [RFC4159] and the delegation removed from the INT
   zone in June 2006.  While it is possible that legacy software
   continues to send queries for names under the IP6.INT domain, this
   document does not specify that IP6.INT be considered a local zone.

   This document has also deliberately ignored names immediately under
   the root domain.  While there is a subset of queries to the root
   nameservers that could be addressed using the techniques described
   here (e.g., .local, .workgroup, and IPv4 addresses), there is also a
   vast amount of traffic that requires a different strategy (e.g.,
   lookups for unqualified hostnames, IPv6 addresses).

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has established a registry of zones that require this default
   behaviour.  The initial contents of this registry are defined in
   Section 4.  Implementors are encouraged to periodically check this
   registry and adjust their implementations to reflect changes therein.

   This registry can be amended through "IETF Review" as per [RFC5226].
   As part of this review process, it should be noted that once a zone
   is added it is effectively added permanently; once an address range
   starts being configured as a local zone in systems on the Internet,
   it will be impossible to reverse those changes.

   IANA should coordinate with the RIRs to ensure that, as DNS Security
   (DNSSEC) is deployed in the reverse tree, delegations for these zones
   are made in the manner described in Section 7.

7.  Security Considerations

   During the initial deployment phase, particularly where [RFC1918]
   addresses are in use, there may be some clients that unexpectedly
   receive a name error rather than a PTR record.  This may cause some
   service disruption until their recursive nameserver(s) have been
   re-configured.

   As DNSSEC is deployed within the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
   namespaces, the zones listed above will need to be delegated as
   insecure delegations, or be within insecure zones.  This will allow
   DNSSEC validation to succeed for queries in these spaces despite not
   being answered from the delegated servers.

   It is recommended that sites actively using these namespaces secure
   them using DNSSEC [RFC4035] by publishing and using DNSSEC trust
   anchors.  This will protect the clients from accidental import of
   unsigned responses from the Internet.

                  Adding 100.64.0.0/10 Prefixes to the
                 IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry

Abstract

   RFC 6598 specifies that "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space
   addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS
   infrastructure."

   This document formally directs IANA to add the associated zones to
   the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry" to prevent such queries
   from accidentally leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6598] specifies that "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address
   Space addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global
   DNS infrastructure."  [RFC6303] provides guidance on handling such
   queries.

   This document directs the IANA to add the IPv4 reverse zones
   corresponding to 100.64.0.0/10, a netblock reserved in [RFC6598], to
   the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zone Registry" established in [RFC6303].

   Unlike the addresses described in [RFC1918], which are not expected
   to be seen by other parties, the addresses defined by [RFC6598] are
   expected to be seen by parties other than those deploying the
   addresses.  Therefore, it is more crucial that recursive nameservers
   default to serving these zones locally.

2.  Changes to the IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry

   IANA has added the zones listed in "RFC 6598 Zones" (Section 2.1) to
   the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zone Registry".

3.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has added the zones listed in "RFC 6598
   Zones" (Section 2.1) to the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zone Registry".

   IANA is reminded that an insecure delegation for these zones is
   required for compliance with [RFC6303] to break the DNSSEC chain of
   trust.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present additional security risks to the
   Internet than those described in [RFC6303] and [RFC6598].
