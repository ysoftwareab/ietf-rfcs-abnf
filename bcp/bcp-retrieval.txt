                   Where and how to get BCPs
                   =========================

The IETF Best Current Practices are documented in a small subset of
the RFCs.  Once you know the RFC number of the document describing an
BCP you may obtain that document by getting the RFC (see
ways_to_get_rfcs).

For convenience these documents are also grouped and listed by their
BCP numbers.

The BCPs may be obtained via EMAIL or FTP from BCP Repositories.

Many of these repositories also now have World Wide Web servers. Try
the following URL as a starting point:

                http://www.rfc-editor.org


1.  FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG

BCPs are available via anonymous FTP from FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG, with the
pathname: in-notes/bcp/bcpNN.txt (where "NN" is the number of the BCP.
For example BCP1.TXT is the current descriptions of the purpose of
BPCs document.  Login with FTP username "anonymous" and password
"ftp".

BCPs can also be obtained via electronic mail from FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG
by using the RFC-INFO service.  Address the request to
"rfc-info@rfc-editor.org" with a message body of:

	 Retrieve: BCP
	   Doc-ID: BCPnnnn

(Where "nnnn" refers to the number of the BCP (always use 4 digits, so
BCP 1 is BCP0001 in the RFC-INFO service).  The RFC-INFO@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
server provides other ways of selecting BCPs based on date ranges and
such; for more information send a message to "rfc-info@rfc-editor.org"
with the message body "help: help".

Note that BCPs may be very large (greater than 100,000 characters), the
RFC-INFO service will return large documents in sections of less than
50,000 characters each.
