Internet-Draft    Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) over COPS  June 2004


1.  Introduction

   The MCOP functionality is specified in [1].  This document specifies
   the protocol between Multicast Control Client (MCCs) and Multicast
   Control Servers (MCSs) over COPS [2].

   The COPS protocol uses a client/server model in which the servers are
   called Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and clients Policy Enforcement
   Points (PEPs).  When mapping these terms to MCOP entities, the MCOP
   MCS is PDP and MCOP MCC is PEP.

   COPS specification discusses two different scenarios: the outsourcing
   scenario and the configuration scenario.  MCOP uses the outsourcing
   scenario in which the PEPs (MCCs) ask PDP (MCS) for information about
   multicast senders and receivers.

   The MCOP functionality is similar to what is described in the COPS
   specification [2], section 1.1 Basic Model.  The outsourcing model is
   described in section 4.4.  COPS provides the basic protocol
   containing security, connection keepalive tracking and extensibility
   and was thus chosen to carry the messages between MCCs and MCS.

3.  MCOP Object Formats

   All MCOP messages sent over COPS follow the same object format in
   which each object begins with a four-octet header:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      Type     |    Subtype    |        Length (octets)        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   :                   ... Object contents ...                     :
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type: 8 bits
   o  Type field identifies the object class contained in the object.
      This document specifies the object formats for MCOP operation for
      first hop routers.  Later documents can specify additional types
      for future uses of MCOP over COPS.  The Type values defined in
      this document are: 1 = Multicast Parameter, 2 = Group Range and 3
      = Group Member

   Subtype: 8 bits
   o  Subtype identifies the subtype of the information contained in the
      object.

   Length: 16 bits
   o  The length field is a two-octet value that describes the number of
      octets (including the object header) that compose the object.  On
      the receiving side, a subsequent object boundary can be found by
      simply rounding up the previous stated object length to the next
      32-bit boundary.

3.1  Multicast Parameter Object

   The Multicast Parameter object contains Parameter Blocks that carry
   parameters used by MCC for multicast control purposes.  The
   parameters are intended to be used for all multicast groups and
   channels (not just for MCOP controlled groups and channels).

   Type = 1,

   Subtype = 0 (IPv4) or Subtype = 1 (IPv6)
   o  The Parameter Blocks list the MCC's directly connected networks
      that have multicast capable hosts.  This information is used by
      MCS to send the correct network specific multicast parameters back

      to the MCC.  Sent by MCC to MCS.

   Subtype = 2 (IPv4) or Subtype = 3 (IPv6)
   o  The Parameter Blocks contain network specific parameters that are
      applied to multicast receivers.  Sent by MCS to MCC.

   Subtype = 4 (IPv4) or Subtype = 5 (IPv6)
   o  The Parameter Blocks contain network specific parameters that are
      applied to multicast sources.  Sent by MCS to MCC.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   For Subtypes 0 and 1 the Number of Groups per Host field and Maximum
   Allowed Multicast Rate MUST be set to zero by MCC and ignored on
   reception by MCS.

   IP Address: 32 bits (IPv4) or 128 bits (IPv6) and Mask Length: 8 bits
   o  For Subtypes 0 and 1 IP Address and Mask Length specify the
      networks that have multicast capable hosts.  For other Subtypes
      they specify the network for which the parameters apply.

   Maximum Number of Groups per Host: 24 bits
   o  Maximum Number of Groups per Host field specifies for receivers
      the maximum number of groups that can be joined by a single host.
      For senders it defines the maximum number of groups that can be
      sent traffic to (within Source Timer).  The meaning depends on the
      subtype in question.  Maximum Number of Groups per Host field
      maximum value of 0xFFFFFF is interpreted as Infinity.

   Maximum Allowed Multicast Rate: 32 bits
   o  Maximum Allowed Multicast Rate is used for controlling multicast
      sources as specified in [1].  Maximum Allowed Multicast Rate field
      maximum value of 0xFFFFFF is interpreted as Infinity.

3.2  Group Range Object

   The Group Range object contains the MCOP controlled multicast

4.  Creating the COPS Messages

   All MCOP objects in COPS Requests are encapsulated within COPS Client
   Specific Information Objects (ClientSI), C-Num = 9 with C-Type = 1,
   Signaled ClientSI.  All MCOP objects in COPS Decisions are
   encapsulated in Decision Objects, C-Num = 6, C-Type = 4, Client
   Specific Decision Data.

4.1  Establishing COPS Connection

   The MCC creates a COPS connection to the selected MCS using the
   Client-type specified in Section 6.  The PEPID COPS object in the
   COPS Client-Open (OPN) message specifies the PEP Identification
   configured to the client.

4.2  MCOP Initialization

   Once the COPS Client-Accept (CAT) message is received the MCC will
   send a COPS Request (REQ) specifying a new Client-Handle, Context
   Object with R-Type 0x08 (Configuration request) and M-Type 0x0.  The
   Request must also contain ClientSI object with C-Type 1 (Signaled
   ClientSI).

   The ClientSI object contains the MCOP Multicast Parameter object in
   which the MCC lists all connected networks that have directly
   connected hosts.

   The format of COPS message from MCC to MCS is

          <Request Message> ::= <Common Header>
                                <Client Handle>
                                <Context>
                                <ClientSI>
                                [<Integrity>]


   MCS responds with COPS Decision (DEC) message specifying the
   Client-Handle, Context Object with R-Type 0x08 (Configuration
   Request) and M-Type 0x0.  The Decision must also contain ClientSI
   object with C-Type 1 (Signaled ClientSI).

   The ClientSI contains MCOP Group Range object which lists all MCOP
   controlled multicast addresses.  MCS also informs MCCs whether the
   control must be applied to multicast receivers, multicast sources or
   both.  The ClientSI also contains MCOP Multicast Parameter object
   which contains general multicast parameters.

   The format of COPS message from MCS to MCC is

          <Decision Message> ::= <Common Header>
                                 <Client Handle>
                                 <Context>
                                 <Init Decision> | <Error>
                                 [<Integrity>]

          <Init Decision> ::= <Decision: Flags>
                              <Decision: ClientSI Data>


   The values for MCOP Connection Holdtime and MCOP Cache Entry Lifetime
   are obtained from locally configured values which may depend on the
   requesting MCC.

   The bits in the Group Address Block are interpreted as follows:
   o  R=1, S=0 indicate that network and address mask is part of the
      MCOP controlled multicast addresses, but applies to multicast
      receivers only.
   o  R=0, S=1 indicate that network and address mask is part of the
      MCOP controlled multicast addresses, but applies to multicast
      sources only.
   o  R=1, S=1 indicate that network and address mask is part of the
      MCOP controlled multicast addresses and applies to both receivers
      and sources.
   o  R=0, S=0 indicate that network and address mask is not part of the
      MCOP controlled multicast addresses.

   MCS may send unsolicited COPS Decisions to the MCC using an existing
   Client Handle if the address space for MCOP controlled multicast
   addresses or general multicast parameters change.  In that case the
   Decision updates the current information in MCC.  Decision ClientSI
   MUST NOT contain Group Member objects.

4.3  MCOP Validation

   When MCC receives new multicast traffic sent to a MCOP controlled
   group or channel, the MCC initiates the validating procedure before
   it passes any traffic up the protocol stack.

   When a MCC receives an IGMP/MLD Report from a new host wishing to
   join a MCOP controlled group or channel, the MCC initiates the
   validating procedure before it passes the packet to IGMP/MLD
   processing.

   If the MCC does not know about the MCOP controlled group's or
   channel's valid receivers and sources already, it MUST retrieve this
   information from MCS using the Group Member object.

   For sending MCOP Validate messages the MCC creates a COPS Request
   (REQ) message with Context object R-Type set to 0x01,
   Incoming-Message/Admission Control Request.  The MCOP Validate
   message is enacapsulated in COPS ClientSI object.  As required by
   COPS the MCC must create a new Client Handle for the new request
   state.

   The format of COPS message from MCC to MCS is

          <Request Message> ::= <Common Header>
                                <Client Handle>
                                <Context>
                                <ClientSI>
                                [<Integrity>]


   The Group Member object is defined as follows:
   o  Multicast Group Address specifies the multicast group that is
      validated with this Group Member object.
   o  Source Address for Source-Specific Group identifies the IP address
      of the source if the multicast group is source-specific.  If the
      address does not identify a source-specific multicast group, it is
      set to 0.
   o  The address of the directly connected network of MCC, where the
      multicast traffic or IGMP Report was received from.  The MCC can
      validate one or more subnets by listing them in Address Blocks.
      The R and S bits MUST be cleared and ignored on reception at MCS.

   MCS uses Group Member object to inform MCCs about the current status
   of multicast sources and receivers.  To reduce the number of
   messages, the status of both receivers and sources for the subnet is
   returned with the same message.  If necessary, the decision from MCS
   may contain individual host entries.  If a new source or receiver
   becomes active for the same MCOP controlled group or channel, the MCC
   already has the control information stored locally.

   If the group status changes, MCS MUST send unsolicited MCOP Result
   message to MCCs that have checked the group status earlier.  Those
   unsolicited MCOP Result messages are treated as an update to the
   multicast group status.

   For sending MCOP Result messages the MCS creates a COPS Decision
   (DEC) message.  The Decision Command-Code must be set to 1, Install.
   The Group Member object is encapsulated in COPS ClientSI object.  As
   required by COPS the MCS must use the Client Handle for mapping the
   decision to the corresponding request.

   The Solicited Message Flag Bit in the COPS Common Header must be set

   if the Decision was solicited by MCC.

   The format of COPS message from MCS to MCC is

          <Decision Message> ::= <Common Header>
                                 <Client Handle>
                                 <Context>
                                 <Validate Decision> | <Error>
                                 [<Integrity>]

          <Validate Decision> ::= <Decision: Flags>
                                  <Decision: ClientSI Data>


   The Group Member object for the MCOP Result message is defined as
   follows:
   o  Multicast Address specifies the multicast group in this Group
      Member object.
   o  Source Address for Source-Specific Group identifies the IP address
      of the source if the multicast group is source-specific.
   o  Address Blocks contain the network addresses and mask lengths for
      senders or receivers.  For source-specific groups a valid source
      must be explicitly mentioned in the Address Block.  Address Block
      can contain individual host entries (mask length = 32 or 128).
      The following network addresses and masks can be used to refer to
      whole multicast group: 0.0.0.0/0 indicate all IPv4 networks and
      ::/0 indicate all IPv6 networks.
   o  R and S bits describe the validity or non-validity of a network or
      a host in question.  If the MCS does not have information about
      the group or channel in question, it MUST set the network or host
      as non-valid.  The individual bits are interpreted as follows:
      *  R=1, S=0 indicate valid receiver.
      *  R=0, S=1 indicate valid source.
      *  R=1, S=1 indicate valid receiver and valid source.
      *  R=0, S=0 indicate non-valid receiver and non-valid source.

4.4  Removing Multicast Group Member Information

   For removing multicast group member information, the MCC creates a
   COPS Delete Request State (DRQ) message using the appropriate Client
   Handle to specify the request state that is removed.

   The format of COPS message from MCC to MCS is

          <Delete Request> ::= <Common Header>
                               <Client Handle>
                               <Reason>
                               [<Integrity>]

4.5  Creating network address groups

   The network addresses in Multicast Parameter and Group Member Objects
   MUST be ordered.  The longest masks are listed first followed in the
   decreasing order by the shorter masks.

   The objects should always contain complete network information.

   For example, if host A in subnet X starts to send to group G the
   whole subnet is validated.  The validation result MUST contain an
   answer that has complete information for the whole subnet.  If, for
   example, the only information MCS has is that only A is *not* allowed
   to send to group G, the MCS MUST also specify in its reply that
   subnet X is allowed to send to group G.  The response thus contains
   two parts, the first specifying that A is not allowed to send and the
   second specifying that subnet X is allowed to send.  Also, note the
   more specific information is listed first followed by the least
   specific information.
