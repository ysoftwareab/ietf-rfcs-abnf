       Requirements and Architecture of Carrier IP Service Models
          draft-li-opsawg-carrier-ip-service-model-req-arch-00

Abstract

   Service Model is a fundamental building block for a controller's
   North-Bound Interface (NBI).  Defining a service model for different
   multi-layered and heterogeneous networks is a complicated work and
   may require lots of consideration since different model users may
   have different perspective and concerns.

   This document proposes the requirements and architecture for service
   models to facilitate future work.  This document does not attempt to
   provide a detailed description of all the architectural components,
   but rather it describes a set of building blocks, requirements,
   architecture and guidelines from which models may be constructed.

1.  Introduction

   Service Model is a fundamental building block for a controller's
   North-Bound Interface (NBI).  Defining a service model for different
   multi-layered and heterogeneous networks is a complicated work and
   may require lots of consideration since different model users may
   have different perspective and concerns.

   This document proposes the requirements and architecture for service
   models to facilitate future work.  This document does not attempt to
   provide a detailed description of all the architectural components,
   but rather it describes a set of building blocks, requirements,
   architecture and guidelines from which models may be constructed.

2.  Terminology

   o  NBI: North-Bound Interface

   o  SBI: South-Bound Interface

   o  SDN: Software-Defined Network

   o  RAN: Radio Access Network

   o  OAM: Operation, Administration and Maintenance

3.  Scope

   The L3VPN service model [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model] is
   defined to provides an abstracted view of the Layer 3 IPVPN service
   configuration components.  A typical usage is to use this model as an
   input for an orchestration layer who will be responsible to translate
   it to orchestrated configuration of network elements who will be part
   of the service.  As the development of SDN controller, there will be
   functionalities division between the controller and the orchestrator.
   The orchestrator is always responsible for the service orchestration
   between network service and related applications while controller is
   dedicated to the network-level services.

   Since an orchestrator will face end users directly, the corresponding
   input for its models will absolutely be expressed into a user-
   friendly manner.  Taking the Network L3VPN Service Model as an
   example, the location of PEs can be expressed by using geographical
   information such as street or latitude/longitude, etc. for an
   orchestrator model.  But the input for a controller's model has to be
   certain identification that can be directly used by the controller
   such as network element ID or IP address.  Though there maybe some
   subtle difference between the service models of controller and
   orchestrator, as the abstracted view of network service, there exists
   much similarity between these network service models.  This document
   primarily focuses on service models for a controller's NBI instead of
   the counterpart of an orchestrator which are shown in the Figure 1.

   Currently service models such as vDC, Service Function Chain (SFC),
   etc. are developed for the data center network.  This document
   focuses on the services of traditional carrier IP networks
   exclusively.  Carrier IP networks are also facing the same challenges
   as those of data center networks such as rapid deployment and
   maintenance of network services for which network service model can
   be introduced to try to simplify the service provision and
   maintenance.  For example, when handling an IP-RAN network with
   thousands of nodes and complex business on, it is really eager to
   have some methods to help to alleviate this pain point.

4.  Considerations

4.1.  Generic Scenarios Oriented

   Instead of addressing all problem spaces and fixing every issue from
   all kinds of scenarios, a network service model is RECOMMENDED to
   primarily focus on those generic ones.  Introducing too many details
   that are scenario specific can cause lots of customized models which
   will minimize the difference between NBI and SBI gradually and
   jeopardize the value of NBI in the long run.

4.2.  Network-Functional Level Abstract

   There are two types of abstraction of network service models: Intent
   Level and Network-functional Level.  Since the network architecture
   is more complicated and there will be hard to introduce many plug-
   and-play features, it is difficult for a carrier IP network to
   achieve high abstraction to the intent level.  As a result, it is
   mandatory to understand some details of the whole network (such as
   service specific topology) when service models are introduced.  Based
   on this consideration, this document will primarily focus on
   definition of service models of network-functional level.

4.3.  Multi-Level Openness Required

   It is obvious that a service model can have lots of users which will
   certainly have different backgrounds and perspective.  It is
   important that a service model can satisfy all these requirements
   through different levels of openness and abstraction while still keep
   itself intact.

   In simple terms, we can divide the users of a service model into two
   groups: business users and administrators.

   1.  Business users.  The primary concern of this kind of users is to
       deploy fast and operate successfully.  They care about details
       only when they have to.  Unless they are professional technical

       personnel or required themselves, it is better for a service
       model to try best to avoid unnecessary details.

   2.  Administrators.  For administrators, they care about not only the
       network service provision based on the possible network service
       models, but also the following aspects related with network
       service:

       A.  Pre-configuration.  In order to accomplish the mapping from
           NBI models to SBI models, it is necessary to pre-configure
           parts of business related items and resources.  This is also
           helpful to lower the threshold for business users.

       B.  Operation and maintenance.  When talking about operation and
           maintenance work on a daily basis, it is reasonable to access
           certain exact information, and even some non-user-friendly
           fields when shooting troubles.  It is important that a
           service model can support such level of openness for
           accessing.

5.  Requirements

5.1.  Base Network Models

   The base network models are to provide the abstraction of underlay
   network to facilitate the definition of network service models.

5.1.1.  Inventory Model

   Network inventory is one important base network models which can
   provide the abstracted view of different network devices and links.

5.1.2.  Topology Model

   Topology models are the base network models to provide the abstracted
   view of topologies of the physical network.  Based on the
   requirements of different network service models, there should be
   models on generic network topology, L3 network topology, L2 network
   topology, MPLS-TE topology and IP-TE topology.

5.2.  Service Models

   Nowadays huge IP related technologies such as IGP, BGP, MPLS, VPN,
   OAM, etc. have been used in carrier IP networks which propose the
   great challenges for network service provision and maintenance.  When
   considering the procedure of deploying these services in a high
   abstraction level, it can be simplified as a work of "leading traffic
   flow into pipes".  These "pipes" can be recognized as tunnels or IP



Li & Wu                  Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Req & Arch of Carrier IP Service Models    October 2015


   flows involving multiple routers in the network, while "traffic flow"
   can be recognized according to different granularity.  In a manner of
   speaking, VPN can be seen as a kind of coarse grain flow while a
   finer grain flow can be defined using the "5-tuple" of IP header.

   Even for the "pipes" base on tunnels, there can be many types of
   tunnels implemented on the device.  Through a controller's NBI, an
   application can trigger a controller to create the tunnel it needs
   without understanding the detail.  Or the business can trigger the
   traffic optimization of network-level MPLS-TE tunnels for service
   bearing.  In these scenarios, the "pipe" itself is also a kind of
   network-level service.  So here we get several basic service models
   for carrier IP network:

   Pipes:

   o  Network Tunnel Service Model

   o  Network IP Flow Service Model

   Flows:

   o  Network VPN Service Model

   o  Network Service Flow Model

   As stated above, because of different requirements and technical
   background, the input of a specific service model shows the wide
   diversity.  For instance, users of VPN Service do not have to care
   about it is L3VPN, L2VPN or EVPN that is actually being used.  And a
   common end identification only needs to be designated instead of
   concrete IP or MAC addresses.  These concrete identifications can be
   allocated by a controller automatically.  On the other hand, some
   users prefer to designate the exact VPN such as L3VPN in the case IP
   address for the identification of ACs should be designated instead of
   allocated by the controller.  Owing to the wide diversity of
   requirements on specific network service models, there should be
   multiple levels of such network service models to accommodate these
   requirements.

5.2.1.  VPN Service Models

   The draft "Considerations on Layered Network VPN Service Models" in
   process describe in details the requirements of VPN service models
   including:

   3. Network L2VPN Service Model
   4. P2P Network L2VPN Service Model
   5. MP2MP Network L2VPN Service Model
   6. Network EVPN Service Model

5.2.2.  Service Flow Models

   Service flow service models is to provide the abstracted view of
   network-level's steering the traffic identified with the thinner
   granularity than VPN such as "5 tuple" of IP header to the possible
   "pipes".  The details will be defined in the future accompanying
   draft.

5.2.3.  Tunnel Service Models

   The draft "Considerations on Layered Network Tunnel Service Models"
   in process describe in details the requirements of Tunnel service
   models including:

   1. Network Tunnel Service Model
   2. Network MPLS TE Tunnel Service Model
   3. Network IP Tunnel Service Model

5.2.4.  IP Flow Service Models

   IP Flow service models is to provide the abstracted view of network
   service based on IP paths spanning multiple network elements.  The
   details will be defined in the future accompanying draft.

5.3.  Supporting Models

   Supporting models is used to help define the possible service in a
   specific network service model.  Templates or profiles of specific
   service are important supporting models which can be reused in the
   multiple instances of a specific network service models.

5.3.1.  QoS Profile

   QoS Profile model can help define a set of QoS parameter which can be
   applied to the network VPN service models.

6.1.  Principles of Architecture

6.1.1.  Hierarchical Architecture

   The architecture of network service models should be defined into a
   multi-level hierarchy in the object-oriented paradigm.  Different
   concern and perspective can be fulfilled through models in different
   levels in the hierarchy.

6.1.2.  Extended Architecture

   In order to adapt changes of service models, even for the network
   service model in the specific level of the hierarchy, there should be
   base model and extended model.  The parameters in the base model
   should be common to most users while the extended model can define
   parameters requireed by limited users.  If the parameters in the
   extended models can be well accepted, they can be moved to the
   corresponding base model.

6.1.3.  Three Containers

   For specific network service models there should be three primary
   containers:

   -- Service Configuration Data: The service configuration data is used
   for the network service provision.

   -- Service Operational Data: The service operational data should be
   defined for operation and maintenance of the network service.  There
   should be different levels of operational data used for business
   users and administrators.

   -- Pre-configuration.  The pre-configuration can be used to define
   the possible policy to help convert the network service model to the
   device-level configuration or the service resources used for the
   conversion.

6.1.4.  Multiple Choices

   There should be multiple choices for defining parameters for specific
   services in the network service models.  For simple use cases, only
   few parameters need to be specified for defining a service (For
   example, bandwidth is specified for QoS process).  But some
   professional users may wish to define a serial of parameters for the
   same service which can be achieved through a parameter template (For
   example, QoS profile should be introduced to define the QoS process).
   It is REQUIRED that options should be available for a service model
   to satisfy different needs.

10.  Acknowledgements

   During the course of defining requirement and architecture of carrier
   IP network services, the discussion with the IP experts from China
   Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom does great help to this work.
   The discussion in the Yang models design teams of different VPNs,
   Tunnels, MPLS features also help much for the abstraction of network
   services.  Research work of colleagues of authors of the draft in
   different controllers and orchestrators including ONOS, ODL,
   OpenStack, etc.  provides extensive thinking on the model design.
   The authors would like to acknowledge all these helpful work.
