Abstract

   This is a companion document to the IMAP CONVERT (RFC 5259) extension
   defined by the Lemonade Working Group.  It defines additional
   conversion parameters for conversions of images, audio, video and
   textual body parts.  It also demonstrates additional CONVERT usage
   scenarios.

Internet-Draft           IMAP CONVERT parameters              March 2009


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.  The five characters [...] means that something has been
   elided.

   [[anchor2: Editorial comments and questions are marked like this.]]


2.  Additional conversion parameters applicable to multiple MIME types

   The sizeLimit defines the maximum size (in bytes) of the converted
   body part.  It can be used with any conversion (including the
   "default conversion").


3.  Additional conversion parameters for image and video conversions

   Width and heigth of the resulting image can be specified using using
   the PIX-X and PIX-Y parameters defined in [DISPLAY-FEATURES].  If
   only one of the parameters is specified, the aspect ratio of the
   resulting image MUST be maintained.

   Number of different colors per image pixel (depth) can be controlled
   by the "color-levels" conversion parameter [DISPLAY-FEATURES].  This
   would typically be combined with the "color" conversion parameter
   [DISPLAY-FEATURES], which controls color encoding scheme, such as
   Mapped (palette or otherwise mapped color), Grey (grey-scale only) or
   Full (full continuous-tone color)


4.  Additional conversion parameters for conversions to text

   The FORMAT conversion parameter can be used when converting a body
   part to TEXT/PLAIN.  It can contain one of two values: "FLOWED" or
   "FIXED".  When this parameter is not specified the default is
   "FIXED".  This parameter is the most useful when converting from
   TEXT/HTML.  See [RFC3676] for more details on the exact meaning of
   this conversion parameter.

   The ExifData conversion parameter can be used when extracting Exif

   information in textual format, i.e. when converting a JPEG image to
   TEXT/PLAIN.  It can contain one of two values: "TRUE" or "FALSE".
   When this parameter is not specified the default value is "FALSE".
   The resulting TEXT/PLAIN body part is similar in format to the header
   field section of an email message [RFC5322].  Each header field name
   is as defined in section 4.6 (4.6.4 D and 4.6.6) of [EXIF] and each
   value is UTF-8 representation of the corresponding value.


5.  Additional conversion parameters for audio and video conversions

   A conversion may change codec bitrate by specifying the "bitrate"
   conversion parameter, which is a non-negative integer specifying bits
   per second.  The "encoding-method" conversion parameter can control
   whether fixed bitrate or variable bitrate encoding is used.  It might
   have one of the two values: "FBR" (for fixed bit rate) or "VBR" (for
   variable bit rate).  For variable bit rate encodings the "min-bit-
   rate" parameter can also be specified.  Its value is a non-negative
   integer specifying the minimum bits per second.

   The "frameRate" conversion parameter can specify the maximum frame
   rate in frames per second, expressed as a rational (>0) number, for
   example "49/2".


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following registrations to the registry
   established by [MEDIAFEAT-REG].

      To: "Media feature tags mailing list"
          <media-feature-tags@apps.ietf.org>
      Subject: Registration of media feature tag sizeLimit

      Media feature tag name:
           sizeLimit

      ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag:
           New assignment by IANA

      Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag:
          The sizeLimit defines the maximum size (in bytes) of the
          converted body part.  It allows a client to control
          resulting size of a body part conversion using IMAP
          CONVERT [CONVERT].
          This feature tag can be used with any conversion
          (including the "default conversion" [CONVERT]).
