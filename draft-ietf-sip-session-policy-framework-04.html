<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact
    policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call
    features. This document specifies a framework for SIP session
    policies that provides a standard mechanism by which a proxy can
    define or influence policies on sessions, such as the codecs or
    media types to be used. It defines a model, an overall
    architecture and new protocol mechanisms for session policies.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>
    is a signaling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
    multimedia sessions. A central element in SIP is the proxy
    server. Proxy servers are intermediaries that are responsible for
    request routing, rendezvous, authentication and authorization,
    mobility, and other signaling services. However, proxies are
    divorced from the actual sessions - audio, video, and session-mode
    messaging - that SIP establishes. Details of the sessions are
    carried in the payload of SIP messages, and are usually described
    with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <a class='info' href='#RFC4566'>[RFC4566]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M., Jacobson, V., and C. Perkins, &ldquo;SDP: Session Description Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>Experience has shown that there is a need for SIP
    intermediaries to impact aspects of a session. For example,
    SIP can be used in a wireless network, which has limited resources
    for media traffic. During periods of high activity, the wireless
    network provider could want to restrict the amount of bandwidth
    available to each user. With session policies, an
    intermediary in the wireless network can inform the user agent
    about the bandwidth it has available. This information
    enables the user agent to make an informed decision about the
    number of streams, the media types, and the codecs it can
    successfully use in a session. Similarly, a network provider can
    have a service level agreement with a user that defines the set of 
    media types the user can use. With session policies, the network can
    convey the current set of policies to user agents, enabling them
    to set up sessions without inadvertently violating any of the
    network policies.
</p>
<p>In another example, a SIP user agent is using a network which
    is connected to the public Internet through a firewall or a
    network border device. The network provider would like to tell the
    user agent that it needs to send its media streams to a specific
    IP address and port on the firewall or border device to reach the
    public Internet. Knowing this policy enables the user agent to set
    up sessions across the firewall or the network border. In contrast
    to other methods for inserting a media intermediary, the use of
    session policies does not require the inspection or modification
    of SIP message bodies. 
</p>
<p>Domains often have the need to enforce the session policies
    they have in place. For example, a domain might have a policy that
    disallows the use of video and can have an enforcement mechanism
    that drops all packets containing a video encoding. Unfortunately,
    these enforcement mechanisms usually do not inform the user about
    the policies they are enforcing. Instead, they silently keep the
    user from doing anything against them. This can lead to a
    malfunctioning of devices that is incomprehensible to the
    user. With session policies, the user knows about the current
    network policies and can set up policy-compliant sessions or
    simply connect to a domain with less stringent policies. Thus,
    session policies provide an important combination of consent
    coupled with enforcement. That is, the user becomes aware of the
    policy and needs to act on it, but the provider still retains the
    right to enforce the policy.
</p>
<p>Two types of session policies exist: session-specific policies
    and session-independent policies. Session-specific policies are
    policies that are created for one particular session, based on the
    session description of this session. They enable a network
    intermediary to examine the session description a UA is proposing
    and to return a policy specifically for this session
    description. For example, an intermediary could open pinholes in a
    firewall/NAT for each media stream in the proposed session
    description. It can then return a policy for the session
    description that replaces the IP addresses and ports of the UA
    with the ones opened in the firewall/NAT that are reachable from
    external. Since session-specific policies are tailored to a 
    session, they only apply to the session they are created
    for. Session-specific policies are created on a session-by-session
    basis at the time the session is established.
</p>
<p>Session-independent policies on the other hand are policies
    that are created independent of a session and generally apply to
    all SIP sessions set up by a user agent. A session-independent 
    policy can, for example, be used to inform user agents about an
    existing bandwidth limit or media type restrictions. Since these
    policies are not based on a specific session description, they can
    be created independent of an attempt to set up a session and only
    need to be conveyed to the user agent when it initializes (e.g., at
    the time the device is powered on) and when policies are
    changed.
</p>
<p>This specification defines a framework for SIP session
    policies. It specifies a model, the overall architecture and new
    protocol mechanisms that are needed for session-independent and
    session-specific policies. Since session-specific and
    session-independent policies have different requirements, this
    specification defines two different mechanisms to deliver them to
    user agents. These mechanisms are independent of each other and,
    depending on whether one or both types of session policies are
    needed, it is possible to use the session-specific or the
    session-independent mechanism or both to deliver policies to user
    agents.

Session-Independent Policies</h3>

<p>Session-independent policies are policies that are created
    independent of a session and generally apply to all sessions a 
    user agent is setting up. They typically remain stable for a
    longer period of time and apply to any session set up while they
    are valid. However, it is possible for session-independent
    policies to change over time. For example, a policy that defines a
    bandwidth limit for a user can change during the day, defining a
    lower limit during peak hours and allow more bandwidth
    off-peak. The policy server informs a UA when session-independent
    policies change.

<p>A SIP UA can receive session-independent policies from one or
      more policy servers. In a typical configuration, a UA receives
      session-independent policies from a policy server in the local
      network domain (i.e., the domain from which the UA receives IP
      service) and possibly the SIP service provider domain (i.e., the
      domain the UA registers at). The local network can have policies
      that support the access network infrastructure. For example, in
      a wireless network where bandwidth is scarce, a provider can
      restrict the bandwidth available to an individual user. The SIP
      service provider can have policies that are needed to support
      services or policies that reflect the service level agreement
      with the user. Thus, in most cases, a UA will receive
      session-independent policies from one or two policy servers.
</p>
<p>Setting up session-independent policies involves the
      following steps:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A user agent requests session-independent policies from the
        policy servers in the local network and SIP service provider
        domain. A user agent typically requests these policies when it
        starts up or connects to a new network domain.
</li>
<li>The policy server selects the policies that apply to this
        user agent. The policy server can have general policies that
        apply to all users or maintain separate policies for each
        individual user. The selected policies are returned to the
        user agent.
</li>
<li>The policy server can update the policies, for example,

UAC Behavior</h3>

<p>A UA that supports session-independent policies MUST
      attempt to retrieve session-independent policies from the local
      network and the SIP service provider domain, unless the UA knows
      (e.g., through configuration) that a domain does not provide
      session-independent policies. In this case, the UA SHOULD NOT
      retrieve session-independent policies from this specific
      domain.
</p>
<p>A UA MUST support the retrieval of session-independent
      policies from the local network and the SIP service provider 
      domain using the "ua-profile" event package defined in the <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework'>Framework for SIP
      User Agent Profile Delivery<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channabasappa, S., &ldquo;A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol User Agent Profile Delivery,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;config&#8209;framework]. The UA MAY support other
      methods of retrieving session-independent policies from local
      network and SIP service provider domain.
</p>
<p>The "ua-profile" event package <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;config&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channabasappa, S., &ldquo;A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol User Agent Profile Delivery,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> provides a
      mechanism to subscribe to session-independent policies. A UA
      subscribes to the policy server in the local 
      network domain using the procedures defined for the
      "local-network" profile-type. The UA uses the procedures defined
      for the "user" profile type to subscribe to the policy server in
      the SIP service provider domain.
</p>
<p>A UA (re-)subscribes to session-independent policies when the
      following events occur:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The UA registers a new address-of-record (AoR) or removes a
        AoR from the set of AoRs it has registered. In these cases,
        the UA MUST establish subscriptions for each new AoR using
        the "user" and the "local-network" profile-types. The UA
        MUST terminate all subscriptions for AoRs it has
        removed.
</li>
<li>The UA changes the domain it is connected to. The UA MUST
	terminate all existing subscriptions for the "local-network"
	profile-type. The UA MUST then create a new subscription for
	each AoR it maintains using the "local-network"
	profile-type. This way, the UA stops receiving policies from
	the previous local domain and starts to receive the policies
	of the new local domain. The UA does not need to change the
	subscriptions for "user" profiles.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If a subscriber is unable to establish a subscription, the subscriber
      SHOULD NOT attempt to re-try this subscription, unless one of
      the above events occurs again. This is to limit the number of
      SUBSCRIBE requests sent within domains that do not support
      session-independent policies.
</p>
<p>A UA compliant to this specification MUST support the User
      Agent Profile Data Set for Media Policy <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-media-policy-dataset'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;media&#8209;policy&#8209;dataset]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hilt, V., Worley, D., Camarillo, G., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;A User Agent Profile Data Set for Media Policy,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. To indicate
      that the UA wants to receive session-independent policies, it
      includes the MIME type "application/media-policy-dataset+xml" in
      the Accept header field of a SUBSCRIBE request. 
</p>
<p>A UA MUST apply the session-independent policies it has
      received and use these policies in the session descriptions it
      creates. If the UA decides not to use the received policies, then
      the UA MUST NOT set up a session unless it changes the domain
      that provided these policies. A UA MAY try to connect to another
      local network and/or SIP service provider domain with a
      different set of policies.
</p>
<p>If a UA receives both session-independent and
      session-specific policies, the UA MUST apply the
      session-independent policies to the session description before
      the session description is sent to the session-specific policy
      server (see <a class='info' href='#sec:specficpolicy'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Session-Specific Policies</span><span>)</span></a>). Thus,
      session-independent policies are always applied before session-specific
      policies are retrieved.

UAS Behavior</h3>

<p>A policy server MAY send a notification to the subscriber
      every time the session-independent policies covered by the
      subscription change. The definition of what causes a policy to
      change is at the discretion of the administrator. A change in
      the policy can be triggered, for example, by a change in the
      network status, by the change in the time of day or by an update 
      of the service level agreement with the customer.

Session-Specific Policies</h3>

<p>Session-specific policies are policies that are created
    specifically for one particular session of a UA. Thus,
    session-specific policies will typically be different for
    different sessions. The session-specific policies for a session
    can change during the course of the session. For example, a user
    can run out of credit during a session, which will cause the
    network to disallow the transmission all media streams from this
    point on.

<p>The following entities are needed for session-specific
      policies (see <a class='info' href='#fig:architecture'>Figure&nbsp;2</a>): a user agent
      (UA), a proxy, a policy server and possibly a policy enforcement
      entity.
</p>
<p>The role of the proxy is to provide a rendezvous mechanism
      for UAs and policy servers. It ensures that each UA has the URI
      of the policy server in its domain and knows where to retrieve
      policies from. The proxy conveys the policy server URI to UAs in
      case they have not yet received it (e.g., in a previous call or
      through configuration). The proxy does not deliver the actual
      policies to UAs.
</p>
<p>The policy server is a separate logical entity that can be
      physically co-located with the proxy. The role of the policy
      server is to deliver session policies to UAs. The policy server
      receives session information from the UA, uses this information
      to determine the policies that apply to the session and returns
      these policies to the UA. The mechanism for generating policies
      (i.e., making policy decisions) is outside of the scope of this 
      specification. A policy server can, for example, query an
      external entity to get policies or it can directly incorporate a 
      policy decision point and generate policies locally.
</p>
<p>A UA receives the URI of a policy server from a proxy. It 
      uses this URI to contact the policy server. It provides
      information about the current session to the policy server and
      receives session policies in response. The UA can also receive
      policy updates from the policy server during the course of a
      session.
</p>
<p>A network can have a policy enforcement infrastructure in
      place. However, this specification does not make any assumptions
      about the enforcement of session policies and the mechanisms
      defined here are orthogonal to a policy enforcement
      infrastructure.
</p>
<p>In principle, each domain that is traversed by SIP signaling
      messages can define session-specific policies for a
      session. Each domain needs to run a policy server and a proxy
      that is able to rendezvous a UA with the policy server (as shown
      in <a class='info' href='#fig:architecture'>Figure&nbsp;2</a>). However, it is expected
      that session-specific policies will often only be provided by
      the local domain of the user agent.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>The protocol defined in this specification clearly separates
      SIP signaling and the exchange of policies. SIP signaling is
      only used to rendezvous the UA with the policy server. From this
      point on, UA and policy server communicate directly with each
      other over a separate policy channel. This is opposed to a
      piggyback model, where the exchange of policy information
      between endpoint and a policy server in the network is
      piggybacked onto the SIP signaling messages that are exchanged
      between endpoints.
</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a separate policy channel is that
      it decouples signaling between endpoints from the policy
      exchange between an endpoint and a policy server. This
      decoupling has a number of desirable properties. It enables the
      use of separate encryption mechanisms on the signaling path to
      secure the communication between endpoints, and on the policy
      channel to secure the communication between endpoint and policy
      server. Policies can be submitted directly from the policy
      server to the endpoint and do not travel along the signaling
      path, possibly crossing many domains. Endpoints set up a
      separate policy channel to each policy server and can disclose
      the information requested by the specific policy server (e.g.,
      offer or offer/answer). Finally, policy servers do not need to
      rely on a SIP signaling message flowing by to send policies or
      policy updates to an endpoint. A policy server can use the
      policy channel at any time to update session policies as
      needed. A disadvantage of the separate channel model is that it
      requires additional messages for the exchange of policy
      information.
</p>
<p>Following this model, signaling for session-specific policies
      involves the following two fundamental tasks:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>UA/policy server rendezvous: a UA setting up a session
        needs to be able to discover the policy servers that are
        relevant to this session.
</li>
<li>Policy channel: once the UA has discovered the relevant
        policy servers for a session, it needs to connect to these
        servers, disclose session information and retrieve the
        policies that apply to this session.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The communication between UA and policy server on the policy
      channel involves the following steps:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A user agent submits information about the session it is
        trying to establish to the policy server and asks whether a
        session using these parameters is permissible.
</li>
<li>The policy server generates a policy decision for this
        session and returns the decision to the user agent. Possible
        policy decisions are (1) to deny the session, (2) to propose
        changes to the session parameters with which the session would
        be acceptable, or (3) to accept the session as it was
        proposed.
</li>
<li>The policy server can update the policy decision at a
        later time. A policy decision update can, for example, propose
        additional changes to the session (e.g., change the available
        bandwidth) or deny a previously accepted session
        (i.e., disallow the continuation of a session).
</li>
</ol>

<p>In many cases, the mechanism for session-specific policies
      will be used to disclose session information and return session
      policies. However, some scenarios only involve the
      disclosure of session information to a network intermediary. If
      an intermediary does not intend to return a policy, it can
      simply accept the session as it was proposed. Similarly, some 
      session-specific policies only apply to the offer (and therefore
      only require the disclosure of the offer) whereas others apply
      to offer and answer. Both types of policies are supported by
      session-specific policy mechanism.

Examples</h3>

<p>This section provides two examples to illustrate the overall
    operation of session-specific policies. The call flows depict the
    rendezvous mechanism between UA and policy server and indicate the
    points at which the UA exchanges policy information with the
    policy server.
</p>
<p>The example is based on the following scenario: there are two
    domains (domain A and domain B), which both have session-specific
    policies for the UAs in their domain. Both domains do not provide
    policies to the UAs outside of their domain. The two domains have
    a proxy (P A and P B) and a policy server (PS A and PS B). The
    policies in both domains involve the session description offer and
    answer.

Offer in Request</h3>

<p>The first call flow shown in <a class='info' href='#fig:flow1'>Figure&nbsp;3</a> depicts an
      INVITE transaction with the offer in the request. It is assumed
      that this is the first INVITE request the UAC creates in this
      domain and that it therefore does not have previous knowledge
      about the policy server URIs in this domain. 
</p>
<p>(1) UA A sends an INVITE request to proxy P A. P A knows that
      policies apply to this session and (2) returns a 488 (Not
      Acceptable Here) response to UA A. P A includes the URI of PS A in the 488 (Not
      Acceptable Here) response. This step is needed since the UAC has
      no prior knowledge about the URI of PS A. (3) UA A uses the URI
      to contact PS A, discloses the session description offer to PS A
      and (4) receives policies for the offer. (5) UA A reformulates
      the INVITE request under consideration of the received policies
      and includes a Policy-Id header field to indicate that it has
      already contacted PS A. P A does not reject the INVITE request this time 
      and removes the Policy-Id header field when forwarding the
      INVITE request. P B adds a Policy-Contact header field containing the
      URI of PS B. (6) UA B uses this URI to contact PS B and
      discloses the offer and the answer it is about to send. (7) UA B 
      receives policies from PS B and applies them to the offer and
      answer respectively. (8) UA B returns the updated answer in the
      200 (OK) response. (9) UA A contacts PS A with the answer and (10)
      retrieves answer policies from PS A.

Offer in Response</h3>

<p>The call flow shown in <a class='info' href='#fig:flow2'>Figure&nbsp;4</a> depicts an INVITE
      transaction with the offer in the response.
</p>
<p>(1) UA A sends an INVITE request without an offer to proxy P A and
      (2) P A returns a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response containing
      the URI of PS A. (3),(4) UA A uses this policy server URI to
      set up the policy 
      channel. At this time, UA A does not disclose a session
      description since it does not have the offer yet. (5) UA A
      re-sends the INVITE request and includes a Policy-Id header
      field to indicate that it has contacted PS A. P A does not
      reject the INVITE request this time and removes the Policy-Id header
      field when forwarding the INVITE request. P B adds a Policy-Contact
      header field containing the URI of PS B. (6) UA B uses this URI
      to discloses the offer to PS B. (7) UA B receives policies from
      PS B and applies them to the offer. (8) UA B returns the updated
      offer the 200 (OK) response. (9),(10) UA A contacts PS and discloses the 
      offer and the answer it is about to send. An important
      difference to the flow in the previous example is that UA A
      performs steps (9) and (10) before returning the answer in step
      (11). This enables UA A to return the final answer in the ACK request,
      which includes all applicable policies. However, it requires
      that PS A immediately returns a policy to avoid a delay in the
      transmission of the ACK request. (12),(13) UA B also sends the
      answer to PS B and applies the policies it receives to the
      answer before using it.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4.1"></a><h3>4.4.1.&nbsp;
UAC Behavior</h3>

<p>A UAC compliant to this specification MUST include a
      Supported header field with the option tag "policy" into all
      requests that can initiate an offer/answer exchange <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> (e.g., INVITE, UPDATE <a class='info' href='#RFC3311'>[RFC3311]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UPDATE Method,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> and PRACK <a class='info' href='#RFC3262'>[RFC3262]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> requests). The UA MUST
      include the "policy" option tag into these requests even if the
      particular request does not contain an offer or answer (e.g., an
      INVITE request without an offer). A UA MAY include the "policy"
      option tag into all requests.
</p>
<p>A UAC can receive a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response that
      contains a Policy-Contact header field. The Policy-Contact
      header field is a new header field defined in this specification. It
      contains the URI of a policy server. A 488 (Not Acceptable Here)
      response with this header field is generated by a proxy to convey the
      URI of the local policy server to the UAC. After receiving a 488
      (Not Acceptable Here) response with a Policy-Contact header field, a
      UAC compliant to this specification needs to decide if it wants
      to continue with the session now knowing that there is a policy
      server. If the UAC decides to continue, it MUST use the policy
      server URI to contact the policy server using the mechanism 
      defined in <a class='info' href='#sec:polchannel'>Section&nbsp;4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Policy Channel</span><span>)</span></a>. After receiving
      policies from the policy server, the UAC decides if it wants to
      accept these policies or not. If the UAC accepts these policies,
      the UAC MUST apply them to the current request and resend the
      updated request. If no changes are required by policies or no
      policies have been received, the request can be resent without
      any policy-induced changes. If the UAC decides that the list of 
      policy servers or the received session policies are
      unacceptable, then the UAC MUST NOT resend the request. 
</p>
<p>The UAC MAY resend the unchanged request if it cannot setup a
      policy channel to the policy server, for example, because the
      policy server is unreachable or returns an error condition that
      cannot be resolved by the UAC (i.e., error conditions other
      than, for example, a 401 (Unauthorized) responses). This is to
      avoid that the failure of a policy server prevents a UA from
      communicating.
</p>
<p>To protect the integrity of the policy server URI in a
      Policy-Contact header field, the UAC SHOULD use a secured transport
      protocol such as TLS between UAC and proxy.
</p>
<p>The UAC MUST insert a Policy-Id header field into requests for
      which it has contacted a policy server and accepted the policies
      received. The Policy-Id header field is a new header field that is defined
      in this specification. The UA MUST create a Policy-Id header field
      value for each policy server it has contacted during the
      preparation of the request. A Policy-Id header field value contains
      two pieces of information: the policy server URI and an optional
      token. The policy server URI is the URI the UA has used to
      contact the policy server. The token is an opaque string the UAC
      can receive from the policy server. A token can, for example, be
      contained in the policy document <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-media-policy-dataset'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;media&#8209;policy&#8209;dataset]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hilt, V., Worley, D., Camarillo, G., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;A User Agent Profile Data Set for Media Policy,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. If the UAC
      has received a token from the policy server the UAC MUST include
      the token in the Policy-Id header field. The format of the Policy-Id
      header field is defined in <a class='info' href='#sec:syntax'>Section&nbsp;4.4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Header Field Definition and Syntax</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Policy-Id header field is to enable a proxy
      to determine if the UAC already knows the URI of the local
      policy server. If the policy server URI is not yet known to the
      UAC, the proxy can convey this URI to the UAC by rejecting the 
      request with a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response.
</p>
<p>In some cases, a request can traverse multiple domains with a
      session-policy server. Each of these domains can return a 488
      (Not Acceptable Here) response containing a policy server 
      URI. Since the UAC contacts a policy server after receiving a
      488 (Not Acceptable Here) response from a domain and before
      re-sending the request, session policies are always applied to a
      request in the order in which the request traverses through the
      domains. The UAC MUST NOT change this implicit order among
      policy servers.
</p>
<p>A UAC frequently needs to contact the policy server in the
      local domain before setting up a session. To avoid the
      retransmission of the local policy server URI in a 488 (Not
      Acceptable Here) response for each new request, a UA SHOULD maintain a
      cache that contains the URI of the local policy server (see <a class='info' href='#sec:uricache'>Section&nbsp;4.4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Caching the Local Policy Server URI</span><span>)</span></a>). The UAC SHOULD use the cached policy
      server URI to contact the local policy server before sending a
      request that initiates the offer/answer exchange for a new
      session (e.g., an INVITE request).
</p>
<p>UAs can re-negotiate the session description during a
      session by initiating a subsequent offer/answer exchange, e.g.,
      in an INVITE, UPDATE or PRACK request. When creating such a
      mid-dialog request, a UA SHOULD contact all policy servers to
      which it has established a policy channel during the initial
      offer/answer exchange (see <a class='info' href='#sec:polchannel'>Section&nbsp;4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Policy Channel</span><span>)</span></a>)
      before sending the request. This avoids the retransmission of
      all policy server URIs in 488 (Not Acceptable Here) responses
      for mid-dialog requests.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4.2"></a><h3>4.4.2.&nbsp;
Proxy Behavior</h3>

<p>A proxy provides rendezvous functionalities for UAs and
      policy server. This is achieved by conveying the URI of a policy 
      server to the UAC or the UAS (or both) when processing INVITE,
      UPDATE or PRACK requests (or any other request that can initiate
      an offer/answer exchange).
</p>
<p>If an offer/answer exchange initiating request contains a
      Supported header field with the option tag "policy", the proxy
      MAY reject the request with a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
      to provide the local policy server URI to the UAC. Before
      rejecting a request, the proxy MUST verify that the request does
      not contain a Policy-Id header field with the local policy
      server URI as a value. If the request does not contain such a 
      header field or the local policy server URI is not present in this
      header field, then the proxy MAY reject the request with a 488 (Not
      Acceptable Here) response. The proxy MUST insert a Policy-Contact header field
      in the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response that contains the URI
      of its associated policy server. The proxy MAY add the header
      field parameter "non-cacheable" to prevent the UAC from caching
      this policy server URI (see <a class='info' href='#sec:uricache'>Section&nbsp;4.4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Caching the Local Policy Server URI</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>If the local policy server URI is present in a Policy-Id
      header field value of a request, then the proxy MUST NOT reject the
      request as described above (it can still reject the request for
      other reasons). The proxy SHOULD remove the Policy-Id header field
      value of its associated policy server from the Policy-Id header field
      before forwarding the request. This value only increases message
      size and is not relevant to other proxies on the path. It also
      would disclose the policy server URI to subsequent proxies.
</p>
<p>The Policy-Id header field serves two main purposes: first and most
      importantly, it enables the proxy to determine if a UAC already
      knows the URI of the local policy server. The second purpose of
      the Policy-Id header field is to enable a domain to route all requests
      that belong to the same session (i.e., the initial request and
      requests a UA retransmits after contacting the policy server) to
      the same proxy and policy server. This is important if a domain
      has multiple proxy/policy server combinations (e.g., in a
      proxy/policy server farm that receives requests through a load
      balancer), which create per-session state in the network. An
      example for such a scenario is a policy server that is
      associated with a session border device. The policy server
      configures the session border device after receiving a session
      description from the UAC via the policy channel. Retransmitted
      requests for such a session need to be routed to the same
      proxy/policy server as the initial request since this
      proxy/policy server combination has configured the associated
      border device for the session.
</p>
<p>Routing all requests that belong to the same session to the
      same proxy can be achieved by using the Policy-Id header field token. It
      requires that the policy server returns a token to the UAC that
      uniquely identifies the specific proxy/policy server
      combination. The UAC includes this token in the Policy-Id header field 
      and it can be used (together with the policy server URI) by the
      proxies in this domain to route the request along the desired
      path. The format of this token does not require
      standardization. The only requirement is that the token provides
      sufficient information for proxies to route the message inside
      a domain to the desired proxy/policy server. The token can,
      for example, be a numeric identifier or an IP address.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Note: it has been proposed to use the Policy-Id header field to
        provide a hint for a proxy that the UAC has actually contacted
        the policy server. This usage also requires the policy server
        to return a token to the UA. In addition, the policy server
        needs to share valid tokens with the proxy. After receiving a 
        request with a Policy-Id header field, the proxy can determine if
        the token in the Policy-Id header field is valid. If it is valid,
        the proxy knows that the UA has contacted the policy server
        for this session. However, this token does not provide any
        proof that the UA has actually used the policies it has
        received from the policy server. A malicious UA can simply
        contact the policy server, discard all policies it receives
        but still use the token in the Policy-Id header field.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proxy MAY insert a Policy-Contact header field into
      INVITE, UPDATE or PRACK requests (or any other request that can 
      initiate an offer/answer exchange) in order to convey the policy
      server URI to the UAS. If the request already contains a
      Policy-Contact header field, the proxy MUST insert the URI after
      all existing values at the end of the list. A proxy MUST NOT
      change the order of existing Policy-Contact header field values.
</p>
<p>A proxy MUST use the Record-Route mechanism <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> if its associated policy server has session
      policies that apply to mid-dialog requests. The Record-Route
      header field enables a proxy to stay in the signaling path and
      re-submit the policy server URIs to UAs during mid-dialog
      requests that initiate an offer/answer exchange. Re-submitting
      the policy server URI to UAs ensures that UAs keep contacting
      the policy server for mid-dialog requests.
</p>
<p>A proxy can find out if the UAS supports this extension by
      examining the Supported header field of responses. The proxy knows
      that the UAS supports this extension if the Supported header field
      of a response contains the option tag "policy". A proxy can use
      this information to determine if the UAS has understood the
      Policy-Contact header field it has inserted into the request.
</p>
<p>To protect the integrity of the policy server URI in a
      Policy-Contact header field, the proxy SHOULD use a secured transport
      protocol such as TLS between proxy and UAs.

UAS Behavior</h3>

<p>A UAS can receive an INVITE, UPDATE or PRACK request (or
      another request that can initiate offer/answer exchanges) that
      contains a Policy-Contact header field with a list of policy
      server URIs. A UAS that receives such a request needs to decide
      if it wants to accept the session knowing that there are policy
      servers involved. If it accepts, the UAS MUST contact all policy
      server URIs in a Policy-Contact header field. The UAS MUST contact the
      policy server URIs in the order in which they were contained in
      the Policy-Contact header field, starting with the topmost value (i.e.,
      the value that was inserted first). 
</p>
<p>If a UAS decides that it does not want to accept a session
      because there are policy servers involved or because one of the
      session policies received from a policy server is not
      acceptable, the UAS MUST reject the request with a 488 (Not
      Acceptable Here) response. 
</p>
<p>The UAS MAY accept a request and continue with setting up a
      session if it cannot setup a policy channel to the policy
      server, for example, because the policy server is unreachable or
      returns an error condition that cannot be resolved by the UAS
      (i.e., error conditions other than, for example, a 401
      (Unauthorized) response). This is to avoid that the failure of
      a policy server prevents a UA from communicating. Since this
      session might not be policy compliant without the policy
      subscription, it can be blocked by policy enforcement mechanisms
      if they are in place.
</p>
<p>A UAS can receive a token from a policy server via the policy
      channel. Since the UAS does not create a Policy-ID header field, it
      can simply ignore this token.
</p>
<p>A UAS compliant to this specification MUST include a
      Supported header field with the option tag "policy" into 
      responses to requests that can initiate an offer/answer
      exchange. The UAS MAY include this option tag in all responses. This
      way, a proxy that has inserted the Policy-Contact header field can
      know that the header field was understood by the UAS.

Caching the Local Policy Server URI</h3>

<p>A UAC frequently needs to contact the policy server in the
      local domain before setting up a session. To avoid the
      retransmission of the local policy server URI for each session,
      a UA SHOULD maintain a cache that contains the URI of the local
      policy server.
</p>
<p>A UA can receive this URI in a Policy-Contact header field of a
      request or a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response. The UA can also
      receive the local policy server URI through configuration, for
      example, via the configuration framework <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sipping&#8209;config&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Channabasappa, S., &ldquo;A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol User Agent Profile Delivery,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. If a UA has
      received a local policy server URI through configuration and
      receives another local policy server URI in a Policy-Contact
      header field, the UA SHOULD overwrite the configured URI with the most 
      recent one received in a Policy-Contact header field.
</p>
<p>Domains can prevent a UA from caching the local policy
      server URI. This is useful, for example, if the policy server
      does not need to be involved in all sessions or the policy
      server URI changes from session to session. A proxy can mark the
      URI of such a policy server as "non-cacheable". A UA MUST NOT
      cache a non-cacheable policy server URI. The UA SHOULD remove the
      current URI from the cache when receiving a local policy server
      URI that is marked as  "non-cacheable". This is to avoid the use
      of policy server URIs that are outdated.
</p>
<p>The UA SHOULD NOT cache policy server URIs it has received
      from proxies outside of the local domain. These policy servers
      need not be relevant for subsequent sessions, which can go to a
      different destination, traversing different domains.
</p>
<p>The UA MUST NOT cache tokens it has received from a policy 
      server. A token is only valid for one request.

Creation and Management</h3>

<p>A UA discovers the list of policy servers relevant for a
      session during the initial offer/answer exchange (see <a class='info' href='#sec:distmech'>Section&nbsp;4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>UA/Policy Server Rendezvous</span><span>)</span></a>). A UA compliant to this specification 
      MUST set up a policy channel to each of the discovered policy
      server. If the UA does not want to set up a policy channel to
      one of the policy servers provided, the UA MUST NOT continue
      with the session. This means that, the UA MUST cancel or reject
      a pending INVITE transaction for the session or terminate the
      session if it is already in progress. 
</p>
<p>If setting up a policy channel to one of the discovered
      policy servers fails, the UA MAY continue with the initiation of
      a session without contacting this policy server. Setting up a
      policy channel can fail, for example, because the server is
      unreachable or returns an error condition that cannot be
      resolved by the UAC (i.e., error conditions other than, for
      example, a 401 (Unauthorized) responses). The UA SHOULD continue
      an ongoing session if a policy server fails after the session
      has been set up. The UA SHOULD consider the policies it
      has previously received from the failed policy server. This is
      to avoid that the failure of a policy server prevents a UA from 
      communicating.
</p>
<p>A UA MUST maintain the policy channel to each discovered
      policy server during the lifetime of a session, unless the
      policy channel is closed by the policy server or the UA
      discovers that the policy server is no longer relevant for the
      session as described below.
</p>
<p>A UAC can receive a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response with a
      Policy-Contact header field containing a new policy server URI in
      response to a mid-dialog request. This indicates that the set of
      policy servers relevant for the current session has changed. If
      this occurs, the UAC MUST retry sending the request as if it was
      the first request in a dialog (i.e., without applying any
      policies except the policies from the local policy server). This 
      way, the UAC will re-discover the list of policy servers
      for the current session. The UAC should compare the new list
      with the list of policy servers to which it currently has 
      established a policy channel. The UAC MUST set up a policy
      channel to each new policy server. The UAC SHOULD close policy
      channels to policy server that are not listed any more. The UAC
      MUST contact policy servers in the order in which they were 
      discovered in the most recent request.
</p>
<p>If a UAS receives a mid-dialog request with a Policy-Contact
      header field containing a list of policy server URIs that is different
      from the list of policy servers to which the UAS has currently
      established a policy channel, then the UAS MUST set up a policy
      channel to all new policy servers and contact them. The UAS
      SHOULD close policy channels to servers that are not listed any
      more. The UAS MUST use policy servers in the order in which they
      were contained in the most recent Policy-Contact header field.
</p>
<p>A UA MUST inform the policy server when a session is
      terminated via the policy channel, unless a policy server
      indicates via the policy channel that it does not need to be
      contacted at the end of the session. This enables a policy
      server to free all resources it has allocated for this
      session.

Contacting the Policy Server</h3>

<p>A UA MUST contact all policy servers to which it has
      established a policy channel before sending or after receiving a
      mid-dialog request. The UA MUST contact the policy servers in the
      order in which they were discovered most recently.
</p>
<p>A UA that receives a SIP message containing an offer or
      answer SHOULD completely process the message (e.g., according to
      <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>RFC3261<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261]) before contacting the policy
      server. The SIP processing of the message includes, for example,
      updating dialog state and timers as well as creating ACK or
      PRACK requests as necessary. This ensures that contacting a
      policy server does not interfere with SIP message processing and
      timing (e.g., by inadvertently causing timers to expire). This
      implies, for example, that a UAC which has received a response
      to an INVITE request should finish the processing of the
      response including transmitting the ACK request before it contacts the
      policy server. An important exception to this rule is discussed
      in the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>In some cases, a UA needs to use the offer/answer it has
      received in a SIP message to create an ACK or PRACK request for
      this message, i.e., it needs to use the offer/answer before
      finishing the SIP machinery for this message. For example, a UAC
      that has received an offer in the response to an INVITE request
      needs to apply policies to the offer and the answer before it
      can send the answer in an ACK request. In these cases, a UA SHOULD
      contact the policy server even if this is during the processing
      of a SIP message. This implies that a UA, which has received an
      offer in the response of an INVITE request, should contact the
      policy server and apply session policies before sending the
      answer in the ACK request.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Note: this assumes that the policy server can always
        respond immediately to a policy request and does not require
        manual intervention to create a policy. This will be the case
        for most policy servers. If, however, a policy server cannot
        respond with a policy right away, it can return a policy that
        temporarily denies the session and update this policy as the
        actual policy decision becomes available. A delay in the
        response from the policy server to the UA would delay the
        transmission of the ACK request and could trigger retransmissions of
        the INVITE response (also see the recommendations for Flow I
        in <a class='info' href='#RFC3725'>RFC3725<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Peterson, J., Schulzrinne, H., and G. Camarillo, &ldquo;Best Current Practices for Third Party Call Control (3pcc) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3725]).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The case of multiple policy servers providing policies to the
      same UA requires additional considerations. A policy returned by
      one policy server can contain information that needs to be
      shared with the other policy servers. For example, two policy
      servers can have the policy to insert a media intermediary by
      modifying the IP addresses and ports of media streams. In order
      for media streams to pass through both intermediaries, each
      intermediary needs to know the IP address and port on which the
      other media intermediary is expecting the stream to arrive. If
      media streams are flowing in both directions, this means that
      each intermediary needs to know IP addresses and ports of the
      other intermediary.
</p>
<p>UAs usually contact a policy server twice during an
      offer/answer exchange (unless a policy server indicates that it
      only needs to be contacted once). Therefore the case of
      multiple policy servers providing policies to a single 
      UA does not require additional steps in most cases. However, a
      UAS usually contacts each policy server only once (see <a class='info' href='#fig:flow2'>Figure&nbsp;4</a>). If a session policy returned by one of
      the policy servers requires that information is shared between
      multiple servers and the UAS receives policies from more than one policy
      server, the UAS MUST contact all policy servers a second time
      after contacting all servers the first time. Whether or not this
      second round is required is determined by the type of
      information returned by the policy server. The data format for
      session policies explicitly states if a second round is
      needed for a particular data element. If a UAS supports this
      data format and receives such an element, it knows that is
      expected to contact policy servers a second time. If such a data element is
      modified during a mid-call offer/answer exchange and multiple
      policy servers are providing policies to a UA then all UAs MUST
      contact policy servers in a first and second round. An example
      call flow for the UAS is shown in <a class='info' href='#sec:multiuas'>Appendix&nbsp;B.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Multiple Policy Servers for UAS</span><span>)</span></a>.

Using Session Policies</h3>

<p>A UA MUST disclose the session description(s) for the current 
      session to policy servers through the policy channel. The UA
      MUST apply session policies it receives to the offer and, if one
      is received, to the answer before using the offer/answer. If
      these policies are unacceptable, the UA MUST NOT continue with
      the session. This means that, the UA MUST cancel or reject a
      pending INVITE transaction for the session or terminate the
      session if it is already in progress. If the UA receives an
      unacceptable policy in an INVITE response, the UA MUST complete
      the INVITE transaction and then terminate the session.
</p>
<p>When a UA receives a notification about a change in the
      current policies, the UA MUST apply the updated policies to the
      current session or the UA MUST terminate the session. If the
      policy update causes a change in the session description of a
      session, then the UA needs to re-negotiate the modified session
      description with its peer UA, for example, using a re-INVITE or
      UPDATE request. For example, if a policy update disallows the
      use of video and video is part of the current session
      description, then the UA will need to create an new session
      description offer without video. After receiving this offer, the
      peer UA knows that video can't be used any more and responds
      with the corresponding answer.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Session policies can significantly change the behavior of a
    user agent and can be used by an attacker to compromise a user
    agent. For example, session policies can be used to prevent a user
    agent from successfully establishing a session (e.g., by setting
    the available bandwidth to zero). Such a policy can be submitted
    to the user agent during a session, which causes the UA to
    terminate the session.
</p>
<p>A user agent transmits session information to a policy server
    for session-specific policies.  This session information can
    contain sensitive data the user does not want an eavesdropper or an
    unauthorized policy server to see. Vice versa, session policies
    can contain sensitive information about the network or service
    level agreements the service provider does not want to disclose to
    an eavesdropper or an unauthorized user agent.
</p>
<p>It is important to secure the communication between the proxy
    and the user agent (for session-specific policies) as well as the
    user agent and the policy server. The following four discrete
    attributes need to be protected:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>integrity of the policy server URI (for session-specific
      policies),
</li>
<li>authentication of the policy server and, if needed, the user
      agent,
</li>
<li>confidentiality of the messages exchanged between the user
      agent and the policy server and
</li>
<li>ensuring that private information is not exchanged between
      the two parties, even over an confidentiality-assured and
      authenticated session.
</li>
</ol>

<p>To protect the integrity of the policy server URI, a UA SHOULD
    use a secured transport protocol such as TLS between proxies and
    the UA. Protecting the integrity of the policy server URI is
    important since an attacker could intercept SIP messages between
    the UA and the proxy and remove the policy header fields needed for 
    session-specific policies. This would impede the rendezvous
    between UA and policy server and, since the UA would not contact
    the policy server, can prevent a UA from setting up a
    session.
</p>
<p>Instead of removing a policy server URI, an attacker can also
    modify the policy server URI and point the UA to a compromised
    policy server. To prevent such an attack from being effective, it
    is RECOMMENDED that a UA authenticates policy servers. 
</p>
<p>Policy servers SHOULD authenticate UAs to protect the information
    that is contained in a session policy. However, a policy server
    can also frequently encounter UAs it cannot authenticate. In these
    cases, the policy server MAY provide a generic policy that does
    not reveal sensitive information to these UAs.
</p>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that administrators use SIPS URIs as policy
    server URIs so that subscriptions to session policies are
    transmitted over TLS.
</p>
<p>The above security attributes are important to protect the
    communication between the user agent and policy server. This
    document does not define the protocol used for the communication
    between user agent and policy server and merely refers to other
    specifications for this purpose. The security considerations of
    these specifications need to address the above security
    aspects.
