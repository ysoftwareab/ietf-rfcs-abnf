1. Introduction

   This memo describes how a BXXP[1] session is mapped onto the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol[2]. Refer to Section 2.5 of [1] for an
   explanation of the mapping requirements.

2. Session Management

   The mapping of BXXP session management onto the SCTP service is
   straight-forward.

   A BXXP session is established when a SCTP association is established
   between two BXXP peers: 

   o  the BXXP peer that issues an ASSOCIATE call is termed the
      initiator; and,

   o  the BXXP peer that receives a COMMUNICATIONS UP notification is
      termed the listener.

   During association establishment, both BXXP peers request 256
   outbound SCTP streams (the maxinum number of channels allowed by
   BXXP).

   A BXXP session is released when either peer issues the SHUTDOWN
   call, and the SCTP association is subsequently terminated.

   A BXXP session is terminated when either peer issues the ABORT call,
   and the SCTP associated is subsequently aborted.

3. Data Exchange

   The mapping of BXXP data exchange onto the SCTP service is
   straight-forward.

   Messages on a given channel are reliably sent and received using the
   SEND and RECEIVE calls: 

   o  the mapping between BXXP channel numbers and SCTP stream
      identifiers is the identity function; and,

   o  the "unorder" flag is not present to provide orderly delivery of
      messages on the same BXXP channel.

   Note that SCTP provides flow control for each BXXP channel (SCTP
   stream) directly, so no additional flow control mechanisms are
   necessary in this mapping (unlike the mapping[3] used over a single
   TCP connection).

4. Special Behavior

   If use of a transport security profile is negotiated, then in
   addition to be used over BXXP channel (SCTP stream) zero, then, each
   time a BXXP channel is created, a new transport security context
   must be negotiated over the underlying SCTP stream.
