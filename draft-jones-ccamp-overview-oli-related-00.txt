1. Abstract

   This document presents an overview of contributions made in IETF,
   ITU-T and T1X1.5 pertaining to the Optical Link Interface (OLI) and
   related interfaces. The intent is to summarize for the IETF
   community the different approaches and corresponding interface and
   protocol specification under-construction in these different
   standardization bodies; this in order to provide the material during
   CCAMP WG meetings. Since the scope of this memo is not to replace in
   any case these contributions, we also strongly encourage the reader
   to refer to these contributions for more details.

   Notice since OIF contributions are regulated by privacy copyright
   related documents arenÆt referenced in this memo.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

3. Introduction

   Existing contributions on OLI or related interfaces general fall
   into 2 types:
   - Requirements for interface to pass information between devices to
     provide information for fault/failure reporting, connectivity/
     adjacency discovery. Some also propose information exchange for
     performance monitoring and protection switching.
   - Proposals for protocol extensions to provide such an interface.

   This document organizes and summarizes existing contributions into
   these categories. Before the summary is given, several discussion
   points are presented for use during the OLI discussions.

   The term OLI is not universally used, and T1X1.5 and ITU-T
   contributions refer to similar interfaces as Optical Supervisory
   Interface (OSI) or Virtual Backplane Interface (VBI). In any event,
   the interface of interest is between a passive device (OXC, PXC or
   optical fabric) and an active device (an Optical Line System or I/O
   port). Information is passed over this interface to the passive
   device by the active device, which terminates in-band signals of the
   data plane.

   OLI used in combination with LMP-WDM has been proposed as the
   protocol of choice by IETF during the London CCAMP WG meeting.
   However, IETF is seeking cooperation with other bodies T1/ITU-T in
   order to progress in this domain.

4. Requirement Contribution

   1. Reference: draft-many-oli-reqts-00.txt, June 2001 (essentially
      the same as T1M1.3/2000-037)

   ôAbstract: We analyze the requirements event communications between
   the active and passive devices, which in turn can be used by the
   optical control plane.  This function is to be defined in such that
   it works without an upper GMPLS layer.  This document includes
   requirements that may be address by either LMP or OLI documents.ö

   This reference further defines - from abstract: ôThe information
   that needs to be shared (between optical line systems (OLSÆs) and
   OLS client devices) includes link status and link properties. We
   call this interface the Optical Link Interface (OLI). In this
   document, we provide high-level requirements for the OLI.ö

   The purpose of this document is to define the needs of active
   systems to communicate with passive systems. This document separates
   the various requirements with the following goals in mind:
   - For active systems to monitor and communicate the status and
     configuration of different lambda(s), link(s) and equipment(s),
     which are not visible to the passive systems and communicate the
     status to the relevant parties.
   - Reduce the error detection and immediate reporting time to passive
     systems (State reporting only is required.)

   Monitored information reported via link management should only
   include degraded conditions that exceed SLAs. Document calls for
   information on:
   - Link State: Signal Failed, Signal Degrade, Operational, Unequipped
     Available, Unequipped Unavailable, Automatic Report Control
   - Link Configuration: such as Link Node Identification, Link
     Identification, Grade of Service

   It also calls for faster defect reporting time (few 10Æs of msec),
   attention to security and a reliable protocol.

   OLI is required to provide fast failure detection and notification
   for PXCs, and provide information for the operation of both
   centralized and GMPLS-controlled optical networks.

   OLI is targeted at the information required for the control plane to
   accomplish its task. Document presents requirement outline for:
   - General Properties: accessibility, extensibility, simplicity,
     independence from control plane)
   - General Characteristics: reliability, security, support for
     multiple OLSÆs)
   - Functionality: Neighbor/Adjacency Discovery, Control Channel
     Maintenance, Connectivity Discovery, Fault Management and Link

   From abstract: ôThis document introduces the environment of the OTM-
   LF and compares it with existing equipment. Based on this, 10
   applications requiring supervisory information being carried over
   this OTM-LF are defined. It is proposed to use this outline as a
   basis for the specification work of this new OTM-LF interface.ö

   This contribution:
   - Begins with analysis of existing equipment with a ôbackplaneö
     interface between I/O port cards and fabric cards, to derive OSI
     requirements.
   - Analyzes needs from data, management and control planes.
   - Recommends single OSI per equipment connected using LAN-type
     architecture.
   - Recommends various applications for OSI:
        - Connection Status
        - Port Management
        - OLS Discovery
        - Status monitoring of physical interface and communications
          over funiculus/OSI
        - Control and Management Plane Communication
        - OCh Overhead
        - Protection Switch Endpoint Coordination and Functional Model
          Emulation
        - Auxiliary Communication
   - Describes various tributary types and the resultant maintenance
     signals forward to the OXC on a failure. Also describes signals
     originated in OXC forwarded to OLS.

   3. Reference: ITU Contribution - New equipment partitioning, October
      2001

   From abstract: Proposes a new recommendation G.vbi to support
   interworking over the virtual backplane interface as introduced in
   this contribution.

   - Motivation for a VBI is that integration of OLS and OXC into a
     single equipment is not expected in same way that SDH LT and ADM
     functions where merged with DXCs. Monitoring functions not
     duplicated in OXC and OLS. Hence standard OXC-OLS interface is
     required.
   - Associated contributions discuss VBI applications, physical
     aspects and performance aspects.
   - Discussed tradeoffs between VBI interface choices:
       - packet interface (e.g. Ethernet LAN)
       - channeled bit oriented interface to/from a central channel
         cross connect function
       - dedicated backplane overhead defined in traffic interface
         signals
   - Presented similar list of applications as T1X1.5/2001-165.

   This contribution:
   - Discusses functions of Automatic Discovery and Fault Notification
     and Trace Monitoring.
   - Outlines main interface requirements
       - Reliable transport protocol between the fabric (PXC) and the
         Line System (LS).
       - The control channel is implemented out of band (e.g. OSC,
         Ethernet, or other media).
       - OLS keeps minimum state information. The responsibility for
         coordination and control is at the fabric.
       - Control channel maintenance uses a simple keep-alive
         mechanism.
       - There is a mechanism for resynchronization if the session is
         disrupted for any reason.
       - Fault reporting must be both event-driven and available
   - Supports discovery using test transmitters and receivers connected
     to well-known ports of the fabric, and terminated by the OLS or
     test TXÆs and RXÆs on other PXCÆs.

5. Protocol Contribution

   1. Reference: T1X1.5/2001-099, January 2001 - Detecting and
      correlating external path-related faults and degradations by
      extending LMP between OXC and DWDM

   From abstract: ôThe need for faster detection and restoration of
   faults and degradations ... calls for tighter control on the
   detection and reporting mechanisms. In this document we propose some
   such extensions that can be made to the LMP to run between the DWDM
   and OXC. This proposal is to extend [draft-fredette-lmp-wdm-00.txt]
   and to streamline the needs for such a protocol.ö

   This contribution:
   - Proposal streamlines different requirements with the following
     goals in mind:
       - Monitor and communicate the status of different lambda(s),
         link(s) and equipment(s), which are not visible to the OXC and
         communicate the status to the relevant parties.
       - Reduce the error detection and reporting time.
           . Fault reporting should be both event-driven and polling-
             driven.
           . Monitored information should be periodic and event-driven
             (in case of degrading links or on demand).
       - Avoid all downstream nodes detecting the same error and
         sending myriad of messages to the upstream nodes.
       - Backward notification of the forward path status to ease the
         layer 3 signaling intervention (for future extension).
   - Presents different actions to be performed by different equipment
     (LDWDM, OXC, UDWDM) in response to the above-identified
     degradation or fault locations (to understand the protocol
     operations the protocol fields that need to be carried).
   - Suggests objectives for transport mechanisms, security, capability
     negotiation, monitoring requirements and fault localization/
     reporting.

   2. Reference: draft-fredette-lmp-wdm-02.txt, July 2001

   From abstract: ôAs part of this protocol suite, the Link Management
   Protocol (LMP) [LMP] is defined to "maintain control channel
   connectivity, verify component link connectivity, and isolate link,
   fiber, or channel failures within the network."  In it's present
   form, [LMP] focuses on peer communications (eg. OXC-to-OXC).  In
   this document we propose extensions to LMP for use with OLSs.  These
   extensions are intended to satisfy the "Optical Link Interface
   Requirements" described in [OLI].ö

   The model for extending LMP to OLSs is shown in the following
   figure:

           +------+       +------+       +------+       +------+

             +----------------------LMP----------------------+

                          Figure 3. Extended LMP Model

   - Refers to multiple LMP sessions that may exist simultaneously on
     same resources (one OXC-OXC and one OXC-OLS). These sessions have

     different purposes, must be independent and not conflict (during
     Verification process).
   - LMP consists of four types of functions:
       - Control Channel Management
       - Link Verification
       - Link Summarization
       - Fault Management (localization and notification)
     All four functions are supported in LMP-WDM. Additionally, a trace
     monitoring function is added.
   - An update is planned in light of revised LMP draft.

   3. Reference: draft-sahay-ccamp-ntip-01.txt, July 2001.

   As decided during the last CCAMP WG meeting, LMP approach has
   received precedence over draft-sahay-ccamp-ntip-01.txt: Network
   Transport Interface Protocol (NTIP) for Photonic Cross Connects
   (PXC), July 2001. The interested reader is thus invited to read the
   corresponding reference for more details.

   There are no security considerations in addition to the ones
   mentioned in the referenced documents.
