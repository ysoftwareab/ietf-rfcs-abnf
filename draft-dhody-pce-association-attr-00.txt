     Path Computation Element communication Protocol extension for
                relationship between LSPs and Attributes
                  draft-dhody-pce-association-attr-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).

   This document defines a mechanism to create associations between a
   set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters
   or behaviors).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   [I-D.minei-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
   configuration parameters or behaviours).

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
   LSPs with a set of attributes, which includes, but not limited to -

   o  Configured Parameters

   o  Policies

   o  Behaviour

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   AGID:  Association Group ID.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

3.  Motivation

   This section discusses in more detail the motivation and use cases
   for such a assosiation.

3.1.  Policy based Constraints

   In the context of policy-enabled path computation [RFC5394], path
   computation policies may be applied at both a PCC and a PCE.
   Consider an Label Switch Router (LSR) with a policy enabled PCC, it
   receives a service request via signaling, including over a Network-
   Network Interface (NNI) or User Network Interface (UNI) reference
   point, or receives a configuration request over a management
   interface to establish a service.  The PCC may also apply user- or
   service-specific policies to decide how the path selection process
   should be constrained, that is, which constraints, diversities,
   optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation strategies should
   be applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have a likelihood to be
   successfully established and provide necessary QoS and resilience
   against network failures.  The user- or service-specific policies
   applied to PCC and are then passed to the PCE along with the Path
   computation request, in the form of constraints [RFC5394].

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   [I-D.minei-pce-association-group] to assosiate a set of LSPs with
   policy and its resulting path computation constraints.  This way
   simplifying the path computation message exchanges.

3.2.  Bundled requests

   In some scenarios(e.g.,the topology example described in Section 4.6
   of [RFC6805]), there is a need to send multiple requests with the
   same constraints and attributes to the PCE.  Currently these requests
   are either sent in a separate path computation request (PCReq)
   messages or bundled together in one (or more) PCReq messages.  In
   either case, the constraints and attributes need to be encoded
   separately for each request even though they are exactly identical.

   If a assosiation is used to identify these constraints and attributes
   shared by multiple requests, thus simplifying the path computation
   message exchanges.

4.  Overview

   As per [I-D.minei-pce-association-group], LSPs are associated with
   other LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common
   association group.  This document use the same association for
   attributes and called Attribute Association Group (AAG) based on the
   generic Association object.  This document defines a new association
   type called "Attribute Association Type" of value TBD.  An AAG can
   have one or more LSPs and its assosiated attributes.  The scope and
   handling of AAG identifier is similar to the generic association
   identifier defined in [I-D.minei-pce-association-group].

5.  Attribute Association Group

   The format of the Association object used for AAG is shown in
   Figure 1:

    0                   1                   2                   3
