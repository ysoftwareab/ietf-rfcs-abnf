Internet-Draft    Bypassing Ingress Filtering for NEMO         June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Recently, the NEMO working group [1] is dealing with the multihoming
   issues [2] in NEMO and is also concerned about an ingress filtering
   problem.  However, there is no suitable solution for the ingress
   filtering problem in multihomed NEMO.  So, we consider about this
   ingress filtering problem when there are multiple MRs, HAs, and MNPs.
   Suppose that there is a multihomed NEMO which has multiple MRs.  If
   any MN wnats to handover to other MRs it should change its address.
   The stateless or stateful auto-configuration procedure of IPv6 for
   the acquisition of a new care-of address is used in this case, it
   takes very long time and connectivity cannot be sustained.  In
   addition, if any MR fails, and hence it cannot provide any more
   service, one of the backup MRs should provide service on behalf of
   the blocked one.  But in this case, if the mobile and fixed nodes are
   provided the Internet service by the backup MR with no change of
   their addresses, ingress filtering problem will occur.  Accordingly,
   we propose a prefix peer CoA registration mechanism in this draft.
   The mobile and fixed nodes can be provided the Internet service
   without the ingress filtering problem nor address changing in the
   above situation using our proposed mechanism.  And MN's soft handover
   is also possible while maintain its connectivity.  Our proposed
   mechanism extends the multiple CoA registration mechanism for a
   multihomed host [3].


2.  Terminology

   Terms used in this draft are defined in [4], [5] and [6].  We define
   or redefine the following ones:

   Active Mobile Router

      An Active mobile router is an MR that is currently used and
      advertises its own mobile network prefix (MNP).

   Blocked Mobile Router

      A blocked mobile router is an MR i) whose egress interface or
      ingress interface fails. ii) itself fails.  Here, "failure" means
      an MR loses the connectivity due to mobility, fading and so on.

   Peer Mobile Router

      A peer mobile router is an MR capable of providing Internet
      services instead of a blocked or an active MR.  A peer MR (PMR)
      should be first authenticated by an active MR or its HA in the
      same NEMO to prevent malicious nodes from spoofing.  An MR hearing

      router advertisement (RA) messages from neighboring MRs initiates
      a PMR authentication depending on its policy.  Also, the technique
      proposed in [7] can be also used for the PMR authentication.

   Prefix Peer Binding Update (PPBU)

      Prefix peer binding update means that this binding update message
      is sent by PMRs.  PPBU has different meanings depending on the
      alternative flag in Binding Unique Identifier sub-option.  If the
      alternative flag is set to 1, it means that a PMR sends this
      binding update message for PMR registration.  Otherwise, this
      binding update message is sent by a PMR to change the active CoA
      of the MNP in binding cache of a HA.

   Active CoA

      An active CoA is a CoA that is currently used in the NEMO.  The
      active field in binding cache entry of the HA corresponding to the
      CoA is set to 1.

   Peer CoA

      A peer CoA is a CoA that is assigned to the egress interface of a
      PMR.  This CoA will be used to provide Internet service instead of
      a blocked mobile router.

   ICMP Mobile Router Hint

      The ICMP Mobile Router Hint message is sent by the active or
      blocked MR to its PMR.  By this message, the PMR can know the
      state of the active MR more quickly and HA address of the active
      or blocked MR to perform PPBU.  This is an option.


3.  Problem Statement

   When there are multiple MRs in a multihomed mobile network, the MNP
   of each MR can be different from each other.  When an MN wants to
   handover to another MRs without address changes or an MN of the
   blocked MR directly uses the peer MR without address change, an MN
   will send a packet to peer MR.  The MR2, which is the peer MR, has
   only one tunnel to HA2 so all packets arrived at MR2 will be
   forwarded.  And then this packet must be discarded at a home network
   of the peer MR because of the ingress filtering according to a policy
   of ISP.  So, we need the solution of ingress filtering.  For this, we
   introduce how to bypass ingress filtering.  The detailed operation is
   followed.

4.  Protocol Overview

   To provide a way to bypass ingress filtering for a multihomed mobile
   network, we propose to make a "prefix peer" relationship among the
   MRs.  The prefix peer relationship is realized by introducing a
   prefix peer binding update (PPBU) message.  Detailed operations are
   described in the following chapters.

4.1.  Prefix peer care-of address registration

   Prefix peer CoA registration is an extended version of multiple CoAs
   registration mechanism for mobile IPv6 [4].  An MR can register not
   only its CoA but also delegate its PMR to register the PMR's CoA as a
   peer CoAs by using multiple CoAs registration.  The registered CoA of
   PMRs is used to provide continuous Internet service and to bypass
   ingress filtering.  If the MR wants to delegate its PMR to register
   the PMR's CoA, it must generate a BID and use this when it sends BU.
   The PMR also generate a BID and use that when it sends a PPBU.  After
   receiving the BU or the PPBU, the HA adds or updates an entry
   corresponding to the CoA in the BU or the PPBU into its binding
   cache.

Internet-Draft    Bypassing Ingress Filtering for NEMO         June 2006


4.2.  Prefix peer care-of address de-registration

   If the MR is plan to move another network or it can not provide peer
   services, it should de-register its CoA.  When the MR wants to de-
   register its CoA, it sends a PPBU with the unset prefix peer flag in
   the Binding Update identifier sub-option to the HA which has this CoA
   entry as a peer CoA in its binding cache.  After receiving this PPBU,
   the HA deletes this CoA entry from its binding cache.

4.3.  Bypassing ingress filtering

   The point of our mechanism is that there are no IP address changes.
   The PMR takes over service of an active or a blocked MR by relaying
   the packets from an active or a blocked MR's node.  Since a source
   address of that packet is not changed, ingress filtering will not
   occur.  IF the PMR starts advertising the MNP of the active or
   blocked MR in addition to its own MNP, the PMR can provide Internet
   service for the active or blocked MR's node.  That is, if the PMR
   receives a packet from fixed nodes or MNs belonging to the MNP of the
   active or the blocked MR, it forwards the packet through an
   appropriate tunnel between the HA of the active or the blocked MR and
   itself for seamless connectivity.  So, ingress filtering problem is
   solved because there are no IP address changes.

   Especially, we illustrate the multihomed NEMO which consists of 2
   HAs, 2 MRs, and 2 MNPs.  The MR1 and the MR2 have a peer relationship
   each other using prefix peer binding update.  If MN of MR1 wants to
   handover to MR2 or there are some problem (ingress or egress
   interface failure) at MR1, the peer MR (MR2) will take over the MR1's
   service.  Packets from an MN or a fixed node of MR1 will be forwarded
   to HA1 through MR2, so there is no ingress filtering problem.


5.  Multiple care-of address extensions

5.1.  Binding Cache Structure Changes

   To support bypassing ingress filtering, there are multiple MRs in a
   multihomed NEMO.  Hence, additional fields are defined in the binding
   cache structure as follow:

   - Active : Active means the CoA is now in use.  The value MUST be
   zero if the CoA is not active.

   - Peer : Peer means this CoA is a PMR's one.  The value MUST be zero
   if the CoA is not a PMR's CoA.

5.2.  Binding Update Structure Changes

   Additional flags are required in the binding update structure, which
   are:

   - Prefix peer flag : Prefix peer flag MUST be set to 0 if the binding
   update is not sent by a peer MR or is used for de-registration of
   prefix peer CoA by PMR.

   - Alternative flag : Alternative flag MUST be set to 1 if the CoA is
   the peer CoA.

5.3.  Message Format Changes

   Additional flags are required in the binding update structure, which
   are:

5.3.1.  Binding Unique Identifier sub-option

   New Alternative (A) flag and new prefix peer flag (P) are included in
   the Binding Unique Identifier sub-option.  The rest of the Binding
   Unique Identifier sub-option format remains the same as defined in
   [3].

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------------------------------+

   Prefix Peer (P)

      The prefix peer flag is set to indicate to the HA whether this BU
      is sent by the PMR (PPBU) or a peer CoA de-registration for
      already registered one.  If the flag is set to 0, it is just a BU
      or the de-registration sent by PMR.

   Alternative (A)

      The alternative flag is set to indicate to the HA whether the CoA
      in the binding update is a peer CoA or not.  If this flag in PPBU
      is set to 0, the active filed of this CoA in binding cache should
      be set.

   For descriptions of the other fields in the message, see [3].

5.4.  HA Operation

5.4.1.  Registration and de-registration

   When the HA receives the PPBU message that includes the CoA of a PMR
   with alternative flag set to 1, it checks its binding cache.  If the
   HA does not have this CoA entry in its binding cache, it adds an
   entry corresponding to this CoA as a peer CoA.  The binding cache
   entry has an active field set to 0 and a peer field set to 1.  When
   the HA receive the BU message that includes the CoA of a PMR with
   alternative flag set to 1, it also checks its binding cache.  If the
   HA does not have this CoA entry in its binding cache, it silently
   discards this packet.  If it does, it deletes this CoA entry.  After
   management its binding cache, the HA responds BU ACK to the PMR.

5.5.  MR Operation

5.5.1.  Registration and de-registration

   After the successful PMR authentication, the PMR sends a PPBU to the
   HA of the active MR for peer MR registration.  This PPBU includes the
   CoA of a PMR and alternative flag set to 1 in Binding Update
   Identifier sub-option.  If the PMR wants to de-register its CoA, it
   sends a PPBU with the unset prefix peer flag in the Binding Update

   identifier sub-option and alternative flag set to 1 to the HA which
   has this CoA entry as a peer CoA in its binding cache.

5.6.  New Message Format

5.6.1.  ICMP Mobile Router Hint

   The ICMP Mobile Router Hint message is sent by the active or blocked
   MR to its PMR.  By this message, the PMR can know the state of the
   active MR more quickly and HA address of the active or blocked MR to
   perform PPBU.  If code value is 1, it means that this Hint message
   (Failure Notify) doesn't need an ACK message.  This ICMP MR Hint
   message is an option.

6.  Conclusion

   In this draft, we propose a solution of the ingress filtering problem
   on multihomed NEMO.  The peer MRs can provide continuous Internet
   service to an MN for seamless MR handover or any node that has been
   attached to a blocked MR, thus ingress filtering problem can be
   avoided.  For our proposed scheme, very few modifications to multiple
   care-of address registration and NEMO are required.


7.  Security Consideration

   In this draft, we assume that a peer MR is already authenticated by
   using an MR authentication mechanism [7].  However, it is necessary

   to design more secure authentication mechanism with low overhead.

Appendix A.  MR Failover

   In this section, the mechanism of MR failover is described.  In
   general, an MR uses the wireless channel as an egress interface for
   NEMO support.  Because this wireless channel is subject to
   disconnectivity due to channel error, blackout, or handover, some
   link failures may occur.  After the HA of an active MR authenticates
   and registers a PMR successfully, the PMR should be able to take over
   if the active MR fails.

A.1.  HA operation

   When a HA1 receives a PPBU with the unset alternative flag in the
   Binding Update Identifier sub-option but the peer field in binding
   cache entry of this HA corresponding to the CoA in the PPBU is set to
   1, the HA1 assumes that the MR1 fails.  If the HA1 does not have any
   entry corresponding to this CoA, it silently discards this message.
   The CoA of the active MR1 in binding cache whose active field set to
   1 cannot be used because of active MR failure.  Thus its active field
   is set to 0.  An active field corresponding to the CoA in a PPBU is
   set to 1.

A.2.  MR operation

   If an MR1 detects its ingress (or egress) interface failure, it
   should immediately stop advertising its prefix and may send a new
   ICMP Mobile Router Hint message (code = 0) to the PMR (MR2).  Any PMR
   detects an egress (or ingress) interface failure of the active MR
   (MR1), the PMR sends a PPBU to the HA1.  The alternative flag of the
   Binding Update Identifier sub-option in this PPBU is set to 0.  After
   receiving the PPBU ACK, this PMR replies a new ICMP Mobile Router
   Hint Acknowledgement (code = 0) to the blocked MR if it received ICMP
   MR Hint message.  The PMR (MR2) starts advertising the MNP1 in
   addition to its own MNP (MNP2).  The PMR (MR2) can provide Internet
   service for fixed and MNs instead of the blocked MR (MR1).  That is,
   if the PMR (MR2) receives a packet from fixed or mobile nodes

   belonging to the MNP of the blocked MR, it can forward the packet
   through an appropriate tunnel between the HA of the blocked MR and
   itself for seamless connectivity.
