1.  Introduction

   The base PCP specification allows to retrieve the external IP address
   and external port to be conveyed in the SIP signaling messages
   [RFC3261].  Therefore SIP Proxy Servers do not need to support means
   to ease the NAT traversal of SIP messages (e.g., [RFC5626],
   [RFC6223], etc.).  Another advantage of using the external IP address
   and port is this provides a hint to the proxy server there is no need
   to return a small expire timer (e.g., 60s).  In addition, the
   outbound proxy does not need any further feature to be supported in
   order to assist the remote endpoint to successfully establish media
   sessions.  In particular, ALGs are not required in the NAT for this
   purpose and no dedicated functions at the media gateway are needed.

   This document discusses how PCP can be used in SIP deployments
   (including IPv6 considerations).

   The benefits of using PCP for SIP deployments are listed below:

   o  Avoid embedding an ALG in the middleboxes.  Note, ALGs are not
      recommended since the evolution of the service would depend on the
      ALG maintenance.

   o  Not require any Hosted NAT Traversal function (e.g., [RFC7362]) to
      be embedded in the SIP server.  Intermediate NATs and firewalls
      are transparent to the SIP service platform.

   o  Avoid overloading the network with keepalive message to maintain
      the mapping in intermediate middleboxes.

   o  Work without requiring symmetric RTP/RTCP [RFC4961].

   o  Not require symmetric SIP to work (i.e., rport [RFC3581]).

   o  Easily support unidirectional sessions.

   o  Does not encounter issues with early media.

   o  The combination of PCP and ALTC [RFC6947] allows to optimize
      IPv4-IPv6 interworking function resources.

   o  Because there is no need for connectivity checks, session
      establishment delay is not impacted (pairs of ports can be pre-
      reserved).

   Experimentation results, including SIP flow examples, are documented
   in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-nat64-experiments].

   Even in deployments where ICE [RFC5245] is required, PCP can be of
   great help as discussed in [I-D.penno-rtcweb-pcp] for the WebRTC
   case.

   The document targets SIP deployments in managed networks.  It can
   also be used as part of SIP-based services delivery in the context of
   network-located residential gateway effort [WT-317].

2.  PCP Features

2.1.  Learn External IP Address and Port

   The PCP base specification allows to create mappings in PCP-
   controlled devices and therefore prepare for receiving incoming
   packets.  A SIP User Agent can use PCP to create one mapping for SIP
   signalling messages and other mappings for media session purposes.

   The SIP UA uses the external IP address and port number to build SIP
   headers.  In particular, this information is used to build the VIA
   and CONTACT headers.

Internet-Draft                  PCP & SIP                  February 2015


   The external IP address and port(s) instantiated for media streams,
   are used to build the SDP offer/answer.  In particular, the "c" line
   and "m" lines.

2.2.  Learn and Set the Lifetime of Mapping Entries

   PCP allows to discover and to set the lifetime of mapping
   instantiated in intermediate middleboxes.

   The discovery of the lifetime of a mapping avoids overloading the
   network and SIP servers with frequent messages.  This is in
   particular important for cellular devices.  According to [Power], the
   consumption of a cellular device with a keep-alive interval equal to
   20 seconds (that is the default value in [RFC3948] for example) is 29
   mA (2G)/34 mA (3G).  This consumption is reduced to 16 mA (2G)/24 mA
   (3G) when the interval is increased to 40 seconds, to 9.1 mA (2G)/16
   mA (3G) if the interval is equal to 150 seconds, and to 7.3 mA
   (2G)/14 mA (3G) if the interval is equal to 180 seconds.  When no
   keep-alive is issued, the consumption would be 5.2 mA (2G)/6.1 mA
   (3G).  The impact of keepalive messages would be more severe if
   multiple applications are issuing those messages (e.g., SIP, IPsec,
   etc.).

2.3.  Allow Unidirectional Media Flows

   As a consequence of instantiating mappings for media/session flows,
   incoming packets can be successfully forwarded to the appropriate SIP
   UA.  Particularly, unidirectional media flows (e.g., announcement
   server) will be forwarded accordingly.

2.4.  Preserve Port Parity

   For deployments relying on classic RTP/RTCP odd/even port numbers
   assignment scheme, PORT_SET option [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set] can be use
   by a SIP UA to request port parity be preserved by the PCP server.

2.5.  Preserve Port Contiguity

   For deployments assuming RTCP port number can be deduced from the RTP
   port number, PORT_SET option [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set] can be used by a
   SIP UA to retrieve a pair of contiguous ports from the PCP server.

2.6.  Learn PREFIX64

   If the SIP UA is located behind a NAT64 device [RFC6146], the option
   defined in [RFC7225] can be used to retrieve the PREFIX64 used by
   that NAT64 device.  The retrieved prefix will be used to locally
   build an IPv6-converted IPv4 address corresponding to the IPv4

   address included in the SDP message received from a remote IPv4-only
   SIP UA in a SDP offer or answer.

2.7.  Compliant with "a=rtcp" Attribute

   The base PCP specification can be used to retrieve the port number to
   be singled if "a=rtcp" attribute is in use [RFC3550].

2.8.  DSCP Marking Policy

   PCP can be used to discover the DSCP value to be used when sending
   real-time flows or to create a mapping that matches a DSCP marking.
   This can be achieved using the DSCP option defined in
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-extensions].  DSCP setting value is configured by
   the network and not the SIP UA.

   This feature can be used as an input for DSCP marking in some
   deployments such as [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos].

3.  Avoid Crossing CGNs

3.1.  Avoid NAT64

   Because an IPv6-only SIP UA is not aware of the connectivity
   capabilities of the remote UA, the IPv6-only SIP UA uses the ALTC
   attribute [RFC6947] to signal the assigned IPv6 address and the IPv4
   address learned via PCP.

   If the remote SIP UA is IPv6-enabled, IPv6 transfer capabilities will
   be used to place the session.  If the remote SIP UA is IPv4-only,
   IPv4 transfer capabilities will be used.  NAT64 devices will be
   crossed only if the remote UA is IPv4-only.

3.2.  Avoid Crossing DS-Lite AFTR

   SIP UAs co-located with the B4 [RFC6333] or located behind the CPE
   can behave as dual-stack UAs:

   o  Native IPv6 address is assigned locally.

   o  The external IPv4 address and port is retrieved using PCP

   To avoid unnecessary invocation of AFTR resources, ALTC attribute is
   used to signal both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  If the remote SIP UA is
   IPv6-enabled, IPv6 transfer capabilities will be used to place the
   session (i.e., the flows will avoid crossing the DS-Lite AFTR
   device).  If the remote SIP UA is IPv4-only, IPv4 transfer

   capabilities will be used.  AFTR devices will be crossed only if the
   remote UA is IPv4-only.

4.  Security Considerations

   PCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6887].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
