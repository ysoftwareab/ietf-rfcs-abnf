Abstract

   This memo describes the procedures by which the IETF appoints
   representatives to the various bodies of the Internet
   Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and to
   the Protocol Supporting Organization (PSO) related to ICANN.

1. Introduction

   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
   depends for some of its activities on the Protocol Supporting
   Organization (PSO). The PSO is required to appoint three members
   of the ICANN Board of Directors, and to appoint a Protocol Council 
   to give appropriate advice to ICANN. These appointments are
   made by the Board of the PSO.

Internet Draft        IETF Appointments to the ICANN PSO     Oct   1998


   As a member of the PSO, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
   is required to

     - appoint three members to the PSO Board
     - nominate three members to the ICANN Board
     - nominate up to thirteen members to the ICANN Protocol Council

   This memo defines the IETF procedures for these appointments.
   
2. Members of PSO Board

   The PSO Board has very limited duties, mainly annual appointments
   to the ICANN Board and Protocol Council based on nominations from
   the PSO members, and financial oversight of payments from PSO 
   members to ICANN.

   The IETF members of the PSO Board shall be the current IETF Chair,
   the current Chair of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and 
   one other current member of the IAB or of the Internet Engineering 
   Steering Group (IESG), appointed by consensus of the IAB and IESG.

   Note that the IETF Chair and all other members of the IAB and IESG
   are appointed by the IETF open nominations process and are subject
   to recall procedures [RFC 2282].


3. Members of ICANN Board

   Each year after the first year, the IETF Nominating Committee
   shall nominate one person to a three year term on the ICANN
   Board, using the procedures defined in [RFC 2282]. 

   In the first year, three people shall be nominated to the ICANN
   Board for terms of three, two and one years respectively.

   These nominations are subject to confirmation by the PSO Board.
   In the event that other PSO members also nominate candidates,
   the PSO Board will elect the final nominees.

   IETF appointees to the ICANN Board are subject to the recall
   procedures defined in [RFC 2282].


4. Members of the Protocol Council

   The IETF members of the Protocol Council shall be the thirteen
   current voting members of the IAB.
   
5. Security considerations

   This memo does not impact the technical security of the Internet.
