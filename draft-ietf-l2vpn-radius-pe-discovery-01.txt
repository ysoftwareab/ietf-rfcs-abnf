Abstract

   This document describes a strategy by which Provider Equipment (PE)
   can be dynamically provisioned for inclusion in PE-based Layer 2

   Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs).  This layered strategy utilizes
   the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol as a
   centralized control mechanism and can be used in conjunction with
   other proposed mechanisms.  The mechanisms described in this document
   enhance those established by RFC 2868 and conform to those described
   by the L2VPN Framework.

3.  Introduction

   This document describes how in PE-based VPNs a PE of a VPN can use
   RADIUS [RFC2865] to authenticate its CEs and discover the other PEs
   of the VPN.  In RADIUS terms, the CEs are users and the PEs are
   Network Access Servers (NAS) implementing RADIUS client
   functionality.

   A VPN can span multiple Autonomous Systems (AS) and multiple
   providers.  Each PE, however, only needs to be a RADIUS client to
   RADIUS server of the "local" provider.  In the case in which a CE
   belongs to a "foreign" VPN, the RADIUS server of the local provider
   acts as a proxy client to RADIUS of the foreign provider.

4.  Information Model

   This document presents a model wherein authorization for
   participation in a PE-based VPN can be divided into three different
   layers of access.

Internet-Draft    Using RADIUS for PE-Based VPN Discovery  February 2005


   o  CE or AC Authorization
   o  VPN Authorization
   o  Pseudowire Authorization

   The first layer is AC authorization, in which a first sign of life on
   a particular AC triggers an authorization resulting in provisioning
   information particular to the circuit in question.  Once the AC is
   authorized, its VPN membership is authorized separately.  This
   authorization step may result in a number of pseudowire specific
   connections; each of which may be authorized separately.  The
   relationships between these three data representations are shown in
   the diagram below.

   Using a layered approach allows the different stages of authorization
   to be satisfied by separate means based on deployment scenario.  It
   also allows one model to apply to various deployment architectures
   including VPLS and VPWS.  If all three authorization stages are
   accommodated by a RADIUS server, the stages may be combined into a
   single transaction instead of having three separate transactions.

      configuration information
   o  Each pseudowire is associated with an AII
   o  Each PE includes an arbitrary number of AIIs
   o  Each PE has one associated next hop address

         6

      Address

   The value indicates the IPv4 address of a particular PE member of a
   VPN.

5.7  PE-Record

   This attribute represents a single element within a particular PE's
   description.  A group of PE-Records combine to form a complete PE
   description when returned during VPN authorization.

   A summary of the PE-Record attribute format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

      Text

   The Text field contains an AII prefixed by a PE-Router-ID and
   separated by a colon, e.g.  "1.1.1.1:14" where the PE-Router-ID is

   1.1.1.1 and the AII is 14.  This represents a particular pseudowire.
   The value is optionally suffixed by a colon separated list of
   attribute value pairs containing pseudowire-specific configuration,
   e.g.  "1.1.1.1:14:PHB=256".

6.  New Values for Existing RADIUS Attributes

6.1  Service-Type

   This document defines one new value for an existing RADIUS attribute.
   The Service-Type attribute is defined in Section 5.6 of RFC 2865
   [RFC2865], as follows:

   This Attribute indicates the type of service the user has requested,
   or the type of service to be provided.  It MAY be used in both
   Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.

   A NAS is not required to implement all of these service types, and
   MUST treat unknown or unsupported Service-Types as though an Access-
   Reject had been received instead.

   A summary of the Service-Type Attribute format is shown below.

   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

     Type

         6 for Service-Type.

      Length

         6

      Value

         The Value field is four octets.

      This document defines one new value for the Service-Type
      attribute.

      (TBA)     L2VPN

      The semantics of the L2VPN service are as follows:

      L2VPN   A CE is requesting to join a VPN.


6.2  User-Name

   This attribute defined by [RFC2865] takes a value depending on which
   layer of VPN authorization is occurring.

   o  For CE/AC authorization, the User-Name value contains either a
      Network Access Identifier (NAI) associated with the CE [RFC2486],
      or an implementation dependent AC name.
   o  For VPN authorization, the User-Name value contains the VPN-ID or
      a Router-Distinguisher.
   o  For pseudowire authorization, the User-Name value contains a
      PE-Router-ID.

7.  Table of Attributes

   The following tables provide a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

        a packet.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in
        a packet.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in
