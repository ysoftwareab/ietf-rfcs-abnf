Abstract

This document describes changes to the Source/Target Link-layer Address
option in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [IPv6ND] to support addresses
of any liength.

1.  Overview and Rationale

The IPv6 Neighbor Disocvery Protocol uses Link-Layer addresses in option.
The option as it stands can only support link layer addresses of 6 + 8*n
octets, where n is natural number (i.e 0,1,2,3, ...). This precludes the
support for link layer addresses of arbitrary length that may need to 
be supported in the future. One example of such an address is IEEE-EUI64
which is a 8 octet address.

2.  Additional Requirements for Link-Layer Options  for Neighbor Dicovery

This document adds two more option types to be used with Neighbor Discovery.
The 

4.6.1.  Source/Target Any Length Link-layer Address

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type      |    Length     |    Link-Layer Address ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Fields:

      Type
                     11 for Source Any Length Link-layer Address
                     12 for Target Any Length Link-layer Address


      Length         The length of the option (including the type and
                     length fields) in units of 1/8 th  octets.  Forexample,
                     the length for IEEE 802 addresses is 1 [IPv6-
                     ETHER].

      Link-Layer Address
                     The variable length link-layer address.
                     The content and format of this field (including
                     byte and bit ordering) is expected to be specified
                     in specific documents that describe how IPv6
                     operates over different link layers.  For instance,
                     [IPv6-ETHER].

      Description
                     The Source Link-Layer Address option contains the
                     link-layer address of the sender of the packet.  It
                     is used in the Neighbor Solicitation, Router
                     Solicitation, and Router Advertisement packets.

                     The Target Link-Layer Address option contains the
                     link-layer address of the target.  It is used in
                     Neighbor Advertisement and Redirect packets.

                     These options MUST be silently ignored for other
                     Neighbor Discovery messages.

2.2 Router Solicitation Message 

In addition to the options mentioned in [IPV6ND], the Source Any Length
Link-layer Address can be used.

2.3 Router Advertisement Message 

In addition to the options mentioned in [IPV6ND], the Source Any Length
Link-layer Address can be used.

2.4 Neighbor Solicitation Message 

In addition to the options mentioned in [IPV6ND], the Source Any Length
Link-layer Address can be used.

2.5  Neighbor Advertisement Message 

In addition to the options mentioned in [IPV6ND], the Target Any Length
Link-layer Address can be used.

2.6 Redirect Message Format

In addition to the options mentioned in [IPV6ND], the Target Any Length
Link-layer Address can be used.
