Abstract

   The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft to
   support multihoming is such that a different unique prefix is given
   to each interface of a Mobile Node that is attached to the PMIPv6
   domain.  However, multihoming can also be provided using single
   prefix for all interfaces of MN.  This memo explores and highlights
   some issues associated with multihoming support in PMIPv6: using
   single prefix per MN method or multiple prefixes per MN method.

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol Version Six (PMIPv6) is a network
   based mobility management protocol which provides mobility management
   to all type of nodes including multiple interfaced (MuIf) mobile
   nodes (MNs) that may or may not have client MIPv6 (CMIPv6)
   functionality.  Details of protocol operation and related
   terminologies are given in [1].  The PMIPv6 draft [1] highlight
   multihoming support for MuIf MNs where a unique prefix is given per
   each interface of MN.  The base draft adopted such a multiple prefix
   model to provide basic multihoming support and connectivity to an
   unmodified MN.  "Unmodified" MN is generally understood as mobile
   nodes that do not have any software changes to attain network based
   mobility management.  However, multihoming can also be provided using
   single prefix for all interfaces and one need not restrict to unique
   prefix per interface type of allocation.

   In this memo, the main focus is to analyze and highlight multiple
   interface related issues in single prefix model and multiple prefix
   model so that one can understand the problems and appropriate
   solutions can be seeked to tackle the problems.  The analysis is
   broken into clusters where issues related to simultaneous attachment
   via all MN's interfaces, vertical hand-off (switching from one
   interface to another), horizontal hand-off and filter rule setting to
   attain the objective of preferred path selection by MN are looked
   into in detail.  In addition to these, how to support multihoming for
   unmodified MN in a single prefix model and how multihoming can be
   supported when MN configures multiple care-of addresses for a certain
   interface is also explored.

   Many Standard Organizations (SDO) such as third generation partner
   ship project (3GPP), third generation partner ship project 2 (3GPP2)
   and Wimax Forum are very much interested in adapting PMIPv6 as a
   mobility management protocol.  We have done some study on the 3GPP
   architecture and thus in this memo, wherever appropriate we are
   highlighting PMIPv6 multihoming problems pertaining towards the 3GPP
   architecture.  Nevertheless, we would not exclude such problem
   analysis for other SDO architectures that will adapt the PMIPv6
   protocol for multihoming purposes.

   In Appendix B and Appendix C, the multihoming problem analysis is
   focused on advanced scenarios such as roaming and a scenario that has
   multiple local mobility anchors (LMAs).  Roaming scenarios in this
   memo refers to MN moving away from home domain into foreign domains.
   In such roaming scenarios, the need for further work is highlighted
   for MNs that have some mobility management functionality.  It can be
   easily understood that such roaming scenarios is not applicable to
   IPv6 nodes that do not have any Client MIPv6 stack implemented.

2.  Multiple Interfaces Support Models in PMIPv6

   When a node with multiple interfaces is roaming in a PMIPv6 domain,
   there are various benefits it can enjoy if the PMIPv6 domain allows
   more than one interfaces to be used simultaneously.  Such benefits
   have been described elsewhere, such as in [2], and are thus omitted
   from this document.  It should be noted that some benefits could be
   enjoyed by the PMIPv6 domain as well.  For instance, when the LMA
   receives a packet destined for a multiple interfaced MN, the LMA may
   be able to choose amongst the multiple routes to better utilize the
   network resources of the PMIPv6 domain or to avoid congested region
   of the PMIPv6 domain.

   There are two main ways multiple interfaces support can be provided
   by the PMIPv6 domain.  The first way is to offer the MN different
   home network prefixes for each of MN's interfaces as described in
   [1].  The second way is to offer the MN the same home network prefix
   for all its interfaces.  In this section, a brief analysis and
   principle of these models are given.  Further analysis and associated
   problems with these multihoming models are given in later sections.

   o  Different Home Network Prefix for Each Interface

      In this case, each interface of MN is allocated an unique Home
      Network Prefix.  To ensure that each interface of MN gets an
      unique prefix, the LMA will use a MN interface identifier (ID)
      inserted in the Proxy Binding Update (PBU), a hand-off flag in PBU
      and its own binding cache entries to allocate such unique prefix
      per interface.  This multiple prefix model is described in greater
      detail in [1].  If the interface ID (If-ID) in PBU is not
      available at the LMA binding cache, and if the hand-off flag is
      set to "1" (implying new connection request), the LMA will assign
      a new prefix for the interface.  When the interface ID which is
      sent in the PBU is matched to an entry in LMA, then the LMA will
      treat it as horizontal hand-off (i.e. one interface disconnecting
      from a MAG and connecting via another MAG) and assign the same
      prefix for session continuity.  For advanced hand-off scenarios
      such as vertical hand-off (i.e. one interface shutting down and
      transferring flows to a newly powered on interface), the LMA will
      use more information such as vertical hand-off flags inserted in
      the PBU, as well as disconnected interface's If-ID, to assign the
      same prefix of the disconnected interface to the new interface.
      Suffice to say, the prefix allocation logic is pretty complex at
      LMA for this multiple prefix model because correct prefixes needs
      to be assigned based on MN's state such as new connection,
      horizontal hand-off and vertical hand-off.

      Since unique prefix is assigned per interface of MN, for practical



Jeyatharan, et al.        Expires July 4, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


      purpose, this model can be treated as multiple MNs each having a
      single interface.  Thus, in a general sense, LMA will not be able
      to perform path switching for packets addressed to a particular
      interface.  For example, MN's IF1 is assigned a prefix (P1) and
      MN's IF2 is assigned another prefix (P2).  When LMA receives a
      packet addressed to an address configured using P1, LMA would not
      route such packet via MN's IF2 path.  If MN is an IPv6 host using
      SHIM6 (Site Multihoming by IPv6 Intermediation) [3] or SCTP
      (Stream Control Transport Protocol) [4] or MONAMI6 capable mobile
      node [5], then the MN can continue to enjoy multihoming benefits
      such as a flow coming towards a MN address can be reached via one
      or more of MN interfaces.  Unless some changes are done to PMIPv6
      protocol, these external protocols such as SHIM6 or MONAMI6 may
      need to be used to achieve multihoming benefits.

      Another general issue with this model is that prefix resources are
      wasted and in some cases, a node may not get a prefix in PMIPv6
      domain if the PMIPv6 domain is supporting numerous MNs with many
      active interfaces.

   o  Same Home Network Prefix for All Interfaces

      In this case, each interface will receive the same Home Network
      Prefix.  In this scenario, MN SHOULD accept packets received by
      any interface as long as the destination address matches the Home
      Network Prefix regardless of the actual address configured (or
      assigned) for that interface.  If single prefix is used for all
      interfaces, then all interfaces may configure same address and
      thus flows can be routed to MN via all available paths without
      introducing any changes to PMIPv6 network entities.  However, even
      if same address is configured for all interfaces, to attain some
      advanced multihoming benefits such as setting flow preference,
      some changes to the PMIPv6 network has to be made.

      When PMIPv6 implements this single prefix model, there is no need
      for the MN to run separate multihoming enabling protocols (such as
      SHIM6, SCTP, MONAMI6) to enjoy some benefits of multihoming.  All
      MN has to do is to configure each interface with an IP address
      from the same prefix.  At the LMA, since prefix based routing is
      used rather than address based routing, any flow destine for MN
      can be routed to MN via any interface.  However, we will explain
      further in next section that further work is required even in the
      case of single prefix model to achieve all the benefits of
      multihoming.  The main advantage of this model is that complex
      prefix allocation mechanism at LMA can be avoided and prefix
      resources are not wasted.

3.  Multiple Interface Problem Analysis for Single Prefix Model

   In this section, problem analysis for multihomed nodes when PMIPv6
   uses a single prefix per MN model is presented.  The assumption in
   the analysis regarding to which PMIPv6 entity is mapped to which
   entity in 3GPP architecture is based on details provided in documents
   such as [6] and [7].

   Figure 1: Attaching multiple interfaces to PMIPv6 that deploys single
                               prefix model

   We first explore some fundamental issues if PMIPv6 uses single prefix
   per MN type of multihoming support.  Figure 1 shows a multiple
   interfaced MN, which is simultaneously attached to a PMIPv6 network
   via both its interfaces.  It is considered that MN.If1 (i.e.
   Interface 1 of MN) is a wireless local area network (WLAN) interface
   and MN.If2 is a third generation cellular (3G) interface.  It is
   further assumed that PMIPv6 protocol is deployed in 3GPP network
   where MN.If1 is attached to the evolved packet data network gateway
   (ePDG) via a IPSec tunnel and MN.If2 is attached to Serving Gateway
   (SGW)/MAG2 which is its first hop router.  It is considered that the
   ePDG/MAG1 is not the first hop router for MN.If1.  In this scenario,
   the ePDG is assumed to have the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG)



Jeyatharan, et al.        Expires July 4, 2008                  [Page 6]

   functionality and it acts as a trusted gateway to 3GPP core network.
   More information on 3GPP architectural entities and their roles can
   be obtained from 3GPP technical specifications [6] and [7].

   If such single prefix type of multihoming is supported, then there
   needs to be some parameter in the LMA/HA cache to differentiate the
   bindings from same MN.  This parameter can be the interface ID
   (If-ID) or Binding Identifiers (BID) as described in [5].  It is
   important to appreciate that in the single prefix model, the
   interface IDs are merely used to differentiate the binding entries
   associated with multiple interfaces of MN.  Interface IDs are not
   used in prefix assignment.  In such single prefix model, the Network
   Access Identifier (NAI) will be used for prefix assignment because
   only a single prefix needs to be assigned to a multiple interface MN.

   In Figure 1 it is assumed that, MN.If1 roams into the PMIPv6 domain
   first and gets attached to MAG1.  This corresponds to the first entry
   in the binding cache (BC).  When MN powers up MN.If2, MAG2 will send
   a new Proxy Binding Update (PBU) to the LMA/HA, requesting to bind
   the Home Network Prefix of MN to the proxy care-of address (CoA)
   which is MAG2.Addr (see 2nd BCE).  It is further assumed that the PBU
   has If-ID information in an option.  Basically these interface IDs
   can be media access control (MAC) addresses or these can be interface
   identifiers that MN use to form global unicast address.  If the
   latter type of interface identifiers are used, then it is extremely
   important that they are unique across MN interfaces.  Thus, as
   advised in [1] the use of MAC addresses are preferred for interface
   IDs, due to their uniqueness per interface.  These interface IDs
   (assuming MAC address) can be readily obtained by MAGs if they are
   first hop routers.  Since MAG1 is an ePDG as in Figure 1, then, using
   simple MAC addresses may not work as the MAC address cannot be
   obtained from IPSec tunnel establishment signal.

   In such a problematic case of an ePDG being a MAG, proper mechanisms
   should be in place to get the correct If-ID.  There can be a case
   where ePDG in Figure 1 does not know If-ID and generates a random
   If-ID.  If this If-ID is same as MN's some other interface If-ID(ex.
   MN.If2 identifier), then this may overwrite an existing If-ID that is
   available at LMA/HA cache.  Such overwriting at LMA/HA will cause a
   loss of a valid routing state.  In such a scenario where MAG is an
   ePDG, one possible way is for MN to generate an If-ID and explicitly
   inform the ePDG during IPSec tunnel establishment.  Alternatively, MN
   can simply inform ePDG its MAC address during tunnel establishment.
   Another way is for Authentication Authorization Accounting server
   (AAA) to generate If-IDs for initial attachments and assume that If-
   IDs can be transferred via context transfer for hand-off attachments.
   Yet another way is for the MAG/ePDG to query nearby routers for MN's
   If-IDs and then generate a unique interface ID.  With so many

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


   approaches, some further analysis needs to be performed to select the
   best possible method.  We feel some MN involvement may be required to
   attain this objective because only the MN will know its unique
   interfaces and its identifiers in all scenarios.  Furthermore, it is
   easier for the MN to provide the initial attachment information to
   the network rather than the network identifying this.

   Suppose we consider MN is an unmodified host in Figure 1 and performs
   such a simultaneous attachment, and if it is given same address as
   MN.If1 for MN.If2 via statefull address configuration method, then
   MN.If2 may not be able to configure a global address (perhaps a
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD failure)) and that interface will
   not be used.  In such a case, MN can only receive packets via MN.If1
   and packets sent to MAG2 will be lost until MAG2 detects that MN.If2
   is not attached and sends a deregistration PBU to LMA/HA.  Thus,
   ideal multihoming is not obtained.  On the other hand, if MN
   configures different addresses on its interfaces using stateless
   address configuration (assuming different interface identifier for
   each interface), then successful simultaneous attachment can be
   obtained.  However, packets arriving at LMA/HA to address of MN.If1
   may be sent via MAG2 and MAG2 will drop the packets because it does
   not have a neighbour cache entry mapping address of MN.If1 to the
   layer two (L2) address of MN.If2.  Thus, it can be clearly seen that,
   although multihoming support is available at LMA/HA, when LMA/HA
   routes packets based on prefix, packets to one address to which a MAG
   does not have supporting neighbour cache entry will be lost.

   To solve the above mentioned problem for an unmodified host when it
   configures same address for both its interfaces may be difficult.  We
   feel that some changes can be done at the network side to prevent
   activation of stateful mode of address configuration for unmodified
   host and thus avoid same address being configured for its interfaces.
   Another possible means is that the dynamic host configuration
   protocol (DHCP) signal can be intercepted by MAGs and MAG could
   insert some interface specific options to the DHCP message so that
   the DHCP server assigns different addresses.  Or, as discussed in the
   NetLMM mailing list, the unmodified host can be configured with a
   single virtual interface at Layer 3 to mitigate this issue.  To solve
   the issue of flow switch at LMA/HA due to LMA/HA implementing prefix
   based routing and MN configuring different addresses for its
   interfaces, further work may be required.  One possible solution to
   this flow switch issue is that the LMA/HA cache can be address based
   rather than prefix based.  But, in such a case, the PBU registration
   has to wait until the MN finishes address configuration which causes
   some delay in routing state establishment at LMA/HA.

3.2.  Problem Analysis for Hand-off Scenarios

   Hand-offs are generally classified as horizontal hand-off and
   vertical hand-off.  In a multiple interface scenario using the single
   prefix model, when one of the interface roams while the other
   interface is still attached, the problem is not very complex.  The
   reason being the new MAG only needs to know the If-ID of the
   interface that is performing the horizontal hand-off to create the
   correct routing entry at LMA/HA.  Again, the new MAG can get to know
   this If-ID by various means.  New MAG can get to know this via
   context transfer from old MAG, from AAA, from the MN, or obtaining
   directly from MAC address.  For horizontal hand-off case, we do not
   foresee any issue as long as there are appropriate mechanisms in the
   system for the new MAG to know the If-ID.

   For the vertical hand-off case (MN shutting down an interface and
   transferring flows to a newly powered on interface), the same prefix
   is given to the new interface (single prefix model).  There need not
   be any specific mechanism as in multiple prefix model to get the same
   prefix via the newly powered on interface.  Basically, if MN's
   interface 1 shuts down and there are flows addressed to MN.If1, then
   when MN.If2 powers on, these flows can be readily received at MAG2
   after MAG2 has performed the PBU at LMA/HA.  The important point here
   is that, MAG2 can readily send the PBU once it knows If2-ID.  Unlike
   in the multiple prefix model, MAG2 need not get information about If1
   at all.  Thus, we predict that v.hand-off establishment delay will be
   less in the single prefix model.  The only problem is that the
   address of MN.If2 may be different from address of MN.If1 and MAG2
   may discard these packets coming to address of MN.If1.  In such a
   case, appropriate mechanism should be in place.  For example, the MN
   may need to inform MAG2 about address of MN.If1, so that MAG2 can
   transfer packets to MN.If2 without trading off on the quality of
   service for flows destined to address of MN.If1.  Again, to solve the
   above mentioned issue, some terminal involvement may be required.
   Perhaps a link layer (L2) trigger from MN may be sufficient if MAG2
   is directly attached to MN.  This said L2 trigger could be such that
   MN informs the address of MN.If1 to MAG2.  Alternatively, MN.If2 can
   configure the same address as MN.If1 to solve this issue.  Again, we
   like to highlight that the appropriate solution to this issue needs

                 Figure 2: Single Prefix Flow Filter Issue

   In this section we assume that MN has multihoming capability and the
   LMAs have multihoming functionality.  One of the advantages of
   multihoming is that flow preference can be set by MN at the
   correspondent node (CN) or at the home agent (HA).  In Figure 2 we
   assume that MN has some functionality such that it can set filter
   rules.  How to set filters at the above said entities is out of scope
   of this memo.  Filter rules are generally set by using flow
   identifier options (FID) in binding update (BU) message and details
   of this mechanism can be found in [8].  In the single prefix multiple
   interface scenario, there is a specific problem that needs to be
   tackled when MN sets filter rules at home agent and is currently
   attached to a foreign domain.  This is explained in detail below.

   In Figure 2, MN sets filter rules at HA which is the Packet Data
   Network Gateway (PDN-GW) in the 3GPP model.  MN prefers flow1 to
   traverse the WLAN interface and flow2 to traverse the cellular/3G
   interface.  Thus, MN sets filter rules accordingly at HA.  However,
   due to foreign LMA/foreign PDN-GW implementing prefix based routing,
   flow1 can be routed wrongly and may arrive via the cellular MAG.

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


   This is certainly an issue and adequate mechanisms needs to be in
   place to rectify this.  When MN's flow preference is broken, MN may
   need to appropriately set the filter rules at the correct entity
   (foreign LMA).  It is further assumed that in Figure 2, MN gets the
   foreign prefix (local breakout prefix in 3GPP jargon) in the foreign
   domain.  Foreign prefix can be used for route optimization without
   trading off the advantage of network based mobility management PMIPv6
   offers.  If in another scenario, MN is directly connected to home
   PMIPv6 domain, then MN may need to set filter rules at HA.

   In this section, problem analysis for multihomed nodes when PMIPv6
   uses a multiple prefixes per MN model is presented.

      Figure 3: Attaching Multiple Interfaces to PMIPv6 that deploys
                           Multiple Prefix Model

   In Figure 3, it is considered that MN can be an IPv6 host or CMIPv6
   enabled host.  MN has two interfaces and receives different prefixes
   via each of its interfaces.  Basically, when MN.If1 attaches to
   PMIPv6 network, the first BC entry will be created.  When MN.If2

   attaches to PMIPv6 network, the second BC entry is created.  This
   multiple prefix model does not create any confusion to an unmodified
   IPv6 host that does simultaneous attachment and thus we will not
   highlight this point any further as it has been discussed extensively
   in the NetLMM mailing list.  However, if MN is having flows with
   multiple CNs and a certain CN sends packets to address of MN
   configured from prefix P1 and another CN sends packets to address of
   MN configured from prefix P2, then multihoming benefits such as these
   said flows coming via all MN interfaces cannot be achieved.  Thus,
   some further work is required in this area.  For example, LMA/HA can
   identify using the NAI that both entries belong to the same MN.  But
   the MAGs are not aware of MN other interface prefixes.  Thus, if
   LMA/HA decides to send packets configured from P1 to MAG2, MAG2 will
   drop it.  If a MAG has knowledge of MN's other interface(interfaces
   not attached to MAG) prefixes, then definitely, MN can enjoy some
   advanced multihoming benefits.

           Figure 4: Horizontal handoff in Multiple Prefix Model

   In Figure 4, it is assumed that MN has two interfaces.  MN here can
   be an IPv6 host or MIPv6 host.  Initially, it is assumed that MN is
   connected to PMIPv6 network via If1 and If2 at MAG1 and MAG2
   respectively.  It is further assumed that MN.If1 is connected to 3G
   network and MN.If2 is connected to trusted WLAN network.  In trusted
   WLAN network, the AR will have the MAG functionality and more
   information on trusted WLAN can be found in [6] and [7].  It is
   further considered that MN while still connected to 3G network via
   MN.If1, will perform a horizontal hand-off for MN.If2.  Basically,
   MN.If2 will detach from MAG2 and attach at a new MAG3.  In such a

   scenario, the important thing is that the If-ID information in the
   PBU sent from MAG3 has to have If2-ID.  As discussed previously,
   various mechanisms are available for MAG3 to obtain If-ID of MN.If2.
   In the scenario shown in Figure 4, there is no big problem of getting
   this interface ID because MAG3 is the directly connected access
   router of MN and the MN.If2 MAC address can be readily obtained
   (assuming MAC address is used as MN If-ID).  The only danger in this
   scenario is that, if MAG3 does not have interface ID of If2 (for some
   reason) and it does not know the hand-off state of MN, then it may
   set the hand-off flag to "4" in the access technology option saying
   that the hand-off is unknown.  In such a worst case scenario, the LMA
   may assign a new prefix for If2 and session continuity for prefix P2
   flows will be disrupted.  Thus, these kind of issues needs to be
   prevented if multiple prefix model is deployed.  The main point we
   want to highlight here is that, if MAG3 does not know If2-ID, then
   getting this information quickly needs to be explored to prevent
   horizontal hand-off establishment delay.

                         +-------------+

             Figure 5: Vertical handoff in Multi Prefix Model

   In Figure 5, it is assumed that MN has three interfaces, such as
   MN.If1, MN.If2 and MN.If3.  It is further assumed that initially MN
   has MN.If1 and MN.If2 connected to the PMIPv6 network.  Then, after
   some time, MN shuts down MN.If2 and attaches via MN.If3 -- i.e., MN
   performs a vertical hand-off for MN.If2.  What is desired by vertical
   hand-off from MN's point of view is that MN requires flows for prefix
   P2 to be sent via MN.If3.  To achieve this, the LMA should assign
   prefix P2 to MN.If3.  For LMA to process such vertical hand-off
   request information and assign the desired prefix P2 in the above



Jeyatharan, et al.        Expires July 4, 2008                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


   scenario, the PBU sent by MAG3 MUST have If2-ID in addition to
   If3-ID.  Moreover, as mentioned in [1], the hand-off flag in the
   access technology type option should specify that this is a vertical
   hand-off.  Thus one can clearly see the complexity involved in
   getting the correct prefix for vertical hand-off in the multi prefix
   model.

   Let us consider another scenario where MN did not have MN.If1 but
   only had MN.If2 and MN.If3.  When MN performs a vertical handoff from
   MN.If2 to MN.If3, If2-ID may not be required in the PBU.  Once LMA
   sees the hand-off flag pointing to "2" (vertical hand-off), it will
   assign P2 to MN.If3.  This is because LMA have no difficulty in
   identifying P2 cache since there are no other entries associated with
   MN.  Thus, one can appreciate that the vertical hand-off complexity
   is high when MN has more than two interfaces.

   As highlighted previously, when MN does vertical hand-off in a
   complex scenario as shown in Figure 5, MAG3 needs If2-ID information
   in the PBU.  The question is how such information can be obtained by
   MAG3.  Suppose MAG3 is ePDG.  Then, as mentioned previously, MN can
   supply the If2-ID to MAG3.  Another option is that MAG3 can get it
   via context transfer from MAG2.  If vertical hand-off is performed
   between heterogeneous access network types, context transfer via
   heterogeneous networks may take some time and other fast mechansims
   may need to taken into consideration to prevent vertical hand-off
   establishment delay.


5.  Problem Analysis for Multiple Care-of address (MCoA) binding in
    PMIPv6

   In this section multihoming is analyzed from the perspective of
   multiple care-of addresses configured for certain interface of MN.
   Furthermore, the analysis is performed in a system that uses single
   prefix multihoming model at LMA/HA.  We would like to highlight that
   the problem highlighted in this section is applicable even if LMA/HA
   deploys the multiple prefix per MN model.

   Figure 6: Multihomed MN processing multiple addresses when PMIPv6 is
                             deployed in 3GPP

   Suppose PMIPv6 protocol is deployed in 3GPP, there are many prefixes
   a particular interface of MN can receive.  It may want to configure
   different addresses from different prefixes for various reasons.  In
   such a scenario shown in Figure 6, it is assumed that MN has
   multihoming support and can generate BIDs as in [5] and LMA/HA can
   support multihoming as well.  Generally, when an interface of MN
   configures different addresses, MN may prefer to have reachability to
   all such configured addresses from the LMA/HA to obtain multihoming
   benefits.  It is also assumed that this PMIPv6 domain is MN's home
   PMIPv6 domain and MN home address(MONAMI6/MIPv6 sense) is equal to
   MN.If1 address.  Furthermore, it is assumed that MN has a single home
   address.  In Figure 6, it is considered that MN.If1 is attached to 3G



Jeyatharan, et al.        Expires July 4, 2008                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


   MAG1.  When MN attaches to PMIPv6 network, it is assumed that it
   connects first via MN.If1.  When such a connection is successful,
   then the first entry in the BC will appear.  The If1-ID can be
   directly obtained by MAG1.  It is further considered that MN.If2 is
   connected to PMIPv6/3GPP network via a Non-Trusted WLAN access
   network.  MN.If2 is directly attached to AR/AP.  When MN.If2 makes a
   successful IPSec tunnel to ePDG, the second entry in the binding
   cache will be created.  Again, the If2-ID needs to be different from
   If1-ID.  Before establishing a tunnel to ePDG, MN.If2 will get a
   nomadic address in the Non-trusted WLAN access network and this
   nomadic address prefix will be directly associated with AR's prefix.

   However, MN may not know that MN.If2 is attached to PMIPv6 network.
   If MN knows that this is PMIPv6 network, then it may act differently.
   MN not knowing that this is PMIPv6 network, may configure another
   address from the home prefix (home2) for MN.If2 to get reachability
   or to set filter rules at LMA/HA.  MN may want to register these
   addresses (nomadic address/on-link CoA, home2) at LMA/HA.  When MN
   does Multiple CoA binding at LMA/HA for home2 and on-link CoA, then
   these CMIPv6 registrations are shown in the binding cache by the
   third and fourth entries respectively.  When MN does CMIPv6
   registrations, the BIDs generated must be different from the PMIPv6
   registrations.  If MN uses If2-ID value as BID1 or BID2, then one of
   the CMIPv6 binding may overwrite the second PMIPv6 binding.  Thus,
   some MN involvement and some added multihoming feature is necessary
   at MN in this scenario to have the desired binding cache entries at
   LMA/HA.  Moreover, one can clearly see that when multiple PMIPv6 and
   CMIPv6 registrations are taking place, there is a signaling storm in
   the system although MN has only two physical interfaces.  Thus,
   further work is required to solve some issues that may arise in this
   scenario.


6.  Conclusion

   In this memo, various issues that needs to be addressed when
   multihoming is supported in the PMIPv6 domain was analyzed.  Issues
   were analyzed for single and multiple prefix models.  From the
   analysis as highlighted in the draft, irrespective of the model used,
   some further work is required to solve issues in: simultaneous
   attachment, flow filtering, horizontal and vertical hand-offs and
   multiple care-of address processing by a single interface.  Finally,
   we would like to conclude that multihoming can be provided by either
   models.  However, how these models are going to be used to achieve
   advanced multihoming benefits needs further work.  Whether network
   based solutions or some terminal involvement deemed necessary has to
   be analyzed for each of the problem scenario that was highlighted in
   the memo.  Considering that the PMIPv6 protocol is designed with the

   objective of reducing the signaling from MN, we suggest that solution
   space analysis for these problems should consider solutions where MN
   involvement is minimal.

              Figure 7: Simultaneously at home and at foreign

   In this section some issues associated with MN when it roaming away
   from home domain is analyzed.  In Figure 7, it is assumed that MN can
   be a MONAMI6 node.  It is assumed that MN.If1 is attached to home
   domain, which is also a PMIPv6 domain.  The entry created at LMA/HA
   due to MN.If1 attachment is shown by the first entry.  If MN.If2 is
   attached to foreign domain, MN will configure a CoA for MN.If2 and
   will want to send a CMIPv6 binding to LMA/HA either using a "H" flag
   or will send a CMIPv6 binding using BID2 in the binding update.  If
   such an action is performed by MONAMI6 MN, then the binding cache
   created is shown by the second entry.  The important point here is
   that, if 'H" flag is used, then there is no problem because both MN
   interfaces reachability states are available at LMA/HA.  However, if
   MONAMI6 nodes decides to put BID2, instead of "H" flag, and if BID2
   sent in CMIPv6 BU is same as If1-ID, then there is a danger of
   overwriting the first PMIPv6 entry and thus loosing the simultaneous
   at home and away benefits.  Furthermore, if MN is a MIPv6 node in
   Figure 7, then MN may not insert BID or "H" flag in CMIPv6 BU and
   this CMIPv6 BU will overwrite the first PMIPv6 PBU and multihoming
   benefits will be lost.

Internet-Draft        Multiple Interfaces in NetLMM         January 2008


   If multiple prefix model is active in the scenario shown in Figure 7,
   then such a roaming scenario does not pose any issue for a MIPv6 host
   that has two home addresses (one for each interface configured from 2
   different home prefixes).  This is because, the first entry in BCE
   will have P1 prefix (PMIPv6 entry) and the second entry will have a
   CMIPv6 entry tying MN HoA(configured from P2 prefix) to a care-of
   address configured in foreign domain.  Thus, the caches from both
   interfaces are clearly separated by means of prefixes.  In this
   multiple prefix roaming case, If-ID need not be attached in the
   CMIPv6 BU to separate the bindings.  Thus, roaming is not a issue for
   an unmodified MIPv6 host.


Appendix C.  Multihoming Issues in Multiple LMA Scenario

   If there are multiple LMAs in the same PMIPv6 network, then there is
   a possibility that a MN sees multiple prefixes being received at the
   same interface.  In this section this scenario is briefly analyzed to
   see whether multihoming issue is present.  Again, it is assumed that
   MN and HA have MONAMI6 functionality.

                Figure 8: PMIPv6 domain with multiple LMAs

   Figure 8 shows a scenario where MN is attached to a foreign PMIPv6
   domain with multiple LMAs.  Here, MN may receive two per-MN unique
   prefixes (LMA1pref and LMA2pref) and configure two care-of addresses
   using these prefixes.  As MN is MONAMI6 capable, it will assign
   different BID for each of the care-of addresses when binding them to
   its home address at its home agent HA.  The binding caches of the
   LMAs and the HA are shown in Figure 8.  In this case, MN can enjoy
   multioming benefits.
