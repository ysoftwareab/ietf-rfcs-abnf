1.  Introduction

   The current GMPLS routing [RFC7138] and signaling extensions
   [RFC7139] includes coverage for all the OTN capabilities that were
   defined in the 2012 version of G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2012].  The 2012
   version of the G.709 included support for the following capabilities:

   a.  Introduction of ODU0

   b.  Mapping of 100BASE-X client (1GE) and other sub-1.25G client
       signals into ODU0

   c.  Mapping of FC-1200 into ODU2e

   d.  Mappings for 100GBASE-R and 40GBASE-R Ethernet client signals.

   e.  OTU4 layer with a rate of 100G.

   f.  Support for 1.25G tributary slots in OPU2, OPU3, OPU4 -- to fully
       support the newly introduced ODU0 signal.

   g.  Support for multi-lane interfaces for OTU3, and OTU4 signals

   The 2016 version of G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2012] introduces support for
   higher rate OTU signals, termed OTUCn (which have a nominal rate of
   100n Gbps).  The newly introduced OTUCn represent a very powerful
   extension to the OTN capabilities, and one which naturally scales to
   transport any newer clients with bit rates in excess of 100G, as they
   are introduced.

   This document presents an overview of the changes introduced in
   [ITU-T_G709_2016] and analyzes them to identify the extensions that
   would be required in GMPLS routing and signaling to enable the new
   OTN capabilities.  In an OTN network as defined by [ITU-T_G709_2016]
   and [ITU-T_G798], two layers can be switched at the intermediate
   nodes: (a) ODU (digital switching), (b) OCh/Optical Tributary Signal
   (OTSi) (optical switching).  This document focuses on the GMPLS
   extensions that are necessary to support ODU switching in networks
   that include the beyond 100G OTU links.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   a.  OPUCn: Optical Payload Unit -Cn.  This signal can be seen as the
       interleaving of n OPUC "slices".

   b.  ODUCn: Optical Data Unit - Cn.  Like the OPUCn, this signal can
       be seen as the interleaving of n slices of ODUC signals.

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               February 2017


   c.  OTUCn: Fully standardized Optical Transport Unit - Cn.  This
       signal can be viewed as being formed as a result of multiplexing
       n OTUC "slices".  An OTUCn has a bandwidth of (approximately)
       nx100G.  An OTUCn signal has n OTUC/ODUC/OPUC overhead instances.

   d.  OTUCn-M: This signal is an extension of the OTUCn signal
       introduced above.  This signal contains the same amount of
       overhead as the OTUCn signal, but contains a reduced amount of
       payload area.  Specifically the payload area consists of M 5G
       tributary slots (where M is strictly less than 20*n).

   e.  GMP: Generic Mapping Procedure.  This procedure allows a uniform
       asynchronous mapping procedure for a adapting a client signal to
       a server layer.  This generic mapping procedure computes the
       population of stuff bytes for all client/server signal rates.
       Specifically this procedure is used to map client signals into
       ODU(s), and Low-Order ODUs into High-Order ODUs.

   f.  PSI: OPU Payload structure Indicator.  This is a multi-frame
       message and describes the composition of the OPU signal.  This
       structure includes a field called Payload Type (PT) whose values
       indicates whether the OPU payload area has been formed by (a)
       mapping a single non-OTN client (b) multiplexing LO-ODUs.  The
       MSI field is a substructure of the PSI structure, and contains
       information about the ODU mix contained in a HO-ODU.  For
       mappings of type (b), the following PT codepoints are defined:

       A.  0x20: indicates 2.5G time slots (with AMP)

       B.  0x21: indicates 1.25G tributary slots (with GMP).

       C.  0x22: (introduced in [ITU-T_G709_2016] is used for ODUCn
           entities, and implies a tributary slot granularity of 5G
           (with GMP).

   g.  MSI: Multiplex Structure Indicator.  This structure indicates the
       grouping of the tributary slots in an OPU payload area to realize
       a client signal that is multiplexed into an OPU.  The individual
       clients multiplexed into the OPU payload area are distinguished
       by the Tributary Port number (TPN).

   h.  FlexO lane: Refers to an electrical/optical lane of a FlexO
       interface, used to carry OTUC transport signals.

   i.  FlexO group: Refers to the group of m * FlexO interfaces.

   j.  AMP: Asynchronous Mapping Procedure

3.  Overview of B100G links in G.709

3.1.  The OTUCn signal

   In G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2012], the standard mechanism for transporting a
   client signal is to first map it into an ODU signal (of the
   appropriate rate), and then switch the resulting ODU signal through
   the OTN network.  In the course of its traversal through the OTN
   network, the ODU signal generated by the mapper is either (a)
   multiplexed into higher-order ODU, and then encapsulated to form an
   OTU or (b) directly encapsulated into an OTU signal that defines the
   section layer.  The option (b), i.e. direct encapsulation into an OTU
   was possible only for ODU1/ODU2/ODU3/ODU4; ODU signals with other
   rates (e.g.  ODUflex) would first have to be processed per option (a)
   above.  The term "client signal" is generic in the sense that it
   encompasses both Constant Bit rate (CBR) clients (e.g. 10GBASE-R,
   SONET OC-768), or packet traffic -- where the goal is to transfer the
   payload from end-to-end (without regard for bit transparency at the
   PCS layer).  Given that OTU4 was the highest rate section layer
   signal supported in [ITU-T_G709_2012], the client signal rates were
   limited to be less than 100G (if ODU-VCAT was not used).

   With the emergence of client signals with rates greater than 100Gbps
   (e.g. 200GBASE-R, 400GBASE-R Ethernet), aggregate signals such as
   FlexE ([OIF_FLEXE_1.0], and the availability of NPUs which can source
   packet traffic of n*100G, it becomes necessary for the OTN to
   transport these signals.  This means that the OTN must be capable of
   creating, and switching ODU entities with rates in excess of n*100G.
   Traditionally, the ITU-T has introduced OTUx/ODUx signals in G.709 as
   and when new client signals with higher rates are defined by other
   standards bodies (e.g.  IEEE).  Rather than follow the traditional
   trajectory, [ITU-T_G709_2016] takes a general and scalable approach
   to decoupling the rates of OTU signals from the client rate
   evolution.  The new OTU signal is called OTUCn; this signal is
   defined to have a rate of (approximately) n*100G.  The following are
   the key characteristics of the OTUCn signal:

   a.  Unlike the signals OTU1..OTU4, the OTUCn signals are not realized
       by keeping the frame format intact and increasing the frame rate.

   b.  The OTUCn signal contains one ODUCn, which in turn contains one
       OPUCn signal.  The OTUCn and ODUCn signals serve as section layer
       entities.

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               February 2017


   c.  The OTUCn signals can be viewed as formed by interleaving n OTUC
       signals (where are labeled 1, 2, ..., n), each of which has the
       format of a standard OTUk signal without the FEC columns (per
       [ITU-T_G709_2016]:Figure 7-1).  The ODUCn, and OPUCn have a
       similar structure, i.e. they can be seen as being formed by
       interleaving n instances of ODUC, OPUC signals (respectively) The
       OTUC signal contains the ODUC, and OPUC signals, just as in the
       case of fixed rate OTUs defined in G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016].

   d.  Each of the OTUC "slices" have the same overhead (OH) as the
       standard OTUk signal in G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016].  The combined
       signal OTUCn has n instances of OTUC OH, ODUC OH, and OPUC OH.

   e.  The OTUC signal has a slightly highly rate compared to the OTU4
       signal (without FEC); this is to ensure that the OPUC payload
       area can carry an ODU4 signal.

3.1.1.  Carrying OTUCn signal between 3R points

   As explained above, within G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016], the OTUCn, ODUCn
   and OPUCn signal structures are presented in an interface independent
   manner, by means of n OTUC, ODUC and OPUC instances that are marked
   #1 to #n.  Specifically, the definition of the OTUCn signal does not
   cover aspects such as FEC, modulation formats, etc.  These details
   are defined as part of the adaptation of the OTUCn layer to the
   optical layer(s).  The specific interleaving of OTUC/ODUC/OPUC
   signals onto the optical signals is interface specific and specified
   for OTN interfaces with standardized application codes in the
   interface specific recommendations (G.709.x).

   The original working assumption was that the first B100G inter-domain
   interface for an OTUC4 would use the optical modules developed for
   the 400GbE signal.  This assumption has been revised as a result of
   new insights into how the notions developed for FlexE can be applied
   to the OTN domain.  The new developments make it possible to support
   OTUC4 signals without having to wait for the 400GbE optical modules.
   The main motivation for developing the interoperable FlexO interfaces
   is to (a) reuse already existing optical modules developed for
   carrying Ethernet signals and (b) realize higher rate OTUCn
   interfaces by bonding the required number of available PHY(s) --
   thereby decoupling the rates of OTUCn interfaces from the rates of
   the available Ethernet PHY(s) . The FlexO layer can be viewed as an
   encapsulation layer for the OTUCn signal.

   Recommendation [ITU-T_G709.1] specifies a flexible interoperable
   short-reach OTN interface over which an OTUCn (n >=1) is transferred,
   using bonded FlexO interfaces which belong to a FlexO group.
   Conceptually, the FlexO can be seen as the adaptation of the idea of

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               February 2017


   FlexE [OIF_FLEXE_1.0] to OTN signals.  Like the FlexE group, the
   FlexO group supports physical interface bonding, the management of
   the group members, overhead for communication between FlexO peers
   etc. (these overheads are separate from the GCC0 channel defined over
   OTUCn).  In its current form, Recommendation [ITU-T_G709.1] is
   limited to the case of transporting OTUCn signals using n 100G
   Ethernet PHY(s).  When the PHY(s) for the emerging set of Ethernet
   signals, e.g. 200GbE and 400GbE, become available, new
   recommendations can define the required adaptations.

   The (high-level) sequence of steps performed at the FlexO/OTUCn
   adaptation source are the following:

   a.  one OTUCn is split into n instances of OTUC at the FlexO source
       node.

   b.  One or more OTUC instances are associated with one FlexO
       interface (which could have a rate of p*100G.  As of this
       document's writing, Ethernet PHY(s) exist for transporting
       100GBASE-R signals (i.e. p=1).  This is the basis for the FlexO
       interface specified in [ITU-T_G709.1].  For this specific
       instance, the mapping between OTUC, and the FlexO interface is
       1:1, and the mapping is illustrated in Figure 1.  Figure 2
       illustrates the scenario in which OTUCn transport makes use of
       200GbE PHY(s).

   c.  The contents of the selected subset of OTUC signals are mapped to
       FlexO frames directed at one of the FlexO interfaces in the FlexO
       group.

   d.  Alignment markers are added to these FlexO frames so that the
       resulting stream can be transported across multiple physical/
       electrical lanes.  The standard IEEE FEC used in conjuction with
       the appropriate Ethernet signal(e.g. 100GbE, or 200GbE) is also
       added to the frames.

   The sink performs the reverse sequence of operations and reconstructs
   the OTUCn signal.  As a result of the direct encapsulation of the
   OTUCn signal into the FlexO layer, full transparency for the OTUCn
   layer is guaranteed.  Once the OTUCn signal is transported between 3R
   regeneration points, all B100G capabilities -- such as the support
   for ODUs with rates higher than 100G, and client signals larger than
   100G are enabled.

                Figure 2: OTUCn transport with 200G PHY(s)

3.2.  The OTUCn-M signal

   The standard OTUCn signal has the same rate as that of the ODUCn
   signal as captured in Table 1.  This implies that the OTUCn signal
   can only be transported over wavelengths which have a capacity of
   multiples of (approximately) 100G.  Modern DSPs support a variety of
   bit rates per wavelength, depending on the reach requirements for the
   optical link.  With this in mind, ITU-T supports the notion of a
   reduced rate OTUCn signal, termed the OTUCn-M.  The OTUCn-M signal is
   derived from the OTUCn signal by retaining all the n slices of
   overhead (one per OTUC slice) and trimming the OPUC tributary slots
   marked as "unavailable".  This operation is equivalent to that
   referred to as "crunching" in the context of FlexE PHY(s).

3.3.  The ODUCn signal

   The ODUCn signal [ITU-T_G709_2016] can be viewed as being formed by
   the appropriate interleaving of content from n ODUC frames.  The ODUC
   frames have the same structure as a standard ODU -- in the sense that
   it has the same Overhead (OH), and the payload area -- but has a
   higher rate since its payload area can embed an ODU4 signal.  The
   ODUCn is meant to be used as a high-order signal only -- implying
   that only other lower-rate (i.e. low-order) ODUs can be multiplexed
   into an ODUCn signal; in other words, no client signals can be
   directly mapped to an ODUCn signal.  The ODUCn signals have a rate
   that is captured in Table 1.

              +----------+---------------------------------+
              | ODU Type |           ODU Bit Rate          |
              +----------+---------------------------------+
              |  ODUCn   | n x 239/226 x 99,532,800 kbit/s |
              +----------+---------------------------------+

           Not all values of 'n' may be standardized by ITU-T-T.

                           Table 1: ODUCn rates

   The ODUCn is a higher-order ODU signal, and is encapsulated into an
   OTUCn signal which occupies the section layer.  In most common
   scenarios, the ODUCn, and OTUCn signals will be co-terminous, i.e.
   they will have identical source/sink locations.  [ITU-T_G709_2016]
   and [ITU-T_G872] allow for the ODUCn signal to pass through a digital
   regenerator node which will terminate the OTUCn layer, but will pass
   the regenerated (but otherwise untouched) ODUCn towards a different
   OTUCn interface where a fresh OTUCn layer will be initiated.
   Specifically, the OPUCn signal flows through these regenerators
   unchanged.  That is, the set of client signals, their TPNs, trib-slot
   allocation remains unchanged.  Note however that the ODUCn Overhead
   (OH) might be modified if TCM sub-layers are instantiated in order to
   monitor the performance of the repeater hops.  In this sense, the
   ODUCn should not be seen as a general, switchable ODU.

3.4.  OPUCn Time Slot Granularity

   [ITU-T_G709_2012] introduced the support for 1.25G granular tributary
   slots in OPU2, OPU3, and OPU4 signals.  With the introduction of
   higher rate signals such as the OPUCn (which are formed by
   interleaving n OPUC signals), it is no longer practical for the
   optical networks (and the datapath hardware) to support a very large
   number of flows at such a fine granularity.  ITU-T has defined the
   OPUC with a tributary slot granularity of 5G.  This choice is
   motivated by the following reasons:



Wang, et al.             Expires August 11, 2017               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               February 2017


   a.  Low bitrate flows will usually be aggregated into higher-order
       ODUs before they are transported over the core of the transport
       network, and as a consequence, the network is not expected to see
       a large number of small bitrate flows such as ODU0.

   b.  The IEEE is planning to define new MAC rates such as 25Gbps.  The
       choice of 5G TS for OPUC nicely accomodates 25GE clients, without
       wasting a large amount of bandwidth

   c.  The OIF FlexE Implementation agreement also defines the FlexE PHY
       calendar slots to have a bandwidth of 5G; the OPUC granularity
       perfectly matches the capacity of the finest FlexE client.

3.5.  Structure of OPUCn MSI

   An OPUCn signal can be viewed as being formed from an interleaving of
   n OPUC signals.  Each of the OPUC "slices" has a format that is very
   similar to that OPU4 -- albeit with a slightly higher rate (since an
   ODU4 can be fully embedded in the payload area of the OPUC signal).
   As mentioned above, the OPUC signal has 20 tributary slots, each with
   a bandwidth of 5G.  The PSI structure for an OPUCn signal can be
   viewed as the concatenation of n PSI structures (one per OPUC).  The
   PSI structure of an OPUC includes the following fields:

   a.  the Payload Type (PT) - 1byte - with a value of 0x22.  This
       indicates that ODUC has been formed by multiplexing zero or more
       low-order ODUs into OPUC.

   b.  Reserved Field - 1 byte.  In ODUs other than ODUC (e.g.
       ODU0/1/2/3/4/flex), this byte carries the "Client Signal Failure
       Indication".  This field is unused in the case of ODUC entities
       since no non-OTN client signal is directly mapped to these server
       layers.

   c.  The MSI field (of size 40 bytes) which contains the information
       about 20 tributary slots; each such information structure
       occupies 2 bytes and has the following format
       (G.709:Section 20.4.1 [ITU-T_G709_2016]):

3.6.  Client Signal Mappings

   Note that [ITU-T_G709_2016] introduces support for OTUCn signals with
   rates of n*100G and also introduces support for client signals with
   rates larger than 100G (e.g. the future 400GBASE-R client being
   standardized by IEEE, higher packet streams from NPUs).  The approach
   taken by the ITU-T to map non-OTN client signals to the appropriate
   ODU containers is as follows:

   a.  All client signals with rates less than 100G are mapped as
       specified in [ITU-T_G709_2016]:Clause 17.  These mappings are
       identical to those specified in the earlier revision of G.709
       [ITU-T_G709_2012].  Thus, for example, the 1000BASE-X/10GBASE-R
       signals are mapped to ODU0/ODU2e respectively (see Table 3 --
       based on Table 7-2 in [ITU-T_G709_2016])

   b.  Always map the new and emerging client signals to ODUflex signals
       of the appropriate rates (see Table 3 -- based on Table 7-2 in
       [ITU-T_G709_2016])

   c.  Drop support for ODU Virtual Concatenation.  This simplifies the
       network, and the supporting hardware since multiple different
       mappings for the same client are no longer necessary.

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               February 2017


   d.  ODUflex signals are low-order signals only.  If the ODUflex
       entities have rates of 100G or less, they can be transported
       using either an ODUk (k=1..4) or an ODUCn server layer.  On the
       other hand, ODUflex connections with rates greater than 100G will
       require the server layer to be ODUCn.  The ODUCn signals must be
       adapted to an OTUCn signal.  Figure 3 illstrates the hierarchy of
       the digital signals defined in G.709; this figure does not
       illustrate the handed off to the optical layers.

4.  Usecases

   This section introduces various usecases, in increasing order of
   complexity.  This material serves as background information that
   provides the rationale for the requirements that any solution must
   satisfy.  At a later point in time, it is possible to consolidate
   these usecases so that all the multiplexing (and demultiplexing)
   variants are encountered along the path of an end-to-end ODU circuit.

   Note: These usecases present scenarios in which OTUCn links are
   depicted.  These illustrations do not highlight how the OTUCn is
   transported between the 3R points.  That is, these usecases cover
   cases in which a standard FlexO interface (e.g. as defined in
   [ITU-T_G709.1]) is used, or whether a vendor specific mapping of
   OTUCn to OTSiG (as defined in [ITU-T_G872]) is used.  In other words,
   multiple variants of these usecases based on FlexO usage (or not) are
   not included in this document.

4.1.  100GE Client Service with a homogeneous chain of OTUC1 links

   In the scenario illustrated in Figure 4 a 100GBASE-R client is mapped
   into an ODU4 at NE1.  The resulting ODU4 signal is multiplexed into
   the ODUC1 server layer (using GMP) and further encapsulated to form
   the OTUC1 signal.  The links NE1-NE2, and NE2-NE3 are both OTUC1
   links -- and they can carry one 100GE client mapped into an ODU4
   server layer.  Actions performed at NE2 are: (a) terminate OTUC1, and
   ODUC1 towards NE1 (b) demultiplex the ODU4 signal from ODUC1 (c) map
   the ODU4 signal onto a different ODUC1/OTUC1 towards NE3.  NE3
   performs the inverse sequence of steps performed at NE1, and recovers
   the 100GBASE-R client from the ODU4 signal.  Note that the ODU4 and
   ODUC1 signals are not "interoperable" and that the ODUC1 is a server
   layer to the ODU4 signal.

   This illustration is also applicable to the usecase in which members
   of a FlexE group are transported in a flexe-unaware mode in the
   transport network.  Although this illustration included only OTUC1
   signals, any higher rate OTUCn signal can be substituted for these
   signals.  In this particular scenario, there are two adjacent ODUC1
   hops, and the NE2 demultiplexs (and multiplexes) the ODU4 onto the
   ODUC1.  It is possible to construct an alternative scenario in the
   case when NE2 acts as a regenerator, and doesn't terminate the ODUC1
   signals in the two hops, and instead repeats the ODUC1 signal; this
   scenario is specifically discussed in Section 4.6.

   In the scenario illustrated in Figure 5 a 100GBASE-R client is mapped
   into an ODU4 at NE1.  The resulting ODU4 signal is encapsulated with
   an OTU layer to form the OTU4 signal.  Actions performed at NE2 are:
   (a) terminate OTU4 layer, and extract the ODU4 signal (b) map the
   ODU4 signal onto a different ODUC1/OTUC1 towards NE3.  NE3 performs
   the same set of actions that were performed by NE3 in Figure 4.

4.3.  400GE Client Service with a mix of OTUCn links

   In the scenario illustrated in Figure 6 a 400GBASE-R client is mapped
   into an ODUflex at NE1.  The resulting ODUflex signal is multiplexed
   into an ODUC4 (using GMP), and then transformed into an OTUC4 signal.
   The links between NE1-NE2, and NE2-NE3 are OTUC4 and OTUC6
   (respectively).  Actions performed at NE2 are: (a) terminate OTUC4,
   and ODUC4 towards NE1 (b) demultiplex the ODUflex signal from ODUC4
   (c) map the ODU4 signal onto ODUC6/OTUC6 towards NE3.  NE3 performs
   the inverse sequence of steps performed at NE1, and recovers the
   400GBASE-R client from the ODUflex signal.

   Although not specifically illustrated in this figure, the 200G of
   spare capacity in the NE2-NE3 links can be used to carry other client
   signals.. Although the scenario illustrated in Figure 6 is specific
   to 400GE, the treatment for packet clients at other rates (e.g. 25G,

   50G, 200G) follows a very similar processing sequence.  In the case
   of 25GBASE-R clients , the 25GE client signal will be mapped to an
   ODUflex, and can be multiplexed into an ODU4 signal, or an ODUCn
   signal as illustrated here.

4.4.  FlexE aware transport over OTUCn links

   In the scenario illustrated in Figure 7 NE1 interfaces to a client
   equipment which includes the FlexE SHIM functions which originate/
   terminate a FlexE group.  The transport network edge node NE2 is
   FlexE aware -- but doesn't terminate the FlexE group.  NE1 may (as
   defined in the FlexE draft [I-D.izh-ccamp-flexe-fwk]), crunch the
   unavailable tributary slots in the FlexE PHY signals, and map the
   resultant stream to one or more ODUflex signals.  The links between
   NE1-NE2, and NE2-NE3 are OTUC4 and OTUC6 (respectively).  Actions
   performed at NE2 are: (a) terminate OTUC4, and ODUC4 towards NE1 (b)
   demultiplex the ODUflex signal from ODUC4 (c) map the ODUflex signal
   onto ODUC6/OTUC6 towards NE3.  NE3 recovers the Crunched and combined
   PHY(s) from the ODUflex signal, re-adds the unavailable calendar
   slots, and outputs the resulting stream towards the FlexE PHY(s).

   In the scenario illustrated in Figure 7 the lowest rate OTUCn link is
   the OTUC4 link between NE1-NE2.  This means that the size of the
   FlexE group is at most 4.  FlexE groups with greater sizes can be

   handled by utilizing appropriate OTUCn links.  Note that at most 400G
   of the capacity of OTUC6 (or 600G) NE2-NE3 link is occupied by the
   ODUflex signal; the remaining bandwidth can be allocated to other
   client signals.

4.5.  FlexE Client transport over OTUCn links

   This use case (see Figure 8) concerns the scenario in which a FlexE
   group is terminated at the transport network edge node (via the FlexE
   SHIM function), and the FlexE clients are demultiplexed, and
   independently transported through the OTN network.  In the scenario
   illustrated in Figure 8 the lowest rate OTUCn link is the OTUC4 link
   between NE1-NE2.  This means that the maximum bit rate of the FlexE
   client is at most 400G.  FlexE clients with greater sizes can be
   handled by utilizing appropriate OTUCn links.  This figure
   illustrates the case in which one FlexE client is transported between
   NE1 and NE3.  Other FlexE clients recovered at NE1 can routed
   independently to NE3, or to other network elements.

4.6.  Multihop ODUCn link

   As mentioned in the introductory section, the ODUCn is not a
   switchable entity.  The ODUCn layer is a server layer, which more-or-
   less occupies the position of a section layer in OTN networks.  As
   such, the ODUCn signal must be terminated and the contained low-order
   ODU flows can be switched independently to other OTN interfaces.
   G.709 and G.872 however allow for digital regenerators to terminate
   the OTUCn layer, and reinject the ODUCn layer towards another
   interface (where a new OTUCn section layer is started).  This
   scenario is illustrated in Figure 9.  In this figure, NE3 is the
   regenerator.  The ODUC2 signal is terminated at NE2, and NE4.  At the
   regeneration points, all the clients embedded inside the ODUCn signal
   are not touched (i.e. no TS changes can occur).  More specifically,
   the OPUC2 signal is not modified in any way.  However, the ODUC2 OH
   may be modified if intrusive TCM monitoring points are applied to the
   ODUC2 signal at NE3.  It is for this reason that the ODUC2 entity
   must be visible at NE3.

   In scenarios involving multi-hop ODUCn links, GMPLS signalling will
   be required to first establish the ODUCn LSP, and then use it as an
   FA-LSP to switch any contained Low-order ODUs.

4.8.  Intermediate State of ODU mux

   The ODUCn links have a tributary slot granularity of 5G -- and this
   makes it a bit inefficient if a small number of ODU0 flows have to be
   switched across an ODUCn links.  In these cases, it is conceivable
   that the intermediate nodes may offer the convenience of a
   intermediate-stage multiplexing, whereby multiple ODU0 flows are
   first multiplexed into a higher rate container (e.g.  ODU2), and then
   multiplexed into an ODUCn signal.  This however assumes that all
   these ODU0 flows are co-routed in the network.  If this assumption
   cannot be made, the only solution is to multiplex these ODU0 flows
   into higher rate flows, from the source of the traffic.  This usecase
   isn't elaborated in this document.  We can add details if required.

5.  GMPLS Implications

5.1.  OTN ODUCn layer network

   As described in the overview section, ODUCn can not be used to
   support non-OTN client signal, so the mapping hierarchy would be the
   OTN client signals (e.g.  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, ODU4,
   ODUflex) are first multiplexed into an ODUCn container, then the
   ODUCn container is then mapped into OTUCn (see Figure 3).  The signal

Internet-Draft              B100G Extensions               February 2017


   hierarchy supported by the ODUCn and OTUCn layers needs to be taken
   into consideration in control plane Routing and Signaling.

5.2.  Implications for GMPLS Signaling

   As described in Section 3 [ITU-T_G709_2016] introduced some new
   containers, such as OPUCn, ODUCn, and OTUCn.  The GMPLS signaling
   mechanisms defined in [RFC4328] and [RFC7139] do not support these
   new OTN features.  Therefore, GMPLS signaling protocol extensions
   will be necessary to support this new functionality.  The following
   summarizes key aspects that should be considered for GMPLS signaling
   extensions:

   a.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL be able to specify the new
       ODUCn/OTUCn signal types and related traffic information.  The
       traffic parameters should be extended in a signalling message to
       support the new ODUCn/OTUCn signal types

   b.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL be able to set up ODUCn/OTUCn
       LSP with related mapping and multiplexing capabilities, and
       allocate slot resources for ODU clients signal.  [Note: Under
       Discussion]

   c.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL be able to set up LSP using
       5G TS granularity

   d.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL support the TPN allocation
       and negotiation

   e.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL support the setup of OTUCn
       sub rates (OTUCn-M) LSP, which includes the negotiation of
       unavaliable slots number, slots postion and allocation of slot
       resources.  [Note: Under Discussion]

   f.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL be able to set up
       ODUCn/OTUCn/OTUCn-M LSP over FlexO group.  [Note: Under
       Discussion]

   g.  The GMPLS signalling protocol SHALL be able to set up
       ODUCn/OTUCn/OTUCn-M LSP over different kinds of FlexO interfaces
       (e.g., 100G/200G FlexO interfaces) [Note: Under Discussion]

5.3.  Implications for GMPLS Routing

   The path computation process needs to select a suitable route and
   capabilities for an ODUCn/OTUCn/OTUCn-M connection request.  In order
   to perform the path computation, it needs to evaluate the available
   bandwidth/slots available on one or more candidate links.  The

   routing protocol should be extended to convey sufficient information
   to represent ODU Traffic Engineering (TE) topology.  Following GMPLS
   Routing Implications should be considered:

   a.  The GMPLS Routing protocol should be able to indicate the
       ODUCn/OTUCn/OTUCn subrates (OTUCn-M) support information

   b.  The GMPLS Routing protocol SHALL support the advertisement of 5G
       Tributary Slot Granularity

   c.  The GMPLS Routing protocol SHALL support the advertisement of
       unused ODUCn tributary slot resource information.

   d.  The GMPLS Routing protocol SHALL support the advertisement of
       available/unavailable tributary slot information in OTUCn-M
       scenario

   e.  The GMPLS Routing protocol SHALL support the advertisement of
       OTUCn implementation (FlexO) specific information, including the
       specific Flexible OTN interface support information [Note: Under
       Discussion]
