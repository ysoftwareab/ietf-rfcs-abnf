Abstract

   This document proposes a private SIP extension header used in
   conjunction with responses to REGISTER messages to provide a
   mechanism by which a registrar may inform a registering UA of a
   service route that the UA may use to request outbound services from
   the registrar's domain.

Internet-Draft    SIP Ext Header for Service Route Discovery  April 2002


1. Background

   3GPP established a requirement for discovering home proxies during
   SIP registration and published this requirement in [3GPPReq].  Unlike
   many other network environments, the 3GPP network dynamically assigns
   a home service proxy to each address-of-record.  This assignment may
   occur in conjunction with a REGISTER operation, or out-of-band as
   needed to support call services when the address-of-record has no
   registrations.  This home service proxy may provide both inbound (UA
   terminated) and outbound (UA originated) services.

   The home proxy network routes inbound messages having a request-URI
   targeting the address-of-record associated with the UA to the
   assigned home service proxy by using some sort of look-up-mechanism
   outside the scope of this document.  This mechanism deals with
   inbound (UA terminated) messages.

   Outbound (UA originated) messages raise another issue.  Specifically,
   "How does the UA know which service proxy to use and how to get
   there?"

   Several mechanisms have been proposed in list discussions, including:
   1.  Configuration data in the UA.  This raises questions of UA
       configuration management and updating, especially if proxy
       assignment is very dynamic as in load-balancing scenarios.
   2.  Use of some other protocol, such as HTTP, to get configuration
       data from a configuration server in the home network.  While
       functional, this solution requires additional protocol engines,
       firewall complexity, operations overhead, and a significant
       additional "over the air" traffic.
   3.  Use of lookup tables in the home network, as is done for inbound
       messages.  This has a relatively high overhead in terms of
       database operations.
   4.  Returning a 302 response indicating the service proxy as a new
       contact, causing the upstream node processing the 302 (ostensibly
       the UA) to retransmit the message toward the service proxy.
       While this shares the database operation of the previous
       alternative, it does explicitly allow for caching the 302
       response thereby potentially reducing the frequency and number of
       database operations.
   5.  Performing an operation equivalent to record-routing a REGISTER
       message between the UA and the associated registrar, then storing
       that route in the UA and reusing it as a service route on future
       messages originating from the UA.  While efficient, this
       constrains the service route for proxy operations to be congruent
       with the route taken by the REGISTER message.
   6.  Returning service route information as the value of a header in
       the REGISTER response.  While similar to the previous



Willis & Hoeneisen      Expires October 18, 2002                [Page 3]

       alternative, this approach grants the ability for the registrar
       to selectively apply knowledge about the topology of the home
       network in constructing the service route.

   This document discusses this final alternative: using a header in the
   REGISTER response to indicate a service route that the UA may wish to
   use if requesting services from the proxy network associated with the
   registrar generating the response.

   Scenario



       UA1----P1-----|    |--R-------|
                     |    |          |
                     P2---|         DBMS
                     |    |          |
       UA2-----------|    |--HSP-----|



   In this scenario, we have a "home network" containing routing proxy
   P2, registrar R, home service proxy HSP, and database DBMS used by
   both R and HSP.  P2 represents the "edge" of the home network from a
   SIP perspective, and might be called an "edge proxy".  UA1 is an
   external UA behind proxy P1.  UA1 discovers P1 via DHCP.  UA2 is
   another UA on the Internet, and does not use a default outbound
   proxy.  We do not show DNS elements in this diagram, but will assume
   their reasonable availability in the discussion.  The mission is for
   UA1 to discover HSP so that outbound messages from UA1 may be routed
   (at the discretion of UA1) through HSP, thereby receiving outbound
   services from HSP.

2. Discussion of Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism uses a private header "P-Service-Route" in the
   REGISTER response to indicate a service route that the UA may wish to
   use if requesting services from the proxy network associated with the
   registrar generating the response.

   Simply put, the registrar generates a service route for the
   registering UA and returns it in the response to each successful
   REGISTER request.  This service route has the form of a Route header
   that the registering UA may use to send messages through the service
   proxy selected by the registrar.  The UA would use this route by
   inserting it as a preloaded Route header in messages originated by
   the UA intended for routing through the service proxy.

Internet-Draft    SIP Ext Header for Service Route Discovery  April 2002


   The mechanism by which the registrar constructs the header value is
   specific to the local implementation and outside the scope of this
   document.

3. Applicability Statement

   The P-Service-Route mechanism is applicable when:
   1.  The UA registers with a REGISTRAR in a given domain.
   2.  The domain dynamically assigns a service proxy for the UA.
   3.  The registrar(s) in the domain has/have sufficient knowledge of
       the network topology, policy, and situation such that a
       reasonable service route can be constructed.
   4.  Other mechanisms for proposing a service route to the UA are not
       available or are inappropriate for use within the administrative
       domain.

4. Syntax

   The syntax for the P-Service-Route header is:

   P-Service-Route = "P-Service-Route" HCOLON 1#( p-sr-value)

   p-sr-value = name-addr *( SEMI rr-param )

   rr-param = generic-param

   The allowable usage of headers is described in Table 2 of [1].  The
   following additions to this table are needed for P-Service-Route.

   Addition of P-Service-Route to SIP Table 2:


         Header field          where   proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRA
         _______________________________________________________________
         P-Service-Route         R      amr   -   -   -   -   -   o   -
         P-Service-Route        2xx     amr   -   -   -   -   -   o   -




5. Usage

5.1 Procedures at the UA

   The UA performs a register as usual.  The register response may
   contain a "P-Service-Route" header.  If so, the UA MAY store the
   value of the P-Service-Route header in an association with the
   address-of-record for which the REGISTER message had registered a



Willis & Hoeneisen      Expires October 18, 2002                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SIP Ext Header for Service Route Discovery  April 2002


   contact.  If the UA supports multiple address of records, it may be
   able to store multiple service routes, one per address-of-record.

   The UA MAY choose to exercise a service route for future messages
   associated with a given address-of-record for which a service route
   is known.  If so, it appends the given service route to any local
   required Route headers, and uses the result as a preloaded Route
   header in outgoing messages.

5.2 Procedures at the Proxy

   The P-Service-Route header is treated like any other unknown header
   by intermediate proxies.  They simply forward it on towards the
   destination.

5.3 Procedures at the Registrar

   When a registrar receives a successful REGISTER message, it MAY
   choose to return a P-Service-Route header in the 200 OK response.
   The determinations of whether to include this header into the 200 OK
   response and what value to insert are a matter of local policy and
   outside the scope of this document.  Having inserted a P-Service-
   Route header, the registrar returns the 200 OK response to the UA in
   accordance with standard procedures.

5.4 Examples of Usage

   We present example in the context of the scenario presented in the
   Background section earlier in this document.  The network diagram is
   replicated below:

   Scenario



     UA1----P1-----|    |--R-------|
                   |    |          |
                   P2---|         DBMS
                   |    |          |
     UA2-----------|    |--HSP-----|

5.6 Example of Mechanism in INVITE Transaction

   This example shows the message sequence for an INVITE transaction
   originating from UA1 eventually arriving at UA2 using outbound
   services from HOMEDOMAIN, where UA1 has previously registered with
   HOMEDOMAIN and been informed of a service route through HSP.  The
   service being provided by HOMEDOMAIN is a "speed dial" service, where
   the user's private speed dial code "Joe" is expanded to "sip:Joe@UA2"
   by the action of HSP.

   Message sequence for INVITE using P-Service-Route:


   F1 INVITE UA1 -> P1

6. Security Considerations

   It is possible for proxies between the UA and the registrar during
   the REGISTER transaction to modify the value of P-Service-Route
   returned by the registrar, or to insert a P-Service-Route even when
   one was not returned by the registrar.  It is also possible for
   proxies on the INVITE path to execute many different attacks.  It is
   therefore desirable to apply transitive mutual authentication using
   sips: or other available mechanisms in order to prevent such attacks.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document defines the SIP extension header "P-Service-Route"
   which should be included in the registry of SIP headers defined in
   SIP [1].  As required by the SIP change process draft-tsvarea-
   sipchange [7] the SIP extension header name "Service-Route" should
   also be registered in association with this extension.
