Abstract

   This document describes the Naming and Directory Service abstract
   type. This abstract type serves as an umbrella type for all
   services which support directory-style operations for obtaining
   system information. This type collects a core set of attributes
   common to all such services.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a template for the naming and directory
   service abstract type. Templates and service types are
   defined in [1]. This type can be used with SLP [2] to
   dynamically discover naming and directory servers. In
   particular, this type applies to name spaces which contain

   information intended primarily for system consumption;
   examples of such information are UNIX-style system information
   (such as passwd, hosts, and service tables), and public-key
   certificates for authenticating principals such as people and
   hosts.

   Currently there is a wide variety of services which are used
   to serve system information (i.e. NIS, NIS+, LDAP, NDS, etc.).
   It is common for two or more of these services to be deployed
   at the same time on the same network. This creates configuration
   complexity for naming and directory clients on the network:
   How does a client choose the right service, and once chosen,
   how does the client find the access handle to that service?

   The type defined by this document manages this complexity by
   collecting attributes common to all naming and directory services,
   allowing clients to select the right service from a
   heterogeneous pool. This type can be used in conjunction with
   SLP to implement a unified discovery solution.

   Note that concrete types include all attributes defined in this
   template; they may also define attributes specific to their
   service. Examples of concrete type templates can be found in
   [3], [4], and [5].

2. Examples

   This section presents two scenarios to illustrate how this type might
   be used. For both scenarios, it is assumed that a number of naming
   and directory services have been deployed in the network, and
   that they are advertising their services via SLP. The following
   list enumerates the registered servers and their attributes. Note
   that in an actual registration, the template attributes would be
   included in the attributes list, and all attributes and URLs would
   be properly escaped. Here, however, these steps have been omitted
   for the sake of brevity and readability:

   URL:
     service:naming-directory:nis://192.168.1.100/eng.wiz.com
   Attributes:
     naming-context=eng.wiz.com
     organization=flat
     dynamic-updates=false
     jndi-sp-available=true
     master=true

   URL:
     service:naming-directory:nis://192.168.1.200/eng.wiz.com

     organization=flat
     dynamic-updates=false
     jndi-sp-available=true
     master=false

     dynamic-updates=true
     jndi-sp-available=true
     master=true
     security-mechanism=clear,tls,kerb5
     transport=cots

   Note that some attributes are not defined in the template
   given below; they are defined in the templates for the
   particular services.

2.1. System Configuration

   A number of UNIX platforms currently bundle clients for the
   NIS, NIS+, and LDAP services. When the system initially needs
   to configure its name service, it has no idea with what services
   its new network has been populated. It does, however, know
   that it wants an authenticated connection to its server, and
   that it has been configured with Kerberos and extended DH
   security. Also, it would like to talk to an authoritative server
   to populate its initial configuration.

   So, in order to discover what naming services are available,
   the system issues the following SLP service request:

   <type>=service:naming-directory

INTERNET DRAFT                                             December 1998


   <predicate>=(&(|(security=kerb5)(security=dh-ext))(master=true))

   It receives the following service handles:

   service:naming-directory:ldap://192.168.3.100/dc=eng,dc=wiz,dc=com
   service:naming-directory:nisplus://192.168.2.100/b17.eng.wiz.com

   Each service handle provides enough information to contact and
   query the server.

   The system then decides whether to use NIS+ or LDAP (or both),
   and uses the access handle to contact the server.

2.2. JNDI Configuration

   The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) [6] provides a
   common interface to naming and directory operations. Using JNDI,
   it is possible to write an application which accesses directories
   without knowing which particular naming or directory service
   it is actually talking to.

   However, JNDI applications require some initial configuration
   in order to find and query a service; this configuration is
   different for each different kind of service.

   This example demonstrates how JNDI applications can use SLP to
   configure themselves in a unified manner. All the application needs
   to know in advance is in what manner it wishes to use a naming or
   directory service.

   In this example, the JNDI application wishes to obtain authentication
   information for a user, and to update preferences for that user in
   the directory. Therefore the required attributes for this directory
   are:
     - dynamic-updates = true
     - jndi-sp-available = true
   The 'jndi-sp-available' attribute is used to find only those services
   for which a JNDI service provider exists, since the application
   needs this driver to communicate with any found services. These
   required attributes are all the application currently "knows"; it
   does not know the address or even the access protocol of a server,
   nor does it have any JNDI service provider available to it. All
   it has are the JNDI framework classes, and a Java environment.

   In order to obtain service handles to suitable service instances,
   the application issues the following SLP service request:

   <type>=service:naming-directory

INTERNET DRAFT                                             December 1998


   <predicate>=(&(dynamic-updates=true)(jndi-sp-available))

   It receives the following service handles:

   service:naming-directory:ldap://192.168.3.100/dc=eng,dc=wiz,dc=com

   At this point, the application now has enought configuration
   information to contact the server. However, it does not have the
   Java class files for the LDAP service provider implementation. It
   can dynamically discover, download, and instantiate the necessary
   classfiles using SLP and the JNDI Drivers service type [7]. See [7]
   for an example of this process.

   The JNDI application is now able to configure itself to talk to a
   directory server, and access the necessary JNDI service provider.

Language of service template: en
Security Considerations:
  If these services are used as authentication repositories, and they
  are compromised, any clients of the service become susceptible to
  forged identities. This could result in compromised systems, forged
  messages, etc. Some security measure, such as SLP security, should
  be used to authenticate service advertisements.
