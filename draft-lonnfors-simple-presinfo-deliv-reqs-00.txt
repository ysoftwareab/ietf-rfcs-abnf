Abstract 
    
   A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints for 
   delivering presence information to devices with low data processing 
   capabilities, small display, and limited battery power. Other 
   limitations can be caused by the interface between the terminal and 
   the network, i.e. over radio links with high latency and low 
   bandwidth. This memo presents requirements for a solution that aids 
   in reducing the impacts of those constrains and increasing 
   efficiency.

1 Introduction 
  
   SIP extensions for presence [1] allow users ("watchers") to subscribe 
   to other users ("presentities") presence information. The presence 
   information is composed of multiple pieces of data that is delivered 
   to the watcher. The size of the presence information can be large 
   (i.e. an arbitrary number of elements called ôPresence tuplesö that 
   may convey data). It may not be reasonable to send complete presence 
   information over low bandwidth and high latency links when only part 
   of that information changes. This may end up in degrading the 
   presence service and causing bad perception at the watcher side. 
   Thus, it is necessary to provide solutions to overcome this problem 
   for the sake of success of the presence service. 
    
   Presence based applications in wireless terminals have certain 
   limitations because it is envisioned that the presence service may 
   demand high bandwidth. It is foreseen that the presence information 
   may have a considerable size, especially if large content is included 
   in presence information. Requirements of wireless environments are 
   also addressed in [2]. 
    
   There are some mechanisms, which might be used to help the problem, 
   such as signaling compression [3] and content indirection [4, 5]. 
   However, none of the existing solutions are optimal because they set 
   additional requirements on basic network functionalities such as 
   charging and security. Some of the existing solutions enforce certain 
   requirements on the network and terminals for supporting compression 
   mechanism, while other solutions require having a specific server to 
   store the requested presence information until the terminal fetches 
   it using another protocol (e.g. HTTP) and therefore increases 
   possible security concerns. 
 
   This memo discusses the requirements for an approach (called ôpartial 
   notificationsö) where the Presence Server (PS) delivers to the 
   watchers only the part of the presence information that has changed 
   compared to the previous notification. The partial notification is 
   already identified as a potential approach by the SIP Extensions for 
   Presence document [1].

2 Conventions used in this document 
     
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]. 
    
    
3 Requirements 
    
3.1 General requirements 
 
   REQ1: The subscriber MUST be able to limit the overall content size 
   delivered in the notifications. 
    
   REQ2: The presence service MUST allow mechanisms for efficient 
   handling of large contents of presence documents. 
    
   REQ3: The mechanism MUST allow the subscriber to get information 
   about state changes (modifications, removals, and additions) of 
   presence information and its structure. 
 
   REQ4: The mechanism MUST NOT affect the requirements of basic network 
   functionalities such as security, and charging. 
     
3.2 Performance requirements 
    
   REQ5: The presence service MUST allow efficient utilization of the 
   network resources (radio links). The presence service SHOULD avoid 
   additional or unnecessary round-trips for receiving changed presence 
   information.  
    
   REQ6: The presence service MUST be able to be utilised by devices 
   with low data processing capabilities, small display and limited 
   battery power. 
    
3.3 Client and server requirements 
    
   REQ7: The subscriber MUST be able to negotiate, during the 
   subscription phase, to receive only changes of the presence document. 
    
   REQ8: The subscriber MUST be able to indicate support for partial 
   notification. 
 
   REQ9: The subscriber SHOULD be able to request, during the 
   subscription phase, that the Presence Agent sends only changes to the 
   presence document.

   REQ10: The subscriber capable of receiving only changes to presence 
   documents MUST be able to use the presence service with full state 
   notifications.  
 
   REQ11: There MUST NOT be any noticeable delays in getting the 
   presence information available for the end user. 
 
 
4 Example use cases 
 
   * Presence service charging for a subscriber is based on the received 
   data volume. Thus the subscriber requires from the presence server 
   that only the changed content is delivered after the first delivery. 
    
   * The subscriber does not have any agreement of using a server for 
   storing data contents in the home network. The subscriber makes a 
   subscription to get contact and availability information of a 
   presentity. The contact and available information includes a photo of 
   the presentity. The subscriber keeps the subscription valid until the 
   presentity becoming available for communication. The subscriber 
   indicates in the subscription about its capability for partial 
   notifications (and thus preference to receive only changed 
   information).  
    
   * The watcher and the presentity have network subscriptions for 
   different operators. The watcher is abroad and subscribes to presence 
   information consisting a video clip, which is changed once a week. 
   The other subscribed information changes more often based on the 
   status of the presentityÆs devices. Because of a high price of the 
   content transfer to abroad the watcher prefers to minimize costs by 
   subscribing to changes. 
    
   * The watcher has low memory on his/her mobile device and wants to 
   receive only changes to presence documents. The watcher can switch on 
   the partial notification feature (and consequently get charged for 
   it). 
    
 
5 Security Considerations 
    
   This document provides requirements for efficient delivery of 
   Presence information. Because it is based on presence delivery 
   mechanisms defined in IMPP and in SIMPLE working group all security 
   considerations defined in PIDF [7] and in [1] apply.
