Abstract

This memo defines a security model based on Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC 2246] for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The security model can be used with any version of SNMP. When SNMPv3 [RFC 2571] is used this security model can be used with View-based Access Control Model (VACM) [RFC 2575]. This security model can be used only if TCP is used for transport.

Internet-Draft     TLS-based security model for SNMP         June 2000


1. Introduction

This memo defines a security model based on Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC 2246] for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The security model can be used with any version of SNMP. When SNMPv3 [RFC 2571] is used this security model can be used with View-based Access Control Model (VACM) [RFC 2575]. This security model can be used only if TCP is used for transport. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119]. 

2. TLS-based security model

This I-D proposes the optional use of TLS to secure SNMP transactions when TCP is used for transport. The mapping of SNMP to TCP is provided in J. Schoenwaelder: 'SNMP over TCP Transport Mapping', draft-irtf-nmrg-snmp-tcp-04.txt, April 27, 2000 [tcp-04]. The reasons for considering this option are provided in Section 3.

RFC 2571 specifies that every security model to be used with SNMPv3 must have an INTEGER identifier, the securityModel. The securityModel is one of the parameters used to interface with VACM. The values 0 through 3 have been assigned in RFC 2571. This I-D proposes to assign the value 4 to SnmpSecurityModel for the TLS-based security model.

NOTE: the values 0-255 can be assigned only by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA). The value 4 in this I-D is a placeholder until an IANA-assigned standard-track number is provided or until an enterprise-specific number is provided.

Another parameter needed to interface with VACM is securityName which identifies the principal who wants access to the target information. TLS is based on public key certificates. In particular, TLS authenticates the subject field in the public key certificate of the principal. Therefore that subject field, which is a distinguished name [RFC 2459] must be used as the securityName. In order to avoid any confusion the subjectAltName extension MUST be absent from the certificate while the subject field MUST be present and its value MUST be unique within the network management domain. If the optional subjectUniqueID field is present in the certificate then securityName is the concatenation of the subject and subjectUniqueID fields.

All other parameters needed to interface with VACM are not affected when TLS is used.

3. Use of SNMP with TLS

TLS cannot be used when UDP is used for transport. Therefore it MUST NOT be used for SNMP applications that may use both TCP and UDP. Furthermore, TLS does not offer any security advantages over User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC 2574]. Therefore the use of TLS for SNMP transactions SHOULD be limited to the cases where the following three circumstances are valid:
1. the SNMP applications are restricted to use only TCP for transport
2. TLS is readily available, with the desired ciphersuites, in all the relevant SNMP systems
3. SNMP is used along with one or more other network management protocols (for example, CORBA, CMIP) that ride over TLS/TCP within the same network management domain.
