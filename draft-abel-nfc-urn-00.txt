1.   Introduction 
    
   The NFC Forum is a specification development body developing 
   technologies related to near-field communications.  This activity is 
   supported by a membership comprised of chip vendors, smart card 
   vendors, equipment vendors, software developers, finance and banking 
   service providers, content providers and other interested companies.  
        
   Some of the technologies being developed by the NFC Forum need 
   namespaces that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  
   To assure that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a 
   specific NID for use by the NFC Forum was deemed appropriate.  
   Therefore, a full and complete registration will follow the namespace 
   specification process as defined in [RFC3406]. 
    
    
2.   URN specification for "nfc" NID

2.1     Namespace ID: 
    
   The NID "nfc" is requested. 
    
2.2     Registration Information: 
    
   Registration version number:  1 
   Registration date:            2006-05-17 
    
2.3     Declared registrant of the namespace: 
    
   Registering organization 
      Name:    Near Field Communication Forum, Inc. 
      Address: 401 Edgewater Place, Suite 600 
               Wakefield, MA, 01880 
    
   Designated contact

      Email:   TPM@nfc-forum.org 
    
2.4     Declaration of syntactic structure: 
    
   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "nfc" 
   NID will have the following structure: 
    
      urn:nfc:{NFCresource}:{ResourceSpecificString} 
    
   Where the "{NFCresource}" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the 
   URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of 
   resource.  Each resource class has a specific labeling scheme that is 
   covered by "{ResourceSpecificString}" which also conforms to the 
   naming requirements of [RFC2141].  
        
   NFC Forum working groups will manage the assignment of NFC resources 
   and the specific registration values assigned for each resource 
   class. The Technical Committee will coordinate creation of new 
   resource class assignments based on community need. 
    
2.5     Relevant ancillary documentation: 
 
   The NFC Forum publishes specifications describing the use of near-
   field communication for interoperable exchange of information between 
   devices in close proximity. Among these specifications are the 
   designation of new data types, schema, XML elements and attributes, 
   protocols, and other formally named items intended for machine 
   parsing. Interested parties are referred to the NFC Forum web site 
   where these publications will be made available to the community:

2.6     Identifier uniqueness considerations: 
    
   The NFC Forum working groups and Technical Committee will ensure 
   uniqueness of resource names assigned by the NFC Forum within the 
   resource classes for which they are responsible. 
    
   When authority and responsibility for assignment of names with a 
   resource class are delegated to an external organization, commitment 
   to adhere to the uniqueness requirements of the assigned resource 
   names will be a pre-condition of such delegation. 
    
   The structure of the NFC Forum namespace into resource classes will 
   further ensure isolation of names in each class from names in other 
   classes. 
    
   It is anticipated that some resource classes may be open to self-
   assignment by any interested individual or organization. To ensure a 
   degree of uniqueness for these self-assigned resource names, fully-
   qualified domain names will be factored into the name to distinguish 
   the naming authorities. 
    
   It should be understood that due to the flexibility of the domain 
   names system and the underlying market-based forces that allow for 
   ownership transfer and abandonment of domain names, no guarantee of 
   long-term uniqueness or persistence can be made for this class of 
   resource names beyond that made for the domain names themselves. 
 
2.7     Identifier persistence considerations: 
    
   The NFC Forum will not reassign names and will thus guarantee the 
   persistence of names beyond the expected lifetime of the named 
   resource. NFC Forum does not anticipate operating a name resolution 
   service for the assigned names and does not anticipate any other 
   usability issues of the assigned names beyond those for any other 
   naturally aging technology. 
 
2.8     Process of identifier assignment: 
    
   The NFC Forum will provide procedures for registration of each class 
   of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three 
   types of registration activities:  
        
     1) Registered names associated with NFC Forum specifications or 
   services; 
     2) Registration of names or resource classes for other entities; 
     3) Name models for use in experimental purposes.

2.9     Process for identifier resolution: 
     
   The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.     
 
2.10      Rules for Lexical Equivalence:  
        
   No special considerations, the rules for lexical equivalence of 
   [RFC2141] apply. 
 
2.11      Conformance with URN Syntax:  
        
   No special considerations. 
 
2.12      Validation mechanism:  
        
   None specified.  URN assignment and registration will be handled by 
   procedures implemented in support of NFC Forum activities. 
 
2.13      Scope:  
        
   Global 
 
3.    Examples 
        
   The following examples are representative URNs that could be assigned 
   by the NFC Forum.  They may not be the actual strings that would be 
   assigned: 
        
      urn:nfc:wkt:Uri 
         Defines the well-known type identifier used to identify URI 
         bookmark data objects defined by the NFC Forum and exchanged by 
         NFC devices. 
        
      urn:nfc:schema:manifest 
         Declares an XML namespace for elements and attributes, used in 
         an XML schema to describe an NFC Forum data transfer manifest. 
 
4.    Namespace Considerations  
        
   The NFC Forum is developing a variety of communication protocol and 
   data exchange specifications.  Some of these specifications depend 
   upon supporting information (e.g. data descriptions, attributes, 
   schema, etc.) to be fully specified.  For proper operation, 
   descriptions of the needed supporting information must exist and be 
   available in a unique, reliable and persistent manner.  These 
   dependencies provide the basis of need for namespaces, in one form or 
   another.

                   URN Namespace for the NFC Forum           May 2006 
 
 
   As type information is relayed across NFC Forum protocols, the need 
   for compact, machine parsed type identification of data and meta-
   content, with the attributes of uniqueness and reliability mentioned 
   above, becomes imperative for proper interoperation across widely 
   varied implementations. 
    
   As the NFC Forum work is ongoing and covers many technical areas, the 
   possibility of using various other namespace repositories has been 
   deemed impractical.  Each data object, description, or schema as 
   defined in the NFC Forum, could possibly be related to multiple 
   different other namespaces so further conflicts of association might 
   occur.  Thus the intent is to utilize the requested URN namespace to 
   manage NFC Forum defined objects, descriptions, and schema. 
 
5.    Community Considerations  
    
   The objects and descriptions required for specifications produced and 
   published by the NFC Forum are generally available for use by other 
   organizations.  The NFC Forum will provide access and support for 
   name requests by these external organizations.  This support can be 
   enabled in timely and responsive fashion as new objects and 
   descriptions are produced. 
    
6.    Security Considerations 
    
   There are no additional security considerations other than those 
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general. 
 
7.    IANA Considerations 
        
   The objective of this registration is for the requested NID to be 
   entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.  This would result in an 
   update to http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any 
   associated mirrors.
