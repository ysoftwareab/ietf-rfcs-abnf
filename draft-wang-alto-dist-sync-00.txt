1.  Introduction

   In some sceneries that one individual ALTO servers can hardly handle,
   such as in large-scale distributed network, or in the network
   combined with different ISPs, the conceptions of network partition
   and cross-domain ALTO servers should be introduced.

   In each network partition, we assume that there is an ALTO server to
   provide network information.  Hence one possibility is to using small
   glimpse of each network partition to compose the information of whole
   complete network.

   The basic idea and problem space for composing is to solve the
   problem of synchronization.

   This document imposes the challenges and initial solutions that can
   be expected for the composing problem of cross-domain ALTO servers.
   In the discussion session, the problems of synchronization of
   distributed ALTO servers that we found but haven't given a solution
   are listed, such as the consistency and the update frequency.

1.1.  Problem Statement

   Before touching the real problem of synchronization, we assume the
   network settings as below:

       +----------------------------------------------------------+
       | .----------.                               ___ Network   |
       | | ISP1     |                .-----------. /    Partition |
       | |     ALTO +--------+-------| ISP 2     |/               |
       | |    Server|        |       |      ALTO |                |
       | `----------'        |       |     Server|                |
       | .----------.        |       `-----------'                |
       | | ISP3     |        |----                                |
       | |     ALTO +-------/     \ ... ...                       |
       | |    Server|                                             |
       | `----------'                                             |
       |                                         Complete Network |
       +----------------------------------------------------------+

                       Figure 1: Network Partitions.

   In each network partition, there is an individual ALTO server.  Each
   ALTO server will track and can only track the information of its own
   network.

   Theoretically, by tracking the information provided by each ALTO
   servers, a whole picture of the complete network information will
   emerge.  However, to synchronize the existing and coming information
   from different network partitions can be a big challenge.

1.2.  Terminology

   o  Network Partition: infrastructures in partial network with
      connectivity.

   o  ECS: Endpoint Cost Service

   o  SSE: Server Sent Event

2.  Challenges

   Implementing distributed ALTO servers architecture is not easy
   because of the synchronization problem.  There are several challenges
   about distributed ALTO servers synchronization.  This document will
   focus on discussing about the challenges in three major services of
   ALTO: network map service, cost map service and endpoint cost
   service.

2.1.  Challenges about Network Map Synchronization

   In the previous design, different servers can have identical names.
   When it comes to compose the whole network, it will introduce
   collisions.

2.2.  Challenges about Cost Map Synchronization

   How to unify the network map dependency of cost map?

   How to compute or indicate the cost between the PIDs in the different
   network partitions?

2.3.  Challenges about Endpoint Cost Synchronization

   How to compute the cost between the endpoints in the different
   network partitions?

3.  Solution Proposal

   This document proposed a basic workflow to make distributed ALTO
   servers be able to synchronize with each others.

   1.  Distributed ALTO servers discovery;

   2.  Real-time incremental update using SSE between ALTO server;

   3.  Network trackers between neighbour partitions.

   Following will talk more details about these three steps.

3.1.  Step1: Distributed ALTO Servers Discovery

   The ALTO servers need to find each others before make any information
   aggregation.  So there need to be some server discovery protocols
   deployed in the network.

   The draft [ALTO-XDOM-DISC] proposed a cross-domain server discovery
   protocol and we can borrow it as well.

3.2.  Step2: Real-time incremental update using SSE

   Each ALTO server can subscribe the incremental update of the network
   map, cost map and endpoint cost service resources in the other ALTO
   servers.  When the network information update, all of ALTO servers
   will receive the update incrementally.

   The draft [ALTO-SSE] gave a solution to implement real-time
   incremental update by using SSE.

3.3.  Step3: Network trackers between neighbour partitions.

   In the current network settings, the network trackers will only
   provide the network information inside their own network partitions.
   It is impossible to get the network information between network
   partitions because there is no components in the architecture
   tracking these information.

   This document proposed a basic solution to solve this problem.  The
   solution is to add some new network trackers between neighbour
   partitions in the network.

4.  Discussion

4.1.  Considerations for Consistency

   Till now there is no solution to promise the consistency between
   different network partitions.

4.2.  Considerations for Update Frequency

   TBD

4.3.  Considerations for ALTO Topology Extension

   Suppose ALTO will provide topology information in future, how do we
   specially compose the topology information from different network
   partition?  Most importantly, at which specific frequency should we
   update the topology information?

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new media type or introduce any new
   IANA consideration.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any privacy or security issue not
   already present in the ALTO protocol.
