                 draft-wahlstroem-ace-cbor-web-token-00

Abstract

   CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
   transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web
   Token (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices.  The claims in
   a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
   and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added
   application layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of
   information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/
   value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.

1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Token (JWT) [5] is a standardized security token format
   that has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect deployments, among
   other applications.  JWT uses JSON Web Signatures (JWS) [3] and JSON
   Web Encryption (JWE) [4] to secure the contents of the JWT, which is
   a set of claims represented in JSON [5].  The use of JSON for
   encoding information is popular for Web and native applications, but
   it is considered inefficient for some Internet of Things (IoT)
   systems that use low power radio technologies.

   In this document an alternative encoding of claims is defined.
   Instead of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification uses
   CBOR [6] and calls this new structure "CBOR Web Token (CWT)", which
   is a compact means of representing secured claims to be transferred

   between two parties.  CWT is closely related to JWT.  It references
   the JWT claims and both its name and pronunciation are derived from
   JWT.  To protect the claims contained in CWTs, the CBOR Object
   Signing and Encryption (COSE) [7] specification is used.

   The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
   "cot".

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [1].

   This document reuses terminology from JWT [5] and COSE [7].

   Type3StringOrURI:

      The "Type3StringOrURI" term has the same meaning, syntax, and
      processing rules as the "StringOrUri" term defined in Section 2 of
      JWT [5], except that Type3StringOrURI uses CBOR major type 3
      instead of a JSON string value.

      FIXME: Use tag 32 for URIs?

   Type6NumericDate:

      The "Type6NumericDate" term has the same meaning, syntax, and
      processing rules as the "NumericDate" term defined in Section 2 of
      JWT [5], except that Type6NumericDate uses CBOR major type 6, with
      tag value 1, instead of a numeric JSON value.

   CBOR encoded claim key:

      The key used to identify a claim value.

3.  Claims

   The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is
   context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.
   Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
   understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
   the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
   by implementations MUST be ignored.

   To keep CWTs as small as possible, the CBOR encoded claim keys are
   represented using CBOR major type 0.  Section 4 summaries all keys
   used to identity the claims defined in this document.

3.1.  Claim Names

   None of the claims defined below are intended to be mandatory to use
   or implement.  They rather provide a starting point for a set of
   useful, interoperable claims.  Applications using CWTs should define
   which specific claims they use and when they are required or
   optional.

3.1.1.  iss (Issuer) Claim

   The "iss" (issuer) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and processing
   rules as the "iss" claim defined in Section 4.1.1 of JWT [5], except
   that the format MUST be a Type3StringOrURI.  The CBOR encoded claim
   key 1 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.2.  sub (Subject) Claim

   The "sub" (subject) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "sub" claim defined in Section 4.1.2 of JWT
   [5], except that the format MUST be a Type3StringOrURI.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 2 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.3.  aud (Audience) Claim

   The "aud" (audience) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "aud" claim defined in Section 4.1.3 of JWT
   [5], except that the format MUST be a Type3StringOrURI.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 3 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.4.  exp (Expiration Time) Claim

   The "exp" (expiration time) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "exp" claim defined in Section 4.1.4 of JWT
   [5], except that the format MUST be a Type6NumericDate.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 4 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.5.  nbf (Not Before) Claim

   The "nbf" (not before) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "nbf" claim defined in Section 4.1.5 of JWT
   [5], except that the format MUST be a Type6NumericDate.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 5 MUST be used to identify this claim.

Internet-Draft               CBOR Web Token                December 2015


3.1.6.  iat (Issued At) Claim

   The "iat" (issued at) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and
   processing rules as the "iat" claim defined in Section 4.1.6 of JWT
   [5], except that the format MUST be a Type6NumericDate.  The CBOR
   encoded claim key 6 MUST be used to identify this claim.

3.1.7.  cti (CWT ID) Claim

   The "cti" (CWT ID) claim has the same meaning, syntax, and processing
   rules as the "jti" claim defined in Section 4.1.7 of JWT [5], except
   that the format MUST be of major type 3 with a case-sensitive string
   value.  The CBOR encoded claim key 7 MUST be used to identify this
   claim.

   Note: Claims defined by the OpenID Foundation have not yet been
   included in the table above.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of the CWT is dependent on the protection offered by
   COSE.  Without protecting the claims contained in a CWT an adversary
   is able to modify, add or remove claims.  Since the claims conveyed
   in a CWT are used to make authorization decisions it is not only
   important to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that the
   recipient is able to authenticate the party that collected the claims
   and created the CWT.  Without trust of the recipient in the party
   that created the CWT no sensible authorization decision can be made.
   Furthermore, the creator of the CWT needs to carefully evaluate each
   claim value prior to including it in the CWT so that the recipient
   can be assured about the correctness of the provided information.

   This section will create a registry for CWT claims, possibly relating
   them to the JWT Claims Registry.

A.1.  CWT with "aud" and symmetric key

   A CWT used in the context of ACE requires at least the "aud" and a
   "cks" claim (defined elsewhere).  This means that "iss", "alg",
   "key_ops" and others are pre-established and assumed.  This would
   look like this non-normative JSON.


{
  "aud":"coap://light.example.com",
  "cks":
    [                       // COSE_Key is a CBOR map with an array of keys
      {
        "kty":4,            // symmetric key is indicated using kty 4
        "k": "loremipsum"   // the symmetric key
      }
    ]
}


       Figure 2: "aud" claim and symmetric key in non-normative JSON

   Using the CBOR encoded claim keys according to Section 4 and COSE [7]
   makes a CWT with "aud" and a symmetric key look like this in CBOR
