Internet-Draft           QoS NSLP State Machine                June 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a state machine for QoS NSLP [1], trying to
   show how QoS NSLP can be implemented to support its deployment.  The
   state machine described in this document is illustrative of how the
   QoS NSLP protocol defined in [1] may be implemented for QoS NSLP
   nodes in the flow path. Where there are differences [1] are
   authoritative.  The state machine diagrams are informative only.
   Implementations may achieve the same results using different methods.

   According to [1], there are several possibilities for QoS NSLP
   signaling, at least including the following: - end-to-end signaling
   vs. scoped signaling - sender-initiated signaling vs.  receiver-
   initiated signaling.

   The messages used in the QoS NSLP protocol can be summarized as
   follows:

      Requesting message       Responding message
      ------------------------+---------------------------
      RESERVE                 |None or RESERVE or RESPONSE
      QUERY                   |RESERVE or RESPONSE
      RESPONSE                |NONE
      NOTIFY                  |NONE
      ------------------------+---------------------------


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].


3.  Notational conventions used in state diagrams

   The following text is reused from [3] and the state diagrams are
   based on the conventions specified in [4], Section 8.2.1.  Additional
   state machine details are taken from [5].

   The complete text is reproduced here:

   State diagrams are used to represent the operation of the protocol by
   a number of cooperating state machines each comprising a group of
   connected, mutually exclusive states.  Only one state of each machine
   can be active at any given time.

   All permissible transitions between states are represented by arrows,



Fu, et al.                                                      [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           QoS NSLP State Machine                June 2006


   the arrowhead denoting the direction of the possible transition.
   Labels attached to arrows denote the condition(s) that must be met in
   order for the transition to take place.  All conditions are
   expressions that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE; if a condition evaluates
   to TRUE, then the condition is met.  The label UCT denotes an
   unconditional transition (i.e., UCT always evaluates to TRUE).  A
   transition that is global in nature (i.e., a transition that occurs
   from any of the possible states if the condition attached to the
   arrow is met) is denoted by an open arrow; i.e., no specific state is
   identified as the origin of the transition.  When the condition
   associated with a global transition is met, it supersedes all other
   exit conditions including UCT.  The special global condition BEGIN
   supersedes all other global conditions, and once asserted remains
   asserted until all state blocks have executed to the point that
   variable assignments and other consequences of their execution remain
   unchanged.

   On entry to a state, the procedures defined for the state (if any)
   are executed exactly once, in the order that they appear on the page.
   Each action is deemed to be atomic; i.e., execution of a procedure
   completes before the next sequential procedure starts to execute.  No
   procedures execute outside of a state block.  The procedures in only
   one state block execute at a time, even if the conditions for
   execution of state blocks in different state machines are satisfied,
   and all procedures in an executing state block complete execution
   before the transition to and execution of any other state block
   occurs, i.e., the execution of any state block appears to be atomic
   with respect to the execution of any other state block and the
   transition condition to that state from the previous state is TRUE
   when execution commences.  The order of execution of state blocks in
   different state machines is undefined except as constrained by their
   transition conditions.  A variable that is set to a particular value
   in a state block retains this value until a subsequent state block
   executes a procedure that modifies the value.

   On completion of all of the procedures within a state, all exit
   conditions for the state (including all conditions associated with
   global transitions) are evaluated continuously until one of the
   conditions is met.  The label ELSE denotes a transition that occurs
   if none of the other conditions for transitions from the state are
   met (i.e., ELSE evaluates to TRUE if all other possible exit
   conditions from the state evaluate to FALSE).  Where two or more exit
   conditions with the same level of precedence become TRUE
   simultaneously, the choice as to which exit condition causes the
   state transition to take place is arbitrary.

   In addition to the above notation, there are a couple of
   clarifications specific to this document.  First, all boolean



Fu, et al.                                                      [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           QoS NSLP State Machine                June 2006


   variables are initialized to FALSE before the state machine execution
   begins.  Second, the following notational shorthand is specific to
   this document:

   <variable> = <expression1> | <expression2> | ...

      Execution of a statement of this form will result in <variable>
      having a value of exactly one of the expressions.  The logic for
      which of those expressions gets executed is outside of the state
      machine and could be environmental, configurable, or based on
      another state machine such as that of the method.


4.  State Machine Symbols

   ( )
      Used to force the precedence of operators in Boolean expressions
      and to delimit the argument(s) of actions within state boxes.

   ;
      Used as a terminating delimiter for actions within state boxes.
      Where a state box contains multiple actions, the order of
      execution follows the normal English language conventions for
      reading text.

   =
      Assignment action.  The value of the expression to the right of
      the operator is assigned to the variable to the left of the
      operator.  Where this operator is used to define multiple
      assignments, e.g., a = b = X the action causes the value of the
      expression following the right-most assignment operator to be
      assigned to all of the variables that appear to the left of the
      right-most assignment operator.

   !
      Logical NOT operator.

   &&
      Logical AND operator.

   ||
      Logical OR operator.

   if...then...
      Conditional action.  If the Boolean expression following the if
      evaluates to TRUE, then the action following the then is executed.

   { statement 1, ... statement N }

      Compound statement.  Braces are used to group statements that are
      executed together as if they were a single statement.

   !=
      Inequality.  Evaluates to TRUE if the expression to the left of
      the operator is not equal in value to the expression to the right.

   ==
      Equality.  Evaluates to TRUE if the expression to the left of the
      operator is equal in value to the expression to the right.

   >
      Greater than.  Evaluates to TRUE if the value of the expression to
      the left of the operator is greater than the value of the
      expression to the right.

   <=
      Less than or equal to.  Evaluates to TRUE if the value of the
      expression to the left of the operator is either less than or
      equal to the value of the expression to the right.

   ++
      Increment the preceding integer operator by 1.

   +
      Arithmetic addition operator.

   &
      Bitwise AND operator.

   EV_RX_NOTIFY:
      NOTIFY message received


5.4  Assumptions

   -  For simplification not all included objects in a message are
      shown.  Only those that are significant for the case are showed.
      State machines do not present handling of messages that are not
      significant for management of the states such as certain NOTIFY
      and QUERY messages.
   -  State machines represent handling of messages of the same Session
      ID and with no protocol errors.  Separate parallel instances of
      the state machines should handle messages for different Session
      IDs.
   -  Default message handling should be defined for messages with
      different Session IDs that have impact on current session state
      and error messages.  This is not included in the current version.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise new security considerations. Any
   security concerns with QoS NSLP are likely reflected in security
   related NSIS work already (such as [1] or [6]).

   For the time being, the state machines described in this document do
   not consider the security aspect of QoS NSLP protocol itself. A
   future versions of this document will add security relevant states
   and state transitions.


8.  Open Issues

   This document tries to describe possible states and transitions for
   QoS NSLP according to its current specification [1], Section 5.  We
   found some issues during the development of the state machines.

   1. Bi-directional reservation is difficult to support as the state
      machine becomes quite complex (note at one particular point in
      time the protocol state engine can be only in one state).
   2. How to signal unsuccessful reservation for Receiver initiated
      reservation (No RII  included; a resulting Response(RSN) cannot be
      forwarded further than the next peer). We use NOTIFY message.
   3. The case of unsuccessful reservation at a QNE node and no RII
      specified by upstream  nodes. According to the spec RESPONSE(RSN)
      should not be forwarded further than the next  peer. Currently we
      use NOTIFY(RSN) that is sent further to the upstream nodes.
   4. We assume that handling of QoS state lifetime expiration event is
      based on the local  policy of the node. NOTIFY/Reserve(Ton)
      messages might be sent to other peers.
   5. The draft states that RESERVE message MUST be sent only towards
      the QNR. This is not  the case when re-routing procedure is done
      and RESERVE(Ton) message should be sent from  merging QNE node for
      deleting the old branch. We believe this is towards the QNI.
   6. Re-routing functionality described in this document is not
      complete and need further  consideration.

Appendix A. ASCII versions of state diagrams

   This appendix contains the state diagrams in ASCII format.  Please
   use the PDF version whenever possible: it is much easier to
   understand.

   The notation is as follows: for each state there is a separate table
   that lists in each row:
   - an event that triggers a transition,
   - actions taken as a result of the incoming event,
   - and the new state at which the transitions ends.
