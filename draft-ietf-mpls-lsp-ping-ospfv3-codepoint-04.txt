                   OSPFv3 CodePoint for MPLS LSP Ping
              draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-ospfv3-codepoint-04

Abstract

   IANA has created "Protocol in the Segment IS Sub-TLV" and "Protocol
   in the Label Stack Sub-TLV of the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV"
   registries under the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry.  RFC8287 defines the
   code points for OSPF and IS-IS.

   This document proposes the code point to be used in the Segment ID
   Sub-TLV and Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV when the IGP is OSPFv3.
   This document also updates RFC8287 by clarifying that the existing
   "OSPF" code point is to be used only to indicate OSPFv2, and by
   defining the behavior when the Segment ID SUb-TLV indicates the use
   of IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   IANA has created the "Protocol in the Segment IS Sub-TLV" registry
   and "Protocol in the Label Stack Sub-TLV of the Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV" registries under the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry
   [IANA-MPLS-LSP-PING].  [RFC8287] defines the code points for OSPF and
   IS-IS.

   [RFC5340] describes OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) to support IPv6.
   [RFC5838] describes the mechanism to support multiple address
   families (AFs) in OSPFv3.  Accordingly, OSPFv3 may be used to
   advertise IPv6 and IPv4 prefixes.

   This document proposes the code point to be used in the Segment ID
   Sub-TLV (Type 34, 35 and 36) and in the Downstream Detailed Mapping
   (DDMAP) TLV when the IGP is OSPFv3.

   This document also updates [RFC8287] by clarifying that the existing
   "OSPF" code point is to be used only to indicate OSPFv2, and by

   defining the behavior when the Segment ID Sub-TLV indicates the use
   of IPv6.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC8402], [RFC8029],
   [RFC8287] and so the readers are expected to be familiar with the
   same.

3.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  OSPFv3 protocol in Segment ID Sub-TLVs

   When the protocol field of the Segment ID Sub-TLV of Type 34, 35 and
   36 is set to 3, the responder MUST perform the FEC validation using
   OSPFv3 as the IGP.

   The initiator MUST NOT set the protocol field of the Segment ID Sub-
   TLV Type 35 as OSPF (value 1) as OSPFv2 is not compatible with the
   use of IPv6 addresses indicated by this Sub-TLV.

   When the protocol field in the received Segment ID Sub-TLV Type 35 is
   OSPF (value 1), the responder MAY treat the protocol value as "Any
   IGP Protocol" (value 0) according to step 4a of Section 7.4 of
   [RFC8287].  This allows the responder to support legacy
   implementations that use value 1 to indicate OSPFv3.

5.  OSPFv3 protocol in Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV

   The protocol field of the Downstream Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV in
   an echo reply is set to 7 when OSPFv3 is used to distribute the label
   carried in the Downstream Label field.

6.  OSPFv2 Protocol in Segment ID and DDMAP Sub-TLVs

   Section 5 of [RFC8287] defines the code point for OSPF to be used in
   the Protocol field of the Segment ID Sub-TLV.  Section 6 of [RFC8287]
   defines the code point for OSPF to be used in the Protocol field of
   the DDMAP TLV.

   This document specifies that the above code points will be used only
   for OSPFv2.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Protocol in the Segment ID sub-TLV

   IANA is requested to assign a new code point from the "Protocol in
   the Segment ID sub-TLV" registry under the "Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters"
   registry as follows:

     Value        Meaning     Reference
   ----------     -------    ------------
     3          OSPFv3     This document

   IANA is also requested to add a note for the existing entry for code
   point 1 (OSPF) to read: - "To be used for OSPFv2 only".

7.2.  Protocol in Label Stack Sub-TLV of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV

   IANA is requested to assign a new code point for OSPFv3 from
   "Protocol in Label Stack Sub-TLV of Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV"
   registry under the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry as follows:

     Value        Meaning      Reference
   ----------    ---------    ------------
     7         OSPFv3       This document

   IANA is also requested to add a note for the existing codepoint 5
   (OSPF) to read - "To be used for OSPFv2 only".

8.  Security Considerations

   This document updates [RFC8287] and does not introduce any additional
   security considerations.
