                  Gateway Function for Network Slicing
                   draft-homma-coms-slice-gateway-01

Abstract

   This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice
   gateway that is a data plane function or function group for
   connecting/disconnecting and compose/decompose network slice subnets
   and providing network slices from end to end.  The interworkings
   between management and control elements at the management and control
   planes with the gateway function for controlling and orchestrating
   end-to-end network slices are also presented in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is an approach to create separate virtual networks in
   support of service depending on several requirements on the same
   physical resources, and it enables networks to adapt to requirements,
   which is diverse more, inexpensively and flexibly.  It's also
   expected to enhance usability of infrastructural networks for tenants
   and create new business opportunities.  For example, by using network
   slices lent from infrastructure operators, other industrial companies
   can provide communication services including ensurance of network
   transport without having physical infrastructure.

   From a business point of view, a slice includes a combination of all
   the relevant network resources, functions, and assets required to
   fulfill a specific business case or service, including OSS, BSS and
   DevOps processes.

   From the network infrastructure point of view, network slice requires
   the partitioning and assignment of a set of resources that can be
   used in an isolated, disjunctive or non- disjunctive manner for that
   slice.

   From the tenant point of view, network slice provides different
   capabilities, specifically in terms of their management and control
   capabilities, and how much of them the network service provider hands
   over to the slice tenant.  As such there are two kinds of slices: (A)
   Inner slices, understood as the partitions used for internal services
   of the provider, retaining full control and management of them.  (B)
   Outer slices, being those partitions hosting customer services,
   appearing to the customer as dedicated networks.

   Network slices are established with combination of various
   technologies, such as software defined network (SDN), network
   function virtualization (NFV), or traffic engineering, and managed/
   operated with automation technologies such as orchestrator.

   Assumed use cases of network slices include establishment of virtual
   networks whose qualities are guaranteed from end to end under the
   supervision of multi-domain orchstrators.  In such cases, a network
   slice subnet is created on each domain, such as access network and
   core network, and such network slices are composed of connected
   subnets.

   Network slice subnets are built based on specification of the
   underlay network, and thus the used technologies might vary.
   Therefore, a gateway function, which enables to connect subnets while
   adapting the differentiations and forward data packets to/from the
   appropriate next subnet, is required.  Defining a new data plane
   technology is not a goal of this draft.  This draft aims to specify
   management-related requirements for an SLG, which may be implemented
   using existing data plane technologies.

   In this document, the gateway function is called slice gateway or
   SLG, and the role and requirements are described.

2.  Definition of Terms

   Network Slicing:  Network slicing is a technology or an approach to
      create separate virtual networks in support of services, depending
      on several requirements, on the same physical resources.  This is
      possible by combinations of several network technologies.

   Network Slice (NS):  An NS is a virtual network established on
      network infrastructure.  Some include additional network functions
      such as firewall or load-balancer in addition to basically
      forwarding functions such as switches or routers.  It has an
      overlay architecture and is independent from the underlay
      network's topology.

   NS Subnet:  An NS subnet is partially virtual network established
      within a single domain.

   End-to-End Network Slice (E2E-NS):  An E2E-NS is a virtual network
      connecting between end points.  E2E slices are composed of a
      single NS subnet or multiple NS subnets.

   Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS):  An NSaaS is a NS distribution
      model in which a third-party provider hosts NSs and makes them
      available to customers.

   Network Slice Tenant (NS Tenant):  An NS tenant is a person or group
      that rents and occupies NSs from NS providers.

   Domain:  A domain is a group of a network and devices administrated
      as a unit with common rules and procedures.

   Administrative Domain:  An administrative domain is a group of
      networks and devices managed by an administrator.

   Resource:  A resource is element used to create virtual networks.
      There are several types of resources, i.e., connectivity,
      computing and storage.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV):  NFV is the concept or
      technologies to provide dedicated network appliances as software.

   Software Defined Network (SDN):  SDN is the concept or technologies
      to separate network control plane from data plane, and control
      network devices dynamically and flexibly.

   Virtual Network:  A virtual network is a network running a number of
      virtual network functions.

   Virtual Network Function (VNF):  A virtual network function (VNF) is
      a network function whose functional software is decoupled from
      hardware.  One or more virtual machines running different software
      and processes on top of industry-standard high-volume servers,
      switches and storage, or cloud computing infrastructure, and
      capable of implementing network functions traditionally
      implemented via custom hardware appliances and middleboxes (e.g.,
      router, NAT, firewall, load balancer, etc.)

   Slice Gateway Function (SLG):  An SLG is a function or a group of
      functions to connect/disconnect NS subnets.  The role is described
      in the following sections.

   Business Support System and Operation Support System (BSS/OSS):  BSS/
      OSS are systems to support service providing and operation of
      network devices.

   Orchestrator:  Orchestrator is an entity to operate network
      components automatically.  There are several types of
      orchestrators including NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) or service
      orchestrator defined by ETSI NFV and Open Source MANO (OSM)
      ([NFV-Architectural-Framework] and [OSM-White-Paper]).

   SLG Controller (SLG-Ctrl):  An SLG-Ctrl is an entity that controls
      SLGs.  An SLG-Ctrl is controlled by upper-level operation systems
      such as OSS/BSS or orchestrator.

3.  Motivations and Roles of SLG

   SLG main role is the enablement of interworkings between data plane
   with management and control elements for controlling and
   orchestrating end-to-end slices.

   Use cases of network slices are discussed in several Standard
   Developing Organizations (SDOs).  Some examples are described in use
   cases document ([I-D.netslices-usecases]).

   In some proposed use cases, an NS is structured across multiple
   network domains.  The capability of NS subnets might be different
   because the components are domain-specific.  In particular, the
   differentiation in capability between different administrative
   domains is large.

   For connecting some different NS subnets and providing a NS that
   guarantees the prescribed quality from end to end, SLGs are required
   to connect such NS subnets.  SLGs enable to provide E2E-NSs
   independently of specifications of underlay networks by hiding the
   differentiations and connecting between NS subnets.  An overview of
   this concept is shown in Figure 1.  SLGs glue NS subnets established
   on each domain and provide an E2E-NS.

   Moreover, identification of user service traffic and their
   allocation/disallocation to the appropriate NS subnet are required at
   the edges of E2E-NSs, as shown in Figure 2, and SLGs might take on
   these roles.

   Note that, this model has the assumption that transitions of data
   packets from one NS subnet to another are executed at only SLGs.
   Also, an SLG is not necessarily implemented as a single device or
   virtual machine (VM).

4.  Architecture Overview of NS Management

   The architecture overview of NS management system is shown in
   Figure 3.  Orchestrators manage whole resources including network
   elements and server resources (i.e., routing, bandwidth, compute or
   storage).  In this figure, the resources including network elements
   and server resources are managed by resource orchestrators installed
   in each domain, and the E2E-orchestrator and network service
   orchestrator handle resource orchestrators.

   NSs are requested from NS tenants via the portal system and the order
   of creations of an NS is given to the E2E orchestrator from the
   portal system via BSS/OSS.  When an NS across multiple administrative
   domains are requested, the portal system that received the request
   forwards the order to create NS subnets to the other infrastructure
   providers' systems via Cross-Segment Slice Manager.  The details of
   COMS architecture are described in the architecture document ([I-
   D.qiang-coms-architecture]).

   SLGs are also controlled via orchestrators.  An SLG basically belongs
   to a network element, and it might also belong to server resource if
   it runs as a VNF.  (An example of position of SLG deployed as a VNF
   is shown in Appendix A.)

   SLGs are located at the edges of each NS subnet.  They translate data
   packets into the appropriate form and send them to the next NS
   subnet.  SLGs located at the end of E2E-NSs additionally provide
   identification of data packets and select the assigned NS subnet
   based on the identification result.

   The information model used in this architecture is described in
   information model document
   ([I-D.qiang-coms-netslicing-information-model]).

5.  Requirements for SLG

   An SLG is basically a component in the data plane and has the roles
   of data packet processing.  Moreover, it is required to have
   functions for control/management processes such as connecting to
   underlay networks or managing NSs.




Homma, et al.           Expires September 6, 2018               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-coms-slice-gateway           March 2018


   Furthermore, an SLG might be required to support handling services
   provided on NSs in addition to controlling of NS because an SLG is an
   edge node on an E2E-NS.

   In this section, we describe the requirements for an SLG in terms of
   the following aspects and their interworkings.

   1. Data plane for NSs as infrastructure

   2. Control/management plane for NSs as infrastructure

   3. Data plane for services on NSs

   4. Control/management plane for services on NSs

5.1.  Management of NS as Infrastructure

5.1.1.  Data Plane Aspect

5.1.1.1.  Identification/Classification

   SLGs at the edge of E2E-NSs MUST have the capability to identify and
   classify data packets, and assign them to the appropriate E2E-NS.
   This requirement varies depending on the location.

   Fixed Access:  An SLG MUST identify and classify data packet with
      access point, including CPE or WiFi-AP, or subscriber ID such as
      VLAN-ID.  Moreover, in some services, an SLG should identify and
      classify data packets based on user device or application used in
      the communication.

   Mobile Access:  An SLG MUST identify and classify data packet with
      subscriber-ID such as IMSI, radio-wave bandwidth, or identifier of
      tunnels.  Moreover, in some services, an SLG should identify and
      classify data packets based on application used in the
      communication or location of the user equipment (UE).

   Between NS subnets:  An SLG MUST identify and classify data packet
      based on the tunnel-ID or virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)
      that received the packets.  If specific slice identifier such as a
      value mapped in the metadata field of the IP header is used; an
      SLG should identify and classify data packets with the ID.

5.1.1.2.  Transporting/Forwarding

   SLGs MUST provide functions for transport data packets depending on
   the specifications of the underlay networks.




Homma, et al.           Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-coms-slice-gateway           March 2018


   Encapsulation/Decapsulation/Tagging:  In network slicing, duplication
      of IP addresses of user packets between NSs MUST be accepted,
      thus, using techniques that enable separation of a network
      logically is preferred.  In short, some tunnel protocols or
      tagging approaches should be used as transport of NSs.  For this
      reason, SLG MUST support encapsulation or tagging of data packets
      based on the specification of the underlay network.  Also, SLG
      MUST support the packets' decapsulation or untagging.  Examples of
      tunnel protocols and tags that can be used for creating NSs on L2/
      L3 segments are described below.



      L2 Segment:  VLAN, MPLS, Segment Routing MPLS (SR-MPLS), PPPoE,
         etc.

      L3 Segment:  GRE, L2TP, GTP-U, VxLAN, IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6),
         etc.

      VxLAN, SR-MPLS, and SRv6 are described in their specification
      documents ([RFC7348], [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], and
      [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).

   Translation of Encapsulation/Tagging Form:  SLG MUST support to
      translate tunnel header or tag of received packets to the
      appropriate tunnel header or tag when it forwards data packets to
      the next NS subnet that has different transport capability.

   Distribution of Traffic:  Some NSs have multiple route between the
      same end points within the same NS subnet because of traffic
      engineering, switching to a redundant path, or other reasons, and
      SLG MAY forward data packets with the appropriate route based on
      some trigger information.  An example of the overview of this
      requirement is shown in Figure 4.  In this figure, there are two
      routes, main and sub, between SLGs, and an SLG switches forwarding
      route depending on the network situation such as congestion
      occurrence on the current route.

5.1.1.3.  Isolation between NSs

   In NSaaS, isolation control is required for avoiding an NS being
   affect by other NSs.  Traffic engineering or QoS control is ones of
   the most fundamental approaches to prevent disturbances between NSs.

   Traffic Shaping/Policing:  An SLG MUST execute traffic shaping and
      policing at its egress and ingress ports to avoid an NS using
      excessive traffic bandwidth.

   Quality of service (QoS) Control:  If there is an order of priority
      between NSs on the same underlay infrastructure, an SLG should
      remark the appropriate QoS parameter of the outer-most header of
      each packet following the preconfigured setting and provide packet
      scheduling based on the QoS parameter for providing priority
      control.  The field that SLG refers may vary depending on the
      specification of the underlay network.  For example, COS value is
      remarked in L2 segments; on the other hand, DSCP value is remarked
      in L3 segments.

5.1.1.4.  Service Chaining as Infrastructural Mechanism(*Optional)

   If an SLG is composed of a combination of several components, a
   service chaining mechanism is required to make them work together and
   achieve SLG functionality.

   Moreover, some NSs may traverse NFVs such as firewalls or cache
   servers for providing value-added services to their users.  In such
   cases, SLG might be required to support service chaining mechanisms,
   such as handling of network service header (NSH) defined in
   [RFC8300].  If an NS includes the service chaining architecture
   defined in [RFC7665], some SLG would be required to support following

   functions; classifier(CF), service function forwarder (SFF), and
   inter boundary node(IBN).  (Details of CF, SFF and IBN are described
   in SFC documents; [RFC7665], [I-D.ietf-sfc-hierarchical].)

5.1.2.  Control/Management Planes Aspects

5.1.2.1.  Interfaces to Controllers or Operation Systems

   SLG MUST have interface to its controller or operation systems for
   set parameters related to the data plane functions described in
   Section 5.1.1.  In addition, an SLG at the edges of E2E-NSs MUST have
   interfaces to authentication servers.

5.1.2.2.  Address Resolution/Routing

   An SLG MUST support address resolution or routing mechanisms to
   connect to underlay network elements including routers or L2
   switches.

5.1.2.3.  Authentication Authorization Accounting (AAA)

   For preventing entry of irregular traffic to NSs, an SLG at the edge
   of E2E-NS MUST support AAA mechanism for incoming traffic.  Also,
   when an SLG connects to another SLG in other administrative domain,
   SLGs should have a mechanism to confirm that the connection is
   established with the regular processes.  For example, an SLG is
   required to support authentication of the opponent SLG with key
   information indicated from higher-level operation systems.

5.1.2.4.  Operation Administration and Maintenance(OAM)

   In management of NSs, OAM or monitoring mechanisms for both underlay
   and overlay networks is required for SLGs.  For an underlay network,
   an SLG MUST have OAM functions to confirm connectivity to
   interconnect equipment.  For an overlay network, an SLG MUST have OAM
   functions to confirm connectivity to the some node on the same NS,
   and measure the traffic amount of flowing packets on each NS.

5.2.  Management of Services on NS (*Optional)

5.2.1.  Data Plane Aspect

5.2.1.1.  Identification/Classification

   In NSaaS, some NS tenants may need delivery of an individual service
   to each user, device, or application on the same NS.  For such
   service deliveries, an SLG might be required to identify and classify
   user traffic based on some information such as subscriber ID or



Homma, et al.           Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-coms-slice-gateway           March 2018


   payload of data packets.  Also, an SLG should be controllable from
   the NS tenant.

5.2.1.2.  QoS Control

   An NS accommodates several communication devices and SLGs might be
   required to have fair queueing mechanisms for maintaining service
   quality of each user.  Also, different types of service traffic that
   have different priorities might coexist on an NS.  For example, some
   NS providers might provide telephone and internet access services to
   their users with an NS.  In such cases, SLG might be required to
   provide QoS control mechanisms for enforcing priority control based
   on service priorities.

   These QoS controls are executed depending on the information of inner
   packets and are independent of isolation mechanisms as
   infrastructure.  An SLG might be required to have a hierarchical QoS
   control mechanism in case that both QoS controls for services over
   NSs and isolation between NSs are required.

5.2.1.3.  Steering/Service Chaining(Cooperation with VNFs)

   SLG might be required to support steering or service chaining
   function for conveying data packets to the appropriate network
   functions deployed on an NS based on the classification result and
   user's contract information.

5.2.2.  Control/Management Planes Aspects

5.2.2.1.  Interfaces to Service Management Systems

   An SLG might have interfaces to controllers for managing user
   policies on each NS.  Some controllers might be deployed on the same
   NS.  If some controllers are located at external networks, they might
   require SLGs to have APIs.

5.2.2.2.  Collection of Telemetry information

   In an NSaaS, collection of telemetry information of each NS might be
   required for understanding traffic usage.  Thus, an SLG might be
   required to support to collect and report telemetry information of
   connected NSs.

6.  Deployment of SLG

   This section describes considerations related with deployment of
   SLGs.

6.1.  Examples of Components Required to Maintain SLG Functions

   For providing E2E-NSs on existing network infrastructures, some
   components located at boundaries of domains are required to have the
   same set of functionality as an SLG.  Examples of such components in
   each domain type are described below.

   Fixed Network:  CPE/HGW, Service Edge, Gateway Router, etc.

   Mobile Network:  User Equipment, Radio-AP, eNodeB, S/P-GW
      ([LTE-Specs]), etc.

   Data Center:  Gateway Router, L2 switch, ToR switch, Server, etc.

6.2.  SLG Types Depending on Locations on NS

   There are mainly three types of SLG for creating E2E-NS across
   multiple administrative domains.  The requirements of each SLG type
   are listed in Appendix B.

6.2.1.  Edge SLG(E-SLG)

   This is located at an edge of an E2E-NS, and supports identification,
   classification and authentication of user traffic in addition to
   fundamental SLG functions, such as transport and isolation.  Also, it
   might be required to have capabilities for services delivered on an
   NS.

6.2.2.  Inter-Subnet SLG(IS-SLG)

   This is located between NS subnets within a single administrative
   domain and has only fundamental functions.  It is not necessarily
   required if a common transport mechanism in all domains is used.

6.2.3.  Inter-Domain SLG(ID-SLG)

   This is located between NS subnets established on different domains.
   It supports authentication for connecting to the opponent SLG in
   addition to fundamental functions.

6.3.  Horizontal Connection

   The connection form of an SLG varies depending on which type it is.
   Examples of horizontal connection forms of each SLG type are
   described below.

   E-SLG:  An E-SLG accommodates several hosts and NS subnets.  This has
      a forwarding table of end hosts and insert their packets to the

      appropriate NS subnet.  An overview of this connection is shown in

6.4.  Vertical Connection

   There are two patterns of vertical connection of SLGs in the middle
   of E2E-NSs.  The first pattern is that the SLGs accommodate only a
   set of NS subnets, which are composition of the same E2E-NS.  In this
   pattern, such SLGs are not required to support NS subnet selection,
   however, establishment of a new SLG is required when a new E2E-NS is
   created.  This might causes extra overheads because of deploying many
   SLGs.

   The other pattern is that such SLGs are acceptable to accommodate
   multiple NS subnets from each domain.  In this pattern, SLGs are
   support NS subnet selection.  On the other hand, this pattern can
   restrain the number of SLGs.  Also, it is easy to provide transit of
   data packets from an NS subnet to other subnet on the same domain.

   The overviews of these patterns are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9.

6.5.  Software vs. Hardware

   An SLG can be created as either a software or hardware function.  NSs
   are virtual networks created depending on requests from external NS
   tenants, and thus software would be more compatible with usage for
   NSs in terms of flexibility or manageability.  Moreover, it enables
   to increase or decrease for each function if SLG is composed of
   combination of several components.  However, it is difficult to
   provide high performance or sufficient throughput for carrier-grade
   networks with software function.  In addition, it would be difficult
   to implement sufficient QoS control mechanisms with general servers,
   because they requires special hardware structures.

   On the other hand, hardware appliances are able to provide high
   throughput compared with software.  However, they are inflexible in
   terms of provisioning.

   From the above considerations, operators should prepare SLG in
   appropriate ways depending on their usages or locations.

7.  Interconnection between NS subnets

   SLG provides interconnectivity between NS subnets.  The concept and
   fundamental framework including the related NS information model are
   described in subnets interconnection document
   ([I-D.defoy-coms-subnet-interconnection]).

   This section is focused on interconnection between NS subnets
   established on different administrative domains, and describes
   considerations related to this condition.

7.1.  Pre-arrangement of transport protocols

   For interconnection between different administrative NS subnets, pre-
   arrangement of the transport protocol, which is used to connect
   between SLGs is required.  Orchestration systems indicate the
   protocol and configuration to each SLG.

7.2.  Quality Assurance between SLGs

   In addition to establishing connection, quality control of
   communication is important.  SLGs of egress side should execute
   traffic shaping to prevent some NSs from excessively occupying the
   link between SLGs.  Moreover, some SLGs are connected to several
   other SLGs that are deployed on the different locations.  Therefore
   SLGs of the ingress side should execute traffic policing to avoid
   excessive inflow of traffic into some NSs.  The parameters for these
   controls are pre-configured by orchestration systems.



Homma, et al.           Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-coms-slice-gateway           March 2018


   The above approaches are ones of the simplest ways to provide quality
   assurance of inter-administrative subnets.  If there is stricter
   isolation request, more considerations would be required.

7.3.  Secure Interconnection

   For connecting networks of different administrators, secure
   interconnection schemes are required.  Especially, in an NSaaS,
   networks might be connected to several networks, and schemes for
   ensuring secure connectivity would be more important.

   SLGs confirm whether the opponent SLG is regular when it requests to
   connect, and reject the request if the SLG is not regular.  In some
   cases, SLGs might be confirm whether the inner packets received from
   the other SLGs are sent from regular users.

8.  Security Considerations

   Requirements and considerations for SLG related to security are
   described in Section 5 and Section 7.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
