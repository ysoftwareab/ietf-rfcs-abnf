Abstract 

   This document defines a new security precondition for the Session 
   Description Protocol precondition framework described in RFC 3312.  
   A security precondition can be used to delay session establishment 
   or modification until media stream security has been negotiated 
   successfully.

1. Notational Conventions 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].   

2. Introduction 

   RFC 3312 defines the concept of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
   [SDP] precondition, which is a condition that has to be satisfied 
   for a given media stream in order for session establishment or 
   modification to proceed.  When the precondition is not met, session 
   progress is delayed until the precondition is satisfied, or the 
   session establishment fails.  For example, RFC 3312 defines the 
   Quality of Service precondition, which is used to ensure 
   availability of network resources prior to establishing (i.e. 
   alerting) a call.   

   Media streams can either be provided in cleartext and with no 
   integrity checks, or some kind of media security can be applied, 
   e.g. confidentiality and/or message integrity.  For example, the 
   Audio/Video profile of the Real-Time Transfer protocol (RTP) 
   [RFC3551] is normally used without any security services whereas the 
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [SRTP] is always used 
   with security services.  When media stream security is being 
   negotiated, e.g. using the mechanism defined in SDP Security 
   Descriptions [SDESC], both the offerer and the answerer need to know 
   the cryptographic parameters being used for the media stream; the 
   offerer may provide multiple choices for the cryptographic 
   parameters, or the cryptographic parameters selected by the answerer 
   may differ from those of the offerer (e.g. the key used in one 
   direction versus the other).  In such cases, to avoid clipping, the 
   offerer must receive the answer prior to receiving any media packets 
   from the answerer.  This can be achieved by using a security 
   precondition, which is used to ensure the successful negotiation of

   media stream security prior to session establishment or 
   modification.  

3. Security Precondition Definition  

   The security precondition type is defined by the string "sec" and 
   hence we modify the grammar found in RFC 3312 as follows: 

     precondition-type  =  "sec" | "qos" | token 

   RFC 3312 defines support for two kinds of status types, namely 
   segmented and end-to-end.  The security precondition-type defined 
   here MUST be used with the end-to-end status type; use of the 
   segmented status type is undefined.  

   An entity that wishes to delay session establishment or modification 
   until media stream security has been established uses the security 
   precondition-type in an offer.  When a security precondition is 
   received in an offer, session establishment or modification MUST be 
   delayed until the security precondition has been met, i.e. 
   parameters for a secure media stream are known to have been 
   negotiated in the direction(s) required.  A secure media stream is 
   here defined as a media stream that uses some kind of security 
   service, e.g. message integrity, confidentiality or both, regardless 
   of the cryptographic strength of the mechanisms being used.   

     As an extreme example of this, Secure RTP (SRTP) using the NULL 
     encryption algorithm and no message authentication/integrity would 
     satisfy the above whereas use of plain RTP would not.  Note 
     though, that use of SRTP without authentication is discouraged.  

   The direction tags defined in RFC 3312 are interpreted as follows: 

   * send:  Media stream security negotiation is at a stage where it is 
     possible to send secure media packets to the other party and the 
     other party will be able to process them correctly.  The 
     definition of "media packets" includes all packets that make up 
     the media stream.  In the case of Secure RTP for example, it 
     includes SRTP as well as SRTCP.  

   * recv:  Media stream security negotiation is at a stage where it is 
     possible to receive and correctly process secure media stream 
     packets sent by the other party.   

   The precise criteria for determining when the other party is able to 
   correctly process secure media stream packets depends on the secure 
   media stream protocol being used as well as the mechanism by which 
   the required cryptographic parameters are negotiated.  We here 
   provide details for SRTP negotiated through SDP security 
   descriptions [SDESC].

   When the offerer requests the "send" security precondition, it needs 
   to receive the answer before the security precondition is satisfied.  
   The reason for this is twofold.  First, the offerer needs to know 
   where to send the media to.  Secondly, in the case where alternative 
   cryptographic parameters are offered, the offerer needs to know 
   which set was selected.  The answerer does not know when the answer 
   is actually received by the offerer (which in turn will satisfy the 
   precondition), and hence the answerer needs to use the confirm-
   status attribute [RFC3312].  This will make the offerer generate a 
   new offer showing the updated status of the precondition.  

   When the offerer requests the "recv" security precondition, it also 
   needs to receive the answer before the security precondition is 
   satisfied.  The reason for this is straightforward: The answer 
   contains the cryptographic parameters that will be used by the 
   answerer for sending media to the offerer.  

   If it is not possible to satisfy a mandatory security precondition, 
   e.g. because the offer does not include any parameters related to 
   establishing a secure media stream, the offer MUST be rejected as 
   described in RFC 3312.  Optional security preconditions MUST be 
   rejected.  

4. Examples 

   The call flow of Figure 1 shows a basic session establishment using 
   the Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] and SDP security descriptions 
   [SDESC] with security descriptions for the secure media stream (SRTP 
   in this case).  The SDP descriptions of this example are shown below 
   - we have omitted the details of the SDP security descriptions as 
   well as any SIP details for clarity of the security precondition 
   described here:

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2004 




   SDP1: A includes a mandatory end-to-end security precondition for 
   both the send and receive direction in the initial offer as well as 
   a "crypto" attribute (see [SDESC]), which includes keying material 
   that can be used by A to generate media packets.  Since B does not 
   know any of the security parameters yet, the current status (see RFC 
   3312) is set to "none".  A's local status table (see RFC 3312) for 
   the security precondition is as follows: 

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 

   and the resulting offer SDP is: 

     m=audio 20000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:sec e2e none 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:foo... 

   SDP2: When B receives the offer and generates an answer, B knows the 
   (send and recv) security parameters of both A and B.  However, A 
   does not know B's security parameters, so the current status of B's 
   "send" security precondition (which equal A's "recv" security 
   precondition) is "no".  Similarly, A does not know any of B's SDP 
   information, so B's "send" security precondition is also "no".  B's 
   local status table therefore looks as follows:  

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    no    |   mandatory      |    no 


   B requests A to confirm when A knows the security parameters used in 
   the send and receive direction and hence the resulting answer SDP 
   becomes:  

     m=audio 30000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:sec e2e none 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=conf:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:bar... 

   SDP3: When A receives the answer, A updates its local status table 
   based on the rules in RFC 3312.  A knows the security parameters of 




Andreasen, Baugher, Wing                                      [Page 5] 

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2004 


   both the send and receive direction and hence A's local status table 
   is updated as follows: 

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    yes 


   Since B requested confirmation of the send and recv security 
   preconditions, and both are now satisfied, A immediately sends an 
   updated offer (3) to B showing that the security preconditions are 
   satisfied: 

     m=audio 20000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=crypto:foo... 

   SDP4:  Upon receiving the updated offer, B updates its local status 
   table based on the rules in RFC 3312 which yields the following: 

       Direction |  Current | Desired Strength |  Confirm  
      -----------+----------+------------------+---------- 
         send    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 
         recv    |    yes   |   mandatory      |    no 

   B responds with an answer (4) which contains the current status of 
   the security precondition (i.e., sendrecv) from B's point of view: 

     m=audio 30000 RTP/SAVP 0 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:sec e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:sec mandatory e2e sendrecv 

   B's local status table indicates that all mandatory preconditions 
   have been satisfied, and hence session establishment resumes; B 
   returns a 180 (Ringing) response (5) to indicate alerting.  

5. Security Considerations 

   In addition to the general security for preconditions provided in 
   RFC 3312, the following security issues, which are specific to 
   security preconditions, should be considered.  

   Security preconditions delay session establishment until 
   cryptographic parameters required to send and/or receive media have 
   been negotiated.  Negotiation of such parameters can fail for a 
   variety of reasons, including policy preventing use of certain 
   cryptographic algorithms, keys, and other security parameters.  If 



Andreasen, Baugher, Wing                                      [Page 6] 

INTERNET-DRAFT           Security Preconditions          October, 2004 


   intermediaries can remove security preconditions or downgrade the 
   strength from an offer/answer exchange, they can therefore cause 
   user alerting for session that will abandoned, which is likely to 
   cause inconvenience to the called party.  Similarly, security 
   preconditions can be used to prevent clipping due to race conditions 
   between an offer/answer exchange and secure media stream packets 
   based on that offer/answer exchange.  If intermediaries can remove 
   or downgrade the strength of security preconditions from an 
   offer/answer exchange, they can cause clipping to occur in the 
   associated secure media stream.   

   Conversely, intermediaries may also add security preconditions to 
   offers that do not contain them or increase their strength.  This in 
   turn may lead to session failure or delayed session establishment 
   that was not desired.  

   Use of integrity mechanisms can prevent all of the above problems.  
   Where intermediaries on the signaling path are trusted, it is 
   sufficient to only use hop-by-hop integrity protection, e.g. IPSec 
   or TLS.  In all other cases, end-to-end integrity protection, e.g. 
   S/MIME, MUST be used.  

6. IANA Considerations  

   IANA is hereby requested to register a RFC 3312 precondition type 
   called "sec" with the name "Security precondition".  The reference 
   for this precondition type is the current document.  

7. Acknowledgements 

   The security precondition was defined in earlier draft versions of 
   RFC 3312.  RFC 3312 contains an extensive list of people who worked 
   on those earlier draft versions which are acknowledged here as well.  
   Thanks to Paul Kyzivat who optimized the example message flow.
