1. Introduction

   This document describes on a high level how the various types of VPN
   services (L3VPN [L3VPN], L2VPN [L2VPN], VPLS[VPLS]) can support
   multicast and broadcast delivery between sites of a VPN.

   For the VPLS service, broadcast capabilities are of high importance
   because of the flooding phase of self-learning bridges.

   This document does not propose a single solution, it describes the
   requirements for the (Service Provider) SP, the scaling properties
   and the applicability of multiple solutions.  The solutions that are
   considered are a superset of the solutions described in [ROSEN].

   Section 6 explains how point-to-multipoint trees can be created
   without the need of IP multicast routing in the SP network.


2. Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture. In this document "VPN"
   means any of the VPN models: L3VPN, L2VPN or VPLS.  Following
   assumptions apply:

   - the L2PE devices are only present in the case of VPLS and can
   coincide with the PE devices.

   - a PE can have zero or more downstream L2PEs leading to a certain
   VPN.

   - an L2PE can have zero or more downstream CEs belonging to a certain
   VPN.

   - for a certain VPN, a CE has only one upstream PE/L2PE (this is a
   limitation compared to the reference architecture in the framework
   document).

   - for a certain VPLS, L2PE uses only one upstream PE ([L2PE]).

   For traffic flowing from CE3 to CE1 we will call CE3 the 'Ingress CE'
   and CE1 the 'Egress CE'.  And similarly, PE2 will be named the
   'Ingress PE' and PE1 the 'Egress PE'.

   The network of Figure 1 also acts as the example network throughout
   this document.  We assume that the sites CE1 to CE6 belong to the
   same VPN, let's call it VPNi. In VPNi several multicast groups can
   exist.  The number of groups in VPNi is N_Gi.  For one of these
   groups, let's call it Gij, the sites at CE3 and CE5 contain one or
   more senders.  In the sites connected to CE4 and CE6 there are no
   receivers for Gij.

   Table 1 shows the parameters that are used in this document.

3. Where to replicate?

   The replication of multicast and broadcast packets can happen in
   several locations of the VPN reference architecture: CE, PE (L2PE) or
   P routers.


3.1. CE

   The CE connected to the source of the multicast packet replicates the
   packet: one copy for every CE interested in the packet.  CEs are
   multicast routing neighbors.  The sites (including the CEs) are
   multicast-enabled and do further replication if there are multiple



Ooms, et al.              Expires August 2002                   [Page 4]

Internet Draft   draft-ooms-ppvpn-mcast-overview-00.txt    February 2002


   receivers inside a site.  In this approach, the SP doesn't need any
   multicast-aware boxes.

   Since the current L2VPN model provides point-to-point connectivity,
   the replication happens in the CE (or even more upstream in the
   site).

   Replication in the CE can also be obtained in L3VPNs and VPLSs if the
   CEs create tunnels between each other to carry multicast traffic
   (which is an extra task for the network manager of the customer
   network).  This results in a multicast overlay network.

   - For a L3VPN this means that the SP is involved in the VPN's unicast
   routing, but not in its multicast routing.

   - For a VPLS it means that the SP is involved in learning unicast
   routes, but not in learning multicast routes by e.g. snooping PIM-SM
   ([PIM-SM]) or IGMP messages ([IGMP-SNOOP]). Basically, the VPLS-
   bridge will not encounter any multicast packet since these are
   encapsulated in unicast.  However, this replication in the CE does
   not remove the need of the PE (L2PE) to broadcast packets during the
   flooding phase.

   The disavantage of replication in the CE is the wasted bandwidth on
   the access link between sending CE and Ingress PE.

3.2. PE

   If the replication is done by PEs, one can distinguish two variants:

   1) Both Ingress and Egress PE replicate: the Ingress PE sends a copy
   to every Egress PE (that has receivers) and the Egress PE further
   replicates to every CE (that has receivers).

   2) Only the Ingress PE is replicating, so it has to send a copy to
   every CE (that has receivers).

   For L3VPNs the first variant is described in [ROSEN section 4].  The
   SP network looks like an NBMA network and the PEs are neighbors in
   the customer's multicast routing.

   To outsource the replication of data to the PE, a L2VPN could create
   a dedicated circuit (DLCI, VPI/VCI) between CE and Ingress PE to
   carry all multicast and broadcast traffic.  The Ingress PE of a L2VPN
   has an LSP to every Egress CE, soit can obtain the behavior of the
   second variant by broadcasting the data received on the dedicated
   circuit to all LSPs.  If the PE of the L2VPN is able to e.g. snooping
   IP multicast routing messages it could perform a more selective



Ooms, et al.              Expires August 2002                   [Page 5]

Internet Draft   draft-ooms-ppvpn-mcast-overview-00.txt    February 2002


   replication for IP multicast data.  To obtain the behavior of the
   first variant, the Egress PE must be able to easily detect which
   packets possibly need replication in the Egress PE, so an extra label
   per triplet (PEi, PEj, VPNk) is needed (L2VPNs create labels per
   (CEi, CEj, VPNk)).

   As long as a PE in a VPLS hasn't learned the path for a (unicast or
   multicast) destination, it will flood the packet to all other PEs
   (variant 1).  If the PE is able to learn multicast paths (by e.g.
   multicast routing snooping) it can perform a more selective
   replication for packets with an Ethernet multicast address.

3.2.1. L2PE

   In a VPLS the PE function might be split over a L2PE and a PE.  If
   the replication happens in the L2PE, the L2PE should do the snooping.
   If the PEs are replicating then a dedicated LSP for 'multicast' data
   is needed between L2PE and PE.  The latter LSP could also be used for
   unicast packets with non-learned paths.


3.3. P routers

   In the previous sections no new state (tunnel) was created in the P
   routers to carry multicast traffic.  The methods in this section will
   create new point-to-multipoint LSPs in the SP network to carry
   multicast and broadcast traffic.

   These new point-to-multipoint can be created for various flow
   granularities (FECs), i.e. various combinations of source and
   destination addresses.  Table 2 gives an overview.

3.3.1. Tree per VPN

   Only one tree per VPN is used.  The tree connects all PEs that belong



Ooms, et al.              Expires August 2002                   [Page 6]

Internet Draft   draft-ooms-ppvpn-mcast-overview-00.txt    February 2002


   to a VPN (so it is in fact a broadcast distribution tree).  This tree
   can be a bidirectional PIM-SM [BIDIR] tree or a shared PIM-SM tree
   [PIM-SM].  The tree will carry all multicast traffic of the VPN to
   all PEs (also to PEs that belong to the VPN, but don't have
   downstream receivers for the group).

   For L3VPNs this approach is described in [ROSEN section 2].

   Application to VPLSs is straightforward, since it is simply a matter
   of putting all packets that have non-learned paths on this
   distribution tree (both unicast and multicast packets).  There is no
   need for the Ingress PE to learn multicast paths because multicast
   packets are always put on this single distribution tree.  To enable
   early filtering of non-wanted multicast packets, an Egress PE could
   learn the multicast paths.

   A L2VPN can use such a tree by bringing all data that should be
   multicasted or broadcasted via a dedicated circuit to the Ingress PE.
   The Egress PE should replicate the data received from the tree to all
   connected CEs.  To enable early filtering of non-wanted multicast
   packets, an Egress PE could learn which Egress CEs have receivers.

   The advantage of this approach is that only one tree is created.  The
   disadvantage is that bidirectional trees are not part of the base
   specification of PIM-SM and that shared tree do not combine well with
   MPLS ([MPLS-MC], [ROSEN]: shared tree requires an extra GRE
   encapsulation).

3.3.2. Tree per (PE, VPN)

   In this approach N_PEi source trees are created per VPN.  These trees
   can be created by ASM PIM-SM, SSM-only PIM-SM or a simple extension
   to existing MPLS signaling protocols (see section 6).  Using source
   trees has the additional advantage that the mapping of source trees
   onto point-to-multipoint LSPs is straightforward ([MPLS-MC]).

3.3.3. Tree per (sending PE, VPN)

   To limit the number of source trees one could only construct source
   trees for Ingress PEs that have sources.  Whether a PE has a
   multicast source could be communicated via BGP to the peer PEs.  BGP
   itself could get this information by configuration or by a mechanism
   that discovers whether there are sources active for any group.

3.3.4. Tree per group

   The approaches in section 3.3.1 to 3.3.3 have the disadvantage that
   data is also delivered to Egress PEs that have no interest in the

Internet Draft   draft-ooms-ppvpn-mcast-overview-00.txt    February 2002


   data.

   In this approach only PEs that have receivers for a group are
   connected to the distribution tree, which is a bidirectional or a
   shared tree.

   For L3VPNs this approach is described in [ROSEN section 3].

   To apply this to L2VPNs or VPLSs the Egress PEs have to learn whether
   they have downstream receivers for a certain group. In case they have
   downstream receivers they should join the distribution tree for this
   group.

   The disadvantage is that a tree for every group of every VPN is
   created in the SP network, which is a scaling issue.

   When there are many groups in a VPN and N_PEi is not too large, one
   could consider to create a tree for every possible combination of PEs
   belonging to VPNi.

3.3.5. Tree per (PE, group)

   See parts of 3.3.4 and 3.3.2.

3.3.6. Tree per (sending PE, group)

   See parts of 3.3.4 and 3.3.3.

3.3.7. Tree for some (sending PE, group)

   To further tune the number of trees one could consider to create only
   trees in the SP network for high bandwidth flows, this would require
   an additional mechanism to detect the highly active (source, group)
   couples.


4. SP requirements for each approach

   The various approaches pose different requirements to the network of
   the Service Provider.  Table 3 gives an overview of which features
   are required for which approach.

5.1. Link usage in SP network

   Table 4 indicates the link*bandwidth product used in the SP network
   by one multicast group.

   The Chuang-Sirbu law [CHUANG] states that:

    Lm = M**0.8 Lu
   with:
    Lm: the number of links in a multicast tree
    M: the number of leaves of the tree
    Lu: the (average) number of links in a unicast path

   One can determine the link efficiency of sub-optimal approaches like
   3.2 and 3.3.1-3 by comparing it with the optimal (but less scalable)
   approaches 3.3.4-6.

   One can also determine the trade-off between 3.2 and 3.3.1-3: when is
   3.2 more efficient than 3.3.1-3 and vice versa.  The ratio of the
   link usage is:
     3.2/3.3.1-3= N_PEi**0.2 * P_R_PEij

                                 Figure 4

   As long as N_PEi is small or for larger N_PEi but with a small
   membership percentage it stays (in terms of link usage) beneficial to
   duplicate in the PE (approach 3.2).


5.2. Number of trees in the SP network

   Table 5 shows the number of trees created in the SP network by the
   N_Gi multicast groups belonging to VPNi.

                                  Table 5

   Remember that each VPNi will generate this amount of trees in the SP
   network.


5.3. CE fan-out (access link duplicates)

   Approach 3.1 will carry N_CEi*P_R_CEij (- 1) duplicate packets over
   the access link.  All other approaches don't generate duplicate
   traffic on the access link.


6. Some considerations about multicast routing

   Approaches 3.3.2-3 and 3.3.5-6 can be achieved by running multicast
   routing in the provider's network and do a mapping of IP multicast
   trees on point-to-multipoint LSPs, but another solution which doesn't
   require IP multicast in the provider's network is also possible.

   Let's have a look at the tasks performed by a multicast routing
   protocol (such as PIM-SM):

   1. Source discovery mechanism: this allows the receivers to discover
   which the sources are for a certain group.

   2. Switch-over from shared to source trees.

   3. Hop-by-hop signaling to create a tree.

   4. Creation of tree state in every router.

   Now, for the above mentioned approaches:

   1. The source PEs are already known via BGP.



Ooms, et al.              Expires August 2002                  [Page 12]

Internet Draft   draft-ooms-ppvpn-mcast-overview-00.txt    February 2002


   2. There are only source trees, so there is no need for a switch-
   over.

   3-4. These are functions that are typically also performed by MPLS.
   Since the SP network already offers (unicast) VPNs, it is already
   MPLS-enabled and thus these functions are basically available.

   Since the Ingress PE knows all Egress PEs and the Egress PE knows all
   Ingress PEs, the label distribution can be Ingress (root) or Egress
   (leaf) initiated ([CHENG], [OOMS]).

   Further, an IP multicast tree is nothing else than a point-to-
   multipoint connection, but with some limitations:

   1. The class D address has two roles:

     - connection identifier

     - the key to the 'connection table' and is in every hop the same

   In other connection-oriented protocols (e.g. MPLS) these roles are
   clearly separated:

     - the connection identifier is the FEC

     - the key to the 'connection table' is a label that can be swapped

   This means e.g. that if approach 3.3.2 is used with an MPLS extension
   one could use (PE, VPN) as the FEC (connection identifier), but when
   approach 3.3.2 is used with multicast routing an extra step is
   required to allocate a unique class D address.

   2. The IP multicast trees are always constructed along the Reverse
   Shortest Path.  Other connection-oriented protocols (like MPLS) allow
   to deviate from the shortest path, which enables goodies like Traffic
   Engineering ([CHENG], [OOMS]).


7. Security Considerations

   Security considerations will be addressed in a future revision of
   this document.
