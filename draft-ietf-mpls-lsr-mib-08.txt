1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for
   modeling a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] Label
   Switch Router (LSR).
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119, reference [RFC2119].


2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   MPLS architecture [RFC3031].  A label switched path (LSP) is
   modeled as a connection consisting of one or more incoming
   segments (in-segments) and/or one or more outgoing segments (out-
   segments) at a label switch router (LSR).  The association or
   interconnection of the in-segments and out-segments is
   accomplished by using a cross-connect.  We use the terminology
   "connection" and "LSP" interchangeably where the meaning is clear

   from the context.


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
      STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD
      16, RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is
      described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
      [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1
      and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version
      of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet
      standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in
      RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
      of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC
      1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
      protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
      RFC 1905 [RFC1905].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
      [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
      described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
   are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
   appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be
   semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are
   omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
   Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into

Internet Draft                MPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
   However, this loss of machine readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


4. Feature Checklist
   
   The MPLS label switch router MIB (LSR-MIB) is designed to satisfy
   the following requirements and constraints:
   
   -  The MIB supports both manually configured LSPs as well as those
      configured via any MPLS signaling protocol.
   
   -  The MIB supports the enabling and disabling of MPLS capability
      on MPLS capable interfaces of an LSR.
   
   -  The MIB allows resource sharing between two or more LSPs.
   
   -  Both per-platform and per-interface label spaces are supported.
   
   -  MPLS packets can be forwarded solely based on an incoming top
      label [RFC3031, RFC3032].
   
   -  Support is provided for next-hop resolution when the outgoing
      interface is a shared media interface.  In the point-to-
      multipoint case, each outgoing segment can reside on a
      different shared media interface.
   
   -  The MIB supports point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
      multipoint-to-point connections at an LSR.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections all outgoing packets can
      have the same top label.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections, the outgoing resources of
      the merged connections can be shared.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections, packets from different
      incoming connections can have distinct outgoing label stacks
      beneath the (identical) top label.
   
   -  In the point-to-multipoint case each outgoing connection can
      have a distinct label stack including the top label.
   
   -  All the members of a point-to-multipoint connection can share
      the resources allocated for the ingress segments.
   
   -  The MIB provides cross-connect capability to "pop" an incoming
      label and forward the packet with the remainder of the label
      stack unchanged and without pushing any labels ("pop-and-go")

      [RFC3032].
   
   -  The MIB supports persistent as well as non-persistent LSPs.
   
   -  Performance counters are provided for in-segments and out-
      segments as well as for measuring MPLS performance on a per-
      interface basis.


5. Outline
   
   Configuring LSPs through an LSR involves the following steps:
   
   -  Enabling MPLS on MPLS capable interfaces.
   
   -  Configuring in-segments and out-segments.
   
   -  Setting up the cross-connect table to associate segments and/or
      to indicate connection origination and termination.
   
   -  Optionally specifying label stack actions.
   
   -  Optionally specifying segment traffic parameters.


5.1.  Summary of LSR MIB
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of the
   following tables:
   
   -  The interface configuration table (mplsInterfaceConfTable),
      which is used for enabling the MPLS protocol on MPLS-capable
      interfaces.
   
   -  The in-segment (mplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (mplsOutSegmentTable) tables, which are used for configuring
      LSP segments at an LSR.
   
   -  The cross-connect table (mplsXCTable), which is used to
      associate in and out segments together, in order to form a
      cross-connect.
   
   -  The label stack table (mplsLabelStackTable), which is used for
      specifying label stack operations.
   
   -  The Traffic Parameter table (mplsTrafficParamTable), which is
      used for specifying LSP-related traffic parameters.
   
   Further, the MPLS in-segment and out-segment performance tables,
   mplsInSegmentPerfTable and mplsOutSegmentPerfTable, contain the

Internet Draft                MPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



   objects necessary to measure the performance of LSPs, and
   mplsInterfacePerfTable has objects to measure MPLS performance on
   a per-interface basis.
   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


6. Brief Description of MIB Objects
   
   Sections 6.1-6.2 describe objects pertaining to MPLS-capable
   interfaces of an LSR.  The objects described in Sections 6.3-6.8,
   were derived from the Incoming Label Map (ILM) and Next Hop Label
   Forwarding Entry (NHLFE) as specified in the MPLS architecture
   document [RFC3031]. Section 6.9 describes objects for specifying
   traffic parameters for in and out segments. It is appropriate to
   note that the in-segment, out-segment, and cross-connect tables
   were modeled after similar tables found in [RFC2515].


6.1.   mplsInterfaceConfTable
   
   This table represents the interfaces that are MPLS capable.  An
   LSR creates an entry in this table for every MPLS capable
   interface on that LSR.


6.2.  mplsInterfacePerfTable
   
   This table contains objects to measure the MPLS performance of
   MPLS capable interfaces and is an AUGMENT to
   mplsInterfaceConfTable.  High capacity counters are provided for
   objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on high-speed
   interfaces.


6.3.  mplsInSegmentTable
   
   This table contains a description of the incoming MPLS segments to
   an LSR and their associated parameters.
   
   The administrative and operational status objects for this table
   are used to control packet transmission on this segment.  If
   either the administrative and operational status objects for this
   table are set to 'down', this implies that packets will not be
   forwarded.  Likewise, if the values are set to 'up' this implies
   that packets are forwarded.  These values are particularly useful
   in cases where multi-point connections utilize a single cross-
   connect and the administrator wishes to disable some, but not all
   of the streams.  In these cases, the administrator may set the
   administrative status object to 'down' on some of the in-segments.

Internet Draft                MPLS LSR MIB               January 2002





6.4.  mplsInSegmentPerfTable
   
   The MPLS In-Segment Performance Table has objects to measure the
   performance of an incoming segment configured on an LSR.  It is an
   AUGMENT to mplsInSegmentTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
   high-speed interfaces.


6.5.  mplsOutSegmentTable
   
   The Out-Segment Table contains a description of the outgoing MPLS
   segments at an LSR and their associated parameters.
   
   The administrative and operational status objects for this table
   are used to control packet transmission on this segment.  If
   either the administrative and operational status objects are set
   to 'down', this implies that packets will not be forwarded.
   Likewise, if the values are set to 'up' this implies that packets
   are forwarded.  These values are particularly useful in cases
   where multicast connections utilize a single cross-connect and the
   administrator wishes to disable some, but not all of the streams.
   In these cases, the administrator may set the administrative
   status object to 'down' on some of the out-segments.


6.6.  mplsOutSegmentPerfTable
   
   The MPLS Out-Segment Table contains objects to measure the
   performance of an outgoing segment configured on an LSR.  It is an
   AUGMENT to mplsOutSegmentTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
   high-speed interfaces.


6.7.  mplsXCTable
   
   The mplsXCTable specifies information for associating segments
   together in order to instruct the LSR to switch between the
   specified segments.  It supports point-to-point, point-to-multi-
   point and multi-point-to-point connections.
   
   The administrative and operational status objects for this table
   imply control of packet forwarding to and from a XCEntry.  When
   the administrative and operational status objects are set to
   'down' for example, this implies that the specified XCEntry will
   not forward packets.  Likewise, when either is set to 'up' this
   implies that packets will be forwarded.

Internet Draft                MPLS LSR MIB               January 2002





6.8.  mplsLabelStackTable
   
   The mplsLabelStackTable specifies the label stack to be pushed
   onto a packet, beneath the top label.  Entries to this table are
   referred to from mplsXCTable.


6.9.  mplsTrafficParamTable
   
   The mplsTrafficParamTable contains objects for specifying the
   traffic parameters of in-segments and out-segments.  Entries in
   this table are referred to from mplsInSegmentTable and
   mplsOutSegmentTable.


7. Example of LSP Setup
   
   In this section we provide a brief example of setting up an LSP
   using the MIB objects described in section 10.  While this example
   is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is intended
   as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It is meant
   to be read after going through the MIB itself.
   
   Suppose that one would like to manually create a best-effort,
   unidirectional LSP.  Assume that the LSP enters the LSR via MPLS
   interface A with ifIndex 12 and exits the LSR via MPLS interface B
   with ifIndex 13.  Let us assume that we do not wish to have a
   label stack beneath the top label on the outgoing labeled packets.
   The following example illustrates which rows and corresponding
   objects might be created to accomplish this.
   
   First, the traffic parameter entries must be set-up for both
   segments.
   
   In mplsTrafficParamTable for the incoming direction:
   {
      mplsTrafficParamIndex           = 5
      mplsTrafficParamMaxRate         = 100000,
      mplsTrafficParamMeanRate        = 100000,
      mplsTrafficParamMaxBurstSize    = 2000,
      mplsTrafficParamRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In mplsTrafficParamTable for the outgoing direction:
   {
      mplsTrafficParamIndex           = 6
      mplsTrafficParamMaxRate         = 100000,
      mplsTrafficParamMeanRate        = 100000,



Srinivasan et al.              Expires July 2002             [Page 8]

Internet Draft                MPLS LSR MIB               January 2002



      mplsTrafficParamMaxBurstSize    = 2000,
      mplsTrafficParamRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Note that if we were setting up a bi-directional LSP, the segments
   in the reverse direction can share the traffic parameter entries
   (and hence resources) with the segments in the forward direction.
   
   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
   entries with suitable traffic parameters by pointing to the
   appropriate traffic parameter entries that we have just created.
   
   
   In mplsInSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsInSegmentIfIndex            = 12, -- incoming interface
      mplsInSegmentLabel              = 21, -- incoming label
      mplsInSegmentNPop               = 1,
      mplsInSegmentTrafficParamPtr    = mplsTrafficParamIndex.5,
      mplsInSegmentRowStatus          = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In mplsOutSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsOutSegmentIndex             = 1,
      mplsOutSegmentIfIndex           = 13, -- outgoing interface
      mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel      = true(1),
      mplsOutSegmentTopLabel          = 22, -- outgoing label
      mplsOutSegmentTrafficParamPtr   = mplsTrafficParamIndex.6,
      mplsOutSegmentRowStatus         = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Next, a cross-connect entry is created thereby associating the
   newly created segments together.
   
   In mplsXCTable:
   {
      mplsXCIndex             = 2,
      mplsXCLspId             = 'c021041502'H, -- 192.33.4.21.2
      mplsInSegmentIfIndex    = 12,
      mplsInSegmentLabel      = 21,
      mplsOutSegmentIndex     = 1,
      mplsXCIsPersistent      = false (1),
      mplsLabelStackIndex     = 0, -- only a single
                                   -- outgoing label
      mplsXCRowStatus         = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Note that the mplsInSegmentXCIndex and mplsOutSegmentXCIndex
   objects will automatically be populated with the value 2 when

   these segments are referred to from the corresponding cross-
   connect entry.


8. Application of the Interface Group to MPLS
   
   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
   
   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be
   in accordance with [RFC2863] which states that the interfaces
   table (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's
   interfaces and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of
   a network interface is considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS
   interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable.  The inter-
   relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack
   Group defined in [RFC2863].
   
   When using MPLS interfaces, the interface stack table might appear
   as follows:
      
      +----------------------------------------+
      | MPLS-interface ifType = mpls(166)      +
      +----------------------------------------+
      | Underlying Layer...                    +
      +----------------------------------------+
   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer..." refers to the ifIndex
   of any interface type, which has been defined for MPLS
   interworking.  Examples include ATM, Frame Relay, Ethernet, etc.

   follow.

9. The Use of RowPointer

   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a conceptual
   row in an SNMP Table by pointing to one of its objects. In this
   MIB, it is used in mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable
   for the following purposes. First, it indicates a particular
   traffic parameter table. An example of such a table is
   mplsTrafficParamTable. Second, it is used to indicate a specific
   instance of a traffic parameter entry that is associated with a
   given in-segment or out-segment entry. In the in-segment and out-
   segment tables, the trafficParamPtr SHOULD point to the first
   column of the appropriate conceptual row.

        - cross-connect index mplsXCIndex that uniquely

        - out-segment index, mplsOutSegmentIndex
       
       Originating LSPs:
        These are represented by using the special
        combination of values mplsInSegmentIfIndex=0 and
        mplsInSegmentLabel=0 as indexes.  In this case the
        mplsOutSegmentIndex MUST be non-zero.

        mplsOutSegmentIndex=0 as index.

11.   Security Considerations
   
   It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful for monitoring of
   MPLS LSRs.  This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results.
   
   At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond
   those that SNMP Security [RFC2571] is itself intended to address.
   These relate to primarily controlled access to sensitive
   information and the ability to configure a device - or which might
   result from operator error, which is beyond the scope of any
   security architecture.
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB which
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations.  The use of SNMP Version 3 is recommended
   over prior versions, for configuration control, as its security
   model is improved.
   
   SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are by themselves not a secure environment.  Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec
   [RFC2401]), there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB.  It is recommended that the implementers
   consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3

   framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model
   [RFC2574] and the View-based Access Control [RFC2575] is
   recommended.  It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure
   that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is
   properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.
   
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in
   that they represent a customer's interface to the MPLS network.
   Allowing uncontrolled access to these objects could result in
   malicious and unwanted disruptions of network traffic or incorrect
   configurations for these customers.  There are no objects that are
   particularly sensitive in their own right, such as passwords or
   monetary amounts.
