          FETCH & PATCH with Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)
                     draft-ietf-core-senml-etch-07

Abstract

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type and data model can be
   used to send collections of resources, such as batches of sensor data
   or configuration parameters.  The CoAP FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH
   methods enable accessing and updating parts of a resource or multiple
   resources with one request.  This document defines new media types
   for the CoAP FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH methods for resources
   represented with the SenML data model.

1.  Introduction

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type [RFC8428] and data
   model can be used to transmit collections of resources, such as
   batches of sensor data or configuration parameters.

   An example of a SenML collection is shown below:

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850", "vb":true},
    {"n":"5851", "v":42},
    {"n":"5750", "vs":"Ceiling light"}
   ]

   Here three resources "3311/0/5850", "3311/0/5851", and "3311/0/5750",
   of an IPSO dimmable light smart object [IPSO] are represented using a
   single SenML Pack with three SenML Records.  All resources share the
   same base name "2001:db8::2/3311/0/", hence full names for resources
   are "2001:db8::2/3311/0/5850", etc.

   The CoAP [RFC7252] FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH methods [RFC8132] enable
   accessing and updating parts of a resource or multiple resources with
   one request.

Internet-Draft          FETCH & PATCH with SenML              March 2020


   This document defines two new media types, one using the JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON) [RFC8259] and one using the Concise Binary
   Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049], which can be used with the
   CoAP FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH methods for resources represented with
   the SenML data model (i.e., for both SenML and Sensor Streaming
   Measurement Lists (SenSML) data).  The rest of the document uses term
   "(i)PATCH" when referring to both methods as the semantics of the new
   media types are the same for the CoAP PATCH and iPATCH methods.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed
   in [RFC8132] and [RFC8428].  The following additional terms are used
   in this document:

   Fetch Record:  One set of parameters that is used to match SenML
      Record(s).

   Fetch Pack:  One or more Fetch Records in an array structure.

   Patch Record:  One set of parameters similar to Fetch Record but also
      containing instructions on how to change existing SenML Pack(s).

   Patch Pack:  One or more Patch Records in an array structure.

   Target Record:  A Record in a SenML Pack that matches the selection
      criteria of a Fetch or Patch Record and hence is a target for a
      Fetch or Patch operation.

   Target Pack:  A SenML Pack that is a target for a Fetch or Patch
      operation.

   (i)PATCH:  A term that refers to both CoAP "PATCH" and "iPATCH"
      methods when there is no difference in this specification in which
      one is used.

3.  Using FETCH and (i)PATCH with SenML

   The FETCH/(i)PATCH media types for SenML are modeled as extensions to
   the SenML media type to enable re-use of existing SenML parsers and
   generators, in particular on constrained devices.  Unless mentioned




Keranen & Mohajer      Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          FETCH & PATCH with SenML              March 2020


   otherwise, FETCH and PATCH Packs are constructed with the same rules
   and constraints as SenML Packs.

   The key differences to the SenML media type are allowing the use of a
   "null" value for removing records with the (i)PATCH method and lack
   of value fields in Fetch Records.  Also the Fetch and Patch Records
   do not have default time or base version when the fields are omitted.

3.1.  SenML FETCH

   The FETCH method can be used to select and return a subset of
   records, in sequence, of one or more SenML Packs.  The SenML Records
   are selected by giving a set of names that, when resolved, match
   resolved names in a Target SenML Pack.  The names for a Fetch Pack
   are given using the SenML "name" and/or "base name" fields.  The
   names are resolved by concatenating the base name with the name field
   as defined in [RFC8428].

   A Fetch Pack MUST contain at least one Fetch Record.  A Fetch Record
   MUST contain a name and/or a base name field.

   For example, to select the IPSO resources "5850" and "5851" from the
   example in Section 1, the following Fetch Pack can be used:

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850"},
    {"n":"5851"}
   ]

   The result to a FETCH request with the example above would be:

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850", "vb":true},
    {"n":"5851", "v":42},
   ]

   The SenML time and unit fields can be used in a Fetch Record to
   further narrow the selection of matched SenML Records.  When no time
   or unit is given in a Fetch Record, all SenML Records with the given
   name are matched (i.e., unlike with SenML Records, lack of time field
   in a Fetch Record does not imply time value zero).  When time is
   given in the Fetch Record, only the SenML Records (if any) with equal
   resolved time value and name are matched.  Similarly, when unit is
   given, only the SenML Records with equal resolved unit and name are
   matched.  If both time and unit are given in the Fetch Record, both
   MUST to match for the SenML Record to match.  Each Target Record MUST
   be included in the response at most once, even if multiple Fetch
   Records match with the same Target Record.

Internet-Draft          FETCH & PATCH with SenML              March 2020


   For example, if the IPSO resource "5850" would have multiple sensor
   readings (SenML Records) with different time values, the following
   Fetch Pack can be used to retrieve the Record with time
   "1.276020091e+09":

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850", "t":1.276020091e+09}
   ]

   The resolved form of records (Section 4.6 of [RFC8428]) is used when
   comparing the names, times, and units of the Target and Fetch Records
   to accommodate for differences in use of the base values.  In
   resolved form the SenML name in the example above becomes
   "2001:db8::2/3311/0/5850".  Since there is no base time in the Pack,
   the time in resolved form is equal to the time in the example.

   If no SenML Records match, empty SenML Pack (i.e., array with no
   elements) is returned as a response.

   Fetch Records MUST NOT contain other fields than name, base name,
   time, base time, unit, and base unit.  Implementations MUST reject
   and generate an error for a Fetch Pack with other fields.  [RFC8132]
   Section 2.2 provides guidance for FETCH request error handling, e.g.,
   using the 4.22 (Unprocessable Entity) CoAP error response code.

3.2.  SenML (i)PATCH

   The (i)PATCH method can be used to change the fields of SenML
   Records, to add new Records, and to remove existing Records.  The
   names, times, and units of the Patch Records are given and matched in
   same way as for the Fetch Records, except each Patch Record MUST
   match at most one Target Record.  A Patch Record matching more than
   one Target Record is considered invalid (patching multiple Target
   Records with one Patch Record would result in multiple copies of the
   same record).  Patch Packs can also include new values and other
   SenML fields for the Records.  Application of Patch Packs is
   idempotent; hence PATCH and iPATCH methods for SenML Packs are
   equivalent.

   When the name in a Patch Record matches with the name in an existing
   Record, the resolved time values and units (if any) are compared.  If
   the time values and units either do not exist in both Records or are
   equal, the Target Record is replaced with the contents of the Patch
   Record.  All Patch Records MUST contain at least a SenML Value or Sum
   field.

   If a Patch Record contains a name, or combination of a time value,
   unit, and a name, that do not exist in any existing Record in the

Internet-Draft          FETCH & PATCH with SenML              March 2020


   Pack, the given Record, with all the fields it contains, is added to
   the Pack.

   If a Patch Record has a value ("v") field with value null, it MUST
   NOT be added but the matched Record (if any) is removed from the
   Target Pack.

   The Patch Records MUST be applied in the same sequence they are in
   the Patch Pack.  If multiple Patch Packs are being processed at the
   same time, the result MUST be equivalent to applying them in one
   sequence.

   Implementations MUST reject and generate an error for Patch Packs
   with invalid Records.  If a Patch Pack is rejected, the state of the
   Target Pack is not changed, i.e., either all or none of the Patch
   Records are applied.  [RFC8132] Section 3.4 provides guidance for
   error handling with PATCH and iPATCH requests, e.g., using the 4.22
   (Unprocessable Entity) and 4.09 (Conflict) CoAP error response codes.

   For example, the following document could be given as an (i)PATCH
   payload to change/set values of two SenML Records for the example in
   Section 1:

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850", "vb":false},
    {"n":"5851", "v":10}
   ]

   If the request is successful, the resulting representation of the
   example SenML Pack would be as follows:

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850", "vb":false},
    {"n":"5851", "v":10},
    {"n":"5750", "vs":"Ceiling light"}
   ]

   As another example, the following document could be given as an
   (i)PATCH payload to remove the two SenML Records:

   [
    {"bn":"2001:db8::2/3311/0/", "n":"5850", "v":null},
    {"n":"5851", "v":null}
   ]

Internet-Draft          FETCH & PATCH with SenML              March 2020


4.  Fragment Identification

   Fragment identification for Records of Fetch and Patch Packs uses the
   same mechanism as SenML JSON/CBOR fragment identification (see
   Section 9 of [RFC8428]), i.e., "rec" scheme followed by a comma-
   separated list of Record positions or range(s) of Records.  For
   example, to select the 3rd and 5th Record of a Fetch or Patch Pack, a
   fragment identifier "rec=3,5" can be used in the URI of the Fetch or
   Patch Pack resource.

5.  Extensibility

   The SenML mandatory to understand fields extensibility mechanism (see
   section 4.4 in [RFC8428]) does not apply to Patch Packs, i.e.,
   unknown fields MUST NOT generate an error but such fields are treated
   like any other field (e.g., added to Patch target records where
   applicable).

   This specification allows only a small subset of SenML fields in
   Fetch Records but future specifications may enable new fields for
   Fetch Records and possibly also new fields for selecting targets for
   Patch Records.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security and privacy considerations of SenML apply also with the
   FETCH and (i)PATCH methods.  CoAP's security mechanisms are used to
   provide security for the FETCH and (i)PATCH methods.

   In FETCH and (i)PATCH requests, the client can pass arbitrary names
   to the target resource for manipulation.  The resource implementer
   must take care to only allow access to names that are actually part
   of (or accessible through) the target resource.  In particular the
   receiver needs to ensure that any input does not lead to uncontrolled
   special interpretation by the system.

   If the client is not allowed to do a GET or PUT on the full target
   resource (and thus all the names accessible through it), access
   control rules must be evaluated for each record in the pack.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two new media types and CoAP Content-Format
   IDs for both media types.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA" with
   the RFC number of this document.

7.1.  CoAP Content-Format Registration

   IANA is requested to assign CoAP Content-Format IDs for the SenML
   PATCH and FETCH media types in the "CoAP Content-Formats" sub-
   registry, within the "CoRE Parameters" registry [RFC7252].  The
   assigned IDs are shown in Table 1.
