                 Circuit Style Segment Routing Policies
                  draft-schmutzer-pce-cs-sr-policy-01

Abstract

   This document describes how Segment Routing (SR) policies can be used
   to satisfy the requirements for strict bandwidth guarantees, end-to-
   end recovery and persistent paths within a segment routing network.
   SR policies satisfying these requirements are called "circuit-style"
   SR policies (CS-SR policies).

1.  Introduction

   Segment routing does allow for a single network to carry both typical
   IP (connection-less) services and connection-oriented transport
   services.  IP services required ECMP and TI-LFA, while transport
   services that normally are delivered via dedicated circuit-switched
   SONET/SDH or OTN networks do require:

   *  Persistent end2end traffic engineered paths that provide
      predictable and identical latency in both directions

   *  Strict bandwidth commitment per path to ensure no impact on the
      Service Level Agreement (SLA) due to changing network load from
      other services

   *  End2end protection (<50msec protection switching) and restoration
      mechanisms

   *  Monitoring and maintenance of path integrity

   *  Data plane remaining up while control plane is down

   Such a "transport centric" behaviour is referred to as "circuit-
   style" in this document.

   This document describes how SR policies
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] and adjacency-SIDs defined
   in the SR architecture [RFC8402] together with a stateful Path
   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC8231] can be used to satisfy those
   requirements.  It includes how end-to-end recovery and path integrity
   monitoring can be implemented.

   SR policies that satisfy those requirements are called "circuit-
   style" SR policies (CS-SR policies).

3.  Reference Model

   The reference model for CS-SR policies is following the segment
   routing architecture [RFC8402] and SR policy architecture
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] and is depicted in Figure 1.

   |       |<=========================================|       |
   +-------+                    SR-policy from Z to A +-------+

               Figure 1: Circuit-style SR Policy Architecture

   By nature of CS-SR policies, paths will be computed and maintained by
   a stateful PCE defined in [RFC8231].  When using a MPLS data plane
   [RFC8660], PCEP extensions defined in [RFC8664] will be used.  When
   using a SRv6 data plane [RFC8754], PCEP extensions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] will be used.

   In order to satisfy the requirements of CS-SR policies, each link in
   the topology MUST have:

   *  An adjacency-SID which is:

      -  Manually allocated or persistent : to ensure that its value
         does not change after a node reload

      -  Non-protected : to avoid any local TI-LFA protection to happen
         upon interface/link failures

   *  The bandwidth available for CS-SR policies

   When using a MPLS data plane [RFC8660] existing IGP extensions
   defined in [RFC8667] and [RFC8665] and BGP-LS defined in [RFC9085]
   can be used to distribute the topology information including those
   persistent and unprotected Adj-SIDs.

   When using a SRv6 data plane [RFC8754] the IGP extensions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-ospfv3-srv6-extensions] and BGP-LS extensions in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-srv6-ext] apply.

4.  CS-SR Policy Characteristics

   A CS-SR policy has the following characteristics:

   *  Requested bandwidth : bandwidth to be reserved for the CS-SR
      policy

   *  Bidirectional co-routed : a CS-SR policy between A and Z is an
      association of an SR-Policy from A to Z and an SR-Policy from Z to
      A following the same path(s)

   *  Deterministic and persistent paths : segment lists with strict
      hops using unprotected adjacency-SIDs

   *  Not automatically recomputed or reoptimized : the SID list of a
      candidate path must not change automatically (for example upon
      topology change)

   *  Multiple candidate paths in case of protection/restoration:

      -  Following the SR policy architecture, the highest preference
         valid path is carrying traffic

      -  Depending on the protection/restoration scheme (Section 7),
         lower priority candidate paths

         o  may be pre-computed

         o  may be pre-programmed

         o  may have to be disjoint

   *  Liveness and performance measurement is activated on each
      candidate path (Section 6)

5.  CS-SR Policy Creation

   A CS-SR policy between A and Z is configured both on A (with Z as
   endpoint) and Z (with A as endpoint) as shown in Figure 1.

   Both nodes A and Z act as PCC and delegate path computation to the
   PCE using the extensions defined in [RFC8664].  The PCRpt message
   sent from the headends to the PCE contains the following parameters:

   *  BANDWIDTH object (Section 7.7 of [RFC5440]) : to indicate the
      requested bandwidth





Schmutzer, et al.       Expires 8 September 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   cs-srte                      March 2022


   *  LSPA object (section 7.11 of [RFC5440]) : to indicate that no
      local protection requirements

      -  L flag set to 0 : no local protection

      -  E flag set to 1 : protection enforcement (section 5 of
         [I-D.ietf-pce-local-protection-enforcement])

   *  ASSOCIATION object ([RFC8697]) :

      -  Type : Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association
         ([I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path])

      -  Bidirectional Association Group TLV ([RFC9059]) :

         o  R flag is always set to 0 (forward path)

         o  C flag is always set to 1 (co-routed)

   If the SR-policies are configured with more than one candidate path,
   a PCEP request is sent per candidate path.  Each PCEP request does
   include the "SR Policy Association" object (type 6) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] to make the PCE aware of the
   candidate path belonging to the same policy.

   The signaling extensions described in
   [I-D.sidor-pce-circuit-style-pcep-extensions] are used to ensure that

   *  Path determinism is achieved by the PCE only using segment lists
      representing a strict hop by hop path using unprotected adjacency-
      SIDs.

   *  Path persistency across node reloads in the network is achieved by
      the PCE only including manually configured adj-SIDs in its path
      computation response.

   *  Persistency across network changes is achieved by the PCE not
      performing periodic nor network event triggered re-optimization.

   Bandwidth adjustment can be requested after initial creation by
   signaling both requested and operational bandwidth in the BANDWIDTH
   object but the PCE is not allowed to respond with a changed path.

6.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)

6.1.  Liveness

   The proper operation of each segment list is validated by both
   headends using STAMP in loopback measurement mode as described in
   section 4.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-spring-stamp-srpm].

   As the STAMP test packets are including both the segment list of the
   forward and reverse path, standard segment routing data plane
   operations will make those packets get switched along the forward
   path to the tailend and along the reverse path back to the headend.

   The headend forms the bidirectional SR Policy association using the
   procedure described in [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path] and receives the
   information about the reverse segment list from the PCE as described
   in section 4.5 of [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath]

6.2.  Performance Measurement

   The same STAMP session used for liveliness monitoring can be used to
   measure delay.  As loopback mode is used only round-trip delay is
   measured and one-way has to be derived by dividing the round-trip
   delay by two.

   The same STAMP session can also be used to estimate round-trip loss
   as described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-spring-stamp-srpm].

7.  Recovery Schemes

   Various protection and restoration schemes can be implemented.  The
   terms "protection" and "restoration" are used with same subtle
   distinctions outlined in section 1 of [RFC4872], [RFC4427] and
   [RFC3386] respectively.

   *  Protection : another candidate path is computed and fully
      established in the data plane and ready to carry traffic

   *  Restoration : a candidate path may be computed and may be
      partially established but is not ready to carry traffic

7.1.  Unprotected

   In the most basic scenario no protection nor restoration is required.
   The CS-SR policy has only one candidate path configured.  This
   candidate path is established, activated (O field in LSP object is
   set to 2) and is carrying traffic.

   In case of a failure the CS-SR policy will go down and traffic will
   not be recovered.

   Typically two CS-SR policies are deployed either within the same
   network with disjoint paths or in two completely separate networks
   and the overlay service is responsible for traffic recovery.

7.2.  1+R Restoration

   To avoid pre-allocating protection bandwidth in steady state
   (Section 7.3) but still be able to react to network failures and
   recover traffic flow in a deterministic way (maintain required
   bandwidth commitment) the CS-SR policy is configured with two
   candidate paths.

   The candidate path with higher preference is established, activated
   (O field in LSP object is set to 2) and is carrying traffic.

   The second candidate path with lower preference is only established
   and activated (O field in LSP object is set to 2) upon a failure
   impacting the first candidate path in order to send traffic over an
   alternate path through the network around the failure with
   potentially relaxed constraints but still satisfying the bandwidth
   commitment.

   The second candidate path is generally only requested from the PCE
   and activated after a failure, but may also be requested and pre-
   established during CS-SR policy creation with the downside of
   bandwidth being set aside ahead of time.

   As soon as the failure that brought the first candidate path down is
   cleared, the second candidate path is getting deactivated (O field in
   LSP object is set to 1) or torn down.  The first candidate path is
   activated (O field in LSP object is set to 2) and traffic sent across
   it.

   Restoration and reversion behavior is bidirectional.  As described in
   Section 6.1, both headends use liveness in loopback mode and
   therefore even in case of unidirectional failures both headends will
   detect the failure or clearance of the failure and switch traffic
   away from the failed or to the recovered candidate path.

7.3.  1:1 Protection

   For fast recovery against failures the CS-SR policy is configured
   with two candidate paths.  Both paths are established but only the
   candidate with higher preference is activated (O field in LSP object
   is set to 2) and is carrying traffic.  The candidate path with lower
   preference has its O field in LSP object set to 1.

   Appropriate routing of the protect path diverse from the working path
   can be requested from the PCE by using the "Disjointness Association"
   object (type 2) defined in [RFC8800] in the PCRpt messages.  The
   disjoint requirements are communicated in the "DISJOINTNESS-
   CONFIGURATION TLV"

   *  L bit set to 1 for link diversity

   *  N bit set to 1 for node diversity

   *  S bit set to 1 for SRLG diversity

   *  T bit set to enforce strict diversity

   The P bit may be set for first candidate path to allow for finding
   the best working path that does satisfy all constraints without
   considering diversity to the protect path.

   The "Objective Function (OF) TLV" as defined in section 5.3 of
   [RFC8800] may also be added to minimize the common shared resources.

   Upon a failure impacting the candidate path with higher preference
   carrying traffic, the candidate path with lower preference is
   activated immediately and traffic is now sent across it.

   Protection switching is bidirectional.  As described in Section 6.1,
   both headends will generate and receive their own loopback mode test
   packets, hence even a unidirectional failure will always be detected
   by both headends without protection switch coordination required.

   Two cases are to be considered when the failure impacting the
   candidate path with higher preference is cleared:

   *  Revertive switching : re-activate the candidate path, change O
      field from 0 to 2 and start sending traffic over it

   *  Non-revertive switching : do not activate the candidate path,
      change O field from 0 to 1, keep the second candidate path active
      with O field set to 2 and continue sending traffic over it

7.4.  1:1+R Protection

   For further resiliency in case of multiple concurrent failures that
   could affect both candidate paths in a Section 7.3 scenario the CS-SR
   policy is configured with three candidate paths with decreasing
   preference.

   The third candidate path enables restoration and will generally only
   be established, activated (O field in LSP object is set to 2) and
   carry traffic after failure(s) have impacted both the candidate path
   with highest and second highest preference.

   The third candidate path may also be requested and pre-computed
   already whenever either the first or second candidate path went down
   due to a failure with the downside of bandwidth being set aside ahead
   of time.

   As soon as failure(s) that brought either the first or second
   candidate path down is cleared the third candidate path is getting
   deactivated (O field in LSP object is set to 1), the candidate path
   that recovered is activated (O field in LSP object is set to 2) and
   traffic sent across it.

   Protection switching, restoration and reversion behavior is
   bidirectional.  As described in Section 6.1, both headends use
   liveness in loopback mode and therefore even in case of
   unidirectional failures both headends will detect the failure or
   clearance of the failure and switch traffic away from the failed or
   to the recovered candidate path.

7.5.  External Commands

   It is very common to allow operators to trigger a switch between
   candidate paths even no failure is present.  I.e. to proactively
   drain a resource for maintenance purposes.  Operator triggered
   switching between candidate paths is unidirectional and has to be
   requested on both headends.
