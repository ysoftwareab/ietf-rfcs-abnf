1.  Introduction

   S/MIME [RFC5751] is typically used to protect (sign and/or encrypt)
   Email message body parts, but not header of corresponding Email
   messages.  Header fields may contain confidential information or
   information whose validity need protecting from modification.
   [RFC5751] describes how to protect the Email message header
   [RFC5322], by wrapping the message inside a message/rfc822 container
   [RFC2045]:

      In order to protect outer, non-content-related message header
      fields (for instance, the "Subject", "To", "From", and "Cc"
      fields), the sending client MAY wrap a full MIME message in a
      message/rfc822 wrapper in order to apply S/MIME security services
      to these header fields.  It is up to the receiving client to
      decide how to present this "inner" header along with the
      unprotected "outer" header.

      When an S/MIME message is received, if the top-level protected
      MIME entity has a Content-Type of message/rfc822, it can be
      assumed that the intent was to provide header protection.  This
      entity SHOULD be presented as the top-level message, taking into
      account header merging issues as previously discussed.

   While the above advice helps in protecting message header fields, it
   doesn't provide enough guidance on what information should and should
   not be included in outer (unprotected) header and how information
   from outer and inner headers should be presented to users.
   Additionally, there are very few implementations of the header

   protection mechanism specified in [RFC5751].  Email clients that
   don't support this mechanism display messages with header protection
   as if they are forwarded email messages.  Some of them don't display
   content of forwarded messages by default (e.g. they display at
   attachment or an icon), so viewing them requires an extra action by
   the user.

   [[Alexey: Depending on WG consensus, the following text will be
   updated to either suggest and alternative approach that is friendlier
   to non compliant email clients or to reinforce use of message/rfc822
   for header protection + recommend use of the new "forwarded"
   parameter to Content-Type.]] This document describes best UI and
   other practices for handling of message header protection.  The goal
   of this document is to improve interoperability and minimize damage
   caused by possible differences between inner and outer headers.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "header field" and "header section" are defined in
   [RFC5322].

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Signed-only message: a multipart/signed or application/pkcs7-mime
   containing SignedData message which doesn't contain any encrypted
   layer.  I.e. this is a message which is not encrypted and not
   encrypted + signed.

3.  Recommended algorithms for email header protection

   [[LAMPS WG should pick between the following 2 alternatives.  They
   are described in details in subsections of this section.]]

   Examples in subsequent sections assume that an email client is trying
   to protect (sign) the following initial message:

3.1.  Option 1: Memory Hole

   Memory Hole approach works by copying the normal message header
   fields into the MIME header section of the top level protected body
   part.  Since the MIME body part header section is itself covered by
   the protection mechanisms (signing and/or encryption) it shares the
   protections of the message body.

   The following example demonstrates how header section and payload of
   a protect body part might look like.  For example, this will be the
   first body part of a multipart/signed message or the signed and/or
   encrypted payload of the application/pkcs7-mime body part.  Lines
   prepended by "O: " are the outer header section.  Lines prepended by
   "I: " are the inner header section.

3.2.  Option 2: Wrapping with message/rfc822 or message/global

   Wrapping with message/rfc822 (or message/global) works by copying the
   normal message header fields into the MIME header section of the top
   level protect body part and then prepending them with "Content-Type:
   message/rfc822; forwarded=no\r\n" or "Content-Type: message/global;
   forwarded=no\r\n", where \r\n is US-ASCII CR followed by US-ASCII LF.
   Since the MIME body part header section is itself covered by the
   protection mechanisms (signing and/or encryption) it shares the
   protections of the message body.

Internet-Draft        Header protection with S/MIME         October 2018


   The rest of this section formally defines the new "forwarded"
   Content-Type header field parameter and how header section wrapping
   works.

   This document defines a new Content-Type header field parameter
   [RFC2045] with name "forwarded".  The parameter value is case-
   insensitive and can be either "yes" or "no".  (The default value
   being "yes").  The parameter is only meaningful with media type
   "message/rfc822" and "message/global" [RFC6532] when used within
   S/MIME signed or encrypted body parts.  The value "yes" means that
   the message nested inside "message/rfc822" ("message/global") is a
   forwarded message and not a construct created solely to protect the
   inner header section.

   Instructions in [RFC5751] describing how to protect the Email message
   header section [RFC5322], by wrapping the message inside a message/
   rfc822 container [RFC2045] are thus updated to read:

      In order to protect outer, non-content-related message header
      fields (for instance, the "Subject", "To", "From", and "Cc"
      fields), the sending client MAY wrap a full MIME message in a
      message/rfc822 wrapper in order to apply S/MIME security services
      to these header fields.  It is up to the receiving client to
      decide how to present this "inner" header section along with the
      unprotected "outer" header section.

      When an S/MIME message is received, if the top-level protected
      MIME entity has a Content-Type of message/rfc822 or message/global
      without the "forwarded" parameter or with the "forwarded"
      parameter set to "no", it can be assumed that the intent was to
      provide header protection.  This entity SHOULD be presented as the
      top-level message, taking into account header section merging
      issues as previously discussed.

   The following example demonstrates how header section and payload of
   a protect body part might look like.  For example, this will be the
   first body part of a multipart/signed message or the signed and/or
   encrypted payload of the application/pkcs7-mime body part.  Lines
   prepended by "O: " are the outer header section.  Lines prepended by
   "I: " are the inner header section.  Lines prepended by "W: " are the
   wrapper.

4.  Recommendations for handling of S/MIME protected header

   [[This section needs more work.  Don't treat anything in it as
   unchangeable.]]

   For a signed-only message, it is RECOMMENDED that all "outer" header
   fields are copied into the "inner" protected body part.  This would
   mean that all header fields are signed.  In this case, the "outer"
   header fields simply match the protected header fields.  And in the
   case that the "outer" header fields differ, they can simply be
   replaced with their protected versions when displayed to the user.

   When generating encrypted or encrypted+signed S/MIME messages which
   protect header fields:

Internet-Draft        Header protection with S/MIME         October 2018


   1.  If a header field is being encrypted because it is sensitive, its
       true value MUST NOT be included in the outer header.  If the
       header field is mandatory according to RFC 5322, a stub value (or
       a value indicating that the outer value is not to be used) is to
       be included in the outer header section.

   2.  The outer header section SHOULD be minimal in order to avoid
       disclosure of confidential information.  It is recommended that
       the outer header section only contains "Date" (set to the same
       value as in the inner header field, or, if the Date value is also
       sensitive, to Monday 9am of the same week), possibly "Subject"
       and "To"/"Bcc" header fields.  In particular, Keywords, In-Reply-
       To and References header fields SHOULD NOT be included in the
       outer header; "To" and "Cc" header fields should be omitted and
       replaced with "Bcc: undisclosed-recipients;".

       But note that having key header fields duplicated in the outer
       header is convenient for many message stores (e.g.  IMAP) and
       clients that can't decode S/MIME encrypted messages.  In
       particular, Subject/To/Cc/Bcc/Date header field values are
       returned in IMAP ENVELOPE FETCH data item [RFC3501], which is
       frequently used by IMAP clients in order to avoid parsing message
       header.

   3.  The "Subject" header field value of the outer header section
       SHOULD either be identical to the inner "Subject" header field
       value, or contain a clear indication that the outer value is not
       to be used for display (the inner header field value would
       contain the true value).

   Note that recommendations listed above typically only apply to non
   MIME header fields (header fields with names not starting with
   "Content-" prefix), but there are exception, e.g.  Content-Language.

   Note that the above recommendations can also negatively affect
   antispam processing.

   When displaying S/MIME messages which protect header fields (whether
   they are signed-only, encrypted or encrypted+signed):

   1.  The outer headers might be tampered with, so a receiving client
       SHOULD ignore them, unless they are protected in some other
       way(*).  If a header field is present in the inner header, only
       the inner header field value MUST be displayed (and the
       corresponding outer value must be ignored).  If a particular
       header field is only present in the outer header, it MAY be
       ignored (not displayed) or it MAY be displayed with a clear
       indicator that it is not trustworthy(*).

       (*) - this only applies if the header field is not protected is
       some other way, for example with a DKIM signature that validates
       and is trusted.

5.  Mail User Agent Algorithm for deciding which version of a header
    field to display

   [[TBD: describe how to recurse to find the innermost protected root
   body part, extract header fields from it and propogate them to the
   top level.  This should also work for triple-wrapped messages.]]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no action from IANA.  RFC Editor can delete
   this section before publication.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document talks about UI considerations, including security
   considerations, when processing messages protecting header fields.
   One of the goals of this document is to specify UI for displaying
   such messages which is less confusing/misleading and thus more
   secure.

   The document is not defining new protocol, so it doesn't create any
   new security concerns not already covered by S/MIME [RFC5751], MIME
   [RFC2045] and Email [RFC5322] in general.
