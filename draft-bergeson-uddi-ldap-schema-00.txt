2. Abstract 
    
   This document defines the schema for representing Universal 
   Description Discovery & Integration (referred to here as UDDI) data 
   types [UDDI] in an LDAP directory [LDAPV3].  It defines schema 
   elements to represent a businessEntity, a businessService, a 
   bindingTemplate, a tModel, and a publisherAssertion. 
    
    
3. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The imperatives from [RFC2119] used in this document are to be 
   interpreted as described there. 
    
4. Representation of UDDI Data Structures 
     
   This document defines schema elements to represent the five UDDI 
   data structure types: a businessEntity, a businessService, a 
   bindingTemplate, a tModel, and a publisherAssertion.  Portions of 
   [UDDI] are repeated here for clarity. 
    
   The information that makes up a registration in UDDI consists of 
   these five data structure types.  This division by information type 
   provides simple partitions to assist in the rapid location and

   understanding of the different information that makes up a 
   registration. 
    
   The individual instance data managed by a UDDI registry are 
   sensitive to the parent/child relationships found in the schema.  A 
   businessEntity object contains one or more unique businessService 
   objects.  Similarly, individual businessService objects contain 
   specific instances of bindingTemplate, which in turn contains 
   information that includes pointers to specific instances of tModel 
   objects. 
    
   It is important to note that no single instance of a core schema 
   type is ever ÊÊcontained∆∆ by more than one parent instance.  This 
   means that only one specific businessEntity object (identified by 
   its unique key value) will ever contain or be used to express 
   information about a specific instance of a businessService object 
   (also identified by its own unique key value). 
    
4.1 businessEntity 
    
   The businessEntity object represents all known information about a 
   business or entity that publishes descriptive information about the 
   entity as well as the services that it offers.  The businessEntity 
   is the top-level container that accommodates holding descriptive 
   information about a business or entity.  Service descriptions and 
   technical information are expressed within a businessEntity by a 
   containment relationship. 
    
4.1.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A businessEntity is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiBusinessKey, uddiAuthorizedName, uddiOperator, 
   uddiDiscoveryURLs, uddiName, uddiDescription, uddiIdentifierBag, and 
   uddiCategoryBag, as defined in section 5.  A businessEntity may 
   contain zero or more instances of uddiContact and 
   uddiBusinessService.  The mandatory attribute, uddiBusinessKey, 
   contains the unique identifier for a given instance of a 
   businessEntity. 
    
   businessEntity∆s definition is given in Section 6.  
    
4.2 businessService 
    
   The businessService instances each represent a logical service 
   classification.  Each businessService object is the logical child of 
   a single businessEntity object.  Each businessService element 
   contains descriptive information in business terms outlining the 
   type of technical services found within each businessService 
   instance. 
    
   In some cases, businesses would like to share or reuse services, 
   e.g. when a large enterprise publishes separate businessEntity

   structures.  This can be established by using the businessService 
   instance as a projection to an already published businessService. 
    
4.2.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A businessService is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiBusinessKey, uddiServiceKey, uddiName, uddiDescription, and 
   uddiCategoryBag, as defined in section 5.  A businessService may 
   contain zero or more instances of uddiBindingTemplate.  The 
   mandatory attribute, uddiServiceKey, contains the unique identifier 
   for a given instance of a businessService. 
    
   businessService∆s definition is given in Section 6. 
    
4.3 bindingTemplate 
    
   Technical descriptions of Web services are accommodated via 
   individual contained instances of bindingTemplate objects.  These 
   instances provide support for determining a technical entry point or 
   optionally support remotely hosted services, as well as a 
   lightweight facility for describing unique technical characteristics 
   of a given implementation.  Support for technology and application 
   specific parameters and settings files are also supported. 
    
   Since UDDI∆s main purpose is to enable description and discovery of 
   Web Service information, it is the bindingTemplate that provides the 
   most interesting technical data. 
    
   Each bindingTemplate instance has a single logical businessService 
   parent, which in turn has a single logical businessEntity parent. 
    
4.3.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A bindingTemplate is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiBindingKey, uddiServcieKey, uddiDesctiption, uddiAccessPoint, 
   and uddiHostingRedirector, as defined in section 5.  A 
   bindingTemplate may contain zero or more instances of 
   uddiTModelInstanceDetails.  The mandatory attribute, uddiBindingKey, 
   contains the unique identifier for a given instance of a 
   bindingTemplate. 
    
   BindingTemplate∆s definition is given in Section 6. 
    
4.4 tModel 
    
   The tModel object takes the form of keyed metadata (data about 
   data).  In a general sense, the purpose of a tModel within the UDDI 
   registry is to provide a reference system based on abstraction.  
   Thus, the kind of data that a tModel represents is pretty nebulous.  
   In other words, a tModel registration can define just about 
   anything, but in the current revision, two conventions have been 
   applied for using tModels: as sources for determining compatibility 
   and as keyed namespace references.

   The information that makes up a tModel is quite simple.  There∆s a 
   key, a name, an optional description, and then a URL that points 
   somewhere--
             -
             -presumably somewhere where the curious can go to find out 
   more about the actual concept represented by the metadata in the 
   tModel itself. 
    
4.4.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A tModel is represented in the directory by the attributes 
   uddiTModelKey, uddiAuthorizedName, uddiOperator, uddiName, 
   uddiDescription, uddiOverviewDescription, uddiOverviewURL, 
   uddiIdentifeierBag, and uddiCategoryBag, as defined in section 5.  A 
   tModel may also contain a uddiHidden to logically delete a tModel.  
   The mandatory attribute, uddiTModelKey, contains the unique 
   identifier for a given instance of a tModel. 
    
   tModel∆s definition is given in Section 6. 
    
4.5 publisherAssertion 
    
   Many businesses, like large enterprises or marketplaces, are not 
   effectively represented by a single businessEntity, since their 
   description and discovery are likely to be diverse.  As a 
   consequence, several businessEntity instances can be published, 
   representing individual subsidiaries of a large enterprise or 
   individual participants of a marketplace.  Nevertheless, they still 
   represent a more or less coupled community and would like to make 
   some of their relationships visible in their UDDI registrations.  
    
4.5.1 Representation in the Directory 
    
   A publisherAssertion is represented in the directory by the 
   attributes uddiFromKey, uddiToKey, uddiKeyedReference, and uddiUUID, 
   as defined in section 5.  The mandatory attribute, uddiUUID, 
   contains the unique identifier for a given instance of a 
   publisherAssertion. 
    
   publisherAssertion∆s definition is given in Section 6. 
    
5. Attribute Type Definitions 
    
   The following attribute types are defined in this document: 
    
        uddiBusinessKey 
        uddiAuthorizedName 
        uddiOperator 
        uddiName 
        uddiDescription

        uddiFromKey 
        uddiToKey 
        uddiUUID 
        uddiIsHidden 
    
5.1 uddiBusinessKey 
    
   Used in uddiBusinessEntity and uddiBusinessService.   
    
   The uddiBusinessKey is the unique identifier for a given instance of 
   an uddiBusinessEntity.  However the attribute is optional for 
   businessService instances contained within a fully expressed parent 
   that already contains a businessKey value. 
    
   If the businessService instance is rendered into XML and has no 
   containing parent that has within its data a businessKey, the value 
   of the businessKey that is the parent of the businessService is 
   required to be provided.  This behavior supports the ability to 
   browse through the parent-child relationships given any of the core 
   elements as a starting point. The businessKey may differ from the 
   publishing businessEntity∆s businessKey to allow service 
   projections.

5.2 uddiAuthorizedName 
    
   The uddiAuthorizedName is the recorded name of the individual that 
   published the uddiBusinessEntity data.  This data is generated by

     SINGLE-VALUE 
   ) 
    
5.3 uddiOperator 
    
   The uddiOperator is the certified name of the UDDI registry site 
   operator that manages the master copy of the uddiBusinessEntity. The 
   controlling operator records this data at the time data is saved. 
   This data is generated and should not be supplied within 
   save_business operations.

5.4 uddiName 
    
   Used in uddiBusinessEntity and uddiBusinessService.   
    
   These are the human readable names recorded for the 
   uddiBusinessEntity or uddiBusinessService, adorned with a unique 
   xml:lang value to signify the language that they are expressed in. 
   Name search is provided via find_business or find_service calls. 
   Names may not be blank. 
    
   The publishing of several names, e.g. for romanization purposes, is 
   supported. In order to signify the language that the names are 
   expressed in, they carry unique xml:lang values. Not more than one 
   name element may omit specifying its language. Names passed in this 
   way will be assigned the default language code of the registering 
   party. This default language code is established at the time that 
   publishing credentials are established with an individual Operator 
   Site. If no default language is provisioned at the time a publisher 
   signs up, the operator can adopt an appropriate default language 
   code.

5.5 uddiDescription 
    
   The uddiDescription is an optional repeating element of one or more 
   descriptions. One description is allowed per national language code 
   supplied. 
    
   ( 2.16.840.1.113719.1.302.4.5.1

   ) 
    
   The xml:lang value ÊÊ#∆∆ precedes the description value. 
    
5.6 uddiDiscoveryURLs 
    
   This is a list of Uniform Resource Locators (URL) that point to 
   alternate, file based service discovery mechanisms. Each recorded 
   uddiBusinessEntity structure is automatically assigned a URL that 
   returns the individual uddiBusinessEntity structure. URL search is 
   provided via find_business call. 
    
   The uddiDiscoveryURLs attribute is used to hold pointers to URL 
   addressable discovery documents. The expected retrieval mechanism 
   for URLs referenced in the data within this structure is HTTP-GET. 
   The expected return document is not defined. Rather, a framework for 
   establishing convention is provided, and two such conventions are 
   defined within UDDI behaviors. It is hoped that other conventions 
   come about and use this structure to accommodate alternate means of 
   discovery.

   ) 
    
5.7 uddiUseType 
    
   The uddiUseType designates the name of the convention that the 
   referenced document follows. Two reserved convention values are 
   ÊÊbusinessEntity∆∆ and ÊÊbusinessEntityExt∆∆. URLs qualified with these 
   values should point to XML documents of the same type as the 
   uddiUseType value.

5.8 uddiPersonName 
    
   The uddiPersonName should list the name of the person or name of the 
   job role that will be available behind the contact. Examples of 
   roles include ÊÊadministrator∆∆ or ÊÊwebmaster∆∆.

5.9 uddiPhone 
    
   Used to hold telephone numbers for the contact. This element can be 
   adorned with an optional uddiUseType attribute for descriptive 
   purposes. If more than one phone element is saved, uddiUseType 
   attributes are required on each. The uddiUseType is appended to the 
   telephone number by a separating Ê#∆.  For example:  
        ÊÊ123 456-7890#Work Number∆∆ 
    
   ( 2.16.840.1.113719.1.302.4.9.1

5.10 uddiEMail 
    
   Used to hold email addresses for the contact. This element can be 
   adorned with an optional uddiUseType attribute for descriptive 
   purposes. If more than one email element is saved, uddiUseType 
   attributes are required on each. The uddiUseType is appended to the 
   email address by a separating Ê#∆.  For example: 
        ÊÊpresident@whitehouse.gov#President of the United States∆∆ 
    
   ( 2.16.840.1.113719.1.302.4.10.1

    ) 
    
5.11 uddiSortCode 
    
   The uddiSortCode is used to drive the behavior of external display 
   mechanisms that sort addresses. The suggested values for 
   uddiSortCode include numeric ordering values (e.g. 1, 2, 3), 
   alphabetic character ordering values (e.g. a, b, c) or the first n 
   positions of relevant data within the address.

5.12 uddiTModelKey 
    
   This is the unique key reference that implies that the uddiKeyName 
   uddiKeyValue pairs given by subsequent uddiAddressLine elements are 
   to be interpreted by the taxonomy associated with the uddiTModel 
   that is referenced.

     SINGLE-VALUE 
    ) 
    
5.13 uddiAddressLine 
    
   The uddiAddressLine contains the actual address in freeform text. If 
   the address element contains a uddiTModelKey, these uddiAddressLine 
   elements are to be adorned each with an optional uddiKeyName 
   uddiKeyValue attribute pair. Together with the uddiTModelKey, 
   uddiKeyName and uddiKeyValue qualify the uddiAddressLine in order to 
   describe its meaning. 
    
   The uddiAddressLine elements contain string data with a line length 
   limit of 80 character positions. Each uddiAddressLine element can be 
   adorned with two optional descriptive attributes, uddiKeyName and 
   uddiKeyValue. Both attributes must be present in each address line 
   if a uddiTModelKey is assigned to the address structure. By doing 
   this, the otherwise arbitrary use of address lines becomes 
   structured. Together with the address∆ uddiTModelKey, uddiKeyName 
   and uddiKeyValue virtually build a uddiKeyedReference that 
   represents an address line qualifier, given by the referenced 
   uddiTModel.  
    
   When no uddiTModelKey is provided for the address structure, the 
   uddiKeyName and uddiKeyValue attributes can be used without 
   restrictions, for example, to provide descriptive information for 
   each uddiAddressLine by using the uddiKeyName attribute. Since both 
   the uddiKeyName and the uddiKeyValue attributes are optional, 
   address line order is significant and will always be returned by the 
   UDDI compliant registry in the order originally provided during a 
   call to save_business.

5.16 uddiIdentifierBag 
    
   The uddiIdentifierBag element allows uddiBusinessEntity or 
   uddiTModel structures to include information about common forms of 
   identification such as D-U-N-S_ numbers, tax identifiers, etc. This 
   data can be used to signify the identity of the uddiBusinessEntity, 
   or can be used to signify the identity of the publishing party. 
   Including data of this sort is optional, but when used greatly 
   enhances the search behaviors exposed via the find_xx messages 
   defined in the UDDI Version 2.0 API Specification. For a full 
   description of the structures involved in establishing an identity, 
   see UDDI Version 2.0 Data Structure Specification - Appendix A: 
   Using Identifiers.

5.17 uddiCategoryBag 
    
   The uddiCategoryBag element allows uddiBusinessEntity, 
   uddiBusinessService and uddiTModel structures to be categorized 
   according to any of several available taxonomy based classification 
   schemes. Operator Sites automatically provide validated 
   categorization support for three taxonomies that cover industry 
   codes (via NAICS), product and service classifications (via UNSPC)

5.18 uddiKeyedReference 
    
   The uddiKeyedReference is a general-purpose attribute for a name-
   value pair, with an additional reference to a tModel.  The tModel, 
   keyName, and keyValue or this attribute are separated by ÊÊ#∆∆, e.g. 
   <tModel>∆∆#∆∆<keyName>∆∆#∆∆<keyValue>.  The keyValue is the only 
   required portion of the attribute.

5.19 uddiServiceKey 
    
   This is the unique key for a given uddiBusinessService. When saving 
   a new uddiBusinessService structure, pass an empty uddiServiceKey 
   value. This signifies that a UUID value is to be generated. To 
   update an existing uddiBusinessService structure, pass the UUID 
   value that corresponds to the existing service. If this data is 
   received via an inquiry operation, the uddiServiceKey values may not 
   be blank. When saving a new or updated service projection, pass the 
   uddiServiceKey of the referenced uddiBusinessService structure. 
    
   This attribute is optional when the uddiBindingTemplate data is 
   contained within a fully expressed parent that already contains a 
   uddiServiceKey value. If the uddiBindingTemplate data is rendered 
   into XML and has no containing parent that has within its data a 
   uddiServiceKey, the value of the uddiServiceKey that is the ultimate 
   containing parent of the uddiBindingTemplate is required to be 
   provided. This behavior supports the ability to browse through the 
   parent-child relationships given any of the core elements as a 
   starting point.

   value. This signifies that a UUID value is to be generated. To

5.21 uddiAccessPoint 
    
   The uddiAccessPoint element is an attribute-qualified pointer to a 
   service entry point. The notion of service at the metadata level 
   seen here is fairly abstract and many types of entry points are 
   accommodated. A single attribute is provided named uddiURLType. 
    
   Required attribute qualified element8. This element is a text field 
   that is used to convey the entry point address suitable for calling 
   a particular Web service. This may be a URL, an electronic mail 
   address, or even a telephone number. No assumptions about the type 
   of data in this field can be made without first understanding the 
   technical requirements associated with the Web service.

5.22 uddiHostingRedirector 
    
   The uddiHostingRedirector element is used to designate that a 
   uddiBindingTemplate entry is a pointer to a different 
   uddiBindingTemplate entry. The value in providing this facility is 
   seen when a business or entity wants to expose a service description 
   (e.g. advertise that they have a service available that suits a 
   specific purpose) that is actually a service that is described in a 
   separate uddiBindingTemplate record. This might occur when a service 
   is remotely hosted (hence the name of this element), or when many 
   service descriptions could benefit from a single service 
   description.

   The uddiHostingRedirector element has a single attribute and no 
   element content. The attribute is a uddiBindingKey value that is 
   suitable within the same UDDI registry instance for querying and 
   obtaining the uddiBindingDetail data that is to be used. 
    
   More on the uddiHostingRedirector can be found in the appendices for 
   the UDDI Version 2.0 API Specification. 
    
   Required element if uddiAccessPoint not provided. This element is 
   adorned with a uddiBindingKey attribute, giving the redirected 
   reference to a different uddiBindingTemplate. If you query a 
   uddiBindingTemplate and find a uddiHostingRedirector value, you 
   should retrieve that uddiBindingTemplate and use it in place of the 
   one containing the uddiHostingRedirector data.

   The uddiInstance Parms is an Optional element of the uddiInstance. 
   Used to contain settings parameters or a URL reference to a file 
   that contains settings or parameters required to use a specific 
   facet of a uddiBindingTemplate description. If used to house the 
   parameters themselves, the suggested content is a namespace 
   qualified XML string -
                        - using a namespace outside of the UDDI schema. 
   If used to house a URL pointer to a file, the suggested format is 
   URL that is suitable for retrieving the settings or parameters via 
   HTTP-GET.

   covers the way a particular uddiTModel specific reference is used as 
   a component of an overall web service description. The suggested 
   format is a URL that is suitable for retrieving an HTML based

7. Security Considerations 
    
   Storing UDDI data into the directory enables the data to be examined 
   and used outside the environment in which it was originally created.  
   The directory entry containing the UDDI data could be read and 
   modified within the constraints imposed by the access control 
   mechanisms of the directory.
