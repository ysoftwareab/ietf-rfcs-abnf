    Consolidated IASA 2.0 Updates of IETF Administrative Terminology
                  draft-ietf-iasa2-consolidated-upd-06

Abstract

   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative
   structure and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
   to a new "IASA 2.0" structure.  In addition to more substantive
   changes that are described in other documents, the transition to the
   2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes several position
   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced
   elsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents
   individually, this specification provides updates to them and
   deprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no
   confusion due to these changes.

1.  Introduction

   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative
   structure, and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity
   (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0" structure [RFC-Struct].  Key IASA 2.0
   changes have been specified in a series of documents, including
   changes to the IETF Trust [RFC-trust-update], the rationale for it
   [RFC-trust-rationale], a new defining document for the IETF
   Administration LLC [LLC-Agreement] (informally called the "IETF LLC"
   or just "the LLC" in places in this document and elsewhere) and

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates             March 2019


   adjustments to the procedures for nominations and selections for
   relevant positions [RFC-7437bis].

   In addition to more substantive changes that are described in those
   and other documents, the IASA 2.0 structure changes several position
   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced in other
   documents.  Rather than reissue those documents individually, this
   document provides a unified update to them.

   This document updates RFCs 2028, 2418, 3005, 3710, and 6702
   (citations in context below) to make those terminology and related
   changes.  For clarity, it also obsoletes RFC 3929 which was an
   Experimental document that is no longer relevant and requests that it
   be made Historic.  In addition, with the authorization of the IAB, it
   requests that the Informational RFC 3716 be made Historic (see
   Section 4).  The sections that follow identify the details of the
   relevant documents and the required changes.

2.  Where Appropriate, Replacement of the IETF Executive Director
    position with the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat

   Under the IASA 2.0 structure, most of the responsibilities of the
   former position of IETF Executive Director been assigned to a new
   position (or at least title) of Managing Director of the IETF
   Secretariat.  An "Executive Director" title is now associated with
   different, and largely new, responsibilities as an Officer of the
   IETF Administration LLC.  These changes are described in the
   description of the new structural arrangements [RFC-Struct].

   This document applies that change to the following:

   o  RFC 2028, The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process
      [RFC2028], Section 3.3.

   o  RFC 2418, IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures [RFC2418]

   o  RFC 3710, An IESG Charter, Section 2[RFC3710].

   o  RFC 6702, Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights
      (IPR) Disclosure Rules, Section 5 [RFC6702].

   Note that the current description of the Internet Standards Process
   [RFC2026] does not require an update by this document for this
   purpose because the reference to the IETF Executive Director in RFC
   2026 was replaced by a document that precedes the current effort
   [RFC3979] and that was, in turn, obsoleted by RFC 8179 [RFC8179].

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates             March 2019


3.  Remove the IETF Executive Director as an Option

   In a few cases, it is no longer appropriate for either the Managing
   Director, IETF Secretariat (former IETF Executive Director position)
   or the new IETF Executive Director (for the LLC) to perform a
   particular historical function.  The relevant documents are updated
   to remove the IETF Executive Director from the list of people with
   specific responsibilities or authority.  Those documents will not be
   updated to use "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" but, instead,
   the mention of the position will simply be dropped.

   This document applies that change to the following:

   o  RFC 3005, IETF Discussion List Charter [RFC3005], section titled
      "Charter for the IETF Discussion List".  This document is modified
      to remove the authorization for the IETF Executive Director to
      restrict people from posting, etc.

4.  Deprecated Documents

   [[CREF1: Note to the WG, IESG, and RFC Editor: I hope this section
   correctly reflects the conclusions of discussions in and with the WG.
   If it does not, the issues should certainly be identified and fixed.
   However, details of some of the actions are the responsibility of the
   RFC Editor and RFC 3716 is an IAB document containing the report of
   an IAB Advisory Committee.  If that text, especially the phrasing of
   various actions, is not quite right, I hope those involved can sort
   the language out with the RFC Editor rather than requiring that the
   WG iterate on the draft. --JcK, editor]]

   The IASA2 Working Group has also identified several RFCs that no
   longer apply as a result of the change to the new IASA 2.0 structure.
   The result is that several Informational, Experimental, or other RFCs
   should be reclassified as necessary to avoid confusion.  Because none
   of them are directly relevant to the IASA 2.0 structure, it is also
   requested that all of the documents listed in this section be
   reclassified to Historic.

4.1.  Obsoleted Documents

   This specification obsoletes the following, formerly Experimental,
   documents:

   RFC 3929  [RFC3929] touches on aspects of the administration of the
      IETF such as mentioning the IETF Executive Director.  It dates to
      2004; the results of the experiment were never documented in the
      RFC Series.

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates             March 2019


   RFC 4633  [RFC4633] refers to the IETF Executive Director.  It
      describes a 2006 experiment that ran for 18 months and whose
      conclusions were never documented in the RFC Series.

4.2.  Documents Whose Context is Changed by This Specification

   Both of the documents that follow were obsoleted in 2017 by RFC 8179
   [RFC8179], which changed mentions of the IETF Executive Director to
   point to the IETF Secretariat more generally.

   o  RFC 3979 [RFC3979].

   o  RFC 4879 [RFC4879].

4.3.  General Description of the IETF Adminstrative Model

   RFC 3716 [RFC3716] is a report of an IAB Advisory Committee that
   served as a starting point for the work that led to the original IASA
   structure.  That report is an IAB document rather than an IETF one.
   The IAB approved a proposal to move RFC 3716 to Historic on March 6,
   2019.

5.  Acknowledgments

   Brian Carpenter's careful checking and identification of documents
   that did, and did not, require consideration was essential to the
   draft in its current form.  He also made several other significant
   contributions.  Bob Hinden also gave the document a careful reading
   and made useful suggestions.  In additional to the above, Alissa
   Cooper, Eliot Lear, Heather Flanagan (the RFC Series Editor), and the
   current membership to the IAB helped sort out the handing of RFC
   3716.

6.  Contributors

   Jason Livingood did the hard work of identifying the documents that
   required updating and supplied considerable text used in this
   document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   [[CREF2: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   The changes specified in this document are matters of terminology and
   organizational structure derived from documents it references.  It
   should have no effect on Internet security.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: Please remove this appendix before publication.

A.1.  Changes from version -00 (2018-11-15) to -01

   o  Removed RFCs 3979 and 4879 from the "obsoletes" list because they
      had already been obsoleted (by 8179).  It also removes RFC 8179
      from the "updates" list because 8179 uses "IETF Secretariat"
      terminology rather than "IETF Executive Director".

      [[CREF3: Note in Draft: That suggests an idea which might
      considerably mitigate the name confusion issue: Instead of
      singling out the Managing Director of the Secretariat as a named
      individual, perhaps we should be referring to the Secretariat
      itself, leaving the contact point or address up to them as an
      internal administrative matter.  Just a thought. --JcK]]

   o  Added text to explain why RFC 2026 is not on the hit list.

   o  Added an acknowledgment to Brian Carpenter.  If he catches another
      batch of errors and supplies text, he gets promoted to
      Contributor.

   o  Adjusted reference [RFC-Struct] to point to 4071bis.

   o  Minor editorial corrections and changes.

A.2.  Changes from version -01 (dated 2018-12-06 but posted 2012-12-07)
      to -02

   I accidentally omitted RFC 4844 from the document header "updates"
   list in Version 01 and noticed that in response to an unrelated
   question almost immediately after posting.  The correction seemed
   important enough to justify almost immediate re-posting.  Changes are
   only that header, the document file name, and the date.  --JcK

A.3.  Changes from version -02 (2018-12-07) to -03

   o  Removed discussion and pointers to RFC 7500 - IAB will publish
      separately.

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates             March 2019


   o  Added text to describe (very superficially) RFC 3716.  That
      document was obsoleted in the previous version but not described.

   o  Removed rant about titles and responsibilities from Section 2 and
      a subsequent editorial note I hope it is no longer needed --JcK.
      In additional, several blocks of text that were commented out in
      earlier versions of the XML have been removed entirely.

A.4.  Changes from version -03 (2018-12-12) to -04

   o  Removed RFC 4844 from the update list and discussion because the
      consensus in the WG seemed to be that it (and the RFC Editor)
      should be handled separately.

   o  Removed RFC 5377 from the update list and discussion because it
      involves the Trust.

   o  Editor's note in draft:

         The above changes and the earlier removal of RFC 7500 so the
         IAB could publish it own document completely eliminate the
         earlier Sections 2 and 3.  That may call for a revision of the
         Introduction and/or Abstract, but I have not done a review for
         this iteration of whether such changes are needed.

         As documents and references are shuffled in and out of this
         one, it occurred to me that having a non-normative appendix
         somewhere that would identify all of the documents containing
         changes to reflect the IASA 1.x to 2.0 transition would be of
         great help to any future historian trying to understand what we
         did and probably helpful to the IETF if some of these changes
         don't work out and/or require further tuning.  After a brief
         discussion, Jason and I concluded that appendix did not belong
         in this iteration of this document.

A.5.  Changes from version -04 (2019-01-17) to -05

   o  Changed title from "Consolidated IASA2-Related Document Updates"
      to "Consolidated IASA 2.0 Updates of IETF Administrative
      Terminology" per suggestions from Brian Carpenter and Bob Hinden
      and 2019-01-31 WG decision.

   o  Removed CREF from Section 1 (should have been done in -04).  The
      only remaining CREFs are the one in this section (above) that
      should probably be preserved through IETF Last Call and notes to
      the RFC Editor.

   o  Updated acknowledgments.

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates             March 2019


A.6.  Changes from version -05 (2019-01-31) to -06

   o  Changes to text about documents that are updated and made
      historic, per advice from RFC Editor, WG Chairs, and IAB.  This
      includes a statement about IAB action of 2019-03-06 that requests
      that the RFC Editor move RFC 3716 to Historic but does not
      obsolete that Informational report.  When minimal changes were
      attempted, Section 4 became very hard to read and hence was
      restructured and somewhat rewritten (and then further modified to
      work around an xml2rfc glitch).  Special attention should be paid
      to the note at the beginning of that section.

   o  Updated the Acknowledgments section.
