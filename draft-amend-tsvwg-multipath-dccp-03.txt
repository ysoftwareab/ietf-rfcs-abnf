    DCCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses
                  draft-amend-tsvwg-multipath-dccp-03

Abstract

   DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per
   connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
   simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could
   improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
   experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
   network failure.

   Multipath DCCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple
   paths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to
   traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers
   the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
   components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across
   potentially disjoint paths.

Internet-Draft               Multipath DCCP                November 2019


1.  Introduction

   Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) is a set of extensions to regular DCCP
   [RFC4340], which enables a transport connection to operate across
   multiple paths simultaneously.  DCCP multipath operations is
   suggested in the context of ongoing 3GPP work on 5G multi-access
   solutions [I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp] and for hybrid
   access networks [I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture][I-D.mu
   ley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access].  It can be applied for
   load-balancing, seamless session handover and aggregation purposes
   (referred to as steering, switching and splitting in 3GPP terminology
   [TR23.793]).

   This document presents the protocol changes required to add multipath
   capability to DCCP; specifically, those for signaling and setting up
   multiple paths ("subflows"), managing these subflows, reassembly of
   data, and termination of sessions.

1.1.  Multipath DCCP in the Networking Stack

   MP-DCCP operates at the transport layer and aims to be transparent to
   both higher and lower layers.  It is a set of additional features on
   top of standard DCCP; Figure 1 illustrates this layering.  MP-DCCP is
   designed to be used by applications in the same way as DCCP with no
   changes.

1.4.  Differences from Multipath TCP

   Multipath DCCP is similar to Multipath TCP [RFC6824], in that it
   extends the related basic DCCP transport protocol [RFC4340] with
   multipath capabilities in the same way as Multipath TCP extends TCP
   [RFC0793].  However, mainly dominated by the basic protocols TCP and
   DCPP, the transport characteristics are different.

   Table 1 compares the protocol characteristics of TCP and DCCP, which
   are by nature inherited by their respective multipath extensions.  A
   major difference lies in the delivery of payload, which is for TCP an
   exact copy of the generated byte-stream.  DCCP behaves contrary and
   does not guarantee to transmit any payload nor the order of delivery.
   Since this is mainly affecting the receiving endpoint of a TCP or
   DCCP communication, many similarities on sender side can be stated.
   Both transport protocols share the 3-way initiation of a
   communication and both exploit a congestion control to adapt to path
   characteristics.

   Consequently, the multipath features, shown in Table 2, are the same,
   supporting volatile paths, session handover and path aggregation
   capabilities.  All of them profit by the existence of congestion
   control.

              Table 2: MPTCP and MP-DCCP protocol comparison

   Therefore the sender logic is not much different between MP-DCCP and
   MPTCP, even if the multipath session initiation differs.  MP-DCCP
   inherits a robust session establishment feature, which guarantees
   communication establishment if at least one functional path is
   available.  MP-TCP relies on an initial path, which has to work;
   otherwise no communication can be established.

   The receiver side for MP-DCCP has to deal with the unreliable
   transport character of DCCP and a possible re-assembly of the data
   stream.  In practice, it is assumed that some sort of re-assembly has
   to be applied, even if DCCP and the order of delivery is unreliable
   by nature.  Such re-assembly mechanisms have to account for the fact
   that packet loss may occur for any of the DCCP subflows.  Another
   issue is the packet reordering introduced when a DCCP communication
   is split across paths with disjoint latencies.  In theory,
   applications using DCCP certainly have to deal with packet
   reordering, since DCCP has no mechanisms to prevent it.  However, in
   practice, without any multipath extension, packet reordering can be
   assumed to be very limited.  Therefore most services on top of DCCP
   are not expecting massive packet reordering and degrades their
   performance if it happens anyway.

   The receiving process for MP-TCP is on the other hand a simple "just
   wait" approach, since TCP guarantees reliable delivery.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Operation Overview

   [Tbd], could be similar to [RFC6824]

   The Multipath Capability for MP-DCCP can be negotiated with a new
   DCCP feature, as described in Section 3.  Once negotiated, all
   subsequent MP-DCCP operations are signalled with a variable length
   multipath-related option, as described in Section 3.1.

3.  MP-DCCP Protocol

   The DCCP protocol feature list ([RFC4340] section 6.4) will be
   enhanced by a new Multipath related feature with Feature number 10,
   as shown in Figure 3.

   [Tbd] On top it requires particular considerations for:

   o  The minimum PMTU of the individual paths must be selected to
      announce to the application.  Changes of individual path PMTUs
      must be re-announced to the application if they are lower than the
      current announced PMTU.

   o  Overall sequencing for optional reassembly procedure

   o  Congestion control

   o  Robust MP-DCCP session establishment (no dependency on an initial
      path setup)

3.1.  Multipath Capable Feature

   DCCP endpoints are multipath-disabled by default and multipath
   capability can be negotiated with the Multipath Capable Feature.

   Multipath Capable has feature number 10 and is server-priority.  It
   takes one-byte values.  The first four bits are used to specify

   The MP_JOIN option is used to add a new path to an existing MP-DCCP
   flow.  The Path Token is the SHA-1 HASH of the derived key (d-key),
   which was previously exchanged with the MP_KEY option.  MP_HMAC MUST
   be set when using MP_JOIN to provide authentication (See MP_HMAC for
   details).  Also MP_KEY must be set to provide key material for
   authentication purposes.

   The MP_KEY suboption is used to exchange key material between hosts.
   The Key Type field is used to specify the key type.  Key types are
   shown in table Figure 6.

   Plain Text
      Key Material is exchanged in plain text between hosts and the key
      parts (key-a, key-b) are concatenated to form the derived key
      (d-key).

   ECDHE-SHA256-C25519
      Key Material is exchanged via ECDHE key exchange with SHA256 and
      Curve 25519 to generate the derived key (d-key).

      Key Material is exchanged via ECDHE key exchange with SHA512 and
      Curve 25519 to generate the derived key (d-key).

3.2.5.  MP_SEQ

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
      Type=45  Length=7 MP_OPT=4

   The MP_SEQ option is used for end-to-end datagram-based sequence
   numbers of an MP-DCCP connection.  The initial data sequence number
   (IDSN) SHOULD be set randomly.

3.2.6.  MP_HMAC

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
      Type=45  Length=23 MP_OPT=5

   The MP_HMAC option is used to provide authentication for the MP_JOIN
   option.  The HMAC is built using the derived key (d-key) calculated
   previously from the handshake key material exchanged with the MP_KEY
   option.  The Message for the HMAC is the header of the MP_JOIN for
   which authentication shall be performed.  By including a nonce in
   these datagrams, possible replay-attacks are remedied.  t

3.2.7.  MP_RTT

     +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
      Type=45  Length=12 MP_OPT=6

   The MP_RTT option is used to transmit RTT values in milliseconds.
   Additionally, the age of the measurement is specified in
   milliseconds.

   Raw RTT (=0)
      Raw RTT value of the last Datagram Round-Trip.  The Age parameter
      is set to the age of when the Ack for the datagram was received.

   Min RTT (=1)
      Min RTT value.  The period for computing the Minimum can be
      specified by the Age parameter.

   o  Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
      request and the MP_KEY option with Host-specific Key-A

   o  Host B sends a DCCP-Response with Confirm feature for MP-Capable
      and the MP_Key option with Host-specific Key-B

   o  Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with both Keys echoed to Host B

   The handshake for subsequent flows based on a successful initial
   handshake is as follows:

   o  Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
      request and the MP_JOIN option with Token TB, derived from the
      derived key by applying a SHA-1 hash and truncating to the first
      32 bits.  Additionally, a random nonce RA is transmitted with the
      MP_JOIN.

   o  Host B computes the HMAC of the DCCP-Request and sends a DCCP-
      Response with Confirm feature option for MP-Capable and the
      MP_JOIN option with the Token TB and a random nonce RB together
      with the computed MP_HMAC.

   o  Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with the HMAC computed for the DCCP-
      Response.

   o  Host B sends a DCCP-Ack confirm the HMAC and to conclude the
      handshaking.
