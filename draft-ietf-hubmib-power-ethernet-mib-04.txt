1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a set of MIB objects to manage a Power
   Ethernet (DTE Power via MDI)Powered Device (PD) and/or power Source
   Equipment (PSE).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2863].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
       1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
       in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
       STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
       the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
       track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
       [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
       message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
       [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

INTERNET DRAFT             Power Ethernet MIB              December 2002


   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
       [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
       in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3. Overview

   The emergence of IP telephony as an application that allows for voice
   applications to be run over the same infrastructure as data
   applications led to the emergence of Ethernet IP phones, with similar
   functions and characteristics as the traditional phones. Powering a
   phone is one of these functions that are being taken as granted. The
   IEEE 802.3 Working Group initiated a standard work on this subject,
   currently known as the IEEE 802.3af work [IEEE-802.3af].

   The IEEE 802.3af WG will not define a full management interface, but
   only the hardware registers that will allow for a management
   interfaces to be built for a powered Ethernet device. The MIB module
   defined in this document extends the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
   [RFC2665] with the management objects required for the management of
   the powered Ethernet devices and ports.

   The following abbreviations are defined in [IEEE-802.3af] and will be
   used with the same significance in this document:

   PSE - Power Sourcing Equipment;

INTERNET DRAFT             Power Ethernet MIB              December 2002


   PD - Powered Device



4. MIB Structure

   This MIB objects are included in four MIB groups - three of them
   include MIB tables, and the fourth scalar objects

   The pethPsePortTable defines the objects used for the configuration
   and describing the status of ports on a PSE device. Examples of PSE
   devices are Ethernet switches that support power Ethernet and mid-
   span boxes.

   The pethPdPortTable defines the objects used for the configuration
   and describing the status of ports on a PD device. Examples of PD
   devices are Ethernet phones.

   The pethMainPseObjects MIB group defines the management objects for a
   managed main power source in a PSE device. Ethernet switches are one
   example of boxes that would support these objects.

   The pethTrapsControlTable includes objects that control the
   transmission of traps by the agent to a management application.

5. Evolution of the Document, Limitations and Future Work

   The IEEE 802.3af is at this stage work in progress. The scope of this
   document is to do the standards work in the IETF in parallel with the
   IEEE standardization activity, in order to allow  for the publication
   of a standard track document containing an SNMP  MIB simultaneously
   or close to the date of the publication of the IEEE revised standard.
   It is possible that changes may be brought to the IEEE proposal, and
   the Ethernet MIB Working Group will work in order to ensure
   consistency between the two standards proposals.

                  Group - A recommended, but optional, entity
                  defined by the IEEE 802.3 management standard,
                  in order to support a modular numbering scheme.
                  The classical example allows an implementor to
                  represent field-replaceable units as groups of
                  ports, with the port numbering matching the
                  modular hardware implementation.

                   Port - This entity identifies the port within the group
                   for which this entry contains information. The numbering
                   scheme for ports is implementation specific."

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may
   contain sensitive information. These are:

   pethPsePortPowerPairsControlAbility
   pethPsePortPowerPriority
   pethPsePortPowerClassifications


   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
   this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
   use of the User-based Security Model [RFC2274] and the
   View-based Access Control Model [RFC2275] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.
