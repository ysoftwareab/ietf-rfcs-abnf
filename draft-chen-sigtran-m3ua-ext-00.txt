Internet-Draft  Clarifications and Amendments to RFC 4666  November 2007 
    

Abstract 

   RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 
   MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the 
   services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Some parts of 
   the specification are unclear that may lead to misinterpretations 
   that may impair interoperability between different implementations. 
   RFC 4666 doesn't define the application of IPSTP-IPSEP interface. For 
   the signalling network management function, messages and procedures, 
   it needs more contributes. 

   This document provides clarifications and amendments to RFC 4666. 

Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

1. Introduction 

   RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 
   MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the 
   services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. During 
   implementation and interoperability testing of RFC 4666, some 
   ambiguities and common misinterpretations have been identified. 

   This document summarizes identified issues and provides 
   clarifications needed for implementations of RFC 4666 to interoperate, 
   i.e., it constitutes an update to RFC 4666. This document also makes 
   amendments to RFC 4666. References to RFC 4666 should, therefore, 
   also include this document. 

1.1. Scope 

   1) Define the Application for IPSTP-IPSEP interface.  

   2) Define the signalling network management function messages,and 
   procedures 

   3) Other Clarifications and Corrections 

1.2. Terminology 

   IP Signaling Transfer Point (IPSTP) - STP in the IP Signaling Network 
   with IP Signaling Interface. It has its own Point Code, can perform 
   SS7/M3UA messages routing, screening and transfer. 

   Internal Signalling Gateway (Internal SG) - A SG which exists in MGW 
   physically or locates with MGW. 

   IP Signaling End Point (IPSEP) - A node in the M3UA network 
   associated with an originating or terminating local exchange (switch) 
   or a gateway exchange. 

2. Conventions 

   In this document, the keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL 
   NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and 
   OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

                Figure 4 Network Model fro IPSEP-IPSTP-STP. 

   In the above network model, IPSEP communicates with STP through IPSTP. 

3.1.2. Update Section 1.4.8. SCTP Client/Server Model 

   Add the Client/Server Model for IPSTP-IPSEP interface. 

   Add the following sentences as the third paragraph: In the case of 
   IPSTP to IPSEP communication, the default orientation would be for 
   the IPSTP to take on the role of  server while the IPSEP is the 
   client. In this case, IPSEP SHOULD initiate the SCTP association to 
   the IPSTP. 

3.2. Define the signalling network management function messages and 
   procedures 

3.2.1. Update Section 1.4 Functional Areas 

   Add M3UA signalling network management function as 1.4.9 1.4.9. M3UA 
   signalling network management function 

   For IPSEP,  

   - When IPSEP receives a M3UA layer DATA message, and finds that it 
   could not be sent to appointed upper layer user, IPSEP shall send 
   DUPU to the source point to indicate with the reason: Unknown, 
   Unequipped Remote User or Inaccessible Remote user. 

   - Shall support SCON/DUNA/DAVA message receiving, refer to 
   corresponding Procedure description.

   - Shall support DAUD message sending, refer to corresponding 
   Procedure description. 

   For IPSTP,  

   - Shall support the DUPU message receiving and handling 

   - When receiving TFC/TFA/TFP message, shall convert to corresponding 
   M3UA SSNM message to IPSEP.  

   - When adjacent IPSEP availability, congestion status change, shall 
   report it to IPSEP through SCON/DUNA/DAVA, to IPSTP/SEP/STP through 
   TFC/TFA/TFP. 

   - When adjacent SEP/STP/IPSTP availability, congestion status change, 
   shall report it to IPSEP through SCON/DUNA/DAVA. 

   - Shall support DAUD message receiving procedure. 

3.2.2. Update 3.4.5. Destination User Part Unavailable (DUPU) 

   The DUPU message is used by an SGP to inform concerned ASPs that a 
   remote peer MTP3-User Part (e.g., ISUP or SCCP) at an SS7 node is 
   unavailable.  

   This message is also used by IPSEP to inform IPSEP/SEP/IPSTP that its 
   corresponding user lary is unavailable. 

   Extend the DUPU message format. A new field is introduced to DUPU. 
   Concerned DPC: Destination DPC which has caused DUPU to be generated.  

   The field Concerned DPC has been defined in RFC3332 for SCON message, 
   tag is 0x0206. 

   The DUPU message contains the following parameters: 

     Network Appearance       Optional 

     Routing Context          Conditional 

     Affected Point Code      Mandatory 

     Concerned Destination    Mandatory

   Concerned Destination: 32 bits 

       The Concerned Destination parameter contains one Concerned 
       Destination Point Code field, a three-octet parameter to allow 
       for 14-, 16-, and 24-bit binary formatted SS7 Point Codes. A 
       Concerned Point Code that is less than 24 bits is padded on the 
       left to the 24-bit boundary.   

   When IPSEP receives a M3UA layer DATA message, and finds that it 
   could not be sent to appointed upper layer user, IPSEP will feedback 
   DUPU to the source point with the reason: Unknown, Unequipped Remote 
   User or Inaccessible Remote user.

   Point Code) shall be fulfilled in Concerned DPC Field. 

   Concerned DPC is like DPC in SS7 UPU. Because DUPU in M3UA is a SSNM 
   message, no DPC in this type of messages. So IPSTP/SG cann't know the 
   destination to transfer this DUPU. Currently because of this 
   shortcoming, DUPU handling is suspended in IPSTP/SG products, no real 
   usage. So shall extend DUPU like SCON, thus IPSTP/SG can know the 
   destinations of this message from Concerned DPC. 

   For internal SG, When it receives DUPU from IPSEP, it shall convert 
   it to UPU to SEP. When converting between DUPU and UPU, Concerned DPC 
   to DPC, affected PC to affected PC, user/cause to user/cause. 

3.2.3. Update Section 4 Procedures 

   Add one section for signalling network management procedures as 
   Section 4.x (x is between 5 and 6) 

   4.x. M3UA signalling network management procedures 

   4.x.1. Procedures to support DUPU in IPSEP-IPSTP interface 

   For the interface IPSEP-IPSTP, DUPU message transmission and 
   receiption procedures are as following: 

   When IPSEP receives a M3UA layer DATA message, and finds that it 
   could not be sent to appointed upper layer user, IPSEP will feedback 
   DUPU to the source point with the reason: Unknown, Unequipped Remote 
   User or Inaccessible Remote user.   

   The Procedure of DUPU message handling when IPSTP receives it:  

       - M3UA analyzes Concerned DPC field, if it is IPSTP's PC and user 
       is SCCP, reports to SCCP layer that Affected PC's SCCP is 
       unavailable. SCCP will not send SCCP message to this Affected PC 
       anymore.  

       - M3UA Parses Concerned DPC field, if it is not its own PC, 
       transmits it to corresponding signaling point(i.e. IPSEP or next 
       jump IPSTP) according to routing table. 

   The Procedure of DUPU message handling when IPSEP receives it:  

       - M3UA analyzes Concerned DPC field, if it is own PC, reports to 
       corresponding user layer that Affected PC's user layer is

       unavailable. User layer will not send this kind of messages to 
       the Affected PC again. 

   4.x.2 Procedures to support DUNA/DAVA/SCON/DAUD in IPSEP-IPSTP 
   interface 

   For IPSEP,  

   - Shall support SCON/DUNA/DAVA message receiving procedure, to RFC 
   4666 Section 4.5 for detail. 

   - Shall support DAUD message sending procedure, to RFC 4666 Section 
   4.5 for detail. 

   For IPSTP,  

   - When receiving TFC/TFA/TFP message, shall convert to corresponding 
   M3UA SSNM message to IPSEP.  

   - When adjacent IPSEP availability, congestion status change, shall 
   report it to IPSEP through SCON/DUNA/DAVA, to IPSTP/SEP/STP through 
   TFC/TFA/TFP. 

   - When adjacent SEP/STP/IPSTP availability, congestion status change, 
   shall report it to IPSEP through SCON/DUNA/DAVA. 

   - Shall support DAUD message receiving procedure, to RFC 4666 Section 
   4.5 for detail. 

3.3. Other Clarifications and Corrections 

3.3.1. Update Section 1.5. Sample Configuration 

   Add Section 1.5.x Sample Example X: BICC Transport between IPSPs

   This example shows Nc interface between two MSC Servers. In this 
   example, BICC messages are exchanged directly between two IP-resident 
   IPSPs through M3UA. In like manner, When M3UA layer delivers MTP-
   PAUSE, MTP-RESUME, and MTP-STATUS indication to BICC, it shall 
   consider SCTP association, IP network status, congestion information 
   etc. 

3.3.2. Update Section 3.1.4. Message Length: 32-Bits (Unsigned Integer) 

   Delete "Note: A receiver SHOULD accept the message whether or not the 
   final parameter padding is included in the message length." 

3.3.3. Update Section 3.4.3.  Destination State Audit (DAUD) 

   Add the sentence in the end of the Section 3.4.3. "For IPSEP, it 
   shall not send DAUD with its own Point Code. For IPSTP, if it 
   receives DAUD with the Affected Point Code parameter which is just 
   the source IPSEP's, it shall return this IPSEP's status." 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   This document provides a number of corrections and clarifications to 
   [1], but it does not make any changes with regard to the security 
   aspects of the protocol.  As a consequence, the security 
   considerations of [1] apply without additions.
