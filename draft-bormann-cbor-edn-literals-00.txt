   Application-Oriented Literals in CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation
                   draft-bormann-cbor-edn-literals-00

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation, CBOR (RFC 8949) defines a
   "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to converse about CBOR data
   items without having to resort to binary data.

   This document specifies how to add application-oriented extensions to
   the diagnostic notation.  It then defines two such extensions for the
   use of CBOR diagnostic notation with CoRAL and Constrained Resource
   Identifiers (draft-ietf-core-coral, draft-ietf-core-href).

1.  Introduction

   For the Concise Binary Object Representation, CBOR, Section 8 of
   [RFC8949] defines a "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to
   converse about CBOR data items without having to resort to binary
   data.  Diagnostic notation is based on JSON, with extensions for
   representing CBOR constructs such as binary data and tags.
   (Standardizing this together with the actual interchange format does
   not serve to create another interchange format, but enables the use
   of a shared diagnostic notation in tools for and documents about
   CBOR.)

   This document specifies how to add application-oriented extensions to
   the diagnostic notation.  It then defines two such extensions for the
   use of CBOR diagnostic notation with CoRAL and Constrained Resource
   Identifiers [I-D.ietf-core-coral] [I-D.ietf-core-href].

2.  Application-Oriented Extension Literals

   This document extends the syntax used in diagnostic notation for byte
   string literals to also be available for application-oriented
   extensions.

   As per Section 8 of [RFC8949], the diagnostic notation can notate
   byte strings in a number of [RFC4648] base encodings, where the
   encoded text is enclosed in single quotes, prefixed by an identifier
   (>h< for base16, >b32< for base32, >h32< for base32hex, >b64< for
   base64 or base64url).

   This syntax can be thought to establish a name space, with the names
   "h", "b32", "h32", and "b64" taken, but other names being
   unallocated.  The present specification defines additional names for
   this namespace, which we call _application-extension identifiers_.
   For the quoted string, the same rules apply as for byte strings.  In
   particular, the escaping rules of JSON strings are applied
   equivalently for application-oriented extensions, e.g., \\ stands for
   a single backslash and \' stands for a single quote.

   An application-extension identifier is a name consisting of a lower-
   case ASCII letter (a-z) and zero or more additional ASCII characters
   that are either lower-case letters or digits (a-z0-9).

   Application-extension identifiers are registered in a registry
   (Section 5).  Prefixing a single-quoted string, an application-
   extension identifier is used to build an application-oriented
   extension literal, which stands for a CBOR data item the value of
   which is derived from the text given in the single-quoted string
   using a procedure defined in the specification for an application-
   extension identifier.

   Examples for application-oriented extensions to CBOR diagnostic
   notation can be found in the following sections.

3.  The "cri" Extension

   The application-extension identifier "cri" is used to notate a
   Constrained Resource Identifier literal as per [I-D.ietf-core-href].

   The text of the literal is a URI Reference as per [RFC3986] or an IRI
   Reference as per [RFC3987].

   The value of the literal is a CRI that can be converted to the text
   of the literal using the procedure of Section 6.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-href].  Note that there may be more than one CRI that
   can be converted to the URI/IRI given; implementations are expected
   to favor the simplest variant available and make non-surprising
   choices otherwise.

   As an example, the CBOR diagnostic notation

   cri'https://example.com/bottarga/shaved'

Internet-Draft              CBOR EDN Literals               October 2021


   is equivalent to

   [-4, ["example", "com"], ["bottarga", "shaved"]]

4.  The "dt" Extension

   The application-extension identifier "dt" is used to notate a date/
   time literal that can be used as an Epoch-Based Date/Time as per
   Section 3.4.2 of [RFC8949].

   The text of the literal is a Standard Date/Time String as per
   Section 3.4.1 of [RFC8949].

   The value of the literal is a number representing the result of a
   conversion of the given Standard Date/Time String to an Epoch-Based
   Date/Time.  If fractional seconds are given in the text (production
   time-fraction in Appendix A of [RFC3339]), the value is a floating-
   point number; the value is an integer number otherwise.

   As an example, the CBOR diagnostic notation

   dt'1969-07-21T02:56:16Z'

   is equivalent to

   -14159024

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a registry [[where?]] for application-
   extension identifiers, with the initial content shown in Table 1.
