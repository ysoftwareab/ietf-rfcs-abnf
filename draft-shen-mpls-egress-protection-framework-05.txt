                    MPLS Egress Protection Framework
             draft-shen-mpls-egress-protection-framework-05

Abstract

   This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting IP/
   MPLS services and MPLS transport tunnels against egress node and
   egress link failures.  In this framework, the penultimate-hop router
   of an MPLS tunnel acts as the point of local repair (PLR) for egress
   node failure, and the egress router of the MPLS tunnel acts as the
   PLR for egress link failure.  Each of them pre-establishes a bypass
   tunnel to a protector.  Upon an egress node or link failure, the
   corresponding PLR performs local failure detection and local repair,
   by rerouting packets over the corresponding bypass tunnel.  The
   protector in turn performs context label switching or context IP
   forwarding to send the packets to ultimate service destination(s).
   This mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before global
   repair reacts to the failure and control plane protocols converge on
   the topology changes due to the failure.  The framework is applicable
   to all types of IP/MPLS services and MPLS tunnels.  Under the
   framework, service protocol extensions may be further specified to
   support service label distribution to protector.

1.  Introduction

   In MPLS networks, LSPs (label switched paths) are widely used as
   transport tunnels to carry IP and MPLS services across MPLS domains.
   Examples of MPLS services are layer-2 VPNs, layer-3 VPNs,
   hierarchical LSPs, and others.  In general, a tunnel may carry
   multiple services of one or multiple types, given that the tunnel can
   satisfy both individual and aggregate requirements (e.g.  CoS, QoS)
   of these services.  The egress router of the tunnel must host the
   corresponding service instances of the services.  An MPLS service
   instance is responsible for forwarding service packets via an egress
   link to the service destination, based on a service label.  An IP
   service instance is responsible for forwarding service packets via an
   egress link to the service destination, based on IP destination
   address.  The egress link is often called a PE-CE (provider edge -
   customer edge) link or attachment circuit (AC).

   Today, local repair based fast reroute mechanisms [RFC4090],
   [RFC5286], [RFC7490], [RFC7812] have been widely deployed to protect
   MPLS tunnels against transit link/node failures.  They can achieve
   fast restoration of traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds.
   Local repair refers to the scenario where the router (aka.  PLR, i.e.
   point of local repair) upstream adjacent to an anticipated failure
   pre-establishes a bypass tunnel to the router (aka.  MP, i.e. merge
   point) downstream of the failure, and pre-installs the forwarding
   state of the bypass tunnel in the data plane.  The PLR also uses a
   rapid mechanism (e.g. link layer OAM, BFD, and others) to locally
   detect the failure in the data plane.  When the failure occurs, the
   PLR reroutes traffic through the bypass tunnel to the MP, allowing
   the traffic to continue to flow to the tunnel's egress router.

   This document describes a fast reroute framework for egress node and
   egress link protection.  Similar to transit link/node protection,
   this framework relies on a PLR to perform local failure detection and
   local repair.  In egress node protection, the PLR is the penultimate-
   hop router of a tunnel.  In egress link protection, the PLR is the
   egress router of the tunnel.  The framework relies on a so-called

Internet-Draft      MPLS Egress Protection Framework           July 2017


   "protector" to serve as the tailend of bypass tunnels.  The protector
   is a router that hosts some "protection service instances" and has
   its own connectivity or paths to service destinations.  When a PLR
   does local repair, the protector is responsible for performing
   "context label switching" for rerouted MPLS service packets and
   "context IP forwarding" for rerouted IP service packets.  Thus, the
   service packets can continue to reach service destinations with
   minimum disruption.

   This framework considers an egress node failure as a failure of a
   tunnel, as well as a failure of all the services carried by the
   tunnel, because service packets can no longer reach the service
   instances on the egress router.  Therefore, the framework addresses
   egress node protection at both tunnel level and service level
   simultaneously.  Likewise, the framework considers an egress link
   failure as a failure of all the services traversing the link, and
   addresses egress link protection at service level.

   This framework requires that the destination (a CE or site) of a
   service must be dual-homed or have dual paths to an MPLS network,
   normally via two MPLS edge routers.  One of them is the egress router
   of the service's transport tunnel, and the other is a backup egress
   router.  In the "co-located" protector mode in this document, the
   backup egress router serves as a protector, and each service instance
   hosted on the router acts as a protection instance.  In the
   "centralized" protector mode (Section 5.14), a protector and a backup
   egress router may be decoupled, and each service instance on the
   backup egress router is simply considered as a "backup service
   instance".

   The framework is described by mainly referring to P2P (point-to-
   point) tunnels.  However, it is equally applicable to P2MP (point-to-
   multipoint), MP2P (multipoint-to-point) and MP2MP (multipoint-to-
   multipoint) tunnels, when a sub-LSP can be viewed as a P2P tunnel.

   The framework is a multi-service and multi-transport framework.  It
   is applicable to all existing and future types of MPLS tunnels and
   IP/MPLS services.  It does not require extensions for the existing
   signaling and label distribution protocols (e.g.  RSVP, LDP, BGP,
   etc.) of MPLS tunnels, because transport tunnels and bypass tunnels
   are expected to be established by using the generic mechanisms
   provided by the protocols.  However, the framework does not preclude
   future extensions to the protocols which may facilitate the
   procedures.  One example of such extension is [RSVP-EP].  The
   framework may need extensions for IGPs and service label distribution
   protocols, to support protection establishment and context label
   switching.  This document provides guidelines for these extensions,
   but the specific details should be addressed in separate documents.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

3.  Terminology

   Egress router - A router at the egress endpoint of a tunnel.  It
   hosts service instances for all the services carried by the tunnel,
   and has connectivity with the destinations of the services.

   Egress node failure - A node failure of an egress router.

   Egress link failure - A failure of the egress link (e.g.  PE-CE link,
   attachment circuit) of a service.

   Egress failure - An egress node failure or an egress link failure.

   Egress-protected tunnel - A tunnel whose egress router is protected
   by a mechanism according to this framework.  The egress router is
   hence called a protected egress router.

   Egress-protected service - An IP or MPLS service which is carried by
   an egress-protected tunnel, and hence protected by a mechanism
   according to this framework.

   Backup egress router - Given an egress-protected tunnel and its
   egress router, this is another router which has connectivity with all
   or a subset of the destinations of the egress-protected services
   carried by the egress-protected tunnel.  In this framework, the
   service instances on this router are called backup service instances,
   and the corresponding services are called backup services.

   Backup service instance - A service instance which is hosted by a
   backup egress router, and corresponding to an egress-protected
   service on a protected egress router.

   Protector - A role acted by a router as an alternate of a protected
   egress router, to handle service packets in the event of an egress
   failure.  It protects an egress-protected tunnel, and hosts
   protection service instances for the egress-protected services
   carried by the tunnel.  A protector may or may not be physically co-
   located with or decoupled from a backup egress router, depending on
   the co-located or centralized protector mode.

   Protection service instance - A service instance hosted by a
   protector, protecting the service instance of an egress-protected

   service on a protected egress router.  A protection service instance
   is a backup service instance, if the protector is co-located with a
   backup egress router.

   PLR - A router at point of local repair.  In egress node protection,
   it is the penultimate-hop router on an egress-protected tunnel.  In
   egress link protection, it is the egress router of the egress-
   protected tunnel.

   Protected egress {E, P} - A virtual node consisting of an ordered
   pair of egress router E and protector P.  It serves as the virtual
   destination for an egress-protected tunnel.  It also serves as the
   virtual location of service instances for the egress-protected
   services carried by the tunnel.

   Context identifier (ID) - A globally unique IP address assigned to a
   protected egress {E, P}.

   Context label - A non-reserved label assigned to a context ID by a
   protector.

   Egress-protection bypass tunnel - A tunnel used for rerouting service
   packets around an egress failure.  In egress node protection, it is
   established from a penultimate-hop router (i.e.  PLR) to a protector,
   bypassing a protected egress router.  In egress link protection, it
   is established from a protected egress router (i.e.  PLR) to a
   protector, bypassing an egress link.

   Co-located protector mode - The scenario where a protector and a
   backup egress router are co-located as one router, and hence each
   backup service instance serves as a protection service instance.

   Centralized protector mode - The scenario where protector is a
   dedicated router, and is decoupled from backup egress routers.

   Context label switching - Label switching performed by a protector,
   in the label space of an egress router indicated by a context label.

   Context IP forwarding - IP forwarding performed by a protector, in
   the IP address space of an egress router indicated by a context
   label.

4.  Requirements

   This document considers the followings as requirements of the egress
   protection framework.

   o  The framework must be based on local failure detection and local
      repair, in a manner similar to transit link/node protection.

   o  The framework must support P2P tunnels.  It should equally support
      P2MP, MP2P and MP2MP tunnels, by treating each sub-LSP as a P2P
      tunnel.

   o  The framework must support multi-service and multi-transport
      networks.  It must accommodate existing and future signaling and
      label-distribution protocols of tunnels and bypass tunnels,
      including RSPV, LDP, BGP, IGP, segment routing, and others.  It
      must also accommodate existing and future IP/MPLS services,
      including layer-2 VPNs, layer-3 VPNs, hierarchical LSP, and
      others.  It must provide a generic solution for environments where
      different types of services and tunnels may co-exist.

   o  The framework must consider minimizing disruption for deployment.
      It should only involve routers around egress, and be transparent
      to ingress routers and other transit routers.

   o  In egress node protection, for scalability and performance, a PLR
      must be agnostic with services and service labels, like PLRs in
      transit link/node protection.  It must maintain bypass tunnels and
      bypass forwarding state on a per-transport-tunnel basis, rather
      than per-service-destination or per-service-label basis.  It
      should also support bypass tunnel sharing between transport
      tunnels.

   o  A PLR must be able to use its local visibility or information of
      routing and/or TE topology to compute or resolve path for a bypass
      tunnel to a protector.

   o  A protector must be able to perform context label switching for
      rerouted MPLS service packets, based on service label(s) assigned
      by an egress router.  It must be able to perform context IP
      forwarding for rerouted IP service packets, in the public or
      private IP address space used by an egress router.

   o  The framework must be able to work seamlessly with transit link/
      node protection mechanisms to achieve end-to-end coverage.

   o  The framework must be able to work in conjunction with global
      repair and control plane convergence.

5.2.  Egress node failure

   An egress node failure refers to the failure of an MPLS tunnel's
   egress router.  At service level, it also means a service instance
   failure for each IP/MPLS service carried by the tunnel.

   All the local failure detection mechanisms used by PLRs in transit
   link/node protection are applicable to egress node failure detection.
   In a case where a PLR does not have a fast and reliable mechanism to
   detect a node failure or distinguish between a link failure and a
   node failure, it may conservatively treat a link failure as a node
   failure and trigger egress node protection.

5.3.  Protector and PLR

   A router is assigned to the "protector" role to protect a tunnel and
   the services carried by the tunnel against an egress node failure.
   The protector is responsible for hosting a protection service
   instance for each protected service, serving as the tailend of a
   bypass tunnel, and performing context label switching and/or context
   IP forwarding for rerouted service packets.

   A tunnel can be protected by only one protector at a given time.
   Multiple tunnels to a given egress router may be protected by a
   common protector or different protectors.  A protector may protect
   multiple tunnels with a common egress router or different egress
   routers.

   For each tunnel, its penultimate-hop router acts as a PLR.  The PLR
   pre-establishes a bypass tunnel to the protector, and pre-installs
   bypass forwarding state in the data plane.  Upon detection of an
   egress node failure, the PLR reroutes all the service packets
   received on the tunnel though the bypass tunnel to the protector.
   For MPLS service packets, the PLR keeps service labels intact in the
   packets.  The protector in turn forwards the rerouted service packets
   towards the ultimate service destinations.  Specifically, it performs
   context label switching for MPLS service packets, based on service
   labels assigned by the protected egress router; It performs context
   IP forwarding for IP service packets, based on their destination
   addresses.  The protector must have its own connectivity with each
   service destination, via a direct link or a multi-hop path, which
   must not traverse the protected egress router or be affected by the
   egress node failure.  This also requires that each service
   destination must be dual-homed or have dual paths to the egress
   router and a backup egress router which serves as the protector.
   Each protection service instance on the protector relies on such
   connectivity to set up forwarding state for context label switching
   and/or context IP forwarding.

5.4.  Protected egress

   This document introduces the notion of "protected egress" as a
   virtual node consisting of the egress router E of a tunnel and a
   protector P.  It is denoted by an ordered pair of {E, P}, indicating
   the primary-and-protector relationship between the two routers.  It
   serves as the virtual destination of the tunnel, and the virtual
   location of service instances for the services carried by the tunnel.
   The tunnel and services are considered as being "associated" with the
   protected egress {E, P}.

   A given egress router E may be the tailend of multiple tunnels.  In
   general, the tunnels may be protected by multiple protectors, e.g.
   P1, P2, and so on, with each Pi protecting a subset of the tunnels.
   Thus, these routers form multiple protected egress', i.e. {E, P1} ,
   {E, P2}, and so on.  Each tunnel is associated with one and only one
   protected egress {E, Pi}. All the services carried by the tunnel are
   then automatically associated with the same protected egress {E, Pi}.
   Conversely, a service associated with a protected egress {E, Pi} must
   be carried by a tunnel associated with the same protected egress {E,
   Pi}. This mapping must be ensured by the ingress router of the tunnel
   and the service (Section 5.7).

   Two routers X and Y may be protectors for each other.  In this case,
   they form two distinct protected egress {X, Y} and {Y, X}.

5.5.  Egress-protected tunnel

   A tunnel, which is associated with a protected egress {E, P}, is
   called an egress-protected tunnel.  It is associated with one and
   only one protected egress {E, P}. Multiple egress-protected tunnels
   may be associated with a given protected egress {E, P}. In this case,
   they share the common egress router and protector, but may or may not
   share a common ingress router, a common path, or a common PLR.

   An egress-protected tunnel is considered as logically "destined" for
   its protected egress {E, P}. However, its path must be resolved and
   established with E as the physical tailend.

5.6.  Egress-protected service

   A service, which is associated with a protected egress {E, P}, is
   called an egress-protected service.  The egress router E hosts the
   primary instance of the service, and the protector P hosts the
   protection instance.

   An egress-protected service is associated with one and only one
   protected egress {E, P}. Multiple egress-protected services may be
   associated with a given protected egress {E, P}. In this case, these
   services share the common egress router and protector, but may or may
   not share a common egress-protected tunnel or a common ingress
   router.

5.7.  Egress-protected service to egress-protected tunnel mapping

   An egress-protected service must be mapped to an egress-protected
   tunnel by its ingress router, based on the common protected egress
   {E, P} of the service and the tunnel.  This is achieved by

   introducing the notion of "context ID" for protected egress {E, P},
   as described in (Section 5.9).

5.8.  Egress-protection bypass tunnel

   An egress-protected tunnel destined for a protected egress {E, P}
   must have a bypass tunnel from its PLR to the protector P.  This
   bypass tunnel is called an egress-protection bypass tunnel.  The
   bypass tunnel is considered as logically "destined" for the protected
   egress {E, P}. However, due to its bypass tunnel nature, it MUST be
   resolved and established with P as the physical tailend and E as the
   node to avoid.  The bypass tunnel MUST have the property that it
   should not be affected by any topology change caused by an egress
   node failure.

   An egress-protection bypass tunnel is associated with one and only
   one protected egress {E, P}. A PLR may share an egress-protection
   bypass tunnel between multiple egress-protected tunnels associated
   with a common protected egress {E, P}. For multiple egress-protected
   tunnels associated with a common protected egress {E, P}, there may
   be one or multiple egress-protection bypass tunnels from one or
   multiple PLRs to the protector P, depending on the paths of the
   egress-protected tunnels.

5.9.  Context ID, context label, and context based forwarding

   In this framework, a globally unique IPv4/v6 address is assigned to a
   protected egress {E, P} to serve as the identifier of the protected
   egress {E, P}. It is called a "context ID" due to its specific usage
   in context label switching and context IP forwarding on the
   protector.  It is an IP address that is logically owned by both the
   egress router and the protector.  For the egress node, it indicates
   the protector.  For the protector, it indicates the egress router,
   particularly the egress router's forwarding context.  For other
   routers in the network, it is an address reachable via both the
   egress router and the protector in routing domain and TE domain
   (Section 5.10).

   The main purpose of a context ID is to coordinate ingress router,
   egress router, PLR and protector in setting up egress protection.
   Given an egress-protected service associated with a protected egress
   {E, P}, its context ID is used as below:

   o  If the service is an MPLS service, when E distributes a service
      label binding message to the ingress router, E attaches the
      context ID to the message.  If the service is an IP service, when
      E advertises the service destination address to the ingress
      router, E also attaches the context ID to the advertisement

      message.  How the context ID is encoded in the messages is a
      choice of the service protocol, and may need protocol extensions
      to define a dedicated "context ID" object.

   o  The ingress router uses the context ID as destination to establish
      or resolve an egress-protected tunnel.  The ingress router then
      maps the service to the tunnel for transportation.

   o  The context ID is conveyed to the PLR by the signaling protocol of
      the egress-protected tunnel, or learned by the PLR via an IGP or
      topology-driven label distribution protocol.  The PLR uses the
      context ID as destination to establish or resolve an egress-
      protection bypass tunnel to P while avoiding E.

   o  P maintains a dedicated label space or a dedicated IP address
      space for E, depending on whether the service is MPLS or IP.  This
      is referred to as "E's label space" or "E's IP address space",
      respectively.  P uses the context ID to identify the space.

   o  If the service is an MPLS service, E also distributes the service
      label binding message to P.  This is the same label binding
      message that E advertises to the ingress router, attached with the
      context ID.  Based on the context ID, P installs the service label
      in an MPLS forwarding table corresponding to E's label space.  If
      the service is an IP service, P installs an IP route in an IP
      forwarding table corresponding to E's IP address space.  In either
      case, the protection service instance on P interprets the service
      and constructs forwarding state for the route based on P's own
      connectivity to the service's destination.

   o  P assigns a non-reserved label to the context ID.  In the data
      plane, this label represents the context ID and indicates E's
      label space and IP address space.  Therefore, it is called a
      "context label".

   o  The PLR may establish the egress-protection bypass tunnel to P in
      several manners.  If the bypass tunnel is established by RSVP, the
      PLR signals the bypass tunnel with the context ID as destination,
      and P binds the context label to the bypass tunnel.  If the bypass
      tunnel is established by LDP, P advertises the context label for
      the context ID as an IP prefix FEC.  If the bypass tunnel is
      established by the PLR in a hierarchical manner, the PLR treats
      the context label as a one-hop LSP over a regular bypass tunnel to
      P (e.g. a bypass tunnel to P's loopback IP address).  If the
      bypass tunnel is constructed by using segment routing, the bypass
      tunnel is represented by a stack of SID labels with the context
      label as the inner-most SID label (Section 5.11).  In any case,

      the bypass tunnel is a UHP tunnel whose incoming label at P is the
      context label.

   o  During local repair, all the service packets received by P on the
      bypass tunnel will have the context label as top label.  P will
      first pop the context label.  For an MPLS service packet, P will
      further look up the service label in E's label space indicated by
      the context label, which is called context label switching.  For
      an IP service packet, P will look up the IP destination address in
      E's IP address space indicated by the context label, which is
      called context IP forwarding.

5.10.  IGP advertisement and path resolution for context ID

   Path resolution or computation for context ID is done on ingress
   routers for egress-protected tunnels, and on PLRs for egress-
   protection bypass tunnels.  Therefore, given a protected egress {E,
   P} and its context ID, E and P must coordinate in IGP advertisement
   for the context ID in routing domain and TE domain.  The context ID
   must be advertised in such a manner that any egress-protected tunnels
   MUST have E as tailend, and any egress-protection bypass tunnels MUST
   have P as tailend while avoiding E.

   This document suggests two approaches:

   1.  The first approach is called "proxy mode".  It requires E and P,
       but not PLR, to have the knowledge of the egress protection
       schema.  E and P advertise the context ID as a virtual proxy node
       (i.e. a logical node) connected to the two routers, with the link
       between the proxy node and E having more preferable IGP and TE
       metrics than the link between the proxy node and P.  Therefore,
       all egress-protected tunnels destined for the context ID should
       automatically follow the shortest IGP or TE paths to E.  Each PLR
       will no longer view itself as a penultimate-hop, but rather two
       hops away from the proxy node, via E.  The PLR will be able to
       find a bypass path via P to the proxy node, while the bypass
       tunnel should actually be terminated by P.

   2.  The second approach is called "alias mode".  It requires P and
       PLR, but not E, to have the knowledge of the egress protection
       schema.  E simply advertises the context ID as a regular IP
       address.  P advertises the context ID and the context label by
       using a "context ID label binding" advertisement.  The
       advertisement must be understood by the PLR.  In both routing
       domain and TE domain, the context ID is only reachable via E.
       This ensures that all egress-protected tunnels destined for the
       context ID should have E as tailend.  Based on the "context ID
       label binding" advertisement, the PLR can establish an egress-

       protection bypass tunnel in several manners (Section 5.11).  The
       "context ID label binding" advertisement may use the IGP
       extensions for IGP mirroring context segment described in
       [SR-ARCH], [SR-OSPF] and [SR-ISIS].

5.11.  Egress-protection bypass tunnel establishment

   A PLR must know the context ID of a protected egress {E, P} in order
   to establish an egress-protection bypass tunnel.  The information is
   obtained from the signaling or label distribution protocol of egress-
   protected tunnel.  The PLR may or may not need to have the knowledge
   of egress protection schema.  All it does is to set up a bypass
   tunnel to a context ID while avoiding the next-hop router (i.e.
   egress router).  As the context ID is advertised in routing domain
   and TE domain by IGP according to Section 5.10, the PLR should be
   able to resolve or establish such a bypass path with the protector as
   tailend.  In some cases like the proxy mode, the PLR may do so in the
   same manner as transit node protection.

   An egress-protection bypass tunnel may be established via several
   methods:

   [1] It may be established by a signaling protocol (e.g.  RSVP), with
   the context ID as destination.  The protector binds the context label
   to the bypass tunnel.

   [2] It may be formed by a topology driven protocol (e.g.  LDP).  The
   protector advertises the context ID as an IP prefix FEC, and binds
   the context label to it.

   [3] It may be constructed as a hierarchical tunnel.  When the
   protector uses the alias mode (Section 5.10), the PLR will have the
   knowledge of the context ID, context label, and protector (i.e. the
   advertiser).  The PLR can then establish the bypass tunnel in a
   hierarchical manner, with the context label as a one-hop LSP over a
   regular bypass tunnel to the protector's IP address (e.g. loopback
   address).  This regular bypass tunnel may be established by RSVP,
   LDP, and others.

   [4] It may be constructed by using segment routing.  In this case,
   the protector uses the alias mode (Section 5.10), and advertises the
   context ID and context label binding as an IGP mirroring context
   segment.  The PLR can then construct the bypass tunnel as a stack of
   SID labels, with the context label as the inner-most SID label.

5.12.  Local Repair on PLR

   In this framework, a PLR is agnostic with services and services
   labels.  This obviates the need to maintain bypass forwarding state
   on per-service basis, and allows bypass tunnel sharing between
   egress-protected tunnels.  During local repair, the PLR simply
   reroutes all service packets received on a tunnel to the
   corresponding bypass tunnel.  Service labels remain intact in MPLS
   service packets.

   Label operation during the rerouting depends on the bypass tunnel's
   characteristics.  If the bypass tunnel is a single level tunnel, the
   rerouting will involve swapping the incoming label of the egress-
   protected tunnel to the outgoing label of the bypass tunnel.  If the
   bypass tunnel is a hierarchical tunnel, the rerouting will involve
   swapping the incoming label of the egress-protected tunnel to a
   context label, and pushing the outgoing label of a regular bypass
   tunnel.  If the bypass tunnel is constructed by segment routing, the
   rerouting will involve swapping the incoming label of the egress-
   protected tunnel to a stack of SID labels, with a context label as
   the inner-most SID label.

5.13.  Service label distribution from egress router to protector

   As mentioned in previous sections, when a protector receives a
   rerouted MPLS service packet, it performs context label switching
   based on the packet's service label which is assigned by the
   corresponding egress router.  In order to achieve this, the protector
   MUST maintain such kind of service labels in dedicated label spaces
   on a per protected egress {E, P} basis, i.e. one label space for each
   egress router that it protects.

   Also, there must be a session of service label distribution protocol
   between each egress router and the protector.  Through this protocol,
   the protector learns the label binding of each egress-protected
   service.  This is the same label binding that the egress router
   advertises to the corresponding ingress router, attached with a
   context ID.  The corresponding protection service instance on the
   protector recognizes the service, and resolves forwarding state based
   on its own connectivity with the service's destination.  It then
   installs the service label with the forwarding state in the label
   space of the egress router, which is indicated by the context ID
   (i.e. context label).

   Different service protocols may use different mechanisms for such
   kind of label distribution.  Specific protocol extensions may be
   needed on a per-protocol basis or per-service-type basis.  The

   specific details of the extensions SHOULD be specified in separate
   documents.

5.14.  Centralized protector mode

   In this framework, it is assumed that the service destination of an
   egress-protected service MUST be dual-homed to two edge routers of an
   MPLS network.  One of them is the protected egress router, and the
   other is a backup egress router.  So far in this document, the
   discussion has been focusing on the scenario where a protector and a
   backup egress router are co-located as one router.  Therefore, the
   number of protectors in a network is the number of backup egress
   routers.  As another scenario, a network may assign a small number of
   routers to serve as dedicated protectors, each protecting a subset of
   egress routers.  These protectors are called centralized protectors.

   Topologically, a centralized protector may be decoupled from all
   backup egress routers, or it may be co-located with one backup egress
   router while decoupled from the other backup egress routers.  The
   procedures in this section assume the scenario where a protector and
   a backup egress router are decoupled.

                                 Figure 2

   Like a co-located protector, a centralized protector hosts protection
   service instances, receives rerouted service packets from PLRs, and
   performs context label switching and/or context IP forwarding.  For
   each service, instead of sending service packets directly to the
   service destination, the protector MUST send them via another
   transport tunnel to the corresponding backup service instance on a
   backup egress router.  The backup service instance in turn forwards
   them to the service destination.  Specifically, in the case of an
   MPLS service, the protector MUST swap the service label in each
   received service packet to the label of the backup service advertised
   by the backup egress router, and then push a label (or label stack)
   of the transport tunnel.

   In order for a centralized protector to map an egress-protected MPLS
   service to a service hosted on a backup egress router, there MUST be
   a session of service label distribution protocol between the backup
   egress router and the protector.  Through this session, the backup
   egress router advertises the service label of the backup service,
   attached with the FEC of the egress-protected service and the context
   ID of the protected egress {E, P}. Based on this information, the
   protector associates the egress-protected service with the backup
   service, resolves or establishes a transport tunnel to the backup

   egress router, and accordingly sets up forwarding state for the label
   of the egress-protected service in the label space of the egress
   router.

   The service label which the backup egress router advertises to the
   protector can be the same as the label which the backup egress router
   advertises to ingress router(s), if and only if the forwarding state
   of the label does not direct service packets towards the protected
   egress router.  Otherwise, the label is not usable for egress
   protection, because it will loop rerouted service packets back to the
   egress router, which must be avoided.  In this case, the backup
   egress router MUST advertise a unique service label dedicated for
   egress protection, and set its forwarding state to use the backup
   egress router's connectivity with the service destination.

6.  Egress link protection

   Egress link protection is achievable through similar procedures to
   that of egress node protection.  In normal situations, an egress
   router forwards service packets to a service destination based on a
   service label, whose forwarding state points to an egress link.  In
   egress link protection, the egress router acts as PLR, by performing
   local failure detection and local repair.  Specifically, the egress
   router pre-establishes an egress-protection bypass tunnel to a
   protector, and installs bypass forwarding state for the service
   label, pointing to the bypass tunnel.  During local repair, the
   egress router reroutes service packets via the bypass tunnel to the
   protector.  The protector in turn forwards the packets to the service
   destination (in the co-located protector mode, as shown in Figure-3),
   or forwards the packets first to a backup egress router and then to
   the service destination (in the centralized protector mode, as shown
   in Figure-4).

                                 Figure 4

   There are two approaches to set up the bypass forwarding state on the
   egress router, depending on the service label distribution mode of
   the given service.  The difference is that one approach requires the
   protector to perform context label switching, and the other one does
   not.  Therefore, the first approach is more consistent with egress
   node protection, and hence recommended.

      [1] The first approach applies when the egress router does not
      know the service label advertised by the backup egress router.  In
      this case, the egress router sets up the bypass forwarding state
      as a label push with the outgoing label of the egress-protection
      bypass tunnel.  Rerouted packets will have the egress router's
      service label intact.  Therefore, the protector MUST perform
      context label switching, and the bypass tunnel MUST be destined
      for the context ID of the {egress router, protector} and
      established as described in Section 5.11.  With this approach, a
      protector can serve both egress node protection and egress link
      protection in a consistent manner, and both the co-located
      protector mode and the centralized protector mode may be used
      (Figure-3 and Figure-4).

      [2] The second approach applies when the egress router knows the
      service label advertised by the backup egress router.  This is
      often the case where the type of service uses BGP as the service
      label distribution protocol.  Since BGP normally distributes
      service labels over a full mesh of sessions between all PEs, the
      egress router can automatically learn the service label of the
      backup egress router.  In this case, the backup egress router
      serves as the protector for egress link protection, regardless of
      the protector of egress node protection, which should be the same
      router in the co-located protector mode but may be a different
      router in the centralized protector mode.  The egress router sets
      up the bypass forwarding state as a label swap from the incoming
      service label to the service label of the protector, followed by a
      label push with the outgoing label of the egress link protection
      bypass tunnel.  The bypass tunnel is a regular tunnel destined for
      an IP address of the protector, instead of the context ID of the
      {egress router, protector}. The protector will simply forward
      rerouted service packets based on its own service label, rather
      than performing context label switching.  With this approach, only
      the co-located protector mode is applicable.

   In a network where different types of services co-exist, the two
   approaches may be used in parallel, or the approach [1] may be used
   consistently for all types of services.

   Note that for a bidirectional service, the physical link of an egress
   link may carry service traffic bi-directionally.  Therefore, a
   failure of the physical link may be considered as an egress link
   failure for the traffic towards the service destination, as well as
   an ingress link failure for the traffic in the opposite direction.
   However, protection for ingress link failure should be provided by a
   separate mechanism, and hence is out of the scope of this framework.

7.  Global repair

   This framework provides a fast but temporary repair for egress node/
   link failures.  For permanent repair, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   traffic SHOULD be moved to an alternative tunnel or alternative
   services which are fully functional.  This is referred to as global
   repair.  Possible triggers of global repair include control plane
   notifications of tunnel and service status, end-to-end OAM and fault
   detection at tunnel or service levels, and others.  The alternative
   tunnel and services may be pre-established as standby, or newly
   established as a result of the triggers or network protocol
   convergence.

8.  Example: Layer-3 VPN egress protection

   This section shows an example of egress protection for a layer-3 VPN.

                         \           |               |    /
                          ---------- R2 ----------- PE3 -
                                                (protector)


                                 Figure 5

   In this example, the site 1 of a given VPN is attached to PE1, and
   site 2 is dual-homed to PE2 and PE3.  PE2 is the primary PE for site
   2, and PE3 is the backup PE.  Every PE hosts a VPN instance.  R1 and
   R2 are transit routers in the MPLS network.  The network uses OSPF as
   routing protocol, and RSVP-TE as tunnel signaling protocol.  The PEs
   use BGP to exchange VPN prefixes and VPN labels between each other.

   Using the framework in this document, the network assigns PE3 to be a
   protector for PE2 to protect the VPN traffic in the direction from
   site 1 to site 2.  This is the co-located protector mode.  Hence, PE2
   and PE3 form a protected egress {PE2, PE3}. A context ID 1.1.1.1 is
   assigned to the protected egress {PE2, PE3}. The VPN instance on PE3
   serves as a protection instance for the VPN instance on PE2.  On PE3,
   a context label 100 is assigned to the context ID, and a label table
   pe2.mpls is created to represent PE2's label space.  PE3 installs the
   label 100 in its default MPLS forwarding table, with nexthop pointing
   to the label table pe2.mpls.  PE2 and PE3 are coordinated to use the
   proxy mode to advertise the context ID in routing domain and TE
   domain.

   PE2 uses per-VRF VPN label allocation mode.  It assigns a single
   label 9000 to the VRF of the VPN.  For a given VPN prefix 9.0.0.0/8
   in site 2, PE2 advertises it along with the label 9000 and other
   attributes to PE1 and PE3 via BGP.  In particular, the NEXT_HOP
   attribute is set to the context ID 1.1.1.1.

   Similarly, PE3 also uses per-VRF VPN label allocation mode.  It
   assigns a single label 10000 to the VRF of the VPN.  For the VPN

   prefix 9.0.0.0/8 in site 2, PE3 advertises it along with the label
   10000 and other attributes to PE1 and PE2 via BGP.  In particular,
   the NEXT_HOP attribute is set to an IP address of PE3.

   Upon receipt and acceptance of the BGP advertisement, PE1 uses the
   context ID 1.1.1.1 as destination to compute a TE path for an egress-
   protected tunnel.  The resulted path is PE1->R1->PE2.  PE1 then uses
   RSVP to signal the tunnel, with the context ID 1.1.1.1 as
   destination, and with the "node protection desired" flag set in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE of RSVP Path message.  Once the tunnel comes up,
   PE1 maps the VPN prefix 9.0.0.0/8 to the tunnel and installs a route
   for the prefix in the corresponding VRF.  The route's nexthop is a
   push with the VPN label 9000, followed by a push with the outgoing
   label of the egress-protected tunnel.

   Upon receipt of the above BGP advertisement from PE2, PE3 (i.e. the
   protector) recognizes the context ID 1.1.1.1 in the NEXT_HOP
   attribute, and installs a route for label 9000 in the label table
   pe2.mpls.  PE3 sets the route's nexthop to a "protection VRF".  This
   protection VRF contains IP routes corresponding to the IP prefixes in
   the dual-homed site 2, including 9.0.0.0/8.  The nexthops of these
   routes MUST be based on PE3's connectivity with site 2, even if this
   connectivity is not the best path in PE3's VRF due to metrics (e.g.
   MED, loc preference, etc.), and MUST NOT use any path traversing PE2.
   Note that the protection VRF is a logical concept, and it may simply
   be PE3's own VRF if the VRF satisfies the requirement.

8.1.  Egress node protection

   R1, i.e. the penultimate-hop router of the egress-protected tunnel,
   serves as the PLR for egress node protection.  Based on the "node
   protection desired" flag and the destination address (i.e. context ID
   1.1.1.1) of the tunnel, R1 computes a bypass path to 1.1.1.1 while
   avoiding PE2.  The resulted bypass path is R1->R2->PE3.  R1 then
   signals the path (i.e. egress-protection bypass tunnel), with 1.1.1.1
   as destination.

   Upon receipt of an RSVP Path message of the egress-protection bypass
   tunnel, PE3 recognizes the context ID 1.1.1.1 as the destination, and
   hence responds with the context label 100 in an RSVP Resv message.

   After the egress-protection bypass tunnel comes up, R1 installs a
   bypass nexthop for the egress-protected tunnel.  The bypass nexthop
   is a swap from the incoming label of the egress-protected tunnel to
   the outgoing label of the egress-protection bypass tunnel.

   When R1 detects a failure of PE2, it will invoke the above bypass
   nexthop to reroute VPN service packets.  The packets will have the

Internet-Draft      MPLS Egress Protection Framework           July 2017


   label of the bypass tunnel as outer label, and the VPN label 9000 as
   inner label.  When the packets arrive at PE3, they will have the
   context label 100 as outer label, and the VPN label 9000 as inner
   label.  The context label will first be popped, and then the VPN
   label will be looked up in the label table pe2.mpls.  The lookup will
   cause the VPN label to be popped, and the IP packets will finally be
   forwarded to site 2 based on the protection VRF.

8.2.  Egress link protection

   PE2 serves as the PLR for egress link protection.  It has already
   learned the VPN label 10000 from PE3, and hence it uses the approach
   [2] described in Section 6 to set up bypass forwarding state.  It
   signals an egress-protection bypass tunnel to PE3, by using the path
   PE2->R3->PE3, and PE3's IP address as destination.  After the bypass
   tunnel comes up, PE2 installs a bypass nexthop for the VPN label
   9000.  The bypass nexthop is a label swap from the incoming label
   9000 to the VPN label 10000 of PE3, followed by a label push with the
   outgoing label of the bypass tunnel.

   When PE3 detects a failure of the egress link, it will invoke the
   above bypass nexthop to reroute VPN service packets.  The packets
   will have the label of the bypass tunnel as outer label, and the VPN
   label 10000 as inner label.  When the packets arrive at PE3, the VPN
   label 10000 will be popped, and the IP packets will be forwarded
   based on the VRF indicated by on the VPN label 10000.

8.3.  Global repair

   Eventually, global repair will take effect, as control plane
   protocols converge on the new topology.  PE1 will choose PE3 as new
   entrance to site 2.  Before that happens, the VPN traffic has been
   protected by the above local repair.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no request for new IANA allocation.

10.  Security Considerations

   As with any kind of fast reroute mechanisms, the framework in this
   document relies on traffic rerouting around a network failure.
   Specifically, service traffic can be temporarily rerouted by a PLR to
   a protector.  In the centralized protector mode, the traffic can be
   further rerouted to a backup egress router.  The rerouted traffic is
   planned and anticipated, and hence it should not be viewed as a new
   security threat.

   The framework requires a label distribution protocol to run between
   an egress router and a protector, which is achievable in a secured
   fashion.
