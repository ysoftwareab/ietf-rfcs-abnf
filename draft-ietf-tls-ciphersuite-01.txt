Overview

     At present, the symmetric ciphers supported by TLS are RC2, RC4,
     IDEA, DES and triple DES.  The protocol would be enhanced by the
     addition of AES [AES] ciphersuites, for the following reasons:

     1.  RC2, RC4 and IDEA are all subject to intellectual property
         claims.  RSA Security Inc has trademark rights in the names RC2
         and RC4, and claims that the RC4 algorithm itself is a trade
         secret.  Ascom Systec Ltd owns a patent on the IDEA algorithm.

     2.  Triple DES is much less efficient than more modern ciphers.

     3.  Now the AES process is completed there will be commercial pres¡
         sure to use the selected cipher.  The AES is efficient and has
         withstood extensive cryptanalytic efforts.  The AES is



Chown                                                           [Page 1]

ietf-tls-ciphersuite-01 AES Ciphersuites for TLS         27 October 2000


         therefore a desirable choice.

     4.  Currently the DHE ciphersuites only allow triple DES (along
         with some ``export'' variants which offer reduced key lengths).
         At the same time the DHE ciphersuites are the only ones to
         offer forward secrecy.

     This document proposes several new ciphersuites, with the aim of
     overcoming these problems.

Cipher Usage

     The new ciphersuites proposed here are very similar to the follow¡
     ing, defined in [TLS]:

     TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
     TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
     TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
     TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
     TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

     All the ciphersuites described here use the AES in cipher block
     chaining (CBC) mode.  Furthermore, they use SHA-1 in an HMAC con¡
     struction as described in section 5 of [TLS].  (Although the TLS
     ciphersuite names include the text ``SHA'', this actually refers to
     the modified SHA-1 version of the algorithm.)

     The ciphersuites differ in the type of certificate and key exchange
     method.  The ciphersuites defined here use the following options
     for this part of the protocol:

     CipherSuite                           Certificate type and key
                                           exchange algorithm

     TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA          RSA
     TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA       DH_DSS
     TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA       DH_RSA
     TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA      DHE_DSS
     TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA      DHE_RSA

     For the meanings of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS and
     DHE_RSA, please refer to section 7.4.2 of [TLS].

     The AES supports key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits.  At the pre¡
     sent time, all of these are believed to be secure against even the
     best equipped attackers.  The overall strength of TLS is such that
     there is no gain from using a key length longer than 128 bits.
     Accordingly the AES will use 128 bit keys.



Chown                                                           [Page 2]

ietf-tls-ciphersuite-01 AES Ciphersuites for TLS         27 October 2000


     The new ciphersuites will have the following definitions:

     CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00, 0x2F };
     CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x30 };
     CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x31 };
     CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x32 };
     CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x33 };

     Implementations SHOULD provide TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and
     TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  Implementations MAY provide any
     of the other ciphersuites described above.

Security Considerations

     It is not believed that the new ciphersuites are ever less secure
     than the corresponding older ones.  The AES is believed to be
     secure, and it has withstood extensive cryptanalytic attack.

     The ephemeral Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites provide forward secrecy
     without any known reduction in security in other areas.  To obtain
     the maximum benefit from these ciphersuites:

     1.  The ephemeral keys should only be used once.  With the TLS pro¡
         tocol as currently defined there is no efficiency gain from
         reusing ephemeral keys.

     2.  Ephemeral keys should be destroyed securely when they are no
         longer required.

     3.  The random number generator used to create ephemeral keys must
         not reveal past output even when its internal state is compro¡
         mised.

     During the development of the AES, NIST published the following
     statement on intellectual property:

          SPECIAL NOTE - Intellectual Property

          NIST reminds all interested parties that the adoption of
          AES is being conducted as an open standards-setting
          activity. Specifically, NIST has requested that all
          interested parties identify to NIST any patents or inven¡
          tions that may be required for the use of AES. NIST
          hereby gives public notice that it may seek redress under
          the antitrust laws of the United States against any party
          in the future who might seek to exercise patent rights

          against any user of AES that have not been disclosed to
          NIST in response to this request for information.

     One of the authors of Rijndael signed the following disclaimer when
     submitting the algorithm to NIST for consideration in the AES pro¡
     cess:

          I, Joan Daemen, do hereby declare that to the best of my
          knowledge the practice of the algorithm, reference imple¡
          mentation, and mathematically optimized implementations,
          I have submitted, known as Rijndael may be covered by the
          following U.S. and/or foreign patents:

          none

          I do hereby declare that I am aware of no patent applica¡
          tions which may cover the practice of my submitted algo¡
          rithm, reference implementation or mathematically opti¡
          mized implementations.

          I do hereby understand that my submitted algorithm may
          not be selected for inclusion in the Advanced Encryption
          Standard.  I also understand and agree that after the
          close of the submission period, my submission may not be
          withdrawn from public consideration for inclusion in the
          Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
          Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  I further understand
          that I will not receive financial compensation from the
          government for my submission.  I certify that, to the
          best of my knowledge, I have fully disclosed all patents
          and patent applications relating to my algorithm.  I also
          understand that the U.S. Government may, during the
          course of the lifetime of the AES or during the FIPS pub¡
          lic review process, modify the algorithm's specifications
          (e.g., to protect against a newly discovered vulnerabil¡
          ity).  Should my submission be selected for inclusion in
          the AES, I hereby agree not to place any restrictions on
          the use of the algorithm intending it to be available on
          a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free basis.

          I do hereby agree to provide the statements for any
          patent or patent application identified to cover practice
          of my algorithm, reference implementation or mathemati¡
          cally optimized implementations and the right to use such
          implementations for the purposes of the AES evaluation
          process.

          I understand that NIST will announce the selected algo¡
          rithm(s) and proceed to publish the draft FIPS for public
          comment.  If my algorithm (or the derived algorithm) is
          not selected for inclusion in the FIPS (including those
          not selected for second round of public evaluation), I
          understand that all rights, including use rights of the
          reference and mathematically optimized implementations,
          revert back to the submitter (and other owner[s] as
          appropriate).  Additionally, should the U.S. Government
          not select my algorithm for inclusion in the AES after a
          period of four years from the close of the submission
          date for candidate algorithms, all rights revert to the
          submitter (and other owner[s] as appropriate).
