Abstract

   This document specifies a modification to the Real-time Transport
   Control Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback. The proposed
   extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as
   Source Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where the traditional
   model of many-to-many group communication is either not possible or
   not preferred. In addition, it can be applied to any group that
   might benefit from a sender-controlled summarised reporting
   mechanism.

2. Introduction

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] provides a real-time
   transport mechanism suitable for unicast or multicast communication
   between multimedia applications. Typical uses are for real-time or
   near real-time group communication via audio and video data streams.
   An important component of the RTP protocol is the control channel,
   defined as the Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP). RTCP involves the
   periodic transmission of control packets between group members in a
   session, enabling group size estimation and the distribution or
   calculation of session-specific information such as packet loss and
   round trip time to other hosts. An additional advantage of providing
   a control channel for a session is that a third-party session
   monitor can listen to the traffic to establish network conditions
   and to diagnose faults based on receiver locations.

   RTP was designed to operate in a unicast mode or in the traditional
   multicast mode of Any Source Multicast (ASM) group communication,
   where both one-to-many and many-to-many communication are supported
   via a common group address in the range 224.0.0.0 through
   239.255.255.255. Typical intra-domain routing protocols, that is
   protocols that operate only within a single administrative domain,
   that enable such communication are the Distance Vector Multicast
   Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [2] or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
   [3][4]. Typically these are used in combination with an Inter-domain

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   routing protocol, that is to say a protocol that operates across
   administrative domain borders, such as the Multi-protocol extension
   to the Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP) [5] in combination with the
   Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) [6]. Such routing
   protocols enable a host to join a single multicast group address and
   to send to or to receive data from all members in the group with no
   prior knowledge of the membership across any multicast enabled
   portion of the internet. In order to enable such a service in the
   network, however there is a great deal of complexity involved at the
   routing level.

   An alternative approach has been developed for multicast groups with
   just a single data sender. The Source Specific Multicast (SSM) [7]
   model provides a simpler alternative in that it removes a great deal
   of the routing complexity involved in multicast group creation and
   source information distribution. In creating such a simplification,
   however the SSM model defines a clear separation between the data
   source and the multicast receiver group. As a consequence the
   multicast distribution is uni-directional providing only one source
   with the capability to communicate to the whole group.

   SSM sessions are typically assigned a value in the group address
   range 232.0.0.0 through 232.255.255.255, although this is not a
   requirement. A session may be assigned any valid multicast address,
   as long as the local network is configured to allow source-specific
   joins outside the suggested SSM range. In order for a host to
   receive traffic from an SSM capable source, it must support the
   IGMPv3 multicast group membership reporting protocol [19], which
   enables the host to explicitly request traffic from a (source,group)
   pair. An SDP syntax is defined in Section 10 to specify the mode of
   operation for the session and the session characteristics such as
   the (source, group) identifier and feedback address.

   The effect of using an SSM channel for RTP is that the ability for
   receivers in the group to communicate RTCP control information with
   all other members in the group is not provided by default. In order
   to explicitly enable this at the routing level, receivers would be
   required to join to an SSM channel from every other member of the
   group. The creation of such a routing mesh, however would clearly
   contradict the initial intention of introducing SSM in the first
   place, and would likely be less efficient than using ASM.

   In this draft, therefore we define a solution to this problem.  We
   introduce a new method for distributing control information amongst
   all members in a multicast session that is designed to operate under
   any multicast group communication scenario. It is, however, of
   particular benefit to SSM sessions in the absence of receivers being
   able to communicate with other members directly. The RTP data stream
   protocol itself is unaffected. The basic architectural models to
   which the unicast feedback method could provide benefit include:

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback


   a) SSM groups with a single sender.
      This is the main motivation behind the unicast RTCP feedback
      mechanism. The proposed extensions allow SSM groups that do not
      have many-to-many communication capability to still receive RTP
      data streams and to continue to participate in the RTP control
      protocol, RTCP by unicasting the data to the source on the
      standard RTCP port.

   b) One-to-many broadcast networks.
      An example of such a network is a satellite network with a
      terrestrial low-bandwidth return channel or a broadband cable
      link. Unlike the SSM network, this communication architecture may
      have the ability for a receiver to multicast return data to the
      group, however a unicast feedback mechanism is likely to be more
      preferable simply for routing simplicity.

   c) ASM with a single sender.
      An SDP [16] session announcement type may identify a session as
      having a single sender receiving unicast RTCP feedback. Receivers
      join the multicast group address and receive RTP and RTCP data
      from the source on the specified address/port combinations. The
      RTCP feedback is unicast back to the source on the RTCP port. The
      unicast feedback approach may help to prevent overtaxing
      multicast routing infrastructure that does not scale as
      efficiently. However, it is not more efficient than a standard
      multicast group RTP communication scenario, and therefore is not
      recommended to replace the traditional mechanism.

   The modifications proposed in this document are intended to
   supplement the existing RTCP feedback mechanisms described in [1],
   Section 6. For certain distribution networks, such as SSM networks,
   this may be a requirement, whereas in others it is an optional
   feature that may be used.


3. Basic Operation

   This draft proposes two new methods to enable receiver feedback to
   all members in a session. Each involves the unicasting of RTCP
   packets to a source whose job it is to re-distribute the information
   to the members of the group. The source must always be able to
   communicate with all group members in order for either mechanism to
   work.

   The content of receiver RTCP traffic will include Receiver Reports
   (RRs) and Session Description (SDES) information since they are
   never active sources in the session. Additionally, Application
   defined (APP) packets may also be transmitted. The various reports
   are combined into a single RTCP packet which should not exceed the
   path MTU. Packets are sent at a rate that is inversely proportional
   to the group size in order to scale the amount of traffic generated.

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   The first method, the 'Simple Feedback Model', is a basic mechanism
   whereby all Receiver RTCP packets are unicast to the source and
   subsequently forwarded by the source to all receivers on the
   multicast RTCP channel. The advantage of using this method is that
   an existing receiver implementation requires little modification in
   order to use it. Instead of sending reports to a multicast address,
   a receiver uses a unicast address and still receives RTCP traffic on
   the control data channel. This method also has the advantage of
   being backwards compatible with RTP/RTCP implementations that do not
   support unicast feedback to the source and that operate using the
   standard multicast group communication model, ASM. In a session that
   uses ASM, such a receiver would multicast reports to the group
   address and designated RTCP port as stated in [1]. The reports would
   be directly received by all members. In a session using SSM, the
   network should prevent any multicast data from the receiver being
   distributed further than the first hop router. Additionally, any
   data heard from a non-unicast capable receiver by other hosts on the
   same subnet should be filtered out by the host IP stack and
   therefore will not cause problems with respect to the calculation of
   Receiver RTCP bandwidth share.

   The second method, the 'Sender Feedback Summary Model' is a
   summarised reporting scheme that provides savings in bandwidth by
   consolidating all the Receiver Reports into one summary packet that
   is then distributed to all the receivers. The advantage of this
   scheme is apparent for large group sessions where the basic
   forwarding mechanism outlined above would create a large amount of
   packet replication in order to forward all the information to all
   the receivers. The basic operation of the scheme is the same as the
   first method, however it requires that all the members in the
   session understand the new summarised packet format outlined in
   Section 7.1. Additionally, the summarised scheme provides an
   optional mechanism to send distribution information about the data
   reported by the whole group. Potential uses for the compilation of
   distribution information are addressed in Section 7.4.

   To differentiate between the two reporting methods, a new SDP
   identifier is created and discussed in Section 10. The reporting
   method MUST be decided prior to the start of the session. A
   distribution source MUST NOT change the method during a session.


4. Definitions

    Distribution Source: In an SSM context, only one source distributes
        RTP data and redistributes RTCP information to all receivers.
        That source is called the distribution source. In order for
        unicast feedback to work, there MUST be only one session
        distribution source for any subset of receivers to which RTCP
        feedback is directed. Note that heterogeneous networks
        comprised of ASM multiple sender groups, unicast-only clients
        and/or SSM single-sender receiver groups MAY be connected via
        translators or mixers to create a single-source group (see
        Section 9 for details).

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback


    RTP and RTCP Channels: The data distributed from the source to the
        receivers is referred to as the RTP channel and the control
        information the RTCP channel. With standard RTP/RTCP, these
        channels typically share the same multicast address but are
        differentiated via port numbers as specified in [1].

    Unicast RTCP Feedback Target: For a session defined as having a
        distribution source A, using ports n for RTP and k for RTCP ,
        the unicast RTCP feedback target is the IP address of Source A
        on port k unless otherwise stated in the session description.
        Note that typically n is an even port number and k=n+1;
        however, certain circumstances such as the presence of NATs
        may require deviating from these rules.  See Section 10 for
        details on how the address is specified.

    SSRC: Synchronization source. A 32-bit value that uniquely
        identifies each member in a session. See [1] for further
        information.

Report blocks: RTCP [1] encourages the stacking of multiple report
blocks in Sender and Receiver Report packets. As a result, a variable
size feedback packet is created and sent from one source that pertains
to multiple other sources in the group. In this draft, the method of
stacking report blocks is extended in Generic Summary Report packets,
where a source optionally may stack multiple reports into one packet in
order to provide additional feedback on the RTCP traffic received from
the group.


5. Packet types

   The RTCP packet types defined in [1] are:

   type       description              Payload number
   SR         sender report            200
   RR         receiver report          201
   SDES       source description       202
   BYE        goodbye                  203
   APP        application-defined      204

   These remain unmodified. Two new packet types are introduced in this
   draft. Later profile extensions may be added to these which are not
   covered in [1] or this document.

   The new packet types are:

   type       description                    Payload number
   RSI        Receiver Summary Information   [see Section 12]
   GSR        General Summary Report         [see Section 12]

   Within the General Summary Report packet, various types of
   distribution data may be reported, each of which requires a


   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 6]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   distribution type identifier. Distribution types defined in this
   document are:

   Distribution Type            Number
   Packet Loss                  1
   Receiver Jitter              2
   Round Trip Time estimation   3
   SSRC distribution            4


6. Simple feedback model

6.1 Packet Formats

   The simple feedback model uses the same packet types as standard
   RTCP feedback described in [1]. Receivers still generate Receiver
   Reports with information on the quality of the stream received from
   the source. The distribution source still must create Sender Reports
   that include timestamp information for stream synchronisation and
   round trip time calculation. Both senders and receivers are required
   to send SDES packets as outlined in [1]. The rules for generating
   BYE and APP packets as outlined in [1] also apply.

6.2 Distribution Source behaviour

   For the simple feedback model, the source provides a simple packet
   reflection mechanism. It is the default behaviour for any
   distribution source and is the minimum requirement for acting as a
   source to a group of receivers using unicast RTCP feedback.

   The source MUST NOT stack report blocks received from different
   SSRCs into one packet for retransmission to the group. Every RTCP
   packet from each receiver MUST be reflected individually.

   The source MUST listen for unicast RTCP data sent to the RTCP port.
   All unicast data received on this port MUST be forwarded by the
   source to the group on the multicast RTCP channel. Any multicast
   data received on this port MUST NOT be forwarded but processed as
   defined in [1].

   The reflected traffic MUST NOT be included in the transmission
   interval calculation by the source. In other words, the source MUST
   NOT consider reflected packets as part of its own control data
   bandwidth allowance. The algorithm for computing the allowance is
   explained in Section 9. The control traffic included in the
   bandwidth calculation includes any Sender Reports to the group,
   along with any additional SDES and APP packets.

   If an application wishes to use APP packets, it is recommended that
   the simple feedback model be used since it is likely that all
   receivers in the session will need to hear the APP specific packets.
   The same applies for all other RTCP packets that are not defined in
   the base RTP specification [1]. The decision to use the simple


   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 7]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   feedback model MUST be made in advance of the session and MUST be
   indicated in the SDP announcement [16].

   When reflecting traffic, it is recommended that the source SHOULD
   attempt to avoid generating bursts of packets whenever buffer
   playout smoothing is possible.

6.3 Receiver behaviour

   Receivers listen on the RTP channel for data and the RTCP channel
   for control. Each receiver calculates its share of the control
   bandwidth based on the standard rule that 75% of the RTCP bandwidth
   is divided equally between all unique SSRCs in the session. See
   Section 9 for further information on the calculation of the
   bandwidth allowance. When a receiver is eligible to transmit, it
   sends a unicast Receiver Report packet to the RTCP port of the
   distribution source.


7. Sender feedback summary model

   In the sender feedback summary model, the sender is required to
   summarise the information received from all the Receiver Reports
   generated by the receivers and place the information into summary
   reports. The sender feedback summary model introduces two new
   packets. The Receiver Summary Information packet (RSI), which MUST
   be sent by a source if the summarised feedback mechanism is
   selected, and the OPTIONAL General Summary Report packet (GSR),
   which MAY be appended to the RSI packet to provide more detailed
   information on the overall session characteristics reported by all
   receivers.

   The sender MUST send at least one Receiver Summary Information
   packet for each reporting interval. The sender can additionally
   stack General Summary Reports (GSRs) after the RSI packet. Each GSR
   packet corresponds to the initial RSI packet and acts as an
   enhancement to the basic summary information required by the
   receivers to calculate their reporting time interval. For this
   reason, GSR packets are not required but recommended. RSI and GSR
   packets are sent in addition to the standard receiver-issued
   packets, such as Sender Reports and SDES packets outlined in [1].

   The RSI packet consists of a main report block modeled along the
   same lines as a Receiver Report with optional GSR blocks appended.
   The first eight bytes of header extension follow the standard RTP
   header outline. This ensures backwards compatibility with older
   versions that may not understand the RSI packet format but can read
   the length field indicating the end of the report block. The
   following fields are included:

   The fields "V", "P", and "length" have the same meaning as per [1].

   SC: 5 bits
      The number of collision SSRC entries towards the end of the
      report block. A value of 0 is allowed, indicating that no
      collisions are reported.

   PT: 8 bits
      The payload type of this report, see Section 5 for further
      details.

   SSRC: 32 bits
      The synchronisation source identifier for the originator of the
      summary report packet.

   timestamp: 32 bits
      The time the packet was sent. This is an unsigned integer value
      displayed in NTP timestamp units to enable detection of duplicate
      packets, reordering and to provide a chronological profile of the
      feedback reports.

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   group size: 32 bits
      This field provides the sender's view of the number of receivers
      in a session. This MUST include the sender itself and any other
      senders potentially connected to the session, e.g., via a
      mixer/translator gateway. The group size is calculated according
      to the rules outlined in [1].

   average fraction lost (AFL): 8 bits
      The average fraction lost indicated by Receiver Reports forwarded
      to this source, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.

   highest cumulative number of packets lost (HCNL): 24 bits
      Highest 'cumulative number of packets lost' value out of all RTCP
      RR packets since the last RSI from any of the receivers.

   highest interarrival jitter: 32 bits
      Highest 'interarrival jitter' value out of all RTCP RR packets
      since the last RSI from any of the receivers.

   receiver bandwidth: 32 bits
      Indicates the maximum bandwidth allocated to any single receiver
      for sending RTCP data relating to the session. This is a fraction
      value indicating a percentage of the session bandwidth, expressed
      as a fixed-point number with the binary point at the left edge of
      the field.

   collision SSRC: n x 32 bits
      The final fields in the packet are used to identify any SSRCs
      that are duplicated within the group. Usually this is handled by
      the hosts upon detection of the same SSRC, however since
      receivers in an SSM context no longer have a global view of the
      session, the collision algorithm is handled by the source. SSRCs
      that collide are listed in the packet.  On receipt of the packet,
      receiver(s) MUST detect the collision and select another SSRC.

   distribution type (DT): 8 bits
      A numeric identifier to indicate the significance of the
      distribution values. The distribution types currently defined are
      described in the following four sections. Additional items may be
      defined in a separate profile by registering the type numbers
      with IANA (see Section 12).

   number of distribution buckets (NDB): 12 bits
      The number of distribution buckets of the data. The size of the
      bucket can be calculated using the formula, number of bits equals
      ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB. The calculation is based upon the length
      of the whole packet in octets (length field*4) minus the header
      of 12 octets. Providing 12 bits for the NDB field enables bucket
      sizes as small as 2 bits for a full length packet. The bucket
      size in bits must always be divisible by 2 to ensure proper byte
      alignment. A bucket size of 2 bits is fairly restrictive,
      however, and it is expected that larger bucket sizes will be more
      practical for most distributions.

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   multiplicative factor (MF): 4 bits
      Indicates the multiplicative factor to be applied to each
      distribution Bucket value. Possible values are 1 - 15.

   length: 8 bits
      The length of the whole GSR data packet in 4 byte units. The full
      length of the packet in bytes is calculated by multiplying the
      length value by 4. This tells the receiver the full length of the
      packet and enables the receiver to identify the bucket size based
      on the calculation ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB. Therefore the maximum
      data portion of a GSR packet may be 1008 bytes, which would
      provide up to 4032 data buckets of length 2 bits, or 2016 data
      buckets of length 4 bits etc...

   minimum distribution value: 32 bits
      The minimum distribution value, in combination with the maximum
      distribution value, indicates the range covered by the data
      bucket values.

   maximum distribution value: 32 bits
      The maximum distribution value, in combination with the minimum
      distribution value, indicates the range covered by the data
      bucket values. The significance and range of the distribution
      values is defined in the individual profiles for each
      distribution type (DT).

   distribution buckets: each bucket is ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB bits
      The size and number of buckets depends upon the value of NDB and
      the length of the packet. In order to calculate the size of the
      bucket, the formula ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB should be used. This
      indicates the division of the data space and the size of each
      data point in bits. Each value must be multiplied by the
      multiplicative factor.

   Interpretation of the minimum, maximum and distribution values in
   the report block are profile-specific and are addressed individually
   in the sections below. The size of the report block is variable, as
   indicated by the packet length field.


  7.1.4 GSR Loss report block

   GSR loss report blocks indicate the distribution of losses as
   reported by the receivers to the distribution source. Values are
   expressed as a fixed-point number with the binary point at the left
   edge of the field. The distribution type (DT) is 1. The maximum
   number of fields is 256, therefore the minimum and maximum
   distribution values may not exceed 0 - 255.

   Valid results for the minimum distribution value field therefore are
   0 - 254. Similarly, valid results for the maximum distribution value
   field are 1 - 255. The minimum distribution value MUST always be
   less than the maximum.


   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 12]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   The distribution bucket values are always unsigned positive integers
   of length ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB.

   For examples on processing GSR loss report blocks, see section 7.4
   and the Appendix B.


  7.1.5 GSR Jitter report block

   GSR jitter report blocks indicate the distribution of the estimated
   statistical variance of the RTP data packet interarrival time
   reported by the receivers to the distribution source. See [1] for
   details on how the values are calculated and the relevance of the
   jitter results. Jitter values are measured in timestamp units and
   expressed as unsigned integers. The maximum number of fields is
   (2^32), therefore the minimum and maximum distribution values may
   not exceed 0 - (2^32)-1. The values are timestamp units expressed as
   an unsigned integer. The minimum distribution value must always be
   less than the maximum. The distribution type (DT) is 2.

   The distribution bucket values are always unsigned positive integers
   of length ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB.

  7.1.6 GSR Round Trip Time report block

   GSR round trip time reports indicate the distribution of round trip
   times from the distribution source to the receivers. The
   distribution source is the only member of the group capable of
   calculating the round trip time to any other members since it is the
   only sender in the group. The sender has the option of distributing
   these round trip time estimations to the whole group, uses of which
   are described in Section 7.4. Round trip times are measured in
   timestamp units and expressed as 32-bit unsigned integers. The
   multiplicative factor can be used to reduce the number of bits
   required to represent the values. The minimum distribution value
   MUST always be less than the maximum. The distribution type (DT) is
   3.

   The distribution bucket values are always unsigned positive integers
   of length ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB.

  7.1.7 SSRC Distribution report block

   GSR SSRC distribution report blocks are an additional data type that
   can be provided by the distribution source to indicate the
   allocation of SSRCs across the group. SSRCs are expressed as 32-bit
   unsigned integers. The multiplicative factor (MF) can be used to
   reduce the number of bits required to represent the values. The
   minimum distribution value MUST always be less than the maximum. The
   distribution type (DT) is 4.

   The distribution bucket values are always unsigned positive integers
   of length ((length*4)-12)*8/NDB.

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

7.2 Distribution Source behaviour

   The source is responsible for accepting RTCP packets from the
   receivers, interpreting and storing the per-receiver information as
   defined in [1]. The importance of this is apparent when creating the
   RSI and GSR summary packets, since incorrect information can have
   serious implications. Section 11 addresses the security risks in
   detail.

   The group size and Receiver RTCP Bandwidth packet fields MUST be
   calculated and included in the RSI packet. Typically, the bandwidth
   value will be calculated as outlined in [1] using the group size and
   session bandwidth as input. However, the Receiver RTCP Bandwidth
   field, does provide the source with the capability to control the
   amount of feedback from the receivers and MAY be increased or
   decreased based on the requirements of the source. Regardless of the
   value selected by the source for the Receiver RTCP Bandwidth field,
   the source MUST continue to forward Sender Reports and RSI packets
   at the rate allowed by its bandwidth allocation. See Section 9 for
   further details about the frequency of reports.

   In order to identify SSRC collisions, the source is responsible for
   maintaining a record of each SSRC and the corresponding CNAME within
   at least one reporting interval in order to differentiate between
   clients. It is RECOMMENDED that an updated list of more than one
   interval be maintained to increase accuracy. This mechanism should
   prevent the possibility of collisions since the combination of SSRC
   and CNAME should be unique if the CNAME is generated correctly. If
   collisions are not detected, the source will have an inaccurate
   impression of the group size. Since the statistical probability is
   very low that collisions will both occur and be undetectable, this
   should not be a significant concern.  In particular, the clients
   would have to randomly select the same SSRC and have the same
   username + IP address (e.g., using private address space behind a
   NAT router).

   For the GSR packet, the source must decide which are the most
   significant feedback values to convey. The packet format provides
   flexibility in the amount of detail conveyed by the data points.
   There is a trade-off between the granularity of the data and the
   accuracy based on the factorisation values, the number of buckets
   and the min and max values. In order to focus on a particular region
   of a distribution, the source can adjust the minimum and maximum
   values and either increase the number of buckets and possibly the
   factorisation, or decrease the number of buckets and provide more
   accurate values. See Appendix B for detailed examples on how to
   convey a summary of RTCP Receiver Reports as GSR information.

   The results should correspond as near as possible to the values
   received during the interval since the last report. The source may
   stack as many report blocks as required in order to convey different
   distributions. If the distribution size exceeds the largest packet
   length (1008 bytes data portion), more packets may be stacked with
   additional information up to the MTU of the connection.

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback



7.3 Receiver behaviour

   The receiver must process RSI packets and adapt session parameters
   such as the RTCP bandwidth based on the information received. The
   receiver no longer has a global view of the session, and will
   therefore be unable to receive information from individual receivers
   aside from itself. However, the information portrayed by the source
   can be extremely detailed, providing the receiver with an accurate
   view of the overall session quality, without the processing overhead
   associated with listening to and analysing all Receiver Reports.

   The SSRC collision list must be checked against the SSRC selected by
   the receiver to ensure there are no collisions. The group size value
   provides the receiver with the data necessary to calculate its share
   of the RTCP bandwidth. The Receiver RTCP Bandwidth field may
   override this value. The Receiver RTCP Bandwidth field provides the
   source with the capability to control the amount of feedback from
   the receivers.

   The receiver can use the GSR data as desired. This data is most
   useful in providing the receiver with a more global view of the
   conditions experienced by other receivers, and enables the client to
   place itself within the distribution and establish the extent to
   which its reported conditions correspond to the group reports as a
   whole. Appendix A provides further information and examples of data
   processing at the receiver.

   The receiver MUST assume that any report blocks in the same packet
   correspond to the same data set received by the source during the
   last reporting time interval. This applies to packets with multiple
   blocks, where each block conveys a different range of values.



7.4 Generating and analyzing summarised reports

   In the most basic form, the sender uses an algorithm such as
   Appendix A.1 to generate the data bucket values for a distribution
   providing buckets for every possible value. As a first step in
   creating the GSR packet for loss, the source would calculate the
   highest loss value out of each data bucket in order to identify what
   bucket width is required. In the case of loss values, there is a
   fixed maximum number of different values which could possibly be
   reported, i.e. 256 since the RTCP fraction lost field is exactly 1
   octet. This means that in this, the most basic example, the source
   creates a distribution with 256 buckets and calculates for each
   bucket how many receivers reported each value. When generating the
   packet, the source sets the Minimum Distribution Value to 0 and the
   Maximum Distribution Value to 255. The maximum data value determines
   the width of the bucket, i.e.
   (2^n-2) -1 < Max Value <= (2^n) -1 where n is an even number. As an
   example, the maximum data bucket values for the widths 6,8 and 10

   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 15]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   bits would be 63,255 and 1023. Therefore if the maximum distribution
   value was 557, a data bucket of size 10 would be required.

   Clearly, there is further potential for applying compression
   techniques to the basic algorithm. In many cases the most extreme
   values, e.g. 200 - 255, may not even be reported by the group or may
   be considered irrelevant. In such circumstances the source might
   choose to decrease either the range or the number of buckets within
   the range. Additionally, the multiplicative factor can be applied to
   further reduce the necessary bucket size. Examples of this and more
   detailed processing are explained in Appendix B. Further information
   on the applicability of distributions to various application
   scenarios is addressed in Appendix A.3.


8. Mixer/Translator issues

   The original RTP specification allows a session to use mixers and
   translators, which help to connect heterogeneous networks into one
   session. There are a number of issues, however, which are raised by
   the unicast feedback model proposed in this document. The term
   'mixer' refers to devices that provide data stream multiplexing
   where multiple sources are combined into one stream. Conversely, a
   translator does not multiplex streams, but simply acts as a bridge
   between two distribution mechanisms, e.g., a unicast-to-multicast
   network translator. Since the issues raised by this draft apply
   equally to either a mixer or translator, they are referred to from
   this point onwards as mixer-translator devices.

   A mixer-translator between distribution networks in a session must
   ensure that all members in the session receive all the relevant
   traffic to enable the usual operation by the clients. A typical use
   may be to connect an older implementation of an RTP client with an
   SSM distribution network, where the client is not capable of
   unicasting feedback to the source. In this instance the mixer-
   translator must join the session on behalf of the client and send
   and receive traffic from the session to the client. Certain hybrid
   scenarios may have different requirements.


8.1 Use of a mixer-translator

   The mixer-translator MUST adhere to the SDP description [16] for the
   single source session (Section 10) and use the feedback mechanism
   indicated. Receivers SHOULD be aware that by introducing a mixer-
   translator into the session, more than one source may be active in a
   session since the mixer-translator may be forwarding traffic from
   either multiple unicast sources or from an ASM session to the SSM
   receivers. Receivers SHOULD still forward unicast RTCP reports in
   the usual manner to the distribution source, which in this case
   would be the mixer-translator itself. It is RECOMMENDED that the
   simple packet reflection mechanism be used under these circumstances
   since attempting to coordinate RSI + LJS reporting between more than


   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 16]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   one source may be complicated unless the mixer-translator is capable
   of undertaking the summarisation itself.


8.2 Encryption and Authentication issues

   Encryption and security issues are discussed in detail in Section
   11. A mixer-translator MUST be able to follow the same security
   policy as the client in order to unicast forward RTCP feedback to
   the source, and it therefore MUST be able to apply the same
   authentication and/or encryption policy required for the session.
   Transparent bridging, where the mixer-translator is not acting as
   the distribution source, and subsequent unicast feedback to the
   source is only allowed if the mixer-translator can conduct the same
   source authentication as required by the receivers.


9. Transmission interval calculation

   The Control Traffic Bandwidth referred to in [1] is an arbitrary
   amount which is intended to be supplied by a session management
   application (e.g., [9]) or decided based upon the bandwidth of a
   single sender in a session. A receiver MUST calculate the number of
   other members in a session based upon either its own SSRC count
   determined by the number of forwarded Receiver Reports, or from the
   group size field in the RSI report from a sender.

   The RTCP transmission Interval calculation remains the same as in
   the original RTP specification [1]. In the original specification,
   the senders are allocated 1/4 of the control traffic bandwidth if
   they number 25% or less than the group size. Otherwise the
   allocation for senders is the percentage of senders to group size.
   The remaining bandwidth is allocated to the receivers to be divided
   evenly amongst the group. The source should calculate the
   transmission interval for RSI + LJS packets out of its 1/4 of the
   control traffic bandwidth with a minimum transmission interval of 5
   seconds.


10. SDP Extensions

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [16] is used as a means to
   describe media sessions in terms of their transport addresses,
   codecs, and other attributes. Providing RTCP feedback via unicast as
   specified in this document constitutes another session parameter
   needed in the session description. Similarly, other SSM RTCP
   feedback parameters need to be provided, such as the summarisation
   mode at the sender and the target unicast address to which to send
   feedback information.  This section defines the SDP parameters that
   are needed by the proposed mechanisms in this draft (and that also
   need to be registered with IANA).




   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 17]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

10.1 SSM RTCP Session Identification

   A new session level attributes MUST be used to indicate the use of
   unicast instead of multicast feedback: "rtcp:unicast".

   This attribute uses one additional parameter to specify the mode of
   operation.

   rtcp:unicast reflection -- MUST be used to indicate packet
   reflection by the RTCP target (without further processing).

   rtcp:unicast gsr        -- MUST be used to indicate the "General
   Summary Report" mode of operation.

   rtcp:unicast rsi        -- MUST be used to indicate the "Receiver
   Summary Information" mode of operation.


10.2 SSM Source Specification

   In addition, in an SSM RTCP session, the sender(s) need to be
   indicated for both source-specific joins to the multicast group as
   well as for addressing RTCP packets to.

   This is done following the proposal for SDP source filters
   documented in draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-srcfilter-00.txt [15].

   From this specification, only the inclusion mode ("a=incl:") MUST be
   used for SSM RTCP.

   There MUST be exactly one "a=incl:" attribute listing the address of
   the sender.  The RTCP port MUST be derived from the m= line of the
   media description.

   An optional alternative feedback address may be supplied using an
   attribute such as a=rtcp:<port> IN IP4 192.168.1.1 [17].


11. Security Considerations


11.1 Assumptions

   RTP/RTCP is a protocol for carrying real-time multimedia traffic,
   and therefore one of the main considerations for any security
   solution must be to maintain as low an overhead as possible in order
   to limit processing constraints. This includes the consideration of
   overhead for different applications and types of cryptographic
   operations, as well as considerations for deploying or creating
   security infrastructure for large groups.

   The distribution of session parameters, typically using type
   information through SAP, email or the web is beyond the scope of
   this document. It is recommended, however, that the method used

   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 18]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   should employ adequate security measures to ensure the integrity and
   authenticity of the information. For the purposes of this analysis,
   it is assumed that the information has already been securely
   distributed out-of-band. SAP, SIP, RTSP, and HTTP, as prime
   candidates for conveying SDP-based session descriptions support the
   necessary protocol mechanisms, drawing on work from the MSEC WG.
   Further work is in progress within the Gsec working group, which is
   addressing the security implications of distributing session
   announcements.

   It is also assumed that the multicast or group distribution
   mechanism, e.g., the SSM routing tree, is not immune to source IP
   address spoofing or traffic snooping. All security weaknesses are
   therefore addressed from a transport level perspective or above.

11.2 Security threats

   Attacks on this architecture may take a variety of forms, and in
   order to identify the security weaknesses, it is important to
   address these individually.

   a) Denial of Service
      A major area of concern would be a denial of service attack. Due
      to the nature of the communication architecture this is a
      situation that could be generated in a number of ways by using
      the unicast feedback characteristic as a weakness. Since standard
      multicast communication does not typically involve many to one
      unicast forwarding of data, this poses new challenges for a
      security solution.

   b) Packet Forgery
      One potential area of attack to guard against is packet forgery.
      In particular, it is important to protect against the integrity
      of certain influential packets since compromise of certain
      control packets could directly affect the transmission
      characteristics of the whole group, however for the purposes of
      defining a security profile at this stage, every packet is
      considered equally as important. This decision may be revisited
      in future revisions as the requirements emerge more clearly. It
      is clear, however that in the case of a large group, the
      compromise of RTCP traffic could have serious consequences.

   c) Session Replay
      An additional concern is the potential for session recording and
      subsequent replay. The issue to deal with in particular in this
      instance is that an attacker may not actually need to understand
      the packet contents, but just simply have the ability to record
      the data stream and at a later time replay it with a spoofed
      source address.

   d) Eavesdropping on a session
      The consequences of eavesdropping by an attacker on a session may
      not directly constitute a security weakness, however it might


   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 19]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

      benefit other types of attack, and should therefore be considered
      as a potential threat.


11.3 Security properties

   The following security types are relevant to this draft and will be
   addressed in greater detail in subsequent sections.

   a) Data integrity
      Ensures that any third party has not tampered with the data
      received from the network, either maliciously or through a
      network error. This property ensures that the packet received is
      guaranteed to be in exactly the same condition as that source
      intended it to be. The authenticity of the data must be tested in
      a separate manner.

   b) Data authenticity
      Ensures the origin of the message can either be uniquely
      identified, or in the case of group authentication can be
      identified as coming from a specific trusted group of sources.

   c) Data confidentiality
      Ensures that the only receiver(s) that can recover the original
      plaintext is the intended receiver(s), therefore in order to
      restrict access only to authorized entities, confidentiality is
      required. It does not prevent eavesdroppers from receiving the
      traffic but does guarantee that they cannot recover the original
      data.

   d) Replay protection
      Ensures that given some pre-determined range of either time or
      session values, a host can determine whether the data was
      transmitted within the given window.



11.4 Architectural Contexts

   In order to understand the potential weaknesses to guard against, it
   is necessary to divide the communication model into a number of
   distinct contexts.

   a) Source to Receiver communication
      The first, and perhaps most influential context to protect, is
      the 'downstream' communication channel from the source to the
      receivers. This is effectively the main controlling influence
      over the behaviour of the group since it determines the bandwidth
      allocation for each receiver and hence the rate at which the RTCP
      traffic is directly unicast back to the source. All traffic that
      is distributed over the downstream channel should be generated by
      a single source. Both the RTP data stream and the RTCP control
      data are sent over this channel. The RTCP data is indirectly

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

      influenced by the information the source has received from the
      whole group.

      This context is vulnerable to all four attacks outlined in the
      previous section. A denial of service attack from the source to
      the receivers is possible, but less of a concern since the worst
      case effect of sending large volumes of traffic over the
      distribution channel has the potential to reach every receiver,
      but only on a one-to-one basis, this is no different from the
      current multicast model where an individual source may send large
      volumes of traffic to a multicast group. The real danger of
      denial of service attacks in this context comes indirectly via
      compromise of the source RTCP traffic. If receivers are provided
      with an incorrect group size estimate or bandwidth allowance, the
      return traffic to the source may create a Distributed DoS effect
      on the source. Similarly, an incorrect feedback address whether
      as a result of a malicious attack or by mistake, e.g., an IP
      address typing error, could directly create a denial of service
      attack on another host which must also be guarded against.

      The danger of Packet forgery in the worst case may be to
      maliciously instigate a denial of service attack, e.g. if an
      attacker were capable of spoofing the source address and
      injecting incorrect packets into the data stream or intercepting
      the source RTCP traffic and modifying the fields. Other
      consequences of packet forgery in this context may be the
      compromise of data affecting the integrity of the data received
      both in the RTP stream itself and the RTCP data in general.

      The replay of a session would have the effect of recreating the
      receiver feedback to the source address at a time when the source
      is not expecting additional traffic from a potentially very large
      group. The consequences of this type of attack may be less
      effective on their own, but in combination with other attacks
      might be serious.

      Eavesdropping on the session would provide an attacker with
      information on the characteristics of the source to receiver
      traffic such as the frequency of RTCP traffic and, if
      unencrypted, might also provide valuable information on
      characteristics such as group size and transmission
      characteristics of the receivers back to the source in addition
      to enabling an attacker to listen to the media streams. In this
      context, the attacker might also have access to personal
      information carried in the SDES packets such as email, phone and
      full username information.

   b) Receiver to source or gateway communication
      The second context to address is the return traffic from the
      group to the source or gateway, which for the purposes of this
      analysis may be considered in the same light as a distribution
      source. This traffic should only be RTCP type data, and should
      include receiver reports, SDES information and possibly
      Application specific packets. The effects of compromise on a

   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 21]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

      single or subset of receivers is less likely to have as great an
      impact as the first context, however much of the responsibility
      for detecting compromise of the source data stream relies on the
      receivers.

      The effects of compromise of the first context with respect to
      critical source RTCP control information would be witnessed most
      seriously in the second context. A large group of receivers may
      unwittingly generate a distributed DoS attack on the source in
      the event that the integrity of the source RTCP channel has been
      compromised and the security breach is not detectable by the
      individual receivers.

      In the event that packet forgery may occur in this context, the
      effect may be the introduction of false RTCP traffic and/or the
      creation of fake SSRC identifiers. Such an attack might slow down
      the overall control channel data rate, since an incorrect
      perception of the group size may be created. This might affect
      external issues such as group accounting and other as yet unknown
      potential uses of the distribution functionality for controlling
      group behaviour such as leader election based on feedback
      criteria.

      A replay attack on receiver return data to the source would have
      the same implications as the generation of false SSRC identifiers
      and RTCP traffic to the source. It is therefore equally as
      important to protect against compromise of any receiver
      contribution to the RTCP channel, as it is to ensure authenticity
      and freshness of the data source.

      Eavesdropping in this context may potentially provide an attacker
      with a great deal of personal information about a large group of
      receivers available from SDES packets. It would also provide an
      attacker with information on group traffic generation
      characteristics and parameters for calculating individual
      receiver bandwidth allowance.


11.5 Requirements in each context

   Some initial requirements to consider for each context in general
   are that the overhead of ensuring the security of the session should
   be kept as low as possible. This entails keeping the setup and
   communication of keys to a minimum. The nature of RTP/RTCP traffic
   is that sessions require real-time processing and minimal overhead
   for communication. This means that processing constraints imposed by
   the required cryptographic techniques are an important consideration
   in defining this security profile.

   Having identified the security weaknesses for each communication
   context, security type requirements can be addressed for each.

   a) The first context is concerned with denial of service attacks
      through possible packet forgery. The forgery may take the form of

   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 22]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

      interception and modification of packets from the source, or
      simply injecting false packets into the distribution channel. To
      combat these attacks, data integrity and source authenticity are
      required. The degree of confidentiality which may be deployed is
      not a requirement in this context since the actual consequences
      of eavesdropping do not affect the operation of the protocol,
      however without confidentiality, access to personal and group
      characteristics information would be unrestricted to an external
      listener and it is therefore recommended.

   b) The second context must defend against the same kinds of attacks.
      Data integrity is required to ensure that interception and
      modification of an individual receiver's RTCP traffic is not
      accomplished. This is to protect against the false influence of
      group control information and the possible serious compromise of
      future services provided by the distribution functionality such
      as leader election based on various parameters. In order to
      ensure data integrity, receiver authenticity is therefore an
      additional requirement in order to ensure the origin of the data
      is secure. The same situation applies as in the first context
      with respect to data confidentiality, and it is recommended that
      precautions should be taken to protect the privacy of the data.


11.6 Overview of existing security solutions

   This section addresses some existing group security mechanisms and
   identifies which aspects of the security requirements they might
   provide. This security analysis is a work in progress, and these
   options will be explored in more detail in subsequent versions of
   the draft.

   SRTP provides confidentiality of the RTP and RTCP packets as well as
   protection against integrity compromise and replay attacks. It
   provides authentication of the data stream, however it does not
   provide authentication on a per-user basis. This means that a packet
   can be authenticated as having originated from one of the session
   members, but it does not indicate which member. All keys for an SRTP
   session are derived from a single master key, which it is assumed
   has been distributed via some out-of-band secure method.

   The most detailed group security profile which may be considered is
   the Group Domain of Interpretation, which provides a solution for
   multicast IPSec ESP security with group authentication. Used in
   combination with a Key negotiation protocol, it provides integrity
   and group authentication and re-keying for groups with dynamic
   membership. It is not particularly well suited to Real-time
   application data stream processing, however and may therefore not be
   appropriate.

   A third option with respect to group security frameworks is TESLA
   [18], a lightweight source authentication scheme based on loose time
   synchronisation calculations by receivers to the source, and a
   delayed key disclosure interval. The usefulness of this scheme in

   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 23]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   addition to the others is currently being considered for the unicast
   RTCP feedback scenario, the results of which will be addressed in a
   subsequent draft.


12. IANA Considerations

   Based on the guidelines suggested in [10], this document proposes 2
   new RTCP data payload types for consideration by IANA, and 4 new
   sub-payload types for summary distribution types, defined in section
   5.

   Furthermore, four new SDP media-level attributes are defined in
   Section 10.

16. Appendix

A  GSR packet processing at the receiver



A.1 Algorithm

   Example processing of Loss Distribution Values
   X values represent the loss percentage.
   Y values represent the number of receivers.

   Number of x values is the NDB value
   xrange = Max Distribution Value(MaDV) - Min Distribution Value(MnDV)
   First data point = MnDV,first ydata
   then
   Foreach ydata => xdata += (MnDV + (xrange / NDB))

A.2 Pseudo-code

   Packet Variables -> factor,NDB,MnDVL,MaDV
   Code variables -> xrange, ydata[NDB],x,y

   xrange = MaDV - MnDV
   x = MnDV;

   for(i=0;i<NDB;i++) {
        y = (ydata[i] * factor);
        /*OUTPUT x and y values*/
        x += (xrange / NDB);
   }

A.3 Application Uses and Scenarios

   Providing a distribution function in a feedback message has a number
   of uses for different types of applications. This section enumerates
   some potential uses for the distribution scheme, however it is
   anticipated that future applications might benefit from it in ways
   not addressed in this document. Due to the flexible nature of the
   GSR packet format, future extensions may easily be added. Some of
   the scenarios addressed here envisage potential uses beyond a simple
   SSM architecture. For example, single-source group topologies where
   every receiver may in fact also be capable of becoming the source.
   Another example may be multiple SSM topologies, which when combined,
   make up a larger distribution tree.

   A distribution of values is useful as input into any algorithm,
   multicast or otherwise, that could be optimized or tuned as a result
   of having access to the feedback values for all group members.
   Following is a list of example areas that might benefit from
   distribution information:



   Chesterfield    Internet Draft - Expires December 2002     [Page 26]

                      RTCP with Unicast Feedback

   - The parameterization of a multicast Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   algorithm. Given an accurate estimate of the distribution of
   reported losses, a source or other distribution agent, which does
   not have a global view, would be able to tune the degree of
   redundancy built in to the FEC stream. The distribution might help
   to identify whether the majority of the group is experiencing high
   levels of loss, or whether in fact the high loss reports are only
   from a small subset of the group. Similarly, this data might enable
   a receiver to make a more informed decision about whether it should
   leave a group that includes a very high percentage of the worst-case
   reporters.

   - The organization of a multicast data stream into useful layers for
   layered coding schemes. The distribution of packet losses and delay
   would help to identify what percentage of members experience various
   loss and delay levels, and thus how the data stream bandwidth might
   be partitioned to suit the group conditions. This would require the
   same algorithm to be used by both senders and receivers in order to
   derive the same results.

   - The establishment of a suitable feedback threshold. An application
   might be interested to generate feedback values when above (or
   below) a particular threshold.  However, determining an appropriate
   threshold may be difficult when the range and distribution of
   feedback values is not known a priori.  In a very large group,
   knowing the distribution of feedback values would allow a reasonable
   threshold value to be established, and in turn would have the
   potential to prevent message implosion if many group members share
   the same feedback value. A typical application might include a
   sensor network that gauges temperature or some other natural
   phenomenon.  Another example is a network of mobile devices
   interested in tracking signal power to assist with hand-off to a
   different distribution device when power becomes too low.

   - The tuning of Suppression algorithms. Having access to the
   distribution of round trip times, bandwidth, and network loss would
   allow optimization of wake-up timers and proper adjustment of the
   Suppression interval bounds.  In addition, biased wake-up functions
   could be created not only to favor the early response from more
   capable group members, but also to smooth out responses from
   subsequent respondents and to avoid bursty response traffic.

   - Leader election among a group of processes based on the maximum or
   minimum of some attribute value. Knowledge of the distribution of
   values would allow a group of processes to select a leader process
   or processes to act on behalf of the group. Leader election can
   promote scalability when group sizes become extremely large.
