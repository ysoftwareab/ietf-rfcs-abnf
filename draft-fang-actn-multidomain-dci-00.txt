1. Introduction

   This document discusses a use-case for data center operators that
   need to interface multi-domain transport networks to offer their
   global data center applications and services. As data center
   providers face multi-domain and diverse transport technology,
   interoperability based on standard-based abstraction is required for
   dynamic and flexible applications and services.

   This use-case is a part of the overarching work, called Abstraction
   and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN). The goal of ACTN is to
   facilitate virtual network operation by:

     . The creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to
        view the abstraction of the underlying multi-admin, multi-
        vendor, multi-technology networks and

     . The operation and control/management of these multiple networks
        as a single virtualized network.

Internet-Draft        Multi-domain DCI Use-case               June 2014


   This will accelerate rapid service deployment of new services,
   including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve overall
   network operations and scaling of existing services.

   Related documents are the ACTN-framework [ACTN-Frame] and the
   problem statement [ACTN-PS].

   Multi-domain transport networks herein are referred to physical WAN
   infrastructure whose operation may or may not belong to the same
   administrative domain as the data center operation. Some data center
   operators may wholly own the entire physical WAN infrastructure
   while others may own partially or even not at all. In all cases,
   data center operation needs to establish multi-domain relationships
   with one or more physical network infrastructure operations.

   Data center based applications are used to provide a wide variety of
   services such as video gaming, cloud storage and computing, grid
   application, data base tools, and mobile applications, and others.
   High-bandwidth video applications such as remote medical surgery,
   video streaming for live concerts and sporting events are also
   emerging. This document is mainly concerned with data center
   applications that in aggregate or individually make substantial
   bandwidth demands that traverse multi-domain transport networks,
   some of which may belong to different administrative domains. In
   addition, these applications may require specific bounds on QoS
   related parameters such as guaranteed bandwidth, latency and jitter
   and others.

   The organization of this document is as follows: Section 2 will
   discuss multi-domain Data Center interconnection and its various
   application scenarios. Section 3 will discuss the issues and
   challenges for Multi-domain Data Center Interconnection Operations
   Architecture. Section 4 will provide high-level requirements.

2. Multi-domain Data Center Interconnection Applications

2.1. VM Migration

   A key enabler for data center cost savings, consolidation,
   flexibility and application scalability has been the technology of
   compute virtualization or Virtual Machines (VMs). A VM to the
   software application looks like a dedicated processor with dedicated
   memory and dedicated operating system. In modern data centers or
   "computing clouds", the smallest unit of computing resource is the
   VM. In public data centers one can buy computing capacity in terms
   of VMs for a particular amount of time. Though different VM
   configurations may be offered that are optimized for different types
   of processing (e.g., memory intensive, throughput intensive).


   Fang              Expires December 5, 2014   [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        Multi-domain DCI Use-case               June 2014


   VMs offer not only a unit of compute power but also as an
   "application environment" that can be replicated, backed up and
   moved. Although VM migration started in the LAN, the need for inter-
   DC VM migration for workload burst/overflow management on the WAN
   has been a real need for Data Center Operators.

   Virtual machine migration has a variety of modes: (i) scheduled vs.
   dynamic; (ii) bulk vs. sequential; (iii) point-to-point vs. point-
   to-multi-point. Transport network capability can impact virtual
   machine migration strategy. For certain mission critical
   applications, dynamic bandwidth guarantee as well as performance
   guarantee must be provided by the network. Make-before-break
   capability is also critical to support seamless migration.

2.2. Global Load Balancing

   As the many data center applications are distributed geographically
   across many data centers and over multi-domain networks, load
   balancing is no longer a local decision. As such, the decision as to
   selecting a server for an application request from the users or
   selecting data centers for migrating or instantiating VMs needs to
   be done globally. This refers to global load balancing.

   There are many factors that can negatively affect the quality of
   experience (QoE) for the application. Among them are: the
   utilization of the servers, the underlying network loading
   conditions within a data center (LAN), the underlying network
   loading conditions between data centers (MAN/WAN), the underlying
   network conditions between the end-user and data center (Access
   Network). To allow data center operators to facilitate global load
   balancing over heterogeneous multi-domain transports from access
   networks to metro/core transport networks, on-line network resource
   information needs to be abstracted and represented from each
   involving network domain.

2.3. Disaster Recovery

   For certain applications, disaster recovery in real-time is
   required. This requires transport of extremely large amount of data
   from various data center locations to other locations and a quick
   feedback mechanism between data center operator and infrastructure
   network providers to facilitate the complexity associated with real-
   time disaster recovery.

   As this operation requires real-time concurrent connections with a
   large amount of bandwidth, a strict guarantee of bandwidth and a
   very low latency between a set of data centers, the underlying
   physical network infrastructure is required to support these network
   capability. Moreover, as the data center operator interfaces

Internet-Draft        Multi-domain DCI Use-case               June 2014


   multiple network infrastructure providers, standard-based interfaces
   and a common ways to abstract network resources and connections are
   necessary to facilitate its operations.

2.4. On-demand Virtual Connection/Circuit Services

   Related to the real-time operations discussed in other applications
   in the previous sections, many applications require on-demand
   virtual connection/circuit services with an assured quality of
   service across multiple domain transport networks.

   The on-demand aspect of this service applies not only in setting up
   the initial virtual connections/circuits but also in increasing
   bandwidth, changing the QoS/SLA, adding a new protection scheme to
   an existing service.

   The on-demand network query to estimate available SLA/QoS (e.g., BW
   availability, latency range, etc.) between a few data center
   locations is also part of this application.

   domain data center interconnection. Figure 1 shows a typical multi-

        Figure 1. Multi-domain Data Center Interconnect Operations
                               Architecture



   Figure 1 shows several characteristics pertaining to current multi-
   domain data center operations.

   1. Data centers are geographically spread and homed on possibly a
     number of mutually independent physical network infrastructure
     provider domains.

   2. Between the data center operator domain and each of mutually
     independent physical network provider domains must establish
     trusted relationships amongst the involved entities. In some cases
     where data center operator owns the whole or partial physical

   Fang              Expires December 5, 2014   [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Multi-domain DCI Use-case               June 2014


     network infrastructure domains, a trusted relationship is still
     required between the data center operation and the network
     operations due to organizational boundaries although it is less
     strict than a pure multi-domain case.

   3. Data center operator may lease facility from physical network
     infrastructure providers for intra-domain connectivity or own the
     facility. For instance, there may be an intra-domain leased
     facility for connectivity between DC 1 to DC 2. It is also
     possible that the data center provider may own this intra-domain
     facility such as dark fibers for connectivity between DC 1 and DC
     2.

   4. There may be need for connectivity that may traverse multi-domain
     networks. For instance, Data Center 1 may have VMs that need to be
     transported to Data Center 6. Typically, multi-domain connectivity
     is arranged statically such that the routes are pre-negotiated
     with the involved operators. For instance, if Data Center 1 were
     to send its VMs to Data Center 6, the route may take on Domain 1 -
     Domain 4 - Domain 3 based on a pre-negotiated agreement prior to
     connectivity request. In such case, the inter-domain facilities
     between Domains 1 & 4 Domains 4 & 3 are a part of this pre-
     negotiated agreement. There could be alternative route choices.
     Whether there may be alternate routing or not is subject to
     policy. Alternate routing may be static or dynamic depending on
     policy.

   5. These transport network domains may be diverse in terms of local
     policy, transport technology and its capability and vendor
     equipment. Due to this diversity, new service introduction,
     requiring connections that traverse multiple domains, need
     significant planning, and several manual operations to interface
     different vendor equipment and technology. New applications
     requiring dynamic and elastic services and real-time mobility may
     be hampered by these manual operational factors.

4. Requirements

   This section provides high-level requirements to fulfill multi-
   domain data center interconnection to support various applications
   discussed in the previous sections.

   1. The interfaces between the Data Center Operation and each
     transport network domain SHOULD support standards-based
     abstraction with a common information/data model.

   2. The Data Center Operation should be able to create a single
     virtual network view.

Internet-Draft        Multi-domain DCI Use-case               June 2014


   3. The following capability should be supported:

        a. Network Query (Pull Model) from the Data Center Operation to
          each transport network domain to collect potential resource
          availability (e.g., BW availability, latency range, etc.)
          between a few data center locations.

            i. The level of abstracted topology (e.g., tunnel-level,
               graph-form, etc.)

        b. Network Path Computation Request from the Data Center
          Operation to each transport network domain to estimate the
          path availability.

        c. Network Virtual Connections/Circuits Request from the Data
          Center Operation to each transport domain to establish an
          end-to-end virtual connections/circuits.

            i. The type of the connection: P2P, P2MP, etc.

           ii. Concurrency of the request (this indicates if the
               connections must be simultaneously available or not in
               case of multiple connection requests).

          iii. The duration of the connections

           iv. SLA/QoS parameters: minimum guaranteed bandwidth,
               latency range, etc.

            v. Protection/Reroute Options (e.g., SRLG requirement,
               etc.)

           vi. Policy Constraints (e.g., peering preferences, etc.)

        d. Network Virtual Connections/Circuits Modification Request
          from the Data Center Operation to each transport domain to
          change QoS/SLA, protection schemes of the existing
          connections/circuits.

        e. Network Abnormality Report (Push Model) from each transport
          domain to the Data Center Operation indicating the service
          impacting network conditions or the potential degradation
          indications of the existing virtual connections/circuits.
