                Minimal Incremental Zone Transfer in DNS
                         draft-mekking-mixfr-00

Abstract

   This document proposes extensions to the DNS protocol to provide an
   incremental zone transfer (IXFR) mechanism with dynamic update
   (UPDATE) capabilities, to make zone transfers even smaller.

1.  Introduction

   Incremental zone transfer (IXFR, [RFC1995]) was introduced to
   efficiently transfer changed portions of a zone.  However, when a
   zone is signed with DNSSEC [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], the
   transfer may still become very large.  For example, when many
   resource record sets (RRsets) need a re-sign, or when the NSEC3
   [RFC5155] salt is changed, an IXFR may become larger than a full zone
   transfer (AXFR, [RFC5936]).  This is because the IXFR includes
   complete copies of both the deleted and replacement RRSIG records.

   To keep the deltas small in zone transfers, we need to have a richer
   update syntax, for example like in Dynamic Update (DNS UPDATE,
   [RFC2136].  This document introduces a new query type MIXFR (minimal
   incremental zone transfer) that is able to express this richer
   syntax.

   An earlier proposal to keep the zone transfers small is IXFR-ONLY
   [IXFR-ONLY], by giving the client an oppurtunity to signal the server
   that it prefers an error above a fall back to an AXFR in case the

   server is not able to send an IXFR.  However IXFR-ONLY does not
   reduce the size of an IXFR.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Syntax

   The syntax for IXFR is a subset of MIXFR.  The richer syntax of MIXFR
   allows to add or delete multiple records with one resource record
   (RR).

3.1.  Add an RR

   This works the same as with IXFR.

3.2.  Delete an RR

   This works the same as with IXFR.

3.3.  Delete an RRset

   Similar to DNS UPDATE.  To delete an RRset, the MIXFR deletion list
   includes an RR whose NAME and TYPE are those of the RRset to be
   deleted.  CLASS must be specified as ANY.  RDLENGTH must be zero (0)
   and RDATA must therefore be empty.

3.4.  Delete All RRsets on a Name

   Similar to DNS UPDATE.  To delete all RRSets at a name, the MIXFR
   deletion list includes an RR at that NAME, whose TYPE must be
   specified as ANY and CLASS must be specified as ANY.  RDLENGTH must
   be zero (0) and RDATA must therefore be empty.

3.5.  Delete All RRsets of a Type

   The MIXFR deletion list includes an RR whose NAME is that of the apex
   of the zone.  TYPE must be specified as the TYPE of the RRsets to be
   deleted.  CLASS must be specified as ANY.  RDLENGTH must be zero (0)
   and RDATA must therefore be empty.

Internet-Draft                    MIXFR                        July 2014


3.6.  Replace an RRset

   The MIXFR addition list includes an RR whose NAME and TYPE are those
   of the RRset to be replaced.  CLASS must be specified as ANY.
   RDLENGTH must be non-zero and the RDATA is that of the first
   replacement record.

   If an RRset is to be replaced with multiple records, the second and
   subsequent records MUST use the syntax for adding an RR.

   The same syntax is used to delete an RRset and to replace an RRset
   with an RR whose RDLENGTH is zero.  This is not ambiguous because the
   former appears in the deletion list (before the new SOA RR) and the
   latter appears in the addition list (after the new SOA RR).

4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Client side

   The client can send a MIXFR request.  Just like with IXFR, it places
   a SOA RR in the authority section to signal the version of the zone
   it holds now.  If the client does not want the server to fall back to
   AXFR, it MAY add another SOA RR in the additional section.  This
   achieves MIXFR-only behavior, similar to IXFR-ONLY [IXFR-ONLY].  For
   example:

   ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 1337
   ;; flags: qr ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1
   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;; example.    IN    MIXFR

   ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=1

   ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=1

            Figure 1: A MIXFR request for the "example." zone.

4.2.  Server side

   A server receiving a minimal incremental zone transfer (MIXFR)
   request will reply with a MIXFR.  A MIXFR looks exactly like an IXFR,
   except there may be zero or more of the new introduced syntax RRs
   that can add or delete more records.  For the zone "example.", the
   following zone transfer can be sent that will replace all signatures
   in the zone with new signatures for the names "example.",
   "a.example.", "b.example." and "c.example.":

   ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 1337
   ;; flags: qr ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 9, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;; example.    IN    MIXFR

   ;; ANSWER SECTION:
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=1
   example.       ANY   RRSIG
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
   example.       IN    RRSIG  rdata
   a.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
   b.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
   c.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=3

            Figure 2: A MIXFR response for the "example." zone.

   The server MAY reply with an IXFR or AXFR instead.  If the server
   does not implement MIXFR it MUST return a response with NOTIMPL
   rcode.  The client MUST fallback to request IXFR or AXFR.

5.  Data Minimization

   The proposal described in the previous section significantly reduces
   the size of a zone transfer compared with IXFR.  However, when a zone
   has changed its NSEC3 salt, the impact is less impressive.  This is
   because you need to remove all NSEC3 records and all its
   corresponding signatures.  The first part is achieved with:

   example.       ANY   NSEC3

           Figure 3: Record to delete all RRsets of type NSEC3.

   But we can't do the same for part two, because there are other
   signatures than those covering type NSEC3.

   However, because RRSIG records are tightly related to its RRset we
   can introduce some additional data minimization rules.

5.1.  Implicit RRSIG deletion

   When an RR or RRset is deleted or replaced, the MIXFR client MUST
   also remove all existing RRSIG records on that RRset.  This is valid
   for all RRtypes except RRSIG itself.

5.2.  More optimizations

   We can optimize the transfer even more, because when adding an RRset
   we duplicate a lot of owner names, class and type fields.  For
   example. we could add an NS RRset of three records like this:

   ADD example. IN NS 3 ns1.example. ns2.example. ns3.example.

               Figure 4: Optimized addition of an NS RRset.

   With such a syntax, we can do more things like

   REPLACE       <name> <type> <n> <rdata>{n}
   REPLACE-RRSIG <name> <type> <n> <rdata>{n}
   SOA           <serial>

                Figure 5: Optimized syntax ideas for MIXFR.

5.3.  A more sophisticated grammar

   REPLACE-RRSIG name <type> <n> <rdata>+
   DEL NSEC3 <nsec3param info> ?
   REPLACE NSEC3PARAM
   REPLACE-NS <name> <n> <rdata>+
   GLUE <name> <type> <n> <rdata>+
   SOA <serial>

           Figure 6: More optimizations syntax ideas for MIXFR.

   Idea: the whole way to RRset

   ADD <type> <n> <m> <Rdata>+n  <RRSIG>+m
   REPLACE <type> <n><m><Rdata>*n <RRSIG>*m
   if only signature then n = 0

         Figure 7: And more optimizations syntax ideas for MIXFR.

   Strictly speaking we can save a few bytes by doing the following in
   RRSIG:

   KEY <alg><lables><origTTL><end-time><start-time><key-id><signer>

   now the RRSIG parts only need to re real signature.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign the RR type value [TBD] (decimal) for MIXFR.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce additional security considerations.
