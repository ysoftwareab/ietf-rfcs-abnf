   REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) 
   signaling protocol for use on the Internet. This document proposes a 
   security extension for RELOAD. A new data transmission security model
   was introduced in this draft. This model was based on a central Key
   Management Server (KMS). Security communications among multi peers 
   can be achieved with PSC(Public Security Channel). PSC can also get
   performance improvement compared with TLS/DTLS method in 
   RELAOD draft.

1.  Introduction                                                                 
                                                                                 
   This document defines PSC (Public Security Channel), a key management
   mode for RELOAD[I-D draft-ietf-p2psip-base-07]. PSC provides an 
   alternative service for security P2P overlay communications. With 
   this service, P2P network allows peers to organize large-scale group 
   communications in virtual channels. Compared with TLS/DTLS mode 
   mentioned in RELOAD draft, PSC mode achieves less expense and low 
   latency. This method can also fulfill the manageability, 
   controllability requirements in some networks.  
   

2.  Terminology                                    
                                                                                 
   PSC: Public Security Channel, used to secure data transmission in 
        P2P network.                        
   KMS: Key Management Server, used to assign PSC ID and key for   
        P2P node.                               
   P2P Node: node in P2P network. Node exchange information after
        encrypting them use PSC key.           
              
              
3.  Design Considerations 
             
   As mentioned in [I-D draft-mattsson-mikey-ticket-02], key management
   systems are divided into three items:                                         
   
   (1) negotiation and exchange directly
       (e.g. Diffie-Hellman based schemes)                                                                           
 
   (2) pre-distribution of user credentials
       (e.g. shared secrets/certificates)                                                                                                                                            
 
   (3) trusted Key Management Service                                                                                                                                                                                    
   
   Key management modes in RELOAD specification are all variants of the 
   first two alternatives. Detailed description will be showed in 3.1.                                                                              
 
   A key management service is often preferred in large-scale systems. 
   Because with Key Management Service , there is no need for 
   pre-distribution of credentials or secret materials. When a peer need
   to establish security communication with other peers, it send request 
   message to KMS. KMS handle this request message. Handle process was 
   consists of certificate verification and access control. KMS will 
   send security channel related materials back to the peer if peer's 
   request was accepted.

3.1  security issues in RELOAD  
   
   RELOAD's security model is based on each node having one or more 
   public key certificates. These certificates can be signed by a 
   central certificate server or node itself. Credentials in the 
   certificates were used for security communications of RELOAD message.
   
   Communication security in RELOAD was at three levels: 
   
   (1) Connection Level: Connections between peers are secured with TLS 
                         or DTLS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
   (2) Message Level: Each RELOAD message must be signed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
   (3) Object Level: Stored objects must be signed by the storing peer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
3.2  design motivation  
   
   As mentioned in 3.1, message communication security in RELOAD was 
   resolved in two levels: connection level and message level. TLS and 
   DTLS were used on connection level between nodes. Nodes in P2P 
   network can exchange messages on TLS or DTLS channel directly. This 
   method was flexible and effective in small-scale network. But there 
   are some imperfections to use TLS/DTLS in RELOAD. 
   
   (1) TLS/DTLS was designed for Client/Server mode. So it is not 
       convenient to use TLS/DTLS in P2P overlay network. for example,
       the position of nodes is equal reciprocally in RELOAD, so mutual
       certification will be needed frequently. But mutual certification
       in TLS/DTLS is complex and expensive.                                                             
   (2) TLS/DTLS is not suitable for different situations. Variant 
       security strategies were needed in large scale networks. TLS/DTLS
       can not sustain many security strategies. Only encryption level 
       and cipher spec can be changed in TLS/DTLS. Complicated security 
       strategy, such as key refreshment according to network situation,
       can not be deployed on TLS/DTLS.     
   (3) In order to set up TLS/DTLS, PKI infrastructure should be
       deployed in the network. This is unrealistic in some 
       environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   (4) The security of nodes in RELOAD was guaranteed to a certain 
       extent. Especially when strict access control was implemented. 
       So there is no need to verify each other before security link was
       established sometimes. But verification between nodes was 
       mandatory in TLS/DTLS. It is unreasonable.                                                                 
   
   In a word, it is necessary to introduce a new key management 
   mechanism into RELOAD. A key management server will be specially 
   designed in this mechanism. Key management server is responsible for
   key generation, distribution and refreshment. This server should also
   cooperate with other existing facilities in RELOAD.

4.  A New Mode: PSC

4.1  overview

   Public Security Channel(PSC) was introduced to resolve message 
   security problems. PSC is an essential complement of TLS/DTLS 
   solution. In PSC, P2P nodes exchange messages after encrypting them 
   using PSC key.
                                                                                                                                                
   The PSC method include KMS and P2P node. The function of KMS and P2P
   node was interpreted in Terminology section.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
   The position of PSC in RELOAD architecture is as follows. PSC link 
   Message Transport Component and Forwarding & Link Management 
   Component. In original RELOAD structure, message can be only 
   supported by overlay link layer. After adding PSC in, P2P overlay 
   network can accomplish security channel establishment without overlay
   link layer.

4.2  set up a PSC
        
   There are two ways to set up a PSC. A node can accomplish the 
   setting up process either in the bootstrap phase or in the normal 
   running phase.   
            
4.2.1  Bootstrap phase         
            
   In the bootstrap phase, the peer acquires an configuration file 
   either by downloading online or other offline methods. Several KMSs 
   server address will be included in the configuration file.
                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   The peer sends InitializeRequest message to one of the KMSs. Message 
   contents are: peer certificate, peer ID, encryption algorithms peer 
   support, whether to join a established PSC, whether to establish a 
   new PSC. 
                                                                                                                                                                               
   (1) peer certificate: help KMS to verify the peer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
   (2) peer ID: identify peer in PSC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   (3) encryption algorithm peer support: used for PSC key generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
   (4) whether to join a established PSC: notify KMS whether to join a 
       established PSC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (5) PSC ID(optional): used with "whether to join a established PSC", 
       confirm the PSC ID which peer want to join in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
   (6) whether to establish a new PSC: notify KMS whether to establish a 
       PSC for peer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
   
   KMS receive the InitializeRequest message and resolve it. KMS check 
   up the user certificate, in this progress, KMS may need communicate 
   with certificate server. KMS decide whether user can establish a PSC
   and whether can join a established PSC. Then KMS send a 
   InitializeResponse message back to user. Message contents are: PSC 
   related materials(PSC ID and PSC key materials).

4.2.2  Running phase                              
                                                                                 
   We need to establish a PSC after joining P2P overlay in some 
   conditions. There may be some peers want to communication in a group 
   or some secret messages transported between P2P nodes. These 
   requirements are temporary during running phase of P2P network.  
     
   One peer should be chosen out to be PSC constructor. This peer 
   collect essential information for PSC constructing and send 
   PscEstablishRequest message to KMS. This message includes: peer ID, 
   PSC access control information. 
                                     
   peer ID: identify peer on KMS, help KMS to get peer's certificate 
   for further manipulation.  
                                                                                                                                                                       
   PSC access control information: help KMS to accomplish access 
   control function.                                                                                                                                                                                   
    
       
   KMS receives PscEstablishRequest message and resolve it. First, KMS 
   verify peer's certificate to examine whether this user can construct
   a PSC. Certificate was stored on KMS during bootstrap phase. If 
   verification was went through, KMS accomplish several actions which
   include choosing encryption algorithm, generating keys, adding PSC
   member ID into PSC data structure, etc. 
      
   KMS send PscEstablishResponse message back to construct peer and 
   notify other PSC members through PscRefresh message. Construct user 
   and other PSC members receive these messages and communicate in PSC.

4.3  join a PSC 
   
   There are two ways to join a PSC: active and passive. Nodes can join 
   a PSC by sending a joining request to KMS actively or invited by a 
   PSC constructor.      
         
4.3.1  Join a PSC actively 
   
   When node A want to communicate with node B in a PSC. Node A should 
   get PSC ID of node B. Then node A send a PscJoinRequest message to 
   KMS. PSC ID was included in this request message. KMS receive this 
   message and query security information of node B's PSC. If node A 
   was authorized to access to node B's PSC. KMS return correct 
   response message to node A. Encryption related materials will also 
   be sent to node A through PscRefresh message. If node A's request 
   can not be accepted, PscJoinRequest message will be sent to node A
   for rejection. If there are not clear information for A's access to 
   B's PSC. KMS should send a query message to B for affirmance. 
   B receive this query message and demand whether A was allowed to 
   this PSC.

   When node A has set up a PSC and asked node B to join this PSC.                
   Node A sends a PscInviteIntializeRequest message to KMS. KMS check             
   the validity of this message and demand whether Node B can be invited          
   to node A's PSC. If invite request was accepted, KMS send                     
   PscInviteRequest message to Node B. Node B decide whether to join              
   this PSC and send PscInviteResponse message to KMS. KMS send                   
   PscInviteIntializeResponse back to Node A. PscInviteIntializeResponse          
   message was used for notifying node A the invite result. At the same           
   time, KMS modify the security information of PSC and send PscRefresh           
   message to group members of PSC.

   PSC should be refreshed in some situations. These situations include:
   
   (1) Timer expired. PSC should be refreshed periodically for security
       consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
   (2) some PSC member leave a PSC. Peer which leave P2P network 
       normally should notify KMS its left. Peer can also detect other 
       peer's abnormal left and inform KMS. KMS receive this 
       information and confirm its facticity.                                                                               
   (3) some nodes join into a PSC. Peers join a PSC must communicate 
       with KMS first, so KMS can apperceive peer's join easily.                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                 
   When above situations happen, KMS send PscRefresh message to PSC 
   members. PSC ID and PSC key materials were included in this message.

                Figure 6  refresh a PSC


4.5  Destroy a PSC

   When security communication finished, PSC construct peer send a 
   PscDestroyRequest to KMS. PSC ID was included in this message. KMS 
   resolve this message as follows: check this peer's certificate to 
   decide whether this peer has the right to destroy a PSC. 
   
   If peer passed-through authentication, KMS send PscRefresh message to
   PSC members. PscRefresh was used for notifying them the destruction 
   of PSC. Then KMS delete the information of PSC.                                                                      

   PSC members stop communicating through PSC after receiving PscRefresh
   message. 
   
   KMS send PscDestroyResponse message back to PSC construct peer 
   at last.

5.  Key management   
   
   Key management is the core function in PSC. Key management function 
   can be divided into three scenarios: key generation, key distribution
   and key refreshment.
   
5.1  Key generation  

   When a peer send a initialize message(set up a PSC in bootstrap 
   phase)or PscEstablishRequest message(set up a PSC in running phase) 
   for PSC construction, KMS should generate PSC key. Just as TLS, PSC 
   constructor send supporting encryption scheme to KMS. KMS decide 
   which encryption scheme was used.
   
   Key generation should also be run when PSC refresh event happen. 
   
5.2  Key distribution  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
   PSC key should be encapsulated into a PscRefresh message which was 
   used for key distribution. This message was encrypted by a master 
   key. Master key can be get from PSC constructor's public 
   certificate.    
   
5.3  Key refreshment    
                                                                                   
   PSC'S key should be refreshed according some situations. These 
   situations has been showed in Section 4.4.
   
   
6.  Communication protocol of PSC  
   
6.1  KMS and certificate server   
   
   When KMS receive initialize message or construct message from peer, 
   KMS should communicate to certificate server for certificate 
   verification.    
                                    
   Certificate server can help KMS to validate the certificate of peer.
   Peer's public key was included in its certificate, KMS get peer's 
   public key after certificate verification.
   
6.2  KMS and peer                                                                                                                                            

   Peer send PSC related messages to KMS for PSC establishment, 
   refreshment and destruction. KMS accomplish corresponding work after 
   receiving these messages.

6.3  communication between KMSs                                         
                                                                        
   In order to defend DoS attack to KMS and achieve high availability,  
   multi KMSs should be deployed. KMS exchange PSC related information  
   (PSC ID, PSC member list, PSC key) between each other.               


7.  Security Considerations

   See details in section 3.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document proposes a new Key Management Mode, which may need IANA 
   considerations to define PSC(Public Security Channel) in RELOAD 
   protocol. 
  
   Todo: Need complete this section further.
