<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-time
      communication, and live media streaming, use a significant amount of
      Internet resources. Such applications often transfer large amounts of
      data in direct peer-to-peer connections. However, they usually have
      little knowledge of the underlying network topology. As a result, they
      may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics that, in
      many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices. This document describes
      problems related to optimizing traffic generated by peer-to-peer
      applications and associated issues such optimizations raise in the use
      of network-layer information.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, such as file sharing, real-time
        communication, and live media streaming, use a significant amount of
        Internet resources<a class='info' href='#WWW.wired.fuel'>[WWW.wired.fuel]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Glasner, J., &ldquo;P2P fuels global bandwidth binge,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Different
        from the client/server architecture, P2P applications access resources
        such as files or media relays distributed across the Internet and
        exchange large amounts of data in connections that they establish
        directly with nodes sharing such resources.
</p>
<p>One advantage of P2P systems results from the fact that the
        resources such systems offer are often available through multiple
        replicas. However, applications generally do not have reliable
        information of the underlying network and thus have to select among
        available instances based on information they deduce from empirical
        measurements that, in some situations, lead to suboptimal choices. For
        example, one popular metric is an estimation of round-trip time. This
        choice occurs before actual data transmission begins and thus before
        the peer can deduce actual throughput. This is one reason why a peer
        selection algorithm that simply uses round-trip time often results in
        a sub-optimal choice of peers.
</p>
<p>Many of today's P2P systems use an overlay network consisting of
        direct peer connections. Such connections often do not account for the
        underlying network topology. In addition to having suboptimal
        performance, such networks can lead to congestion and cause serious
        inefficiencies. As shown in <a class='info' href='#ACM.fear'>[ACM.fear]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karagiannis, T., Rodriguez, P., and K. Papagiannaki, &ldquo;Should ISPs fear Peer-Assisted Content Distribution?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, traffic
        generated by popular P2P applications often cross network boundaries
        multiple times, overloading links which are frequently subject to
        congestion <a class='info' href='#ACM.bottleneck'>[ACM.bottleneck]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Akella, A., Seshan, S., and A. Shaikh, &ldquo;An Empirical Evaluation of WideArea Internet           Bottlenecks,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Moreover, such
        transits, besides resulting in a poor experience for the user, can be
        quite costly to the network operator.
</p>
<p>Recent studies <a class='info' href='#ACM.ispp2p'>[ACM.ispp2p]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, V., Feldmann, A., and C. Scheideler, &ldquo;Can ISPs and P2P systems co-operate for improved           performance?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#WWW.p4p.overview'>[WWW.p4p.overview]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Xie, H., Krishnamurthy, A., Silberschatz, A., and R. Yang, &ldquo;P4P: Explicit Communications for Cooperative Control Between           P2P and Network Providers,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#ACM.ono'>[ACM.ono]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Choffnes, D. and F. Bustamante, &ldquo;Taming the Torrent: A practical approach to reducing           cross-ISP traffic in P2P systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> show
        a possible solution to this problem. Internet Service Providers (ISP),
        network operators or third parties can collect reliable network
        information. This information includes relevant information such as
        topology or instantaneous bandwidth available. Normally, such
        information is rather "static", i.e., information which can change
        over time but on a much longer time scale than information used for
        congestion control on the transport layer. By providing this
        information to P2P applications, it would be possible to greatly
        increase application performance, reduce congestion and optimize the
        overall traffic across different networks. Presumably, both the
        application and the network operator can benefit from such
        information. Thus, network operators have an incentive to provide,
        either directly themselves or indirectly through a third party, such
        information and applications have an incentive to use such
        information. This document gives the problem statement of optimizing
        traffic generated by P2P applications using information provided by a
        separate party.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#problem'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>The Problem</span><span>)</span></a> introduces the problem. <a class='info' href='#usecases'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Use Cases</span><span>)</span></a> describes some use cases where both P2P
        applications and network operators benefit from a solution to such a
        problem. <a class='info' href='#solution'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aspects of the Problem</span><span>)</span></a> describes the main issues to
        consider when designing such a solution. Note a companion document to

        are examples of contemporary solution proposals that address the
        problem described in this document. Moreover, these proposals have
        encouraging simulation and field test results. These and similar,
        independent, solutions all consist of two essential parts: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>a discovery mechanism which a P2P application uses to find a
            reliable information source and
</li>
<li>a protocol P2P applications use to query such sources in order
            to retrieve the information needed to perform better-than-random
            selection of the endpoints providing a desired resource.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not easy to foresee how such solutions will perform in the
        Internet. A more accurate evaluation requires representative data
        collected from real systems by a critical mass of users. However, wide
        adoption is unlikely without an agreement on a common solution based
        upon an open standard.

Definitions</h3>

<p>The following terms have special meaning in the definition of the
      Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Application:</dt>
<dd>A distributed communication system (e.g.,
          file sharing) that uses the ALTO service to improve its performance
          or quality of experience while optimizing resource consumption in
          the underlying network infrastructure. Applications may use the P2P
          model to organize themselves, use the client-server model, or use a
          hybrid of both.
</dd>
<dt>Peer:</dt>
<dd>A specific participant in an application.
          Colloquially, a peer refers to a participant in a P2P network or
          system, and this definition does not violate that assumption. If the
          basis of the application is the client-server or hybrid model, then
          the usage of the terms "client" and "server" disambiguates the
          peer's role.
</dd>
<dt>P2P:</dt>
<dd>Peer-to-Peer.
</dd>
<dt>Resource:</dt>
<dd>Content, such as a file or a chunk of a file
          or a server process, for example to relay a media stream or perform
          a computation, which applications can access. In the ALTO context, a
          resource is often available in several equivalent replicas. In
          addition, different peers share these resources, often
          simultaneously.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Identifier:</dt>
<dd>An application layer identifier
          used to identify a resource, no matter how many replicas exist.

<dt>Resource Provider:</dt>
<dd>For P2P applications, a resource
          provider is a specific peer that provides some resources. For
          client-server or hybrid applications, a provider is a server that
          hosts a resource.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Consumer:</dt>
<dd>For P2P applications, a resource
          consumer is a specific peer that needs to access resources. For
          client-server or hybrid applications, a consumer is a client that
          needs to access resources.
</dd>
<dt>Transport Address:</dt>
<dd>All address information that a
          resource consumer needs to access the desired resource at a specific
          resource provider. This information usually consists of the resource
          provider's IP address and possibly other information, such as a
          transport protocol identifier or port numbers.
</dd>
<dt>Overlay Network:</dt>
<dd>A virtual network consisting of
          direct connections on top of another network, established by a group
          of peers.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Directory:</dt>
<dd>An entity that is logically
          separate from the resource consumer that assists a resource consumer
          to identify a set of resource providers. Some P2P applications refer
          to the resource directory as a P2P tracker.
</dd>
<dt>Host Location Attribute:</dt>
<dd>Information about the
          location of a host in the network topology. The ALTO service gives
          recommendations based on this information. A host location attribute
          may consist of, for example, an IP address, an address prefix or
          address range that contains the host, an autonomous system (AS)
          number, or any other localization attribute. These different options
          may provide different levels of detail. Depending on the system
          architecture, this may have implications on the quality of the
          recommendations ALTO is able to provide, on whether recommendations
          can be aggregated, and on how much privacy-sensitive information
          about users might be disclosed to additional parties.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Service:</dt>
<dd>Several resource providers may be able
          to provide the same resource. The ALTO service gives guidance to a
          resource consumer or resource directory about which resource
          provider(s) to select in order to optimize the client's performance
          or quality of experience while optimizing resource consumption in
          the underlying network infrastructure.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Server:</dt>
<dd>A logical entity that provides interfaces
          to query the ALTO service.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Client:</dt>
<dd>The logical entity that sends ALTO
          queries. Depending on the architecture of the application one may
          embed it in the resource consumer or in the resource directory.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Query:</dt>
<dd>A message sent from an ALTO client to an
          ALTO server, which requests guidance from the ALTO Service.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Response:</dt>
<dd>A message sent from an ALTO server to
          an ALTO client, which contains guiding information from the ALTO
          service.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Transaction:</dt>
<dd>An ALTO transaction consists of an
          ALTO query and the corresponding ALTO response.
</dd>
<dt>Local Traffic:</dt>
<dd>Traffic that stays within the network
          infrastructure of one Internet Service Provider (ISP). This type of
          traffic usually results in the least cost for the ISP.
</dd>
<dt>Peering Traffic:</dt>
<dd>Internet traffic exchanged by two
          Internet Service Providers whose networks connect directly. Apart
          from infrastructure and operational costs, peering traffic is often
          free to the ISPs, within the contract of a peering agreement.
</dd>
<dt>Transit Traffic:</dt>
<dd>Internet traffic exchanged on the
          basis of economic agreements amongst Internet Service Providers
          (ISP). An ISP generally pays a transit provider for the delivery of
          traffic flowing between its network and remote networks to which the
          ISP does not have a direct connection.
</dd>
<dt>Application Protocol:</dt>
<dd>A protocol used by the
          application for establishing an overlay network between the peers
          and exchanging data on it, as well as for data exchange between
          peers and resource directories if applicable. These protocols play
          an important role in the overall ALTO architecture. However,
          defining them is out of the scope of the ALTO WG.
</dd>
<dt>ALTO Client Protocol:</dt>
<dd>The protocol used for sending
          ALTO queries and ALTO replies between an ALTO client and ALTO
          Server.
</dd>
<dt>Provisioning Protocol:</dt>
<dd>A protocol used for populating
          the ALTO server with topology-related information.
</dd>
<dt>Inter-ALTO Server Protocol:</dt>
<dd>The protocol used for
          synchronization, query forwarding, or referral between ALTO servers
          that have been provisioned with only partial knowledge of the
          topology-related information (e.g., on a per-domain basis).

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
The Problem</h3>

<p>Network engineers have been facing the problem of traffic
      optimization for a long time and have designed mechanisms like <a class='info' href='#RFC3031'>MPLS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, E., Viswanathan, A., and R. Callon, &ldquo;Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3031] and <a class='info' href='#RFC3260'>DiffServ<span> (</span><span class='info'>Grossman, D., &ldquo;New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3260]
      to deal with it. The problem these protocols address consists in finding
      (or setting) optimal routes for packets traveling between specific
      source and destination addresses and based on requirements such as low
      latency, high reliability, and priority. Such solutions are usually
      implemented at the link and network layers, and tend to be almost
      transparent. At best, applications can only "mark" the traffic they
      generate with the corresponding properties.
</p>
<p>However, P2P applications that are today posing serious challenges to
      Internet infrastructures do not benefit much from the above route-based
      techniques. Cooperating with external services aware of the network
      topology could greatly optimize the traffic the P2P application
      generates. In fact, when a P2P application needs to establish a
      connection, the logical target is not a host, but rather a resource
      (e.g., a file or a media relay) that is often available in multiple
      instances on different peers. Selection of the closest one -- or, in
      general, the best from an overlay topological proximity -- has much more
      impact on the overall traffic than the route followed by its packets to
      reach the endpoint.
</p>
<p>Optimization of peer selection is particularly important in the
      initial phase of the process. Consider a P2P protocol such as
      BitTorrent, where a querying peer receives a list of candidate
      destinations where a resource resides. From this list, the peer will
      derive a smaller set of candidates to connect to and exchange
      information with. In another example, a streaming video client may be
      provided with a list of destinations from which it can stream content.
      In both cases, the use of topology information in an early stage will
      allow applications to improve their performance and will help ISPs make
      a better use of their network resources. In particular, an economic goal
      for ISPs is to reduce the transit traffic on interdomain links.
</p>
<p>Addressing the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem
      means, on the one hand, deploying an ALTO service to provide
      applications with information regarding the underlying network and, on
      the other hand, enhancing applications in order to use such information
      to perform better-than-random selection of the endpoints they establish
      connections with.

File sharing</h3>

<p>File sharing applications allow users to search for content shared
        by other users and download it. Typically, search results consist of
        many instances of the same file (or chunk of a file) available from
        multiple sources. The goal of an ALTO solution is to help peers find
        the best ones according to the underlying networks.
</p>
<p>On the application side, integration of ALTO functionalities may
        happen at different levels. For example, in the completely
        decentralized Gnutella network, selection of the best sources is
        totally up to the user. In systems like BitTorrent and eDonkey,
        central elements such as trackers or servers act as mediators.
        Therefore, in the former case, optimization would require modification
        in the applications, while in the latter it could just be implemented
        in some central elements.

Cache/Mirror Selection</h3>

<p>Providers of popular content like media and software repositories
        usually resort to geographically distributed caches and mirrors for
        load balancing. Selection of the proper mirror/cache for a given user
        is today based on inaccurate geolocation data, on proprietary network
        location systems or often delegated to the user himself. An ALTO
        solution could be easily adopted to ease such a selection in an
        automated way.

Live Media Streaming</h3>

<p>P2P applications for live streaming allow users to receive
        multimedia content produced by one source and targeted to multiple
        destinations, in a real-time or near-real-time way. This is
        particularly important for users or networks that do not support
        multicast. Peers often participate in the distribution of the content,
        acting as both receivers and senders. The goal of an ALTO solution is
        to help peers to find the best sources and the best destinations for
        media flows they receive and relay.

Realtime Communications</h3>

<p>P2P real-time communications allow users to establish direct media
        flows for real-time audio, video, and real-time text calls or to have
        text chats. In the basic case, media flows directly between the two
        endpoints. However, unfortunately a significant portion of users have
        limited access to the Internet due to NATs, firewalls or proxies.
        Thus, other elements need to relay the media. Such media relays are
        distributed over the Internet with a public addresses. An ALTO
        solution needs to help peers to find the best relays.

ALTO Service Providers</h3>

<p>At least three different kinds of entities can provide ALTO
        services: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Network operators. Network operators usually have full
            knowledge of the network they administer and are aware of their
            network topology and transit and peering traffic policies.
</li>
<li>Third parties. Third parties are entities separate from network
            operators, but which may have either collected network information
            or have arrangements with network operators to learn the network
            information. Examples of such entities are content delivery
            networks like Akamai, which control wide and highly distributed
            infrastructures, or companies providing an ALTO service on behalf
            of ISPs.
</li>
<li>User communities. User communities run distributed algorithms,
            for example for estimating the topology of the Internet.
</li>
</ol>

ALTO Service Implementation</h3>

<p>It is important for the reader to understand there are significant
        user communities that expect an ALTO Server to be a centralized
        service. Likewise, there are other user communities that expect a
        service that services P2P applications be itself a distributed,
        possibly even a P2P, service.
</p>
<p>A result of this is one can reasonably expect there to be some sort
        of service discovery mechanism to go along with the ALTO protocol
        definition.

User Privacy</h3>

<p>On the one hand, there are data elements an ALTO client could
        provide in its query to an ALTO server that could help increase the
        level of accuracy in the replies. For example, if the querying client
        indicates what kind of application it is using (e.g. real-time
        communications or bulk data transfer), the server will be able to
        indicate priorities in its replies accommodating the requirements of
        the traffic the application will generate. On the other hand,
        applications might consider such information private. In addition,
        some applications may not know a priori what kind of request they will
        be making.

Topology Hiding</h3>

<p>Operators, with their intimate knowledge of their network topology,
        can play an important role in addressing the ALTO problem. However,
        operators often consider such network information to be
        confidential.

<a name="rfc.section.5.5"></a><h3>5.5.&nbsp;
Coexistence with Caching</h3>

<p>Caching is a common approach to optimizing traffic generated by
        applications that require large data transfers. In some cases, such
        techniques have proven to be extremely effective in both enhancing
        user experience and saving network resources.
</p>
<p>A cache, either explicitly or transparently, replaces the content
        source. Thus, the cache must use the same protocol as the querying
        peer. That is, if a cache stores web content, it must present an HTTP
        interface to the web client. Any cache solution for a given protocol
        needs to present that same protocol to the client. Said differently,
        each caching solution for a different protocol needs to implement that
        specific protocol. For this reason, one can only reasonably expect
        caching solutions for the most popular protocols, such as HTTP and
        BitTorrent.
</p>
<p>It is extremely important to realize that caching and ALTO are
        entirely orthogonal. ALTO, especially if it is aware of caches, can in
        fact direct clients to nearby caches where the user could get a much
        better quality of experience.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This document is neither a requirements document nor a protocol
      specification. However, we believe it is important for the reader to
      understand areas of security and privacy that will be important for the
      design and implementation of an ALTO solution. Moreover, issues such as
      digital rights management are out of scope for ALTO, as they are not
      technically enforceable at this level.
</p>
<p>The approach proposed in this document asks P2P applications to
      delegate a portion of their routing capability to third parties. This
      gives the third party a significant role in P2P systems.
</p>
<p>In the case where the network operator deploys an ALTO solution, it
      the P2P community might consider it hostile because the operator could,
      for example: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>use ALTO to prevent content distribution and enforce
          copyrights;
</li>
<li>redirect applications to corrupted mediators providing malicious
          content;
</li>
<li>track connections to perform content inspection or logging;
          and
</li>
<li>apply policies based on criteria other than network efficiency.
          For example, the service provider may suggest routes sub-optimal
          from the user's perspective to avoid peering points regulated by
          inconvenient economic agreements.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note there is no protocol mechanism to require
      ALTO for P2P applications. If, for some reason, ALTO fails to improve
      the performance of P2P applications, ALTO will not gain popularity and
      the P2P community will not use it.
</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the privacy issues described in the
      previous section are relevant for an ALTO solution. Users may be
      reluctant to disclose sensitive information to an ALTO server.
      Operators, on the other hand, may not wish to disclose information that
      would expose details of their interior topology. When exploring the
      solution space in detail, one needs to consider these issues so that an
      ALTO protocol does not presume mandatory information disclosure, by
      either clients or servers.
