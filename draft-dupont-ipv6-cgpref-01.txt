Abstract

   This document proposes the allocation of a dedicated prefix for
   Cryptographically Generated IDs (CGIDs).  This prefix makes the
   distinction between a CGID and a real IPv6 global address trivial.

1.  Introduction

   Some ideas floating at the IETF are about Cryptographically Generated
   IDs which provide intrinsic proofs of ownership.  Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses [RFC3972] are an example but this document

Internet-Draft                 CGID Prefix                     June 2005


   addresses some needs for CGIDs using the global unicast IPv6 address
   format [RFC3587].

   If all CGIDs use a dedicated prefix, marked as not routable, then the
   distinction between a CGID and a real global unicast IPv6 address
   will be instantaneous.  With such a prefix on n bits, a CGID will be
   the concatenation of the n bits of the prefix followed by 128 - n
   bits cryptographically generated (i.e., from the result of a hash
   function applied to parameters, including in many examples a public
   RSA key).

2.  Security Considerations

   The generation of a CGID should use a random value, like the CGA
   modifier, in order to make it unpredictable.  A small value of "n"
   makes collisions statically impossible and direct attacks very hard.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document argues in favour of the allocation of a dedicated
   prefix of 16 to 32 bits in length from the global unicast space.
   IANA is in charge of allocations in this space [RFC3513].

4.  Acknowledgments

   Gabriel Montenegro was the first to present the CGID idea.  IANA
   people helped us to find a reasonable range for the "n" value.
