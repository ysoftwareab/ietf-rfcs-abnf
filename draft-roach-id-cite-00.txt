Abstract

   This document updates RFC 2026 to change the term "Work in Progress"
   to "Internet Draft."

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on October 8, 2018.

1.  Introduction

   Section 2.2. of [RFC2026] allows publication of RFC with references
   to Internet-Drafts, with the requirement that such citations indicate
   that the Internet-Draft is labeled as a "Work in Progress."  While
   this designation is frequently accurate when used in this way, it is
   sometimes useful for RFCs to refer to Internet Drafts that are not
   being actively maintained and which will likely never be published.
   As such documents are not technically "Works in Progress," this
   specification updates RFC 2026's language to use the more broadly
   applicable phrase "Internet Draft."

2.  Change to RFC 2026

   This document updates RFC 2026 by replacing the final paragraph of
   its section 2.2 with the following text:

   Note: It is acceptable to reference a standards-track specification
   that may reasonably be expected to be published as an RFC using the
   phrase "Internet Draft" without referencing an Internet-Draft.  This
   may also be done in a standards track document itself as long as the
   specification in which the reference is made would stand as a
   complete and understandable document with or without the reference to
   the "Internet Draft".
