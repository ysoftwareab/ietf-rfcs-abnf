Internet-Draft    Format for SMSC/MMSC Feedback Reports        July 2010


1.  Introduction

   As the SMS/MMS spam problem continues to expand and potential
   solutions evolve, mobile operators are developing their own SMS/MMS
   anti-spam application on SMSC/MMSC or message gateways.  There is
   almost no centralized reporting agent/system to receive a SMS/MMS
   message abuse reports.  There is no centralized message spam analysis
   system which receives reports from individual message centers and
   instructs the message centers with filtering criteria and rules which
   are developed from message abuse reporting.

   This document introduces a SMS/MMS message abuse report and defines
   the content and report format; therefore, extends
   [draft-ietf-marf-base] to add features required for SMSC/MMSC
   reporting.

1.1.  Purpose

   The reports defined in this document are intended to inform SMS/MMS
   operators about:

   o  SMS/MMS abuse originating from foreign networks

   o  SMS/MMS abuse originating from their networks

   o  SMS/MMS abuse originating from application entities

1.2.  Requirements

   The following requirements are necessary for feedback reports (the
   actual specification is defined later in this document):

   o  They must be both human and machine readable

   o  In order to allow the receiver to handle the report properly, one
      of the following data must be enclosed in the report:

      *  The original message headers and whole message body

      *  The original message headers and a part of the message body
         which contains spam

      *  The original message headers only

   o  The machine-readable section must provide ability for the report
      generators to share the message meta-data with receivers

   o  The format must be extensible


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  SMS/MMS Reporting Required Fields

   The format of email feedback reports as a MIME message in
   [draft-ietf-marf-base] should be extended to include SMS/MMS message
   abuse report.

   The following is a non-exhaustive list of the specific parameters
   that SHOULD be included as optional fields in the base reporting MIME
   feedback reports, but are RECOMMENDED for SMS/MMS message reporting:

   o  Message ID

   o  Message Center ID

   o  Message Type

   o  Message Protocol ID

   o  Message Teleservice ID

   o  Message Language Indicator (M)

   o  Message Segment Indicator

   o  Message Data Encoding

   o  Message User Data

   o  Originating Domain

   o  Originating Address Type

   o  Originating Address

   o  Terminating Domain

   o  Termination Address Type

   o  Termination Address

   o  Abuse Type (M)

   o  Abuse Detected Methods (M)

   o  Abuse Keyword (M)

   o  Abuse Multimedia Elements (M)

   o  Message Delivery Decision

   o  Message Received Timestamp

   o  Message Delivered Timestamp
