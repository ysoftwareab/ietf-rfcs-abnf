          On the Dynamic/Automatic Configuration of IPv6 Hosts
                 draft-gont-v6ops-host-configuration-00

Abstract

   IPv6 has two different mechanisms for dynamic/automatic host
   configuration: SLAAC and DHCPv6.  These two mechanisms allow for the
   configuration of IPv6 addresses and a number of network parameters.
   While there is overlap in the parameters that can be configured via
   these two protocols, different implementations support only subsets
   of such parameters with either mechanism, or have no support for
   DHCPv6 at all.  This document analyzes a problem that arises from
   this situation, and mandates that all host implementations support
   RFC 6105 (DNS options for SLAAC) and the stateless DHCPv6
   functionality in RFC 3315.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 has two different mechanisms for dynamic/automatic host
   configuration: Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862]
   and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315].
   SLAAC allows for distributed address assignment (where each host
   automatically configures its own IPv6 addresses) and basic network
   configuration (such as recursive DNS servers and DNS search lists).
   On the other hand, DHCPv6 provides for centralized address assignment
   (the DHCPv6 server leases IPv6 addresses to hosts) and richer network
   configuration (NTP servers, web proxys, etc.).

   Traditionally, SLAAC has been seen as a more lightweight mechanism,
   suitable for resource-constrained devices, while DHCPv6 has been seen
   more as heavy-weight and full-fledged mechanism.  We note that this

   distinction is rather questionable, and is essentially meaningless
   for typical mobile devices or home appliances.

   Among the possible configuration information that can be conveyed
   with both SLAAC and DHCPv6 is DNS related configuration: recursive
   DNS servers and DNS search lists.  Configuring this information is
   probably as vital in practice as configuring IPv6 addresses, since
   for obvious reasons both humans and popular applications operate on
   names (rather than on IPv6 addresses).  The ability to convey this
   information has always been part of DHCPv6, while for the SLAAC case,
   support was added in a separate document that standardizes "IPv6
   Router Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration" [RFC6106].

   Unfortunately, different host and router implementations provide
   support for only a subset of these options.  For example, some host
   implementations (e.g., Android) support SLAAC DNS options [RFC6106],
   but do not support stateless DHCPv6.  On the other hand, other host
   implementations (e.g., Microsoft Windows) support stateless DHCPv6,
   but do not support [RFC6106].  Similarly, some router implementations
   support [RFC6106], while others do not.

   This represents a problem for IPv6 deployment, since:

   1.  in order to support most popular IPv6 host implementations, IPv6
       networks are required to support *both* SLAAC and DHCPv6.

   2.  some router implementations do not support [RFC6106] and hence
       support for the SLAAC DNS options may be impossible or require
       yet an additional network element or network service to support
       [RFC6106]

   We note that, in most cases, this problem is currently masked by the
   fact that most IPv6 deployments are actually dual-stack, and hence
   hosts can currently rely DNS-related information being obtained via
   IPv4-based DHCP.  However, at the point such deployments disable IPv4
   to become IPv6-only, the aforementioned problems will become evident,
   possibly as a surprise to network operators.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements for IPv6 Hosts

   IPv6 hosts MUST support the SLAAC DNS options specified in [RFC6106],
   and the stateless DHCPv6 mechanism specified in [RFC3315].

4.  Requirements for IPv6 Routers

   IPv6 routers MUST support the SLAAC DNS options specified in
   [RFC6106].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.  The RFC-Editor should remove
   this section prior to publication of this document as an RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   Host implementations supporting SLAAC are subject to a number of
   attacks based on forged ICMPv6 Router Advertisement [RFC4861]
   messages.  Such attacks can be mitigated by means of RA-Guard
   [RFC6105] [RFC7113].  Hosts supporting DHCPv6 are subject to a number
   of attacks based on forged DHCPv6-server messages.  Such attacks can
   be mitigated by means of DHCPv6-Shield [RFC7610].
