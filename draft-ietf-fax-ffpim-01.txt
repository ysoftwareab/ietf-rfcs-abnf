Abstract
     
     Classic facsimile document exchange represents both a set of
     technical specifications [T30] and a class of service.
     Previous work [RFC2305, RFC2532] has replicated some of that
     service class as a profile within Internet mail.  The
     current specification defines ôfull modeö carriage of
     facsimile data over the Internet, building upon that
     previous work and adding the remaining functionality
     necessary for achieving reliability, timeliness and
     capability negotiation for Internet mail that is on a par
     with classic T.30 facsimile. These additional features are
     designed to provide the highest level of interoperability
     with the existing and future standards-compliant email
     infrastructure and mail user agents, while providing a level
     of service that approximates the level currently enjoyed by
     fax users.
     
     The IETF has been notified of intellectual property rights
     claimed in regard to some or all of the specification
     contained in this document.  For more information consult

1.   Introduction
     
     The current specification defines ôfull modeö carriage of
     facsimile data over the Internet, building upon previous
     work [RFC2305, RFC2532] and adding the remaining
     functionality necessary for achieving reliability,
     timeliness and capability negotiation for Internet mail that
     is on a par with classic T.30 facsimile. These additional
     features are designed to provide the highest level of
     interoperability with the existing and future standards-
     compliant email infrastructure and mail user agents, while
     providing a level of service that approximates the level
     currently enjoyed by fax users.
     
     The new features are designed to be interoperable with the
     existing base of mail transfer agents (MTAs) and mail user
     agents (MUAs), and take advantage of existing standards for
     advanced functionality such as positive delivery
     confirmation and disposition notification.  The enhancements
     described in this document utilize the existing Internet
     email messaging infrastructure, where possible, instead of
     creating fax-specific features that are unlikely to be
     implemented in non-fax messaging software.
     
     The key words ôMUSTö, ôMUST NOTö, ôREQUIREDö, ôSHALLö,
     ôSHALL NOTö, ôSHOULDö, SHOULD NOTö, ôRECOMMENDEDö, ôMAYö,
     and ôOPTIONALö in this document are to be interpreted as
     described in [RFC2119].



2.   Content Negotiation
     
     Classic facsimile service is interactive, so that a sending
     station can discover the capabilities of the receiving
     station, prior to sending a facsimile of a document.  This
     permits the sender to transmit the best quality of facsimile
     that is supported by both the sending station and the
     receiving station.  Internet mail is store-and-forward, with
     potentially long latency, so that before-the-fact
     negotiation is problematic.
     
     This specification therefore uses a post-hoc technique that
     permits an originator to send the best version known by the
     originator to be supported by the recipient and then to send
     a better version if the recipient requests it.
     
     The specification for this technique is in [CONNEG].
     Implementations that are conformant to FFPIM MUST support
     content negotiation.
          
          [[[ A concern has been expressed that CONNEG does not
          support the full range of fax features.  The working
          group needs to resolve a) whether there are functional
          requirements for complete emulation of fax services
          that are not satisfied by the above specification, and
          b) what changes are necessary, if the answer to
          question a) is æyesÆ. /editor]]]

2.1. ESMTP-based content negotiation
     
     SMTP servers that are able to report capabilities of the
     addresses (mailboxes) which they support MAY use the ESMTP
     ôCONNEGö option.  This allows them to report capabilities of
     the receiving station as part of the ESMTP RCTP-TO
     interaction.
          
          [[[ This section is intended to assist in the operation
          of ôdirectö FFPIM interactions.  We need to develop
          specifications for the ESMTP ôCONNEGö option.  /editor
          ]]]



3.   Timely Disposition
     
     Internet mail is often reliable and speedy.  However it
     displays a very wide range of variability, depending upon
     details such as software implementation, systems operation,
     network connectivity and network activity.  By contrast,
     facsimile systems typically suffer only the fixed delay of
     telephone call setup time.  The T.30 fax standard includes a
     required delivery confirmation; so the sender gets an
     immediate, unambiguous report on the status of a
     transmission and, possibly, printing.  Internet mail
     standards include methods of reporting confirmation, but
     these are not always supported.
     
     This specification uses a set of capabilities that permits
     an originator to request that the email transport system
     seek a particular timeliness in delivery and then assures
     that the system will report the success or failure of that
     request.
     
     The specification for this technique is in [TIMELY].
     Implementations that are conformant to FFPIM MUST support
     timely disposition.
          
          [[[ A question has been raised about alternative
          confirmation behaviors.  The working group needs to
          resolve a) whether there are functional requirements
          for complete emulation of fax services that are not
          satisfied by the above specification, and b) what
          changes are necessary, if the answer to question a) is
          æyesÆ. /editor]]]
          
          [[[ The editor believes that the features provided by
          the TIMELY mechanisms EXCEED the related services
          provided by the T.30 fax world.  /d ]]]



4.   Content Format
     
     Support for enhancements to TIFF are included in this
     specification.  The details for these enhancements are
     contained in [TIFF].  Implementations that are conformant to
     FFPIM MUST support TIFF enhancements.
          
          [[[ A question has been raised about alternative
          confirmation behaviors.  The working group needs to
          resolve a) whether there are functional requirements
          for complete emulation of fax services that are not
          satisfied by the above specification, and b) what
          changes are necessary, if the answer to question a) is
          æyesÆ. /editor ]]]
          
          [[[ The editor suspects that the features provided by
          the TIFF specification meets or exceeds the related
          services provided by the T.30 fax world.  /d ]]]



5.   Security Considerations
     
     As this document is an extension of [RFC2305] and [RFC2532],
     the Security Considerations sections of [RFC2305] and
     [RFC2532] applies to this document, including discussion of
     PGP and S/MIME use for authentication and privacy.
     
     It appears that the mechanisms added by this specification
     do not introduce new security considerations, however the
     concerns raised in [RFC2532] are particularly salient for
     these new mechanisms.
