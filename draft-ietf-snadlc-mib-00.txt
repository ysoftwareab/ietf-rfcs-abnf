months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted
by other documents at any time.  It is not appropriate to use
Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other
than as a "working draft" or "work in progress."

2.  Abstract

This Internet-Draft defines an extension to the Management
Information Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network
management.  In particular, it defines objects for managing
the configuration, monitoring and control of data link
controls in an SNA environment. This draft identifies managed
objects for SNA Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) links
only.  2, 3.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
community.

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
components.  They are:

o    RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of
     management.

o    RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
     architectural aspects of the framework.

o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
     access to managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an
administratively assigned name.  The object type together with
an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
object type.

4.  Overview

The SNADLC MIB is composed of two managed entities with, at
most, three tables each.  The two managed entities for SDLC
are:

o    Ports: the physical connection, and

o    Link Stations: the logical connections on the Port.

The three management tables are:

o    Adminstration: objects used for configuring and
     controlling the operation of a Port or Link Station,

o    Operational: objects that reflect the run-time state of
     the Port or Link Station, and

o    Statistics: objects that reflect the operating metrics of
     the Port or Link Station.

Not all managed entities have all three tables.  The following
are the actual tables found in this MIB:

1)   Port Administration Table,

2)   Port Operation Table,

3)   Link Station Administration Table,

4)   Link Station Operation Table,

5)   Link Station Statistics Table,

There is no Port Statistics Table since most of the statistics
relevant to a particular port are a part of the RS-232 MIB in
RFC1317.
