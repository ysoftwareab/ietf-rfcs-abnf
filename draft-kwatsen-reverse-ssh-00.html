<h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Requirements Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">This memo presents a technique for a SSH (Secure Shell) <a href="#RFC4251">[RFC4251]</a> server to initiate the underlying TCP connection to the SSH client.  This role reversal is necessary in cases where the SSH client would otherwise be unable to initiate an SSH connection to the SSH server, such as a device "calling home" on its first boot.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">The need for Reverse SSH is primarily for device management, as no other circumstance seems to need it.  As such, and so as to reduce confusion, this document uses the terms "device" and "application" to refer to the TCP-client/SSH-server and TCP-server/SSH-client, respectively.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">The SSH protocol is nearly ubiquitous for device management, as it is the transport for the command-line applications `ssh`, `scp`, and `sftp` and the required transport for the NETCONF protocol <a href="#RFC4741">[RFC4741]</a>.  However, in all these cases, the device expects to be the SSH server so that it can authenticate the application, apply security credentials, enable SSH channels to be opened, and so on.  Reverse SSH allows the device to always be the SSH server regardless of which peer initiates the underlying TCP connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Reverse SSH is useful for both initial and on-going device management.  Use of Reverse SSH for initial deployment is independent of its use for on-going management.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">For initial deployment, Reverse SSH may be used as a "call home" mechanism, similar to that provided by Broadband Forum TR-069 <a href="#TR069">[TR069]</a>, but with the benefit of not being bound to any particular protocol (SOAP over HTTP).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">For on-going management, Reverse SSH may be used to enable any of the following scenarios: </p>

<ul>
<li>The device may be deployed behind a NAT-ing device that doesn't provision an external address and port to connect to.</li>
<li>The device may be deployed behind a firewall that doesn't allow SSH access to the internal network.</li>
<li>The device may be configured in "stealth mode" with no open ports</li>
<li>The device may access the network in a way that dynamically assigns it an IP address and is not configured to use a service to register its dynamically-assigned IP address to a well-known domain name.</li>
<li>The operator prefers to have one open-port to secure in the data center, rather than have an open port on each device in the network.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">One key benefit of using SSH as the transport protocol for Reverse SSH is its ability to multiplex an unspecified number of independently flow-controlled TCP sessions on top of a single encrypted tunnel <a href="#RFC4254">[RFC4254]</a>.  This feature is valuable as the device only needs to be configured to initiate a single Reverse SSH connection regardless the number the TCP-based protocols the application wishes to support.  For instance, the application may "pin up" a channel for each distinct type of asynchronous notification the device supports (logs, traps, backups, etc.) and dynamically open/close channels as needed by its runtime.  Lastly, using SSH channels has been found to be more straightforward and supported than using other multiplexing protocols such as Block Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) <a href="#RFC3080">[RFC3080]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">Reverse SSH has been designed to be fully transparent to the SSH protocol and, specifically, not affect the ability for an SSH server to reset its host keys.  This strategy ensures that Reverse SSH is easy to both implement and deploy.  As a testament to it's ease of implementation, all the SSH libraries tested in a number of programming languages, both the client and server side API supported using an already accepted TCP file descriptor, which doesn't retain any state as to which peer initiated the TCP connection.  Further, on systems supporting OpenSSL, the `sshd -i` parameter does the same on the command-line, in order for `inetd` to pass accepted connections on to it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.9">This RFC additionally defines a YANG <a href="#RFC6020">[RFC6020]</a> module for the configuration of the Reverse SSH agent running on a device.  While wholly distinct from the Reverse SSH protocol, the definition of a YANG module enables a management application to generically manage the IETF-namespaced configuration without needing to understand any device-specific data-model.  This is important as helps to normalize the configuration necessary to bootstrap multi-vendor devices for their "initial deployment".  The definition of a YANG module also ensures that key features are enabled such as supporting more than one application, more than one server per application, and the definition of a reconnection strategy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.10">This RFC does not attempt to define any strategy for how an initial deployment might obtain its bootstrapping "call home" configuration (address to connect to, signature algorithm to use, authentication credentials to use, etc.).  That said, implementations may consider use of a DHCP server or a USB pen drive as viable options.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Protocol Overview</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The Device's perspective </p>

<ul>
<li>The device initiates a TCP connection to the application on the IANA-assigned Reverse SSH port [TBD]</li>
<li>Immediately after the TCP session starts, the device MUST send a REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message to the remote application and then start the SSH server using the accepted TCP connection.</li>
<li>The REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message contains information necessary for the application to identify the device and authenticate it's SSH host-key</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The Application's Perspective </p>

<ul>
<li>The application listens for TCP connections on the IANA-assigned Reverse SSH port</li>
<li>The application accepts an incoming TCP connection and waits to receive the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message</li>
<li>The application processes the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message by first asserting that its message header fields are as expected</li>
<li>The application then uses the DEVICE-ID field to lookup the device in some internal persistent datastore</li>
<li>The application uses a device-specific key found in its datastore to authenticate the device's SSH host key contained in the message</li>
<li>The application initiates the SSH client protocol using the accepted TCP connection</li>
<li>The application authenticates the device's SSH host key using one of the ones it just authenticated from the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message</li>
<li>The application authenticates itself to the device using previously configured authentication credentials</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Protocol</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">As mentioned in in the overview, the "protocol" is really just a single message, the 'REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO' message, which is described as follows:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.1"></div>
<pre>
    string "REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO (v1)"
    string device-id
    uint32 host-key-info-count
    string host-key-info[1..host-key-info-count]
                </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The "device-id" field encodes an application-configured identifier.  This field is necessary as the device MAY not be identifiable from its TCP session's source address due to it "calling home" for the first time or having a dynamically assigned address.  The device-id MAY be the device's serial-number though, for security reasons, it is NOT RECOMMENDED.  The device-id SHOULD be a random value meaningful only to the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The "host-key-info-count" field indicates the number of "host-key-info" blocks that follow.  This value MUST be a positive value less than or equal to the number of host-keys the device has.  This is to say, the value cannot exceed the number of "server_host_key_algorithms" the device would present in its "SSH_KEY_INIT" message (section 7.1 of <a href="#RFC4253">[RFC4253]</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">The "host-key-info" field, one for each host key the device has, provides information needed for the application to authenticate the host-key at the time of the SSH key-exchange.  Certificate based hosts keys, such as those using PGP from <a href="#RFC4253">[RFC4253]</a> or x.509 from <a href="#RFC6187">[RFC6187]</a> only need to list their name, whereas others will need to be signed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">Format for the 'host-key-info' field:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.2"></div>
<pre>
    string server-host-key-algorithm
    .....  algorithm-specific-data follow
                </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">The "server-host-key-algorithm" field identifies the format of the host-key (e.g. "ssh-rsa").  It's value MUST be one of the "server_host_key_algorithms" values the device would present in its "SSH_KEY_INIT" message (section 7.1 of <a href="#RFC4253">[RFC4253]</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">No algorithm-specific data needs to follow any of the certificate-based host key algorithms; the name alone is sufficient since the host-key presented at the time of the SSH key exchange will carry with it all the information needed for the application to authenticate it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.8">Non certificate-based host key algorithms MUST encode their algorithm-specific data as follows:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.3"></div>
<pre>
    string host-key
    string signature-algorithm
    string signature
                </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.9">The "host-key" field is the algorithm-specific host key (e.g. the ssh-rsa key) on the device.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.10">The "signature-algorithm" field identifies the signature algorithm used to sign the host key.  Which algorithm is used is an application-configured value selected among options supported by the device.  The following options are identified here, but vendor-specific options MAY be specified using the extensibility mechanism defined in <a href="#RFC4250">[RFC4250]</a>.</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.4"></div>
<p>Signature Algorithms (extensible)</p>
<pre>
    hmac-md5        [RFC2104]
    hmac-sha1       [RFC2104]
    rsa-sha1        [RFC3447] (Section 8.2)
    hmac-sha256     [RFC4231]
                </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.11">All of these signature algorithms require a key to be provided. The HMAC-based algorithms require a symmetric-key (both peers know the same value) and the RSA-based algorithm requires an asymmetric key (device has the private key).  The YANG module presented in the "Device Configuration" section below defines the necessary configuration nodes for these key values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.12">The "signature" field contains the "result" of the signature algorithm applied to the host-key field.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> Device Configuration</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">For devices that support NETCONF, this section defines a YANG <a href="#RFC6020">[RFC6020]</a> module that can be used to enable management applications to configure the Reverse SSH service on the device.   This section is also useful for devices that do not support NETCONF, as it highlights what a configuration data model SHOULD include.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">While it's expected that NETCONF <a href="#RFC4741">[RFC4741]</a> will be used to configure the device, it's not entirely clear how that can be done for "initial-deployments", especially when needing to support a zero-touch "call home" mechanism, where the device is set to its factory defaults.  Though out of scope for this RFC, it's helpful to consider that many of these values can be provided either from the DHCP server or a USB-based drive that device bootstraps itself from.  Further, for devices having a secure crypto processor, it's expected that its "factory default" includes a unique private key (stored in crypto processor) and a public certificate signed by the device's vendor, providing the needed "chain of trust" for the PGP and/or x.509 host key algorithms.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> Security Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">This protocol deviates from standard SSH protocol usage in two ways: 1) the device initiates the underlying TCP connection and 2) the device sends the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message to the application.  The SSH client/server protocol itself is unchanged.  Thus all security considerations are limited to these two differences.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">Despite section 4 of the SSH Transport Layer Protocol RFC <a href="#RFC4253">[RFC4253]</a> stating "The client initiates the connection", having the device initiate the underlying TCP connection is in itself not a primary concern.  This can be seen by assuming the device has a stable IP address, such that the application can discover it from the TCP connection's state, thus enabling it to lookup of the corresponding record for the device's host-key in its local datastore and proceed as usual.  Ultimately, the fundamentals for how the application trusts the device's host key are unchanged.  This is true even for first-time authentications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">However, Reverse SSH is designed to support cases where the device's IP address may be NAT-ed or dynamically-assigned.  Compounding the issue further, Reverse SSH is designed to support scenarios where its not possible to have any prior information about the device's host key.  This is clear since SSH keys are typically generated after a device boots its "factory default".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">Thus there are two issues - establishing the identity of the device and trusting its host key.  Resolving these two issues is the purpose of the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">The REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message itself is neither signed nor encrypted.  Care must be taken regarding the data the device sends and how it is precessed by the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.6">Since the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message is not encrypted, it should not contain any value that might give an observer any undue information about the device. Of primary concern are the "device-id" field and information embedded in any certificates sent.  Specifically, using the device's serial number for its "device-id" is NOT RECOMMENDED as it may reveal the device's model-number and/or manufacturing date.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.7">Likewise, many fields in the REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message must be consumed without being able to verifying that they are the values the device sent.  For instance, the "device-id" value must to used to lookup the device's record in a local datastore in order to obtain the keys needed to process the rest of the message.  The application must be sure to validate all inputs carefully as they may be purposely encoded to illicit unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.8">The REVERSE-SSH-CONN-INFO message enables the application to authenticate the device's SSH host key.  This authentication occurs prior to the start of the SSH protocol in order to remain entirely transparent to it.  The device's host keys are authenticated by it being signed by another key that the application does trust.  Thus the trust in the host key is conveyed by the other key vouching for it.   In order for this solution to not lose any cryptographic strength, the strength of the signing key MUST be greater or equal to SSH host key it it vouching for.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.9">An attacker could DoS the application using valid "device-id" values, forcing the application to perform computationally expensive operations, only to deduce that the attacker doesn't posses a valid key.  This is no different than any secured service and all common precautions apply (e.g. blacklisting the source address after a set number of unsuccessful login attempts).</p>
