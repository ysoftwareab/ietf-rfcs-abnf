                      draft-ietf-ngtrans-6to4-01.txt

   This memo specifies an optional mechanism for assigning a unique

   address prefix to any site with at least one globally unique IPv4
   address, even if combined with an IPv4 Network Address Translator
   (NAT).

Internet Draft Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds       Feb 1999


1. Introduction

   This memo specifies an optional mechanism for assigning a unique IPv6
   address prefix to any site that currently has at least one globally
   unique IPv4 address, and describes scenarios for using such a prefix
   during the co-existence phase of IPv4 to IPv6 transition. Note that
   these scenarios are only part of the total picture of transition to
   IPv6, in addition to the mechanisms in [RFC 1933].

   The motivation for this method is to allow isolated IPv6 domains,
   attached to a wide area network which has no native IPv6 support, to
   communicate with other such IPv6 domains with minimal manual
   configuration. Effectively it treats the wide area IPv4 network as a
   virtual link layer.

   IPv6 domains connected using this method do not require IPv4-
   compatible IPv6 addresses [RFC 1933] or configured tunnels. In this
   way IPv6 gains considerable independence of the underlying wide area
   network and can step over many hops of IPv4 subnets. The abbreviated
   name of this mechanism is 6to4 (not to be confused with [6OVER4]).
   The 6to4 mechanism is implemented almost entirely in boundary
   routers, without specfic host modifications except a recommended
   address selection algorithm.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2. IPv6 Prefix Allocation

   Suppose that a subscriber site has at least one valid, globally
   unique 32-bit IPv4 address, referred to in this document as V4ADDR.
   This address MUST be duly allocated to the site by an address
   registry (possibly via a service provider) and it MUST NOT be a
   private address [RFC 1918].

   The IANA has permanently assigned one 13-bit IPv6 Top Level
   Aggregator (TLA) identifier under the IPv6 Format Prefix 001 [AARCH,
   AGGR], referred to in this document as TLA624. Its numeric value is
   0x0010.

   [*** temporary note - this assignment remains to be made and may
   change ***]

   The subscriber site is then deemed to have the following IPv6 address
   prefix, without any further assignment procedures being necessary:
      Prefix length: 48 bits
      Format prefix: 001
      TLA value: TLA624
      NLA value: V4ADDR

   This is illustrated as follows:

         | 3 |  13 |    32     |   16   |          64 bits               |
         +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+
         |FP | TLA | V4ADDR    | SLA ID |         Interface ID           |
         |001| 624 |           |        |                                |
         +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+

   Thus, this prefix has exactly the same format as normal prefixes
   assigned according to [AGGR]. Within the subscriber site it can be
   used for automated address assignment and discovery according to the
   normal mechanisms such as [CONF, DISC].
   If the subscriber site is not yet running native
   IPv6, but is running IPv4 multicast, this "6 to 4" address prefix can
   be used in conjunction with the "6 over 4" mechanism [6OVER4]. Thus
   isolated IPv6 hosts within isolated IPv6 domains can communicate by
   using "6 over 4" to a boundary router and "6 to 4" over the wide
   area.



3. Maximum Transmission Unit

   If the IPv6 MTU size proves to be too large for some intermediate
   IPv4 subnet, IPv4 fragmentation will ensue.  While undesirable, this
   is not necessarily disastrous, unless the fragments are delivered to
   different IPv4 destinations due to some  form of IPv4 anycast. The
   IPv4 "do not fragment" bit MUST NOT be set in the encapsulating IPv4
   header.

   The default MTU size for IPv6 packets is 1280 octets [IPV6], which is
   greater than the specified minimum IPv4 MTU size of 576 octets [RFC
   791].  In the event that the IPv6 Path MTU is discovered to be less
   than 1280 octets, the 6to4 egress router MUST return an ICMP Packet
   Too Big message reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  The
   procedure described in the last paragraph of Section 5 of [IPv6] MUST
   then be followed by analogy. Note that this does not require any
   modification to an IPv6 host conforming to [IPv6]. Other
   considerations are as described in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC 1933].



4. Frame Format

   IPv6 packets are transmitted in IPv4 packets [RFC 791] with an IPv4
   protocol type of 41, the same as has been assigned [RFC 1933] for
   IPv6 packets that are tunneled inside of IPv4 frames.  The IPv4
   header contains the Destination and Source IPv4 addresses.  One or
   both of these will be identical to the V4ADDR field of an IPv6 prefix
   formed as specified above (see section 6 for more details).  The IPv4
   packet body contains the IPv6 header and payload.

   If there are IPv4 options, then padding SHOULD be added to the IPv4
   header such that the IPv6 header starts on a boundary that is a 32-
   bit offset from the end of the datalink header.

   The IPv4 Time to Live will be set as normal [RFC 791], as will the
   encapsulated IPv6 hop limit [IPv6]. Other considerations are as
   described in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC 1933].



5. Multicast and Anycast

   Nothing prevents IPv6 multicast packets being sent to or sourced from
   a 6to4 router. A multicast routing protocol such as PIM-SM may be
   used.  However, since unicast routing for 6to4 has some peculiarities
   discusssed in the next section, an IPv6 multicast tree that covers
   both 6to4 and non-6to4 sites is likely to have a sub-optimal
   topology. If it has a single branch in the 6to4 address space, the
   multicast packets are likely to traverse large regions of the IPv4
   network as well as corresponding regions of the IPv6 network. If the
   tree has multiple branches in the 6to4 address space, 6to4
   encapsulation of the same multicast packet will take place multiple
   times.

   The allocated anycast address space [ANYCAST] is compatible with
   TLA624 prefixes.



6. Scenarios, scaling, and transition to normal prefixes



6.1 Simple scenario - all sites work the same

   The simplest deployment scenario for 6to4 is for use between a number
   of sites, each of which has at least one connection to a shared IPv4


Carpenter + Moore         Expires August 1999                   [Page 5]

Internet Draft Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds       Feb 1999


   Internet. This could be the global Internet, or it could be a
   corporate IP network. In the case of the global Internet, there is no
   requirement that the sites all connect to the same Internet service
   provider. The only requiremement is that any of the sites is able to
   send IPv4 packets to any of the others.

   By definition, each site has an IPv6 prefix in the format defined in
   Section 2. It will therefore create DNS records for these addresses.
   For example, site A which owns IPv4 address 192.1.2.3 will create DNS
   records with the IPv6 prefix {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=192.1.2.3}/48.
   Site B which owns address 9.254.253.252 will create DNS records with
   the IPv6 prefix {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=9.254.253.252}/48.

   When an IPv6 host on site B queries the DNS entry for a host on site
   A, the DNS returns an address with the prefix
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=192.1.2.3}/48 and whatever SLA and Interface
   ID applies.  The converse applies when a host on site A queries the
   DNS for a host on site B. IPv6 packets are formed and transmitted in
   the normal way within both sites.

   The only change to standard IPv6 routing is that the egress router on
   each 6to4 site MUST include the sending rule:

        if the destination address of an IPv6 packet is
          {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16
          then
              if the NLA field is an IPv4 address assigned to this site
                then queue the packet for local IPv6 forwarding
                else encapsulate the packet in IPv4 as in Section 3
                     with destination address set to the NLA value V4ADDR;
                     queue the packet for IPv4 forwarding.

   A simple decapsulation rule for incoming IPv4 packets with protocol
   type 41 is also required:
          Apply any security checks (see Section 8)
          Remove the IPv4 header
          Submit the packet to local IPv6 routing.

   In this scenario, no IPv4 routing information is imported into IPv6
   routing (nor vice versa). The above special sending rule is the only
   contamination of IPv6 forwarding, and it occurs only at egress
   routers.

   In this scenario, any number of 6to4 sites can interoperate with no
   prior agreement, no tunnel setup, and no special requirements from
   the IPv4 service. All that is required is the appropriate DNS entries
   and the special sending rule configured in the egress router. This
   router SHOULD also generate the appropriate IPv6 prefix announcements
   [CONF, DISC].

   It is RECOMMENDED that in any case each site should use only one IPv4
   address per egress router, and that should be the address assigned to
   the external interface of the egress router.  Single-homed sites
   therefore SHOULD use only one IPv4 address for 6to4 routing.  Multi-
   homed sites are discused in section 6.3.

   Because of the lack of setup and prior agreement, and the distributed
   deployment model, there are believed to be no particular scaling
   issues with the 6to4 mechanism.



6.2 Mixed scenario - some sites also have native IPv6

   Suppose one or more of the sites described above acquire native IPv6
   connectivity in addition to 6to4 connectivity. In this case it is
   necessary to relay packets between the 6to4 realm and the native IPv6
   realm. There must be at least one router acting as a relay.  There is
   nothing special about this; it is simply a normal router which
   happens to have at least one logical 6to4 egress interface and at
   least one other IPv6 interface.

   An IPv6 router willing to act as a relay from native IPv6 to the 6to4
   address space advertises a route to {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 into the
   native IPv6 routing system, and whatever other native IPv6 prefixes
   are appropriate on its 6to4 interface. These prefixes will indicate
   the regions of native IPv6 topology that the relay router is willing
   to relay to. Their choice is a matter of routing policy. It is
   clearly desirable for network operators to carefully consider
   desirable traffic patterns and topology when choosing the scope of
   such advertisements.

   Within a 6to4 site, the {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 prefix will normally
   be handled as a default route.

   It is a matter of routing policy how far the advertisement of
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 is propagated. Since there will presumably be
   multiple relay routers advertising it, network operators will require
   to filter it in a managed way. Incorrect policy in this area will
   lead to potential unreachability or to perverse traffic patterns.

   A 6to4 site which also has a native IPv6 connection MUST NOT
   advertise its TLA624/48 prefix on that connection, and IPv6 network
   operators MUST filter out and discard any TLA624 prefix
   advertisements longer than /16.

   Sites which have at least one native IPv6 egress, in addition to a
   6to4 egress, will therefore have at least one IPv6 prefix which is
   not a TLA624 prefix. Such sites' DNS entries will reflect this and
   DNS lookups will return multiple addresses.  If two such sites need
   to interoperate, whether the 6to4 route or the native route will be
   used depends on IPv6 address selection by the individual hosts (or
   even applications).

   Now consider again the example of the previous section. Suppose an
   IPv6 host on site B queries the DNS entry for a host on site A, and
   the DNS returns multiple IPv6 addresses with different prefixes. If
   the host picks the 6to4 prefix according to some rule for multiple
   prefixes, it will simply send packets to an IPv6 address formed with
   the prefix {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=192.1.2.3}/48. It is essential that
   they are sourced from the prefix


Carpenter + Moore         Expires August 1999                   [Page 7]

Internet Draft Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds       Feb 1999


   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=9.254.253.252}/48 for two-way connectivity to
   be possible.

   The following algorithm SHOULD be used for address selection. Suppose
   that sending host B has a set {B} of IPv6 addresses, and the DNS has
   returned a set {A} of IPv6 addresses for host A. Then B performs a
   longest prefix match for each address in {B} against each member of
   {A}, and selects as the address pair to be used that pair with the
   overall longest match. This guarantees that a pair of TLA624
   addresses will be selected unless there is a better match using
   native IPv6 addresses, which is the desired result. In the case of a
   tie the choice is arbitrary. This algorithm is believed to be of
   general application as it will always select the topologically
   closest pair of addresses. It is the only host software change
   required.


6.3 Multihoming

   Sites which are multihomed on IPv4 MAY extend the 6to4 scenario by
   using a TLA624 prefix for each IPv4 egress router, thereby
   automatically obtaining a degree of IPv6 multihoming. The address
   selection algorithm of the previous section will apply.



6.4 Transition considerations

   If the above rules for routing advertisements and address selection
   are followed, then a site can migrate from using 6to4 to using native
   IPv6 connections over a long period of co-existence, with no need to
   stop 6to4 until it has ceased to be used. The stages involved are

   1. Run IPv6 on site using any suitable implementation. True native
   IPv6, [6OVER4], or tunnels are all acceptable.

   2. Configure an egress router to the external IPv4 network to
   support 6to4, including advertising the appropriate TLA624
   prefix locally. Configure IPv6 DNS entries using this prefix.
   At this point the 6to4 mechanism is automatically available.

   3. When native external IPv6 connectivity becomes available,
   add a second (native) IPv6 prefix to both the egress router
   configuration and the DNS configuration. At this point, the
   address selection rule described above will determine when
   6to4 and when native IPv6 will be used.

   4. When 6to4 usage is determined to have ceased (which may
   be several years later), remove the 6to4 configuration.

6.5 Usage with firewall or NAT

   The 6to4 mechanisms can run exactly as described above in the
   presence of a firewall at the egress router.

   If the site concerned has very limited global IPv4 address space, and
   is running an IPv4 network address translator (NAT), all of the above
   mechanisms remain valid. The address used for V4ADDR will simply be a
   globally unique IPv4 address allocated to the NAT, which will also
   function as an IPv6 6to4 router. Combining a 6to4 router with an IPv4
   NAT offers  the site concerned a globally unique IPv6 /48 prefix,
   automatically, behind the IPv4 address of the NAT. Thus every host
   behind the NAT can become an IPv6 host with no need for additional
   address space allocation, and no intervention by the Internet service
   provider.  No address translation is needed by these IPv6 hosts.

   A more complex situation arises if a host is more than one NAT hop
   away from the globally unique IPv4 address space. This document does
   not adress this situation.



6.6 Usage within Intranets

   There is nothing to stop the above scenario being deployed within a
   private corporate network as part of its internal transition to IPv6;
   the corporate IPv4 backbone would serve as the virtual link layer for
   individual corporate sites using TLA624 prefixes.  In this case the
   V4ADDR MAY  be a private IPv4 address [RFC 1918], which MUST be
   unique within the private network.  The corresponding DNS record MUST
   NOT be advertised outside the private network.



6.7 Summary of impact on routing

   IGP (site) routing will treat the local site's TLA624 /48  prefix
   exactly like a native IPv6 site prefix assigned to the local site.
   There will also be an IGP route to the generic {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16
   prefix, which will be a route to the site's 6to4 router, unless this
   is handled as a default route.

   EGP (i.e. BGP) routing will include advertisements for the
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624}/16 prefix from relay routers into the native IPv6
   realm, whose scope is limited by routing policy. This is the only
   non-native IPv6 prefix advertised by BGP.

   It will be necessary for 6to4 routers to obtain routes to relay
   routers in order to access the native IPv6 realm. In the simplest
   case there will be a manually configured default IPv6 route to
   {FP=001,TLA=TLA624,NLA=V4ADDR}/48, where V4ADDR is the IPv4 address
   of a relay router. Such a route can be used to establish a BGP
   session for the exchange of additional IPv6 routes.

7. ICMP messages

   ICMP "unreachable" and other messages returned by the IPv4 routing
   system will be returned to the egress router or relay router that
   generated a encapsulated TLA624 packet. However, this router will
   often be unable to return an ICMPv6 message to the originating IPv6
   node, due to the lack of sufficient information in the "unreachable"
   message. This means that the IPv4 network will appear as an
   undiagnosable link layer for IPv6 operational purposes. Other
   considerations are as described in Section 4.1.3 of [RFC 1933].



8. IANA considerations

   No assignments by the IANA are required except the special TLA value
   TLA624 = 0x0010.   [*** value to be confirmed ***]



9. Security considerations

   Implementors should be aware that, in addition to posssible attacks
   against IPv6, security attacks against IPv4 must also be considered.
   Use of IP security at both IPv4 and IPv6 levels should nevertheless
   be avoided, for efficiency reasons.  For example, if IPv6 is running
   encrypted, encryption of IPv4 would be redundant except if traffic
   analysis is felt to be a threat.  If IPv6 is running authenticated,
   then authentication of IPv4 will add little.  Conversely, IPv4
   security will not protect IPv6 traffic once it leaves the 6to4
   domain. Therefore, implementing IPv6 security is required even if
   IPv4 security is available.

   By default, 6to4 traffic will be accepted and decapsulated from any
   source from which regular IPv4 traffic is accepted.  If this is for
   any reason felt to be a security risk (for example, if IPv6 spoofing
   is felt to be more likley than IPv4 spoofing), then additional
   source-based packet filtering could be applied. A possible
   plausibility check is whether the encapsulating IPv4 address is
   consistent with the encapsulated TLA624 address. If this check is
   applied, exceptions to it must be configured to admit traffic from
   relay routers (Section 6).  TLA624 traffic must also be excepted from
   checks applied to prevent spoofing of "6 over 4" traffic [6OVER4].
