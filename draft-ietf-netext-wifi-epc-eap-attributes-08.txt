               EAP Attributes for WiFi - EPC Integration
              draft-ietf-netext-wifi-epc-eap-attributes-08

Abstract

   With WiFi emerging as a trusted access network for service providers,
   it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G
   and 4G networks in WiFi access networks as well.  Such functions
   include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data
   Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility between WiFi and
   3G/4G networks.

   The EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') protocol is required for mobile devices to
   access the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via trusted WiFi
   networks.  This document defines a few new EAP attributes to enable
   the above-mentioned functions in trusted WiFi access networks.

1.  Introduction

   WiFi has emerged as a trusted access technology for mobile service
   providers.  It has become important to provide certain functions in
   WiFi which are commonly supported in licensed-spectrum networks such
   as 3G and 4G networks.  This draft specifies a few new EAP attributes
   for a Mobile Node (MN) to interact with the network to support some
   of the functions (see below).  These new attributes serve as a
   trigger for network nodes to undertake the relevant mobility
   operations.  For instance, when the Mobile Node indicates and the
   network agrees for a new IP session (i.e., a new Access Point Name or
   APN in 3GPP), the corresponding attribute (defined below) can act as

   a trigger for the Mobile Anchor Gateway (MAG) to initiate a new
   mobility session with the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).  This document
   refers to [RFC6459] for the basic definitions of mobile network
   terminology (such as APN) used here.

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks support many
   functions that are not commonly implemented in a WiFi network.  This
   document defines EAP attributes that enable the following functions
   in trusted WiFi access networks using EAP-AKA' [RFC5448] and EAP-AKA
   [RFC4187]:

      o APN Selection

      o Multiple APN Connectivity

      o WiFi to 3G/4G (UTRAN/EUTRAN) mobility

   Since the attributes defined here share the same IANA registry, the
   methods are applicable to EAP-AKA', EAP-AKA and EAP-SIM [RFC4186]
   and, with appropriate extensions, are possibly applicable for other
   EAP methods as well.  In addition to the trusted WiFi access
   networks, the attributes are applicable to any trusted "non-3GPP"
   access network that uses the EAP methods and provides connectivity to
   the mobile EPC (which provides connectivity for 3G, 4G and other non-
   3GPP access networks).

1.1.  APN Selection

   The 3GPP networks support the concept of an APN (Access Point Name).
   This is defined in [GPRS].  Each APN is an independent IP network
   with it's own set of IP services.  When the MN attaches to the
   network, it may select a specific APN to receive desired services.
   For example, to receive generic internet services, user device may
   select APN "Internet" and to receive IMS voice services, it may
   select APN "IMSvoice".

   In a WiFi access scenario, a MN needs a way of sending the desired
   APN name to the network.  This draft specifies a new attributes to
   propagate the APN information via EAP.

1.2.  Multiple APN Connectivity

   As an extension of APN Selection, a MN may choose to connect to
   multiple IP networks simultaneously. 3GPP provides this feature via
   Additional Packet Data Protocol (PDP) contexts or Additional Packet
   Data Network (PDN) connections, and defines the corresponding set of
   signaling procedures.  In a trusted WiFi network, a MN connects to
   the first APN via DHCPv4 or IPv6 Router Solicitation.  This document

Internet-Draft  EAP Attributes for WiFi - EPC Integration      June 2014


   specifies an attribute that indicates the MN's capability to support
   multiple APN connectivity.

1.3.  WiFi to E-UTRAN mobility

   When operating in a multi-access network, a MN may want to gracefully
   handover it's IP attachment from one access to another.  For
   instance, a MN connected to 3GPP E-UTRAN network may choose to move
   its connectivity to a trusted WiFi network.  Alternatively, the MN
   may choose to connect from both the access technologies
   simultaneously, and maintain two independent IP attachments.  To
   implement these scenarios, the MN needs a way to correlate the UTRAN/
   E-UTRAN session with the new WiFi session.  This draft specifies an
   attribute to propagate E-UTRAN session identification to the network
   via EAP.  This helps the network to correlate the sessions between
   the two RAN technologies and thus helps the overall handover process.

2.  Reference Architecture and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Overview

3.1.  Brief Introduction to EAP

   EAP is defined as a generic protocol in [RFC3748].  EAP, combined
   with one of the payload protocols such as EAP-AKA' [RFC5448] can
   accomplish several things in a network:

   o  Establish identity of the user (MN) to the network.

   o  Authenticate the user during the first attach with the help of an
      authentication center that securely maintains the user
      credentials.  This process is called EAP Authentication.

   o  Re-authenticate the user periodically, but without the overhead of
      a round-trip to the authentication center.  This process is called
      EAP Fast Re-Authentication.

   This draft makes use of the EAP Authentication procedure.  The use of
   EAP Fast Re-Authentication procedure is for further study.  Both the
   EAP Authentication and EAP Fast Re-Authentication procedures are
   specified for trusted access network use in 3GPP.  [TS-33.402]

3.2.  IEEE 802.11 Authentication using EAP over 802.1X

   In a WiFi network, EAP is carried over the IEEE 802.1X Authentication
   protocol.  The IEEE 802.1X Authentication is a transparent, payload-
   unaware mechanism to carry the authentication messages between the MN
   and the WiFi network elements.

   EAP, on the other hand, has multiple purposes.  Apart from it's core
   functions of communicating MN's identity to the network and proving
   MN's credentials, it also allows the MN to send arbitrary information
   elements to help establish the MN's IP session in the network.  The
   following figure shows an example end-to-end EAP flow in the context
   of an IEEE 802.11 WiFi network.

   o  WAC: WiFi Access Controller.  In a PMIPv6 [RFC5213] network, hosts
      the MAG functionality or is assumed to have a suitable interface
      to the MAG.  In the following, we simply use "WAC" notation.  The
      MAG functionality within the WAC (or within the WiFi access
      network), or a suitable interface to MAG is assumed for PMIPv6
      deployments.

   o  IPCN: IP Core Network.  This includes the LMA function.  It
      generically also includes the AAA server function.

   o  NOTE: The figure shows separate WiFi Access Point and WiFi Access
      Controller, following the split-MAC model of CAPWAP [RFC5415].  A
      particular deployment may have the two functions within a single
      node.

   Call Flow Description:

   1.   MN detects a beacon from a WAP in the vicinity

   2.   MN probes the WAP to determine suitability to attach (Verify
        SSID list, authentication type and so on)

   3.   MN initiates the IEEE 802.11 Authentication with the WiFi
        network.  In WPA/WPA2 mode, this is an open authentication
        without any security credential verification.

   4.   MN initiates 802.11 Association with the WiFi network.

   5.   WiFi network initiates 802.1X/EAP Authentication procedures by
        sending EAP Request/Identity

   6.   MN responds with it's permanent or temporary identity

   7.   WiFi network challenges the MN to prove it's credentials by
        sending EAP Request/AKA-Challenge

   8.   MN calculates the security digest and responds with EAP
        Response/AKA-Challenge

   9.   If authentication is successful, WiFi network responds to MN
        with EAP Success.

   10.  End-to-End data path is available for MN to start IP level
        activity (DHCPv4, IPv6 Router Solicitation etc.,)

4.  New EAP Attributes

   The following sections define the new EAP attributes and their usage.

4.1.  APN Selection

   In a WiFi network, a MN includes AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID attribute in
   EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge to indicate the desired APN identity for
   the first PDN connection.

   If the MN does not include AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID attribute in EAP-
   Response/AKA-Challenge, the network may select an APN by other means.
   This selection mechanism is outside the scope of this document.

4.2.  WiFi to UTRAN/E-UTRAN Mobility

   When a multi-access MN enters a WiFi network, if MN intends to
   continue the IP session previously attached via UTRAN/E-UTRAN, it
   shall include the following parameters in the EAP-Response/AKA-
   Challenge.

   o  AT_HANDOVER_INDICATION : This attribute indicates to the network
      that MN intends to continue the IP session from UTRAN/E-UTRAN.  If
      a previous session can be located, network shall honor this
      request by connecting the WiFi access to the existing IP session.

   o  AT_HANDOVER_SESSION_ID: MN may use this attribute to identify the
      session on UTRAN/E-UTRAN.  If used, this attribute shall contain
      P-TMSI (Packet Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) if the
      previous session was on UTRAN or shall contain M-TMSI (Mobile
      Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) if the previous session was
      on E-UTRAN.  This attribute helps the network correlate the WiFi
      session to an existing UTRAN/E-UTRAN session.

4.3.  Connectivity Type

   A Mobile Node indicates its preference for connectivity using the
   AT_CONNECTIVITY_TYPE attribute in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.  The preference indicates whether the MN wishes connectivity
   to the Evolved Packet Core (so-called "EPC PDN connectivity") or
   Internet Offload (termed as "Non-Seamless Wireless Offload").

   The network makes its decision and replies with the same attribute in
   the EAP Success message.

5.  Attribute Extensions

   The format for the new attributes follows that in [RFC4187].  Note
   that the Length field value is inclusive of first two bytes.

5.1.  AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID

   The AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID attribute identifies the virtual IP network
   that the MN intends to attach to.  The implementation of the virtual
   network on the core network side is technology specific.  For
   instance, in a 3GPP network, the virtual network is implemented based
   on the 3GPP APN primitive.

   This attribute SHOULD be included in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.

               Figure 2: AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID EAP Attribute

   Virtual Network Id:

   An arbitrary octet string that identifies a virtual network in the
   access technology MN is attaching to.  For instance, in 3GPP E-UTRAN,
   this could be an APN.  See [TS-23.003] for encoding of the field.

5.2.  AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_REQ

   When MN intends to connect an APN, MN shall use this attribute to
   indicate different capabilities to the network.  In turn, the network
   provides what is supported.

   From the MN, this attribute can be included only in EAP-Response/
   Identity.  From the network, it SHOULD be included in the EAP
   Request/AKA-Challenge message.  In the MN-to-network direction, the
   Type field (below) indicates MN's request.  In the network-to-MN
   direction, the Type field indicates network's willingness to support
   the request; a present Type field indicates the network support for
   that Type.

5.3.  AT_CONNECTIVITY_TYPE

   A Mobile Node uses this attribute to indicate whether it wishes the
   connectivity type to be Non-Seamless WLAN Offload or EPC.  This
   attribute is applicable for multiple PDN connections only.

   From the MN, this attribute can be included only in EAP-Response/
   Identity.  From the network, it SHOULD be included in the EAP

              Figure 5: AT_HANDOVER_INDICATION EAP Attribute

   Handover Type:

   o  0 - MN has no intention of handing over an existing IP session,
      i.e., MN is requesting an independent IP session with the WiFi
      network without disrupting the IP session with the UTRAN/E-UTRAN.
      In this case, no Session Id (Section 5.5) may be included.

   o  1 - MN intends to handover an existing IP session.  In this case,
      MN may include a Session Id (Section 5.5) to correlate this WiFi
      session with a UTRAN/E-UTRAN session.

5.5.  AT_HANDOVER_SESSION_ID

   When MN intends to handover an earlier IP session to the current
   access network, it may propagate identity that can help identify the
   previous session from UTRAN/E-UTRAN that MN intends to handover.
   This attribute is defined as a generic octet string.  MN may include
   E-UTRAN GUTI if the previous session was a E-UTRAN session.  If the
   previous session was a UTRAN session, MN may include UTRAN Global RNC
   ID (MCC, MNC, RNC Id) and P-TMSI concatenated as an octet string.

   This attribute SHOULD be included in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.

              Figure 6: AT_HANDOVER_SESSION_ID EAP Attribute

   Access Technology:

   This field represents the RAN technology from which the MN is
   undergoing a handover.

   o  TBA IANA: Reserved

   o  TBA IANA: UTRAN

   o  TBA IANA: E-UTRAN

   Session Id:

   An arbitrary octet string that identifies the session in the source
   access technology.  As defined at the begining of this section, the
   actual value is RAN technology dependent.  For E-UTRAN, the value is
   GUTI.  For UTRAN, the value is Global RNC Id (6 bytes) followed by
   P-TMSI (4 bytes).See [TS-23.003] for encoding of the field.

5.6.  AT_MN_SERIAL_ID

   This attribute defines the MN's machine serial number.  Examples are
   International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and International
   Mobile Equipment Identity Software Version (IMEISV).  Other formats
   may be defined in the future.

   This attribute SHOULD be included in the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge
   message.

                  Figure 7: AT_MN_SERIAL_ID EAP Attribute

   Serial ID Type:

   This field identifies the type of the MN Identifier.  New values may
   be defined in the future.

   o  TBA IANA: Reserved

   o  TBA IANA: IMEI

   o  TBA IANA: IMEISV

   MN Serial Id

   An arbitrary octet string that identifies the MN's machine serial
   number.  The actual value is device-specific.  See [TS-23.003] for
   encoding of the field.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines new EAP attributes to extend the capability of
   EAP-AKA protocol as specified in Section 8.2 of RFC 4187 [RFC4187].
   The attributes are passed from the MN to the AAA server.  The
   document does not specify any new messages or options to the EAP-AKA
   protocol.

Internet-Draft  EAP Attributes for WiFi - EPC Integration      June 2014


   The attributes defined here are fields which are used in existing
   trusted 3G and 4G networks, where they are exchanged (in protocols
   specific to 3G and 4G networks) subsequent to the mobile network
   authentication (e.g., using the UMTS-AKA mechanism).  The exact model
   is followed here with the EAP-AKA (or EAP-AKA', EAP-SIM)
   authentication; the new attributes specified MUST be processed only
   after a successful EAP authentication.  In doing so, the new
   attribute processing, security-wise, is no worse than that in
   existing 3G and 4G mobile networks.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new skippable EAP-AKA attributes.
   These attributes need assignments from the "EAP-AKA and EAP-SIM
   Parameters" registry at https://www.iana.org/assignments/eapsimaka-
   numbers/eapsimaka-numbers.xhtml

   o  AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID (Section 5.1) - TBA by IANA

   o  AT_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_REQ (Section 5.2) - TBA by IANA

   o  AT_CONNECTIVITY_TYPE (Section 5.3) - TBA IANA

   o  AT_HANDOVER_INDICATION (Section 5.4) - TBA by IANA

   o  AT_HANDOVER_SESSION_ID (Section 5.5) - TBA by IANA

   o  AT_MN_SERIAL_ID (Section 5.6) - TBA by IANA

   This document requests a new IANA registry "Trusted non-3GPP Access
   EAP Parameters", and requests assignments for the following fields:

   o  Virt-Net-Req Type (Section 5.2) - TBA by IANA

   o  Virt-Net-Req Sub type (Section 5.2) - TBA by IANA

   o  Connectivity Type (Section 5.3) - TBA IANA

   o  Access Technology (Section 5.5) - TBA by IANA

   o  Serial ID Type (Section 5.6) - TBA by IANA

8.  Acknowledgment

   Thanks to Sebastian Speicher for the review and suggesting
   improvements.  Thanks to Mark Grayson for proposing the MN Serial ID
   attribute.  And, thanks to Brian Haberman for suggesting a new
   registry.
