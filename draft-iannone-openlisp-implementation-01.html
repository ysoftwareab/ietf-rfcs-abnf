Introduction</h3>

<p>Very recent activities in the IETF and in particular in the 
     Routing Research Group (RRG) have focused on defining a new Internet 
     architecture, in order to solve issues related to scalability, 
     addressing, mobility, multi-homing, inter-domain traffic engineering 
     and routing (<a class='info' href='#I-D.iab-raws-report'>[I&#8209;D.iab&#8209;raws&#8209;report]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Meyer, D., &ldquo;Report from the IAB Workshop on Routing and Addressing,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, 
     <a class='info' href='#I-D.irtf-rrg-design-goals'>[I&#8209;D.irtf&#8209;rrg&#8209;design&#8209;goals]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, T., &ldquo;Design Goals for Scalable Internet Routing,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). 
     It is widely recognized that the approach based on the separation of 
     the end-systems' addressing space (the identifiers) and the routing 
     locators' space is the way to go. 
     This separation is meant to alleviate the routing burden of the 
     Default Free Zone (DFZ), but it implies the need of distributing and 
     storing mappings between identifiers and locators on caches placed 
     on routers and to perform tunneling or address translation operation.
     
</p>
<p> Among the various proposals presented in various RRG's meeting, 
    LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol), based on the map-and-encap 
    approach <a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[I&#8209;D.farinacci&#8209;lisp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Oran, D., and D. Meyer, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, is one of the most 
    advanced and promising proposals. 
    UC Louvain his currently developing an implementation, 
    called OpenLISP, of this protocol in the FreeBSD kernel (version 7.0 -  
    <a class='info' href='#FreeBSD'>[FreeBSD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>The FreeBSD Project, &ldquo;FreeBSD, the power to serve,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>). OpenLISP can be downloaded from: 
    http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be. Note that the current release refers to version 
    07 of the LISP draft. 
    
</p>
<p>This draft describes the overall architecture of 
    this implementation and its main data structures.
    The draft is structured as follows. 
    We first describe the kernels' data structures created to store the 
    mappings necessary to perform encapsulation and decapsulation operations.
    Then, we show the architectural modifications made to the FreeBSD
    protocol stack in order to support the LISP protocol. 
    Then, we describe the new mapping sockets that have been introduced in 
    order to access the mappings from user space. This feature will be useful
    to develop Mapping Distribution Protocols in the user space.
    Finally, we discuss some issues related to the design and the 
    implementation of the LISP proposal.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Map Tables</h3>

<p>LISP defines two different databases to store mappings between 
    EID-prefixes and RLOCs. 
    The "LISP Cache" stores short-lived mappings 
    in an on-demand fashion when new flows start. The "LISP Database" 
    stores all the local mappings, i.e., all the mappings of the EID-Prefixes 
    behind the router.
    In OpenLISP we merged the two databases in a single radix tree
    data structure <a class='info' href='#TCPIP'>[TCPIP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wright, G. and W. Stevens, &ldquo;TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, The Implementation.,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a>.
    This allows to have an efficient indexing structure for all the EID-Prefixes
    that need to be stored in the system. EID-Prefixes that are part of the LISP 
    Database are marked by a "local" flag, indicating that they are 
    EID-Prefixes for which the mapping is owned locally.
    Thus, from a logical point of view the two "databases" are still 
    separated.
    Actually there are two radix structures in the system, one for IPv4 
    EID-Prefixes and another for IPv6 EID-Prefixes. 
    In both map tables, each entry has the format depicted in 
    <a class='info' href='#mapentry'>Figure&nbsp;1</a>.
    
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="mapentry"></a>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
struct mapentry {
   struct radix_node map_nodes[2];  /* tree glue, and other values */

   struct sockaddr_storage *EID;    /* EID value */

   struct locator_chain * rlocs;    /* Set of locators */
   int    rlocs_cnt;                /* Number of rlocs */

   u_long map_flags;                /* up/down?, local */

};

</pre></div>
<p style='text-align: center'>The mapentry structure
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;1&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p> Besides the fields necessary to build the radix tree itself,
    the entries contain a pointer to a socket address structure that
    holds the EID-Prefix to which the entry is related. 
    
</p>
<p>The "map_flags" field contains general flags that apply to the whole 
    mapping. Insofar, four flags have been defined and are listed in 
    <a class='info' href='#mapflags_tbl'>Table&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>General mapping flags</span><span>)</span></a>. The MAPF_UP flag just states that the 
    mapping is usable. 
    The MAPF_LOCAL flag means that the mapping is owned locally 
    (i.e., it is part of the LISP Database). In OpenLISP, when inserting a 
    "local" mapping it is mandatory that at least one RLOC is a local 
    address; i.e., an address of one of the interfaces of the system, 
    otherwise, during insertion, the system will return EINVAL error.
    This is because, when OpenLISP performs encapsulation, it only selects 
    source RLOCs that are addresses of the system. Doing otherwise would 
    introduce the risk of packet filtering on upstream routers if packets are 
    sent with a source address that does not belong to the system performing 
    the encapsulation operation.   
    The MAPF_STATIC indicates that the mapping has been manually added, 
    e.g., through the map utility (see <a class='info' href='#manmap1'>Appendix&nbsp;A.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>map(1)</span><span>)</span></a>). 
    The MAPF_DONE flag is used for messages through mapping sockets (see 
    <a class='info' href='#sockets'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mapping Sockets API</span><span>)</span></a>).
    Note that in the actual release of OpenLISP, 
    both static and non-static entries are treated in the same way: they need to
    be explicitly deleted. Future releases of OpenLISP will include the 
    possibility to introduce a timeout for non-local entries.

<p>The other main field of the mapentry data structure is the rlocs_cnt 
    field, containing the number of RLOCs present in the mapping. These 
    RLOCs are stored in a chained list whose head is referenced by the 
    "rlocs" pointer. The list of RLOCs is always maintained ordered by 
    increasing priority values, which means that RLOCs with higher priority 
    are at the head of the list. 
    
</p>
<p>Each element of the RLOCs list is a socket address structure 
    containing the locator and an rloc_mtx structure.
    The latter, depicted in <a class='info' href='#rlocmtx'>Figure&nbsp;2</a>,  contains the priority
    and weight parameters, whose meaning and use are defined in the original 
    LISP specification (including the particular 255 value for the priority 
    field). Note that load balancing is not yet implemented 
    in OpenLISP, thus the weight is not considered during RLOC selection.
    Future versions of OpenLISP will include load balancing and hence full
    support of the weight parameter.
    Furthermore, there is also a flags field, for flags
    that are specific to a RLOC, and a mtu field.

<p> Concerning flags, there are only two RLOC specific flags defined 
    insofar and described in <a class='info' href='#rlocflags_tbl'>Table&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>RLOC Specific flags</span><span>)</span></a>. 
    The RLOCF_REACH flag just indicates if the RLOC is reachable or not.
    This flag is meaningful no matter if the mapping is local or not.
    The RLOCF_LIF flag is meaningful only for local mappings and indicates 
    if the RLOC address belongs to the system. 
    When performing encapsulation, a RLOC is selected from a local mapping 
    only if it has this flag set, it is reachable, and its priority is less 
    than 255. This in order to issue packets that have a source address which 
    belongs to the system itself.
    
</p>
<p>The "mtu" field is used to check if the size of the LISP-encapsulated
    packet fits the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the outgoing interface.
    OpenLISP automatically fill this field when a local mapping is added. 
    In particular, OpenLISP checks all the RLOCs of the local mappings, if it 
    is an address belonging to the system it sets the RLOCF_LIF flag and  
    copies the MTU of the interface associated to the address. Note that, the 
    check is done only upon insertion, thus changes in the local address or the 
    MTU are not automatically copied in the mapping entry. For details on the 
    use of this field please refer to <a class='info' href='#mtu'>Section&nbsp;6.8<span> (</span><span class='info'>MTU Management</span><span>)</span></a>. 
    
</p>
<p>The use in OpenLISP of a chained list to store the RLOCs, allows 
    mixing IPv4 and IPv6 RLOCs. 
    This in turn allows to use IPv6 tunneling for IPv4 packets 
    and vice versa. Even more, in this way it is possible, for the same EID, 
    to perform both IPv6 and IPv4 tunneling depending on the RLOC 
    eventually chosen for the encapsulation. This avoids the constraint of 
    having the tunnels toward the same EID either all IPv4 or all IPv6.    
    Even if in the actual implementation status of OpenLISP, both IPv4 and IPv6 
    EIDs mapping tables are present, and both IPv4 and IPv6 RLOCs can be 
    introduced without limitation on the EID address family, the encapsulation
    and decapsulation operation are implemented only for IPv4, as long as the 
    map and mapstat utility (see <a class='info' href='#manmap1'>Appendix&nbsp;A.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>map(1)</span><span>)</span></a> and 
    <a class='info' href='#manmapstat'>Appendix&nbsp;A.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>mapstat</span><span>)</span></a>). Future releases of OpenLISP will support 
    IPv6 encapsulation.

Protocol Stack Modifications</h3>

<p>Compared to the original protocol stack implementation of the 
    FreeBSD OS (<a class='info' href='#TCPIP'>[TCPIP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wright, G. and W. Stevens, &ldquo;TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, The Implementation.,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#FreeBSD'>[FreeBSD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>The FreeBSD Project, &ldquo;FreeBSD, the power to serve,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>) 
    four main modules have been added, namely lisp_input(), lisp6_input(), 
    lisp_output(), and lisp6_output(). As should be clear from the names, 
    the first two modules manage incoming IPv4 and IPv6 LISP packets, 
    while the last two modules are responsible for outgoing IPv4 and IPv6 
    LISP packets.
    To describe the global architecture, we use the same 
    module representation as in <a class='info' href='#TCPIP'>[TCPIP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wright, G. and W. Stevens, &ldquo;TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, The Implementation.,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a> and show how packets

Incoming Packets</h3>

<p>The lisp_input() and lisp6_input() modules are positioned right 
      above respectively the ip_input() and ip6_input() modules, from 
      which they are called, as depicted in <a class='info' href='#lispinput'>Figure&nbsp;3</a>.  
      
</p>
<p>Let us for simplicity assume that an IPv4 LISP packet is received by 
      the system. The packet will be first treated by the ip_input() 
      module. The ip_input() module has been patched in order to recognize
      LISP packets. The patch consists simply to divert towards lisp_input(),
      all incoming UDP packets destined to the local machine and 
      having destination port number set to the LISP reserved value 
      4341 (for encapsulated data packets).
      If the UDP packet has not such a port number it is delivered as usual
      to the transport layer (i.e., udp_input()).
      
      In the case of an encapsulated data packet (port number 4341), 
      the module strips the UDP header and then it treats the reachability 
      bits and the nonce of the LISP specific header.
      
</p>
<p>OpenLISP checks all of the reachability bits and updates reachability 
      information in the map tables. While performing such an update a 
      consistency check  is performed. In particular, the number of reachability 
      blocks (32 bits) present in the packet is compared to the number of 
      reachability blocks present in the matching mapping entry, if different 
      the packet is dropped for bad LISP encapsulation and a message is sent 
      through open mapping sockets (see <a class='info' href='#sockets'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mapping Sockets API</span><span>)</span></a>).

<p>The same action is triggered if the number of reachability bits that 
      are set in the blocks differs from what expected. For instance, let us 
      assume the stored mapping contains two (2) RLOCs and the incoming packets 
      contains three (3) reachability bits set, this should never happen, 
      thus the packet is discarded and a message is sent through open mapping 
      sockets, in order to inform possible existing mapping management processes.
      Note that a mismatch in the number of reachability bits can be discovered
      only if they are set to reachable. If everything matches, but some 
      reachability bits have changed, they are updated in the mapping and a 
      message is sent through open mapping sockets to notify this change.
      Note that this last message is not a an error message, but just a 
      notification message, necessary to notify possible mapping management 
      processes in the user space about the reachability change.
      
</p>
<p>After having performed these operations, the IP header of the 
      remaining packet is checked in order to decide to which module to 
      deliver the packet. 
      In practice this means to re-inject the packet in the IP 
      protocol stack, by putting it in the input buffer either of the 
      ip_input() or the ip6_input() module.
      
</p>
<p> In the case of an IPv6 LISP packet the overall process is the 
      same. The packet is first received by ip6_input(), where if the 
      packet is a locally destined UDP packet with destination port 
      number equal to the LISP reserved 4341 value it is delivered to 
      lisp6_input(). The latter module performs the same operations as
      lisp_input(), with the only difference that it is specialized in 
      treating IPv6 headers. If the packet is a data packet, depending 
      on the address family of the inner header, once decapsulated it is 
      re-injected either in the input buffer of the ip_input() module 
      or the input buffer of ip6_input() module.
      
</p>
<p>Once the packet is re-injected in the protocol stack, in both 
      IPv4 and IPv6 cases, the packet follows the normal process. This 
      means that if the decapsulated packet is not destined to the local 
      host it will be first delivered to the forwarding module 
      (ip_forward() or ip6_forward()) that will in turn deliver it 
      to the output module (ip_output() or ip6_output()) in order to 
      send it down to the data link layer and transmit it toward its 
      final destination. These last actions are driven by the content of 
      the routing table of the system.

<p>Let us for simplicity assume that an IPv4 is received by the 
	ip_output() module, coming either from the ip_forward() module 
	or the transport layer (i.e., either tcp_output() or udp_output()).
	Note that we refer to a normal IPv4 packet, not a LISP encapsulated 
	packet.
	The ip_output() module has been patched in order to recognize
	if the packet needs to be encapsulated with a LISP header. 
	The patch consists in first checking if there is a valid mapping in 
	the LISP database. 
	This means to perform a search in the map table 
	using the source address (source EID) of the packet. 
	If the lookup returns an entry with the MAPF_LOCAL flag set 
	(recall <a class='info' href='#maptables'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Map Tables</span><span>)</span></a>), then a second lookup
	is performed in order to find a mapping for the destination EID.
	
</p>
<p>If there is no mapping available a message is sent through open 
	mapping sockets in order to notify the cache miss. This is needed in 
	order to trigger a mapping lookup, i.e., to send a Map-Request, by the 
	Mapping Distribution Protocol. Since there is no mapping available 
	the packet is not encapsulated. It is normally treated by the IP layer, 
	which means that if the destination EID is routable and a route exist 
	in the IP routing table it is forwarded without being encapsulated.
	Otherwise the IP layer will drop it.
	
</p>
<p>If a mapping for the destination EID is present, the packet 
	is diverted toward the lisp_output() module.
        The lisp_output(), will first perform MTUs checks (see 
	<a class='info' href='#openlispmtu'>Section&nbsp;6.8.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>OpenLISP local MTU Management</span><span>)</span></a>), then it prepends to the packet the 
	LISP header (i.e. reach bits and nonce). Final step is to prepend 
	a new IP + UDP header using selected RLOCs. The destination RLOC is
	selected using the policy described in the original LISP specification.
	The source RLOC is chosen in a slightly more restrictive way, as 
	described in <a class='info' href='#maptables'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Map Tables</span><span>)</span></a>. 
	
</p>
<p>
	Subsequently the packet is sent again to the IP layer in order to 
	ship it to the data-link layer. This does not mean that the packet 
	is delivered to ip_output(). Indeed, the mapping for the destination 
	address can have an IPv6 RLOC as a first element of the list of 
	locators, meaning that the prepended header is IPv6+UDP and that the
	packet is delivered to the ip6_output() module.
	Note that the new LISP encapsulated packet cannot be recursively 
	encapsulated. Indeed, the mbuf containing the packet is tagged with 
	a new M_TAG_LISP tag, which avoids to re-perform encapsulation check by 
	performing lookups on the map tables. This allows to reduce 
	computational overhead while protecting against bad setups generating 
	loops where a packet is recursively encapsulated until it is dropped 
	due to MTU checks.
	
</p>
<p> In the case of an outgoing IPv6 packet  the overall process is the 
	same. The packet, if a mapping exists for the source EID,  
	is first diverted toward lisp6_output(), which prepends the 
	correct headers to the packet and, depending of the RLOC used, delivers
	the packet either to the ip_output() module or the ip6_output() 
	module. 
	
</p>
<p>Once the packet is re-injected in the protocol stack, in both 
	IPv4 and IPv6 cases, the packet follows the normal process. This 
	means that the encapsulated packet will be delivered to the 
	data-link layer.

Implementation Status</h3>

<p> In the current public release of OpenLISP, only the modules
      lisp_input() and lisp_output() are present. Thus only IPv4 
      encapsulation/decapsulation operations are supported. Future 
      releases will include encapsulation/decapsulation support 
      for IPv6.
      
</p>
<p>Similarly, the gleaning mechanism is not yet supported. Thus, 
      OpenLISP is not able to generate and manage Data-Probe packets.

Mapping Sockets API</h3>

<p> In line with the UNIX philosophy and to give 
      the possibility for future Mapping Distribution Systems 
      running in the user space to access the kernel's map tables
      a new type of socket, namely the "mapping sockets", has been defined.
      
</p>
<p>Mapping sockets are based on raw sockets in the new AF_MAP domain 
      and are very similar to the well known routing sockets
      (<a class='info' href='#TCPIP'>[TCPIP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wright, G. and W. Stevens, &ldquo;TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, The Implementation.,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#NetProg'>[NetProg]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stevens, W., Fenner, B., and A. Rudoff, &ldquo;UNIX Network Programming, The Sockets Networking API.,&rdquo; 2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.) 
      A mapping socket is easily created in the following way:
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;net/if.h&gt;
#include &lt;net/maptables.h&gt;

int s = socket(PF_MAP, SOCK_RAW, 0);
</pre></div>
<p>Note that &lt;net/maptables.h&gt; is the header file containing all 
      the useful data structures and definitions.
      
</p>
<p> Once a process has created a mapping socket, it can perform the 
      following operations by sending messages across it:

      </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>MAPM_ADD:</dt>
<dd> used to add a mapping. The process writes 
	the new mapping to the kernel and reads the result of the operation
	on the same socket. 
	
</dd>
<dt>MAPM_DELETE:</dt>
<dd> used to delete a mapping. It works in 
	the same way as MAPM_ADD.  
	
</dd>
<dt>MAPM_GET:</dt>
<dd> used to retrieve a mapping. The process 
	writes on the socket the request of a mapping for a specific EID 
	and reads on the same socket the result of the query.  
	
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p> The messages sent across mapping socket for the above 
      operations all use the same data structure, namely map_msghdr{}, 
      depicted in <a class='info' href='#maphdr'>Figure&nbsp;5</a>. 
      
</p>
<p>The field map_type can be set only to the type listed above. 
      The fields map_msglen, map_version, map_pid, map_seq, and map_errno
      have the same meaning and are used in the same way as for the 
      rt_msghdr{} structure for routing sockets. 
      Details about these fields and their use can be found in 
      <a class='info' href='#TCPIP'>[TCPIP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wright, G. and W. Stevens, &ldquo;TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, The Implementation.,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a>.
      The map_flags field is used to set some general flags that concern the 
      whole mapping entry or the message. The possible values are listed
      in <a class='info' href='#mapflags_tbl'>Table&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>General mapping flags</span><span>)</span></a> along with their meaning in 
      <a class='info' href='#maptables'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Map Tables</span><span>)</span></a>. The only value that was not described 
      in <a class='info' href='#maptables'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Map Tables</span><span>)</span></a> is the MAPF_DONE flag. 
      This particular flag is set by the kernel and just 
      state that the operation requested has been performed successfully. 
      Note that all of the messages are returned by the kernel and copies 
      are sent to all interested listeners (open mapping sockets).
      A process may avoid the expense of reading replies to its own
      messages by issuing a setsockopt(2) call indicating that the
      SO_USELOOPBACK option at the SOL_SOCKET level is to be turned off.
      A process may ignore all messages from the mapping socket by doing
      a shutdown(2) system call for further input.

<p>When trying to install a new mapping, the OpenLISP code can  
     return the following error codes if something goes wrong:
     </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>ENOBUFS:</dt>
<dd> If insufficient resources were available to 
       install a new mapping.
       
</dd>
<dt>EEXIST:</dt>
<dd> If the EID-Prefix already exists in the mapping 
       table.
       
</dd>
<dt>EINVAL:</dt>
<dd> This error code can be returned in two cases. 
       The first case is when the list of RLOC provided for a mapping contains 
       replicated addresses. The second case is when a "local" mapping is 
       provided without any RLOC (address) belonging to the system.
       Note the OpenLISP does not support Negative Mapping Entries.
       
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
     
</p>
<p> As can be noted, the use of the MAPF_LOCAL flag allows to
     use the mapping socket API for mappings in both the LISP Database
     and LISP Cache. As explained in <a class='info' href='#maptables'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Map Tables</span><span>)</span></a>, 
     they are merged in the radix data structure in order to have an 
     efficient lookup mechanism for all possible EIDs. 
     
</p>
<p>The OpenLISP kernel code can trigger some messages to be sent 
     through the mapping sockets if some particular events take place.
     The messages triggered by the kernel are the following:

     </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>MAPM_MISS:</dt>
<dd> a lookup operation has generated a miss 
       (mapping not present). This message is generated when a LISP
       encapsulated packet is received, but no mapping exists, in the map 
       tables, for the source EID.
       
</dd>
<dt>MAPM_BADREACH:</dt>
<dd> a LISP encapsulated packet has been 
       received but the reachability bits do not match existing mapping.
       This message informs possible existing mapping distribution systems 
       in the user space that a non recoverable mismatch has been detected 
       between the reachability bits in the header of a LISP encapsulated 
       packet and what expected from the mapping present in the map tables.
       Details on this case can be found in <a class='info' href='#inbound'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Incoming Packets</span><span>)</span></a>.
       
</dd>
<dt>MAPM_REACH:</dt>
<dd> reachability bits have changed. This message
       informs possible existing mapping distribution systems in the user space
       that reachability bits in an existing mapping have changed due to 
       the reception of an LISP encapsulated packet.
       
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

     Note that the above messages contain the EID for which the message has 
     been triggered. On the one hand, this allows interested existing mapping 
     distribution systems, in case of a MAPM_REACH message, to retrieve the 
     updated mapping by means of a MAPM_GET message. On the other hand, for 
     both MAPM_REACH and MAPM_BADREACH messages, the mapping distribution 
     system in the user space can issue a Map-Request message in order to 
     either ask confirmation of the change to the mapping owner or to 
     obtain a fresh mapping.

     simple socket address structures, an RLOC is composed of a 
     socket address structure followed by an rloc_mtx structure containing 
     the metrics of that specific RLOC. The rloc_mtx data structure has been

An example of mapping sockets usage</h3>

<p>Hereafter is described an example using mapping sockets.
       Along with the code in the kernel, a small utility called "map" has 
       been written. This utility has similar functionalities to the "route" 
       utility present in UNIX systems. It allows to manually manage 
       map tables. The complete man page of the map utility can be found in 
       <a class='info' href='#manmap1'>Appendix&nbsp;A.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>map(1)</span><span>)</span></a>.
       
</p>
<p>Assuming we want to retrieve the mapping for the EID 
       10.0.0.1, we can type:
       
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

freebsd% map get -inet 10.0.0.1

</pre></div>
<p>The map utility first builds a buffer containing a map_msghdr{} 
      structure, followed by a socket address structure containing the 
      EID for the kernel to look up, as depicted in <a class='info' href='#msgtokern'>Figure&nbsp;6</a>. 
      The map_type is set to MAPM_GET and the map_addrs is set to MAPA_EID.
      The entire buffer is written to a mapping socket previously open.

<p>The first part of the message is a map_msghdr{} structure, with 
      the map_type unchanged, the map_addrs set to 0x07, which is equivalent 
      to MAPA_EID, MAPA_EIDMASK, and MAPA_RLOC all set, and finally the 
      map_rloc_count set to 2. Right after the map_msghdr{} there is 
      a first socket address structure containing the EID prefix, which is 
      10.0.0.0 in this example. The second socket address structure contains
      the netmask, 255.255.0.0 in this case. The third socket address structure 
      contains the first RLOC. RLOCs are returned ordered by increasing 
      priority. After the first RLOC there is an rloc_mtx structure containing 
      the metrics associated to the first RLOC. The message ends with the 
      socket address structure for the second RLOC and the rloc_mtx structure 
      for its metrics.
      
</p>
<p>
       When using the map utility a possible output for the get request 
       for EID 10.0.0.1 can be:
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
freebsd% map get -inet 10.0.0.1
   Mapping for EID: 10.0.0.1
     EID: 10.0.0.0
     EID mask: 255.255.0.0
     RLOC Addr: inet6 2001::1     P 1   W 100 Flags R   MTU 0
     RLOC Addr: inet  10.1.0.0    P 2   W 100 Flags     MTU 0
     flags: &lt;UP,STATIC,DONE&gt;

</pre></div>
<p>The above output is of straightforward reading. The requested lookup
      for EID 10.0.0.1 matches the entry with EID address 10.0.0.0 and EID mask
      255.255.0.0 (/16). Note that since the map tables are radix trees, the 
      longest prefix match is always returned.
      The mapping contains two (2) RLOCs. The first is the IPv6 RLOC 2001::1, 
      having priority equal to 1, weight equal to 100, the R flag indicates 
      that the RLOC is reachable, the MTU equal to 0 just states that no MTU 
      is actually set. The second RLOC, is the IPv4 RLOC 10.1.0.0, having 
      priority equal to 2, weight equal to 100, it has no flags, thus it is not
      reachable, and the MTU is not set.
      
</p>
<p>Using the map utility, the command line to set the above-described 
      mapping is:
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
freebsd% map add -inet 10.0.0.0/16 -inet6 2001::1 1 100 1
                                              -inet 10.1.0.0 2 100 0

</pre></div>
<p>Further examples of the map utility can be found in 
      <a class='info' href='#manmap1'>Appendix&nbsp;A.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>map(1)</span><span>)</span></a>. A useful exercise in order to get familiar 
      with the content of mapping socket messages is to run the map 
      utility in "monitor" mode in one terminal, by typing:
      </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
freebsd% map monitor

</pre></div><p>

      while modifying the mapping tables using the map utility in another 
      terminal. The monitor mode of the map utility just dumps all the messages
      going through mapping sockets.
      
</p>
<p>Along with the map utility the "mapstat" utility is provided with 
      OpenLISP. Mapstat is a modification of the netstat utility, already 
      present on FreeBSD, able to provide LISP specific information.
      In particular a new "-X" option has been added in order to obtain a 
      dump of the map tables. Referring to the mapping previously described, the 
      result of the mapstat utility would be:
      </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
freebsd% mapstat -X
Mapping tables

Internet:
EID           Flags    Refs    # RLOC(s)
10.0.0.0/16   US          1    1 2001::1     1   100 R     0         34
                               2 10.1.0.0    2   100       0         43

</pre></div><p>

      The dump shows how only the 10.0/16 mapping is present in the map tables.
      The general flags show that the mapping is up ("U") and static "S", one 
      reference exists to this mapping. Then there are the RLOCs. The information
      for the two RLOCs is the same like for the get command of the map utility,
      except for two differences. The first difference is the "#" column, which
      shows the position of the RLOC in the chained list of RLOCs. Second
      difference is the last value of the line: it expresses the number of time the
      RLOC has been selected for an encapsulation operation.
      
</p>
<p>Along with the "-X" option, mapstat can show LISP-related
      network status.  Where applies, mapstat accepts also the word
      "lisp" as protocol. As an example the following command:
      </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
freebsd% mapstat -sf inet -p lisp

</pre></div><p>

      will give the following result:
      </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
freebsd% mapstat -sf inet -p lisp
lisp:
        0 datagrams received
        0 with incomplete header
        0 with bad encap header
        0 with bad data length field
        0 delivered
        0 datagrams output
        0 dropped on output
        0 sent

</pre></div><p>

      
</p>
<p>The first five (5) counters concern incoming LISP encapsulated packets.
      In particular, the first counter gives the total number of LISP 
      encapsulated packets received by the system. The following three gives 
      the number of LISP encapsulated received packets dropped due to header 
      problems or data length field problem. The fifth counter expresses the 
      total number of packets correctly decapsulated and handed back to the IP 
      layer.
      
</p>
<p>The remaining three (3) counters concern packet received by the 
      OpenLISP module which have a mapping for both source and destination 
      EID and thus need to be encapsulated. The first of these three counters 
      expresses the total packets received for encapsulation by the OpenLISP 
      module. The second counter gives the number of packet dropped due to 
      error conditions. The last counter gives the total number of LISP 
      encapsulated packets that have been correctly sent.

Sysctl API</h3>

<p>OpenLISP offer the possibility to mapping distribution system in 
      the user space to obtain a complete dump of the map tables through  
      sequence of mapping messages. This is done by using a sysctl
      system call in the CTL_NET level. For details on the general sysctl API
      and its levels, in the FreeBSD systems, please refer to sysctl(3) 
      man page.
      With OpenLISP is possible to use AF_MAP as second level and 
      NET_MAPTBL_DUMP as fifth level. The sequence of messages returned by the
      system call is the same described in <a class='info' href='#sockets'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mapping Sockets API</span><span>)</span></a>.
      
</p>
<p> An example of sysctl usage to obtain a map tables' dump is the 
      following:
      </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;net/if.h&gt;

#include &lt;net/maptables.h&gt;

int mib[6];
size_t spaceneeded;
char * buffer;

mib[0] = CTL_NET;
mib[1] = PF_MAP;
mib[2] = 0;
mib[3] = 0;
mib[4] = NET_MAPTBL_DUMP;
mib[5] = 0;

if (sysctl(mib, 6, NULL, &amp;spaceneeded, NULL, 0) &lt; 0)
        /* code for error handling */

if ((buffer = malloc(needed)) == NULL)
        /* code for error handling */

if (sysctl(mib, 6, buffer, &amp;needed, NULL, 0) &lt; 0)
        /* code for error handling */

</pre></div><p>

      
      At the end of this code, the memory buffer referenced by the "buffer" 
      pointer will contain a contiguous sequence of mapping messages, all of 
      them starting with the map_msghdr{} data structure, thus it can be easily 
      parsed.

OpenLISP and LISP variants</h3>

<p> OpenLISP does not implement any EID filtering policy, while adopting
      a fallback strategy for encapsulation. This means that packets for 
      which there is no mapping available are handed back to the IP layer
      for "traditional" processing. If the original packet has a non-routable 
      destination address it will be dropped, otherwise, if a route is available,
      it will be forwarded. This means that OpenLISP is able, with the correct 
      mappings to support all variants of LISP described in 
      <a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[I&#8209;D.farinacci&#8209;lisp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Oran, D., and D. Meyer, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

OpenLISP as TE-ITR/TE-ETR</h3>

<p> The lack of EID filtering policies in OpenLISP allows it 
      to be used as also as TE-ITR/TE-ETR.  The correct functioning 
      is just a matter of putting the correct mappings in the map tables. 
      Nevertheless, note that recursive encapsulation cannot be done
      on the same machine. In order to avoid inner loops (see 
      <a class='info' href='#outbound'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Outgoing Packets</span><span>)</span></a>), each packet once encapsulated is 
      tagged and never checked again for further encapsulation.
      
</p>
<a name="nonce"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.6.4"></a><h3>6.4.&nbsp;
OpenLISP and nonce</h3>

<p>The original proposal of LISP includes a "nonce" value to be included
      in every LISP encapsulated packet. Formal definition is:
      </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>LISP Nonce:</dt>
<dd> is a 32-bit value that is randomly 
	generated by an ITR. It is used to test route-returnability when 
	an ETR echoes back the nonce in a Map-Reply message.
	
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      In the current OpenLISP implementation, the nonce is generated and put in 
      the LISP header, but its value is never checked on reception of a LISP 
      encapsulated packet. This is because the current release
      of OpenLISP does not support Map-Reply packets. 
      Nevertheless, this let us think that marking every packet with a nonce 
      is not strictly necessary, rather it introduces useless overhead. 
      Moreover, the random generation of the nonce can be also expensive 
      in terms of encapsulation operation performances. 
      
</p>
<p>In order to reduce the overhead it would be desirable to
      avoid putting the nonce in normal LISP encapsulated packets.
      Nonce can be introduced in packets that really need 
      the value present, which are easy to recognize.
      
</p>
<p> Indeed, a Map-Reply message is sent only in two cases:
      </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd> To reply to an explicit Map-Request message.
	
</dd>
<dt>2</dt>
<dd> In the case of the gleaning mechanism, to reply to a Data-Probe 
	packet.
	
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p> In the first case, messages are generated in the user space using 
      as port number the IANA reserved value 4342. In this case, it is easy 
      to recognize LISP signaling packets (Map-Request and Map-Reply) 
      since they use destination port 4342, and thus nonce value can be 
      handled.
      
</p>
<p>In the second case, the Data-Probe should contain the nonce value in 
      order to provide the value that needs to be returned by the subsequent 
      Data-Reply. Data-Probe packets use destination port 4341, the same as 
      normal LISP encapsulated data packets. However, Data-Probe packets are 
      easily recognizable by the fact that the inner IP header and outer IP 
      header contain the same destination address.  Thus nonce can be 
      correctly handled.
      
</p>
<p> To summarize, the suggestion here is to avoid in general the nonce 
      in normal LISP encapsulated packets, while use it in Data-Probe, 
      Map-Request, and Map-Reply packets, which are easy to recognize.
      This means to split the packets' format in two main types: with and without
      nonce.
      This would allow reducing overhead in both terms of bandwidth and 
      efficiency in the encap/decap operations.

OpenLISP and RLOC order</h3>

<p> The LISP specification clearly state that RLOCs are ordered by 
      priority, however, it does not clarify what happens in the case of 
      multiple RLOCs having the same priority value. The ordering of RLOC is 
      very important since it is used in the reachability bits.
      
</p>
<p>OpenLISP uses the simple approach of considering the IP address of 
      RLOCs (in network byte order) as an integer value and puts smaller values 
      before bigger ones. When RLOCs belong to different address family,
      i.e., IPv4 and IPv6, IPv4 (AF_INET) address family is given priority.
      Since in OpenLISP duplicated RLOCs for the same EID-Prefix are not 
      allowed this gives a strict ordering to the list of RLOCs.

LISP Source port and statefull firewall</h3>

<p> During our tests with OpenLISP, we observed packet losses on 
      high load traffic on a network protected by an IPFW statefull firewall. 
      These packet losses were caused by the utilization of random UDP 
      source ports for LISP packets. 
      In <a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[I&#8209;D.farinacci&#8209;lisp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Oran, D., and D. Meyer, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, Section 5.3, there is the 
      following statement:
      </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>UDP Header:</dt>
<dd> contains a random source port allocated 
	by the ITR when encapsulating a packet.  The destination port MUST 
	be set to the well-known IANA assigned port value 4341.
	
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
      This can be interpreted in two ways:
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>In each packet we put a random source port number. This has 
	proved not to work well with the "keep-state" directive of IPFW.
	Loss of packets has been observed on high load	traffic on a 
	network protected by an IPFW statefull firewall. 
	On statefull firewall, a state is kept for each flow, which is 
	identified by source and destination IP addresses and source and 
	destination port number. 
	In presence of many different flows (due to random source port 
	selection), the number of cached tuples (Source IP, Destination IP, 
	Source Port, Source Destination, Protocol) can fill the firewall 
	cache and block any new flow for a period of at least the time an
	entry remains in the firewall state. The random selection of UDP source 
	ports caused a kind of DoS attack against the state maintained by 
	the statefull firewall.
	
</li>
<li> For the first packet to a certain RLOC we select a port number 
	and use it as long as the mapping is valid. This is not much
	meaningful, since LISP never uses the source port for a reply
	or something else, thus this state is wasteful.
	
</li>
</ul><p>
      For the above reasons, in OpenLISP, the LISPDATA (4341) port number
      is used for source port for all LISP encapsulated packets.

<a name="rfc.section.6.7"></a><h3>6.7.&nbsp;
ICMP</h3>

<p>In LISP, it is not possible to find the actual source of a packet 
	responsible of an ICMP if it occurs during the transit (i.e., when 
	the packet is encapsulated in a LISP message). 
	
</p>
<p> The problem comes from the encapsulation. The returned ICMP 
	message has sufficient space only to include the outer header, 
	thus the one containing RLOCs as source and destination addresses.
	In this way it is not possible to forward the packet to the source of 
	the original packet, since it is not possible to retrieve the original 
	source EID. Even performing a lookup on the LISP database, using the 
	source RLOC as search key, the result will be an EID-Prefix, not 
	sufficient to forward the packet.
	
</p>
<p> A solution would be to increase the size of ICMP messages in order 
       to include the inner header of the LISP encapsulated packet.
       This would allow to retrieve the correct information in order to forward 
       the packet. Note, however, that before forwarding the ICMP packet
       needs to be cleaned from LISP specific information, since end-system 
       are supposed to be unaware of being behind a LISP router.
       On the one hand, this proposition seems to be the efficient,
       but needs to modify ICMP and thus non-LISP routers. On the other hand,
       many routers that do not generate ICMP messages, or rate limit 
       them, in the DFZ,
       thus reducing the real effectiveness of the solution.      
       
</p>
<p> For the above mentioned reasons, OpenLISP does not implement any 
	technique that allows the router to make a link between the LISP 
	packet header the packet source in order to "translate" and re-route 
	ICMP packets. 
	
</p>
<p> The general ICMP problem in LISP can however be the pretext
       of a more philosophical discussion. Indeed, as LISP is a
       tunneling technique based on the separation of ID and locator space, 
       is it required to send information about what happens between 
       the RLOCs to the client running behind a LISP router? 
       In principle the answer is no, since end-systems do not 
       need to be aware of the routing infrastructure (i.e., the RLOC space).
       In this case LISP has to handle ICMP in a different way that needs to 
       be explored.

<a name="rfc.section.6.8.1"></a><h3>6.8.1.&nbsp;
OpenLISP local MTU Management</h3>

<p>During preliminary tests, we observed that the MTU issue is at the 
	  origin of many problems. OpenLISP does not (and will not) 
	  implement the fragmentation mechanism proposed in Sec. 5.4 of
	  <a class='info' href='#I-D.farinacci-lisp'>[I&#8209;D.farinacci&#8209;lisp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Fuller, V., Oran, D., and D. Meyer, &ldquo;Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. The reason is because
	  the proposed method sounds very primitive and does not appear
	  to be efficient. The original LISP specification is based on an 
	  architectural constant used by the xTR to limit the MTU of LISP 
	  encapsulated packets. OpenLISP uses a more advanced solution, 
	  based on the real MTU of the local RLOCs present on the xTR, 
	  as described below.
	  
</p>
<p>Currently OpenLISP manages the MTU issue in the following manner.
	  As described in <a class='info' href='#maptables'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Map Tables</span><span>)</span></a> for each local mapping,
	  OpenLISP discovers the RLOCs that are local interfaces and copies
	  the MTU associated to the interface to the RLOC entry.
	  When a packet needs to be encapsulated the first step is to calculate 
	  the final packet size and compare it to the MTU contained in the source
	  RLOC used. If the size exceeds the MTU the action taken depends on the 
	  origin of the packet. If the packet has been locally generated through 
	  a socket in the user space, the write operation on the socket will
	  return an EMSGSIZE error. If the packet has been originated elsewhere,
	  an ICMP Too Big message is sent back to the source address of the 
	  original packet. Note that this can be done since the size check is 
	  done before actually encapsulating the packet.

<a name="rfc.section.6.8.2"></a><h3>6.8.2.&nbsp;
OpenLISP Extended MTU Management</h3>

<p>The way OpenLISP manages MTU solves the problem only for the local 
	domain and the first hop after the ITR. It does not yet solve the issue
	of having an ICMP Too Big message generated in the middle of the LISP
	tunnel. A possible solution could be the enlargement of the ICMP 
	Too Big message, as described in <a class='info' href='#icmp'>Section&nbsp;6.7<span> (</span><span class='info'>ICMP</span><span>)</span></a>.
	
</p>
<p>Another possible solution is to start using the mtu field in the 
	rloc_mtx structure also for non-local mappings. In the current 
	OpenLISP implementation, the mtu field for RLOCs of non-local mapping 
	are set to zero (0), which means to ignore it.
	If an ICMP Too Big Message is triggered in the middle of a LISP tunnel, 
	it will normally reach the ITR that has performed the encapsulation and 
	its content is sufficient to retrieve the destination RLOC toward which 
	the packet was sent. This in turns allows setting a MTU on the RLOC of 
	the mapping entry containing it. This would allow perform a check on 
	the subsequent packets before encapsulating them, and if necessary, to
	send an ICMP Too Big message back to the real source of the packet.
	
</p>
<p>From an architectural perspective, the proposed approach is very 
	simple.
	Nevertheless, a limitation can be found in the fact that the 
	approach suffers from some delay. Indeed, for an ICMP Too Big message 
	to reach the original packet source, two large packets are needed. The
	first packet will trigger an ICMP message in the LISP tunnel, thus 
	updating the ITR. Only the second packet will trigger an ICMP message 
	from the ITR to the source, making the latter shrink its path MTU.
	However, this solution still needs to be carefully explored, since 
	a burst of large packets must not have the results of generating a burst 
	of ICMP messages reducing too much the MTU size on the ITR. 
	A simple rate limitation approach can help in alleviating this problem.
	
</p>
<p> A second limitation of this approach can be found in the fact that
	in order to rapidly update the mapping when an ICMP Too Big message is 
	received from a LISP tunnel, an RLOC-based lookup should be performed.
	In the current state of OpenLISP, this is not possible, since the 
	mapping tables are radix trees using EIDs as key. On the other hand,
	RLOC-based lookup will not be that common (compared to the number of 
	EID-based lookups), the trade-off between lookup efficiency and data
	structure complexity needs to be further explored.
	
</p>
<p> Note, finally, that MTU discovery between RLOCs can be also 
	performed using proposals like <a class='info' href='#I-D.templin-seal'>[I&#8209;D.templin&#8209;seal]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Templin, F., &ldquo;The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> or

	in order to put the correct value in the mtu field associated to RLOCs
	in the OpenLISP implementation. Such an adaptation is out of the scope of 
	OpenLISP, even if worth to be explored.

<p> The present memo describes the overall architecture and the 
       implementation status of OpenLISP, an implementation of the 
       LISP proposal in the FreeBSD OS. 
       OpenLISP provides support for encap/decap operations and 
       EID-to-RLOC mappings storage in the kernel space.
       OpenLISP is freely available at http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be.
       
</p>
<p>OpenLISP can work as both a router and end-host, thus providing 
       a wide range of test scenarios.      
       We think that the mapping sockets introduced by OpenLISP is a great 
       tool for easy development of Mapping Distribution Protocols in the 
       user space. 
       People working in this area can contact authors. We believe that 
       a complete working system composed by OpenLISP and a mapping distribution 
       protocol would provide very helpful insights, leading to important 
       improvements for both OpenLISP and the mapping distribution protocol.

<a name="rfc.section.10.1"></a><h3>10.1.&nbsp;
Reachability bits DoS</h3>

<p> An attacker can deactivate a particular RLOC on a mapping of an 
	ITR with a single packet using the reachability bits. If the reachability
	bit of a RLOC is set to one, the RLOC is reachable, otherwise 
	it is unreachable.
	
</p>
<p>Since reachability information on specific RLOCs can be modified
	by the reachability bits in the LISP header carried by data
	packets and not a control protocol, it is possible for an attacker 
	to make a DoS on a EID by sending a single packet for that EID 
	where all the reachability bits	are at set to zero. 
	To succeed the attack, it is not required to have a bi-directional 
	flow, the only constraint is to build a LISP packet, for an EID 
	mapping present in the ITR, with as source EID the one that is 
	meant to be made unreachable and a correctly formed LISP header 
	having reachability bits all set to zero.
	Once the packet has been received, all RLOCs will be set to 
	unreachable, and the ITR will not be able to reach the EID used 
	as source, until another packet (not spoofed) will set again the RLOCs
	to a reachable state.
	
</p>
<p> To tackle this issue two solutions are available:
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Keep the reachability bits semantic, but add a confirmation 
	  phase to be sure the RLOC must be deactivated. When a reachability
	  bit has changed compared to the mapping present in the cache, a 
	  Map-Request should be sent in order to obtain the new mapping
	  with the correct reachabilty information.
	  In OpenLISP, this can be easily implemented, since for any 
	  reachability change, a message is sent through the mapping sockets 
	  in order to inform the mapping distribution system, which in turn 
	  will perform the request.
	  
</li>
<li> Change the reachability bits semantic to become a version 
	  number. Instead of carrying reachability information for each RLOC,
	  the bits contain the version number of the mapping. If
	  the version number changes for an EID, a mapping request is sent.
	  
</li>
</ul><p> 
	
</p>
<p> The two solutions are not "bulletproof", however, they can help
	in removing, or at least reducing,  DoS attacks.
	Nevertheless, a control on the rate of Map-Request is needed in order 
	to avoid DoS attacks on the mapping system. 
	The solution based on version number is more DoS-proof as the 
	attacker must be able to know the version number to launch the 
	attack. If the version number is not near the real version number,
	the message can be considered as invalid.

MAP(1)               BSD General Commands Manual                 MAP(1)


NAME
     map -- manually manipulate the LISP mappings

SYNOPSIS
     map [-dnqtv] command [[modifiers] args]

DESCRIPTION
     The map utility is used to manually manipulate the network mapping
     tables (both cache and database). Only the super-user may modify
     the mapping tables. It normally is not needed, as a system mapping
     table management daemon, such as LISP-ALT, should tend to this
     task.

     The map utility supports a limited number of general options, but
     a rich command language, enabling the user to specify any
     arbitrary request that could be delivered via the programmatic
     interface discussed in map(4).

     The following options are available:

     -d      Run in debug-only mode, i.e., do not actually modify
             the routing table.

     -n      Bypass attempts to print host and network names
             symbolically when reporting actions. (The process of
             translating between symbolic names and numerical
             equivalents can be quite time consuming, and may require
             correct operation of the network; thus it may be
             expedient to forget this, especially when attempting to
             repair networking operations).

     -v      (verbose) Print additional details.

     -q      Suppress all output from the add, change, and delete
             commands.

     The map utility provides five commands:

     add         Add a mapping.
     delete      Delete a specific mapping.
     get         Lookup and display the mapping for an EID.
     monitor     Continuously report any changes to the mapping
                 information base, mapping lookup misses, etc.
     flush       Remove all mappings. This includes mappings from both
                 the cache and the database.

     The monitor command has the syntax:

          map [-n] monitor

     The flush command has the syntax:

          map [-n] flush

     The other commands have the following syntax:

          map [-n] command [-local] [-inet | -inet6] EID
          [-inet | -inet6] RLOC [Priority [Weight [Rechability]]]

     where EID is the address of the EID-Prefix (it can be also a full
     address), -local indicates if the mapping should be treated as
     part of the local mapping database or as part of the cache.
     Default is cache. The keyword -inet and -inet6 are not optional,
     they must be used before any address (both EID and RLOC).
     These keywords indicate if the following address should be
     treated as an IPv4 or IPv6 address/prefix. RLOC is the address of
     the RLOC argument. Likewise the EID, it must be preceded by
     -inet or -inet6 keyword in order to indicate the address family.
     The EID must be specified in the net/bits format. For example,
     -inet 128.32 is interpreted as -inet 128.0.0.32; -inet 128.32.130
     is interpreted as -inet 128.32.0.130; and -inet 192.168.64/20 is
     interpreted as the network prefix 192.168.64.0 with netmask
     255.255.240.0.

     The values Priority, Weight, and Reachability are optional to
     declare.
     If not declared, the following default values are set:
     Priority    255 (Not usable)
     Weight      100
     Reachability
                 0 (not reachable)

     It is not mandatory to declare all of them, but when declaring
     one, all the previous must be also declared. This means that to
     declare a weight the priority must also be declared; and to set
     the reachability to 1 (reachable) both priority and weight must be
     declared.

     Mappings have associated flags that influence operation. These
     flags may be set (or sometimes cleared) by indicating the
     following corresponding modifiers:

     -static    MAPF_STATIC     - manually added mapping (default)
     -nostatic ~MAPF_STATIC     - pretend mapping added by kernel or
                                  daemon

     All symbolic names specified for an EID or RLOC are looked up first
     as a host name using gethostbyname(3). If this lookup fails,
     getnetbyname(3) is then used to interpret the name as that of a
     network.

     The map utility uses a mapping socket and the message types
     MAPM_ADD, MAPM_DELETE, MAPM_GET, and MAPM_CHANGE. The flush
     command is performed using the sysctl(3) interface. As such, only
     the super-user may modify the mapping tables.

EXAMPLES
     The command to add a mapping, in the LISP database, for EID
     1.1.0.0/16, having RLOC 2.2.2.2 and Priority 1, Weight 100, and
     marked as Reachable, is:

     map add -local -inet 1.1.0.0/16 -inet 2.2.2.2 1 100 1

     The command to delete the same mapping is:

     map delete -inet 1.1.0.0

     To add in the cache a mapping having several RLOCs, the command
     is:

     map add -inet 1.1.0.0/16 -inet 2.2.2.2 1 100 1 -inet 3.3.3.3
     2 100 1

     -inet 4.4.4.4 3 100  -inet 5.5.5.5

     The above command associate to the EID-Prefix 1.1.0.0/16 the
     following RLOCs and related Priority, Weight, and Reachability
     values:

     RLOC       Priority    Weight    Reachability
     2.2.2.2    1           100       Reachable
     3.3.3.3    2           100       Reachable
     4.4.4.4    3           100       Unreachable
     5.5.5.5    255         100       Unreachable

EXIT STATUS
     The map utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

MAP(4)                BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               MAP(4)

NAME
     map -- kernel LISP mapping cache and database

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
     #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
     #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
     #include &lt;net/if.h&gt;
     #include &lt;net/maptable.h&gt;

     int
     socket(PF_MAP, SOCK_RAW, int family);

DESCRIPTION
     OpenLISP provides some mapping facilities into the kernel of
     FreeBSD. The kernel maintains a mapping information database,
     which is used in selecting the appropriate RLOCs when
     transmitting/forwarding packets.

     A user process (or possibly multiple co-operating processes)
     maintains this database by sending messages over a special kind
     of socket. Mapping table changes may only be carried out by the
     super user.

     The operating system may spontaneously emit mapping messages in
     response to external events, such as receipt of a packet for
     which no mapping is available. The message types are described
     in greater detail below.

     When handling a packet, the kernel will attempt to find the most
     specific EID mappings matching the source and the destination
     addresses. If there is more then one RLOC in the mapping the
     actual RLOC used for encapsulation is chosen following the
     rules described in (LISP).  Note, however, that for local
     mappings, i.e., mappings that are part of the database, the flag
     "i" must be set in order for the RLOC to be used. This is to
     avoid to emit packets with a source address that does not belong
     to the machine. If no mapping is found, for both source and
     destination EIDs, packet is handed back to normal IP operation,
     which may lead to sending the packet, if the EID is routable and
     a route is available in the IP routing table.

     One opens the channel for passing mapping control messages by
     using the socket call. There can be more than one routing socket
     open per system.

     Messages are formed by a header followed by a number of sockaddrs
     (of variable length depending on the address family) and RLOC
     metrics data structure.

     Any messages sent to the kernel are returned, and copies are sent
     to all interested listeners. The kernel will provide the process
     ID for the sender, and the sender may use an additional sequence
     field to distinguish between outstanding messages.
     However, message replies may be lost when kernel buffers are
     exhausted.

     The kernel may reject certain messages, and will indicate this by
     filling in the map_errno field. The OpenLISP code returns the
     following error codes if new mappings cannot be installed:

     ENOBUFS: If insufficient resources were available to install a new
             mapping.

     EEXIST: If the EID-Prefix already exist in the mapping table.

     EINVAL: This error code can be returned in two cases. The first
             case is when the list of RLOC provided for a mapping
             contains replicated addresses. The second case is when a
             "local" mapping is provided without any RLOC (address)
             belonging to the system.

     A process may avoid the expense of reading replies to its own
     messages by issuing a setsockopt(2) call indicating that the
     SO_USELOOPBACK option at the SOL_SOCKET level is to be turned off.
     A process may ignore all messages from the mapping socket by doing
     a shutdown(2) system call for further input.

     If a mapping is in use when it is deleted, the entry will be
     marked down and removed from the mapping table, but the resources
     associated with it will not be reclaimed until all references to
     it are released. User processes can obtain information about the
     mapping entry for a specific EID by using a MAP_GET message.

     Messages include:

     #define MAPM_ADD        0x1     /* Add Map */
     #define MAPM_DELETE     0x2     /* Delete Map */
     #define MAPM_CHANGE     0x3     /* Change Metrics or flags */
     #define MAPM_GET        0x4     /* Report Metrics */
     #define MAPM_MISS       0x5     /* Lookup Failed */
     #define MAPM_BADREACH   0x6     /* Reachability Block Problem */
     #define MAPM_REACH      0x7     /* Reachability Block Changed */

     A message header consists of the following:

     struct map_msghdr {
             u_short map_msglen;     /* to skip over non-understood
                                        messages */
             u_char  map_version;    /* future binary compatibility */
             u_char  map_type;       /* message type */

             int     map_flags;      /* flags, incl. kern &amp; message,
                                        e.g. DONE */
             int     map_addrs;      /* bitmask identifying sockaddrs
                                        in msg */
             int     map_rloc_count; /* Number of rlocs appended to
                                        the msg */
             pid_t   map_pid;        /* identify sender */
             int     map_seq;        /* for sender to identify action
                                      */
             int     map_errno;      /* why failed */

     };

     The ``int map_flags'' is as defined as:

     #define MAPF_UP         0x1     /* mapping usable */
     #define MAPF_LOCAL      0x2     /* Mapping is local
                                      * This means that it should be
                                      * considered
                                      * as part of the LISP Database
                                      */
     #define MAPF_STATIC     0x4     /* manually added */
     #define MAPF_DONE       0x8     /* message confirmed */

     Specifiers for which addresses are present in the messages are:

     #define MAPA_EID        0x1      /* EID sockaddr present */
     #define MAPA_EIDMASK    0x2      /* netmask sockaddr present */
     #define MAPA_RLOC       0x4      /* Locator present */

     If MAPA_RLOC is set, it means that there are "int map_rloc_count"
     pairs of "struct sockaddr" and  "struct rloc_mtx" present.

     The ``struct rloc_mtx'' is as defined as:

     struct rloc_mtx {            /* Metrics associated to the RLOC
                                   * Usefull for messages mapping
                                   * sockets.
                                   */
             u_int8_t priority;   /* Each RLOC has a priority.
                                   */
             u_int8_t weight;     /* Each locator has a weight.
                                   */
             u_int16_t flags;     /* Flags concerning specific RLOC.
                                   */
             u_int32_t mtu;       /* MTU for the specific RLOC.
                                   */
     };

     The ``u_int16_t flags'' is as defined as:

     #define RLOCF_REACH    0x01 /* RLOC Reachable. */
     #define RLOCF_LIF      0x02 /* RLOC is a local interface.
                                  * This is only valid for local
                                  * mappings.
                                  */

     A good example of how top use mapping sockets can be found in
     /usr/src/sbin/map/map.c.

MAPSTAT(1)           BSD General Commands Manual            MAPSTAT(1)

NAME
     mapstat -- Modification of the netstat(1) utility to show
     LISP-related network status

DESCRIPTION
     The mapstat command symbolically displays the contents of various
     network-related data structures. It is a modification of the
     existing netstat command, thus it basically offers the same
     identical features and can be used in the same identical way.
     Please refer to netstat(1) for more information on the normal
     use of netstat.

     What mapstat introduces is that fact that it can show LISP-related
     network status.  Where applies, mapstat accepts also the word
     "lisp" as protocol. Try the following command as an example:

      mapstat -sf inet -p lisp

     The mapstat adds the new following option:

     -X    Displays the content of mapping tables. The mapping table
           display indicates the available mappings and their status.

     Each mapping consists of an EID, flags related to the whole
     mapping, references, and the list of RLOC. For each RLOC there is
     the address, its priority, its weight, and the flags related to
     that specific RLOC. It also shows the available MTU (Maximum
     Transmission Unit) for the specific RLOC, and the number of times
     that the RLOC has been selected for packet encapsulation.

     The flags field shows a collection of information about the
     mapping or the RLOC stored as binary choices. The individual flags
     are the listed hereafter.

     General flags

        U      The mapping entry is "up" and usable.

        L      The mapping entry "local", i.e., it is part of the lisp
               mapping database as defined in the original LISP
               proposal.

        S      The mapping entry is "static", i.e., it has been
               manually added.

     RLOC specific flags

        R      The specific RLOC is reachable.

        i      The specific RLOC is a local interface. This flag can
               be set only for mappings that are part of the database,
               i.e., have the flag "L" set.

HISTORY
     The mapstat utility appeared in FreeBSD 7.0.

BUGS
     The code is still exprimental. Some combinations of the -X option
     with other native options of netstat may not work or produce
     unexpected results.
