Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, a number of top
   level domain names are reserved for use in private testing, as
   examples in documentation, and the like. In addition, a few second
   level domain names reserved for use as examples are documented.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                     Test and Example TLDs


1. Introduction

   The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in RFC 1034,
   1035, 1591 and numerous additional Requests for Comment.  It defines
   a tree of names starting with root, ".", immediately below which are
   top level domain names such as ".com" and ".us". Below top level
   domain names there are normally additional levels of names.



2. TLDs for Testing and Documentation Examples

   There is a need for top level domain names that can safely be used in
   private testing, as examples in documentation, and for
   experimentation, without fear of conflicts with actual top level
   domain names in the global DNS, or which should be reserved to avoid
   confusion.  It is best to allocate a reasonably large number of names
   of different lengths now to reduce the probability of a need for
   further top level domain name creation and assignment for this
   purpose in the foreseeable future.

   To satisfy these needs, forty two domain names are reserved as
   described below.

   The following twelve top level domain names are permanently reserved.

                     .xy
                     .xz
                    .nil
                    .tld
                   .link
                   .site
                   .test
                  .bogus
                .example
                .invalid
              .localhost
    .asixtythreecharacterstopleveldomainnamewhichisthelongestallowed

        Note: two letter top level domain names are reserved for ISO
        3166 / Universal Postal Union two letter country codes.
        However, ISO 3166 reserves all two letter codes beginning with
        "x" for local use and states that they will never be assigned to
        a country.

   These names are available for use in testing or as examples in
   documentation except for ".invalid", ".link", and ".localhost".
   ".invalid" is intended for use in online construction of domain names
   that are sure to be invalid.  ".link" is reserved to avoid confusion
   with the "link.local" domain provided in draft-ietf-dnsind-local-

   names-*.txt and should not be used.  The ".localhost" TLD has
   traditionally been staticly defined in host DNS implementations as
   having an A record pointing to the loop back IP address and is
   reserved for such use.

   The TLDs ".xy", ".nil", and ".test" are particularly recommended for
   use in testing. If a larger number of test names is needed, the
   numeric suffix names listed below should be used.

   The TLDs ".xz", ".tld", ".site", ".bogus", and ".example" are
   particularly recommended for use in documentation or as examples.  If
   a larger number of names is needed in documentation or as examples,
   the numeric suffix names listed below should be used.

   The above twelve names will be added to the root with a single type
   TXT RR under each. The RDATA for these TXT RRs will contain the
   single string

        Reserved, see RFC NNNN.

   [where NNNN is the number of the RFC this draft gets issued as.]

   In addition, the thirty domain names formed by appending the digits 0
   through 9 to "tld", "test", and "example", as listed below, are also
   permanently reserved for test and documentation use; however, since
   there are currently no TLDs with digits in them and the presence of
   these names without the digit suffix should provide notice, it is not
   intended that these thirty additional TLDs be entered into the root
   zone.

              .tld0        .test0        .example0
              .tld1        .test1        .exmaple1
              .tld2        .test2        .example2
              .tld3        .test2        .example2
              .tld4        .test4        .example4
              .tld5        .test5        .exmaple5
              .tld6        .test6        .example6
              .tld7        .test7        .example7
              .tld8        .test8        .example8
              .tld9        .test9        .example9

3. Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names

   IANA has also reserved the following second level domain names which
   can be used as examples.

        example.com
        example.net
        example.org



4. Security Considerations

   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of a current or
   potential future top level domain name in testing, experimentation,
   as an example in documentation, or the like.  Test and experimental
   software can escape and end up being run against the global
   operational DNS.  Even examples used "only" in documentation can end
   up being coded and released or cause conflicts due to later real use
   and the possible acquisition of intellectual property rights in such
   "example" names.

   The reservation of several top level domain names for these purposes
   will minimize such confusion and conflict.
