Abstract

   This document is registration for the "example" media type and
   "example" subtypes within the standards tree.  The example/* and
   */example media types are defined for documentation purposes only.


1.  Introduction

   From time to time, documents created by the IETF or by other
   standards bodies show examples involving the use of media types,

   where the actual media type is not relevant.  It would be useful in
   such cases to be able to show a media type whose illustrative role in
   the example is clear.  In the worst case, this can be useful to debug
   implementations where the designer mistook the example for a
   requirement of the protocol concerned.

   To meet this need, this document registers the following media types:
   o  the example media type;
   o  the text/example, image/example, audio/example, video/example, and
      application/example media subtypes.

   It is suggested that compilers of illustrative examples involving
   media types in trees other than the standards tree might also
   incorporate the string "example" into their hypothetical media types.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Registration of the example media type

   Type name: example.

   Subtype name: any subtype may be used with the example type.
   However, subtypes of example MUST NOT be registered.

   Required parameters: as invented by the user.

   Optional parameters: as invented by the user.

   Encoding considerations: as invented by the user.

   Security considerations: none.

   Interoperability considerations: none.

   Published specification: this document.

   Applications that use this media type: as invented by the user.

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): not applicable.

   Intended usage: LIMITED USE.

5.  Security considerations

   The example media type and subtypes are defined for use in
   documentation only.  Hence they present no security issues other than
   those contrived by their user for purposes of illustration.


6.  IANA considerations

   This document specifies and registers the example media type and the
   text/example, image/example, audio/example, video/example, and
   application/example media subtypes.
