Internet-Draft       IPv6 Multicast over IEEE 802.16       February 2006


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 networks support mobile stations (MSs) to access
   broadband wireless networks while moving at a vehicular speed
   [IEEE802.16e].  However, 802.16 networks do not provide link layer
   native multicast capability because of point-to-multipoint connection
   characteristic [IEEE802.16].  This feature restricts the adoption of
   protocols or applications that need IPv6 multicast capability.  One
   of the prominent ways to solve the multicast support problem is to
   use the built-in LAN emulation feature of 802.16 which is based on
   Convergence Sublayer [I-D.jee-16ng-problem-statement].

   There are several previous work that focused on the transport of link
   local scope multicast packets over 802.16 network [I-D.jeon-ipv6-ndp-
   ieee802.16][I-D.jang-16ng-llm].  However, the IPv6 multicast service
   requires not only the delivery of link local scope multicast packets,
   but also the delivery of non-link local scope multicast packets such
   as site local or global scope multicast packets.  Since it is unclear
   for 802.16 networks what constitutes a subnet, we need to consider
   the transport of IPv6 multicast packets over various subnet models
   [I-D.madanapalli-nd-over-802.16-problems].

   This memo describes how the IPv6 multicast packets with various scope
   can be delivered over four different types of subnet models.

1.1.  Assumption and Scope

   This document describes how to provide IP CS based IPv6 multicast
   packets delivery over IEEE 802.16 networks.  We will consider
   Ethernet CS based IPv6 multicast packet transport in the later
   version of this document.

   We classify the IPv6 multicast packet into link local scope and non-
   link local scope multicast packet.  Node-local scope multicast packet
   is not considered in this memo.  When a BS is separated from an
   access router (AR), we assume that the BS is connected to AR via
   Ethernet.  If Ethernet is not used between BS and AR, tunneling may
   be used to apply our proposed approaches.

   Our approaches are based on the use of multicast CID (MCID) to
   distinguish between multicast and unicast packets, and to deliver the
   multicast packets.  This memo presents MCID based transport of IPv6
   multicast packet not only link local scope, but also non-link local
   scope.  The initialization or distribution of MCID is not covered in
   this document, but we may guess that the MCID will be initialized
   during the establishment phase of host IP connectivity.

1.2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   In this memo, a link local multicast packet indicates a multicast
   packet with link local scope such as NS, RA, and so on.  A non-link
   local multicast packet means that scope of the packet is neither node
   local nor link local.  The non-link local multicast packet also
   includes a multicast data packet.

      BS (base station)
      CID (connection id)
      CS (convergence sublayer)
      MCID (multicast CID) : CID for IP multicast service
      MS (mobile station)

2.  Brief Description of Subnet Models

   The relationship between BS and AR induces several IP subnet models
   in 802.16 networks.  We may deduce following four IP subnet models
   from the IP prefix assignment method and the relationship of AR and
   BS [I-D.shin-v6ops-802.16-deployment-scenarios].  This document
   describes the transport of IPv6 multicast packets with IP CS over
   each subnet models.

3.  Subnet Model A

   When BS and AR are integrated in the same box, there exist two cases
   of IPv6 prefix allocation method.  The one is to assign an IPv6
   prefix to each AR/BS box and the other is to allocate an IPv6 prefix
   to each MS, similar to 3GPP scenario [RFC 3314].

   In this section, we discuss the delivery of IPv6 multicast packets
   over 'Subnet model A' depicted in Figure 2 where a BS is integrated
   with a router, composing one box in view of implementation.  In this
   subnet model, each subnet consists of single BS/AR and only one MS.
   Thus, each MS has a unique IPv6 prefix.

          +-----+
          | MS1 |<-------------+
          +-----+              v
          +-----+            +-------+         +--------+
          | MS2 |<---------->|BS/AR1 |---------| Edge   |    ISP
          +-----+            +-------+         | Router +==>Network
                                               +--------+
          +-----+            +-------+           |
          | MS3 |<---------->|BS/AR2 |-----------+
          +-----+            +-------+
                                        <---> IP termination

   Figure 2: Subnet model A

3.1.  Link Local scope Multicast Packet

   Since one MS exists in a subnet and the MS gets a unique IPv6 prefix,
   it is not needed to transmit IPv6 multicast packet by using MCID.  A
   multicast packet sent from MS may be delivered to BS/AR by using
   unicast CID.  BS/AR may transmit a multicast packet to MS by using
   unicast CID.

3.2.  Non-link Local scope Multicast Packet

   There are two types of non-link local scope multicast packets,
   originated from MS and originated from other subnets or Internet.  In
   both types, BS/AR should support both MLDv2 [RFC 3810] and IPv6
   multicast routing protocols.

3.2.1.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 2, when BS/AR1 receives a non-link local scope
   multicast packet from MS1, BS/AR1 looks up the multicast routing
   table and forwards the packet to the edge router according to lookup
   result.  The packet forwarded by BS/AR1 is delivered to edge router

   or BS/AR2 by means of regular IPv6 multicast packet transport
   procedure.  If the packet is destined to BS/AR2's subnet, BS/AR2
   transmits the packet to its downlinks with unicast CID.

3.2.2.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from Other Subnets or Internet

   When BS/AR receives a multicast packet from edge router, it looks up
   the multicast routing table and checks whether the packet is destined
   to its own subnet.  If there exists a receiver in the subnet, BS/AR
   forwards the packet to its downlinks by using unicast CID.

4.  Subnet Model B

   In this section, we discuss the delivery of IPv6 multicast packets
   over 'Subnet model B' depicted in Figure 3 where a BS is integrated
   with a router, composing one box, and a subnet consisting of only
   single BS/AR and multiple MSs.

          +-----+
          | MS1 |<------+
          +-----+       |
          +-----+       |    +-------+         +--------+

          +-----+            +-------+         | Router +==>Network

          +-----+            +-------+           |
          | MS3 |<---------->|BS/AR2 |-----------+
          +-----+            +-------+
                                        <---> IP termination

   Figure 3: Subnet model B

4.1.  Link Local scope Multicast Packet

   Link local scope multicast packets may be classified by packets
   originated from MS and from BS/AR integrated box.

4.1.1.  Link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 3, when BS/AR1 receives a link local scope multicast
   packet from MS1, BS/AR1 multicasts the packet onto its downlinks by
   using MCID.

4.1.2.  Link Local Multicast Packet from BS/AR

   When BS/AR needs to send a multicast packet to MSs in the subnet,
   BS/AR transmits the packet to its downlinks with MCID.

4.2.  Non-link Local scope Multicast Packet

   There are two types of non-link local scope multicast packets,
   originated from MS and from other subnets or Internet.  In both
   types, BS/AR should support both MLDv2 and IPv6 multicast routing
   protocols.

4.2.1.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 3, when MS1 sends a non-link local scope multicast
   packet, BS/AR1 receives the packet and transmits the packet to its

   downlinks by using MCID.  After then, BS/AR1 looks up the multicast
   routing table and forwards the packet to the edge router according to
   the lookup result.  The packet forwarded by BS/AR1 is delivered to
   BS/AR2 or edge router by means of regular IPv6 multicast packet
   transport procedure.  If the packet is destined to BS/AR2's subnet,
   BS/AR2 transmits the packet to its downlinks with MCID.

4.2.2.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from Other Subnets or  Internet

   When BS/AR receives a multicast packet from edge router, it looks up
   the multicast routing table and checks whether the packet is destined
   to its own subnet.  If there exists a receiver in the subnet, BS/AR
   sends the packet to its downlinks by using MCID.

5.  Subnet Model C

   In this section, we discuss the transport of IPv6 multicast packets
   over the 'Subnet model C' shown in Figure 4 where a BS is separated
   from an AR and a subnet consists of multiple BSs and multiple MSs.

          +-----+
          | MS1 |<------+

   Figure 4: Subnet model C

5.1.  Link Local scope Multicast Packet

   Link local scope multicast packets may be classified by packets
   originated from MS and from AR.

5.1.1.  Link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 4, when BS1 receives a link local scope multicast
   packet originated from MS1, BS1 multicasts the packet onto its
   downlinks by using MCID.  After then, BS1 converts the IEEE 802.16
   MAC frame format to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame and transmits the frame
   into the link connected to AR.

5.1.2.  Link Local Multicast Packet from AR

   When BS receives an Ethernet frame sent from AR, it examines the IPv6
   destination address.  If the destination address is link local scope
   multicast address, BS transmits the packet to its downlinks with
   MCID.

5.2.  Non-link Local scope Multicast Packet

   Non-link local scope multicast packets can be classified into two
   cases, packets sent from MS and sent from other subnets in the same
   site or Internet.  In both cases, AR should support both MLDv2 and
   IPv6 multicast routing protocols.

5.2.1.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 4, when MS1 sends a non-link local scope multicast
   packet, BS1 performs the same operation as link local scope case.
   When AR receives the packet transmitted by BS1, it performs the
   multicast routing table lookup and forwarding.  The packet forwarded
   by AR is delivered to BS2 or edge router according to regular IPv6
   multicast packet transport procedure.  If the packet is destined to
   MSs in BS2's subnet, BS2 transmits the received packet to its
   downlinks with predefined MCID.

5.2.2.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from Other Subnets or Internet

   When AR receives a packet from edge router, it looks up the multicast
   routing table and checks whether there exists a receiver of the
   packet in AR's subnets.  If there exists a receiver, AR sends the
   packet to appropriate BSs in the downlinks.  When BS receives the
   multicast packet sent from AR, it checks the IPv6 destination
   address.  If the destination address is non-link local scope
   multicast address, BS multicasts the packet to its downlinks with
   MCID.

6.  Subnet Model D

   In this section, we discuss the transport of IPv6 multicast packets
   over the 'Subnet model D' shown in the Figure 5 where a BS is
   separated from a router, and a subnet consists of multiple BS and
   multiple MSs.

6.1.  Link Local scope Multicast Packet

   Link local scope multicast packets may be classified by packets
   originated from MS and from AR.

6.1.1.  Link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 5, when BS1 receives a link local scope multicast
   packet originated from MS1, BS1 multicasts the packet onto its
   downlinks by using MCID.  After then, BS1 converts the IEEE 802.16
   MAC frame format to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame and transmits the frame
   into the link connected to AR according to the destination address.
   BS2 which is on the same link as BS1, receives the Ethernet frame
   sent from BS1 and examines the IPv6 destination address.  If the
   destination address is link local multicast address, BS2 multicasts
   the packet to its downlinks with predefined MCID.  If the destination
   address is unicast, the received packet goes through IPv6 unicast
   packet handling process.

6.1.2.  Link Local Multicast Packet from AR

   When BS receives an Ethernet frame sent from AR, it examines the IPv6
   destination address.  If the destination address is link local scope
   multicast address, BS transmits the packet to its downlinks with
   MCID.

6.2.  Non-link Local scope Multicast Packet

   Non-link local scope multicast packets can be classified into two
   cases, packets sent from MS and sent from other subnets in the same
   site or Internet.  In both cases, AR should support both MLDv2 and
   IPv6 multicast routing protocols.

6.2.1.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 5, when MS1 sends a non-link local scope multicast
   packet, BS1 and BS2 perform same operation as link local scope case.
   When AR1 receives the packet transmitted by BS1, it performs the
   multicast routing table lookup and forwarding.  The packet forwarded
   by AR1 is delivered to AR2 or edge router according to regular IPv6
   multicast packet transport procedure.  If the packet is destined to
   AR2's subnet, AR2 transmits the packet to its downlinks.  BS which is
   on the downlinks of AR2, receives the Ethernet frame sent from AR2
   and examines the IPv6 destination address.  If the destination
   address is link local multicast address, BS multicasts the packet to
   its downlinks with predefined MCID

6.2.2.  Non-link Local Multicast Packet from Other Subnets or Internet

   When AR receives the packet from edge router, it looks up the
   multicast routing table and checks whether there exist receivers of
   the packet in AR's subnet.  If there exists a receiver, AR sends the
   packet to BSs in the downlinks.  Each BS in the subnet receives the
   packet sent from AR and checks the IPv6 destination address.  If the
   destination address is non-link local scope multicast address, BS
   multicasts the packet to its downlinks with MCID.

7.  Considerations about MCID Format

   The allocation of MCID to IPv6 multicast packets needs to be
   considered in IEEE.  However, in this memo, we present a few
   candidates.

7.1.  IPv6 scope-based MCID Format

   This section specifies a modification to the CID format as follows.


         |               11             | 1 |     4    |
         +------------------------------+---+----------+
         |          MCID prefix         | M |   scop   |
         +------------------------------+---+----------+


   Figure 6: IPv6 Scope based MCID Format

   MCID consists of MCID prefix, M, and scope field.  MCID prefix is
   used to indicate that a multicast packet is embedded in IEEE 802.16
   frame.  M field implies that IP CS is used to encapsulate the IPv6
   packet.  When M field is 1, scope field be set to the same value as
   the scope field of encapsulated IPv6 destination address.  When M
   field is 0, scope field is reserved for future use and should be 0.

7.2.  Distributed Link Local Multicast CID Format

   This format is proposed in [I-D.jang-16ng-llm].  When IEEE 802.16
   network interface is initialized, a MS generates a set of
   corresponding link local multicast CIDs by affixing well-known prefix
   n bit for IPv6 link local multicast, to the 16-n bit of the IPv6
   multicast address.  The well-known prefix will be allocated by IEEE
   later and 'n' will be decided with much consideration in later
   version.
