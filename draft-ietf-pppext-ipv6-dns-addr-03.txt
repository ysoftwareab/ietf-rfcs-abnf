1.  Introduction

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [STD51] provides a standard method
   for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.
   PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a family of
   Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring
   different network-layer protocols.

   This document extends the NCP for establishing and configuring
   Version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPV6) over PPP [RFC2472],
   defining the negotiation of primary and alternate Domain Name System
   (DNS) server addresses for IPV6 [RFC1034] [RFC1035] [RFC1886].


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Additional IPV6CP Configuration Options

   The two name server address configuration options, TBD1 and TBD2,
   provide a method of obtaining the addresses of Domain Name System
   (DNS) servers on the remote IPV6 network.

   For implementation convenience, these options are designed to serve
   identical purposes, except that when both are present an attempt
   SHOULD be made to resolve names using the primary address before
   using the alternative server address.


3.1.  Primary DNS Server IPV6 Address

   Description
      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the IPV6 address of the primary DNS server to be

      used on the local end of the link.  If the local peer requests an
      invalid server address (which it will typically do intentionally)
      the remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and
      returning the Ipv6 address of a valid DNS server.

      By default, no primary DNS address is provided.

      A summary of the Primary DNS IPV6 Address Configuration Option
      format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to
      right.

   Primary-DNS-IPV6-Addr
      The sixteen octet Primary-DNS-Addr is the address (in network
      byte order) of the primary DNS server to be used by the local
      peer.  If all sixteen octets are set to zero, it indicates an
      explicit request that the peer provide the address information in
      a Config-Nak packet.

   Default
      No address is provided.


3.2.  Alternative DNS Server IPV6 Address

      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the IPV6 address of an alternate DNS server to be

   Alt-DNS-IPV6-Address
      The sixteen octet Secondary-DNS-IPV6-Address is the IPV6 address 
      (in network byte order) of the secondary DNS server to be used 
      by the local peer.  If all sixteen octets are set to zero, it 
      indicates an explicit request that the peer provide the address
      information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default
      No address is provided.
