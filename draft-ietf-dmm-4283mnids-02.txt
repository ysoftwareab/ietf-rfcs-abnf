1.  Introduction

   The Mobile Node Identifier Option for MIPv6 [RFC4283] has proved to
   be a popular design tool for providing identifiers for mobile nodes
   during authentication procedures with AAA protocols such as Diameter
   [RFC3588].  To date, only a single type of identifier has been
   specified, namely the MN NAI.  Other types of identifiers are in
   common use, and even referenced in RFC 4283.  In this document, we
   propose adding some basic types that are defined in various
   telecommunications standards, including types for IMSI
   [ThreeGPP-IDS], P-TMSI [ThreeGPP-IDS], IMEI [ThreeGPP-IDS], and GUTI
   [ThreeGPP-IDS].  In addition, we specify the IPv6 address itself and
   IEEE MAC-layer addresses as mobile node identifiers.  Defining

   identifiers that are tied to the physical elements of the device
   (RFID, MAC address etc.) help in deployment of Mobile IP because in
   many cases such identifiers are the most natural means for uniquely
   identifying the device, and will avoid additional look-up steps that
   might be needed if other identifiers were used.

2.  New Mobile Node Identifier Types

   The following types of identifiers are commonly used to identify
   mobile nodes.  For each type, references are provided with full
   details on the format of the type of identifer.

   The Tag Data standard promoted by Electronic Product Code(TM)
   (abbreviated EPC) supports several encoding systems or schemes
   including

   o  RFID-GID (Global Identifier),
   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item Number),
   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container),
   o  RFID-SGLN (Global Location Number),
   o  RFID-GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier),
   o  RFID-DOD (Department of Defense ID), and
   o  RFID-GIAI (Global Individual Asset Identifier).

   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are two variations: a 64-bit
   scheme (for example, SGLN-64) and a 96-bit scheme (SGLN-96).  GID has
   only a 96-bit scheme.  Within each scheme, an EPC identifier can be
   represented in a binary form or other forms such as URI.

   The following list includes the above RFID types as well as various
   other common identifiers and several different types of DUIDs.

                                  Table 1

3.  Descriptions of MNID types

   In this section descriptions for the various MNID types are provided.

3.1.  Description of the IPv6 address type

   The IPv6 address [RFC4291] is encoded as a 16 octet string containing
   the full IPv6 address.

3.2.  Description of the IMSI MNID type

   The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS] is
   at most 15 decimal digits (i.e., digits from 0 through 9).  The IMSI
   MUST be encoded as a string of octets in network order, where each
   digit occupies 4 bits.  The last digit MUST be zero padded, if
   needed, for full octet size.  For example an example IMSI
   123456123456789 would be encoded as follows:

      0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x90

3.3.  Description of the EUI-48 address type

   The IEEE EUI-48 address [IEEE802-eui48] is encoded as a 6 octet
   string containing the IEEE EUI-48 address.

3.4.  Description of the EUI-64 address type

   The IEEE EUI-64 address [IEEE802-eui64] is encoded as a 8 octet
   string containing the full IEEE EUI-64 address.

3.5.  Description of the DUID-LLT type

   The DUID-LLT is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) formulated by
   concatenating the link-layer address plus a timestamp [RFC3315].
   This type of DUID consists of a two octet type field containing the
   value 1, a two octet hardware type code, four octets containing a
   time value, followed by link-layer address of any one network
   interface that is connected to the DHCP device at the time that the
   DUID is generated.  The time value is the time that the DUID is
   generated represented in seconds since midnight (UTC), January 1,
   2000, modulo 2^32.  Since the link-layer address can be of variable
   length [RFC2464], the DUID-LLT is of variable length.

Internet-Draft      MN Identifier Types for RFC 4283           June 2016


3.6.  Description of the DUID-EN type

   The DUID-EN is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) formulated by
   concatenating the Enterprise Number plus some additional data
   [RFC3315].  This form of DUID is assigned by the vendor to the
   device.  It consists of a two octet type field containing the value
   2, the vendor's registered Private Enterprise Number as maintained by
   IANA, followed by a unique identifier assigned by the vendor.  Since
   the vendor's unique identifier can be of variable length, the DUID-EN
   is of variable length.

3.7.  Description of the DUID-LL type

   The DUID-LL is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) formulated by
   concatenating the network hardware type code and the link-layer
   address [RFC3315].  This type of DUID consists of two octets
   containing the DUID type 3, a two octet network hardware type code,
   followed by the link-layer address of any one network interface that
   is permanently connected to the client or server device.  For
   example, a host that has a network interface implemented in a chip
   that is unlikely to be removed and used elsewhere could use a DUID-
   LL.  Since the link-layer address can be of variable length, the
   DUID-LL is of variable length.

3.8.  Description of the DUID-UUID type

   The DUID-UUID [RFC6355] is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier based on the
   Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122].  This type of DUID
   consists of two octets containing the DUID type 4, followed by
   128-bit UUID.

3.9.  Description of the RFID types

   The General Identifier (GID) that is used with RFID is composed of
   three fields - the General Manager Number, Object Class and Serial
   Number.  The General Manager Number identifies an organizational
   entity that is responsible for maintaining the numbers in subsequent
   fields.  GID encodings include a fourth field, the header, to
   guarantee uniqueness in the namespace defined by EPC.

   Some of the RFID types depend on the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)
   code defined in the General EAN.UCC Specifications [EANUCCGS].  A
   GTIN identifies a particular class of object, such as a particular
   kind of product or SKU.

   The EPC encoding scheme for SGTIN permits the direct embedding of
   EAN.UCC System standard GTIN and Serial Number codes on EPC tags.  In

   all cases, the check digit is not encoded.  Two encoding schemes are
   specified, SGTIN-64 (64 bits) and SGTIN-96 (96 bits).

   The Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) is defined by the EAN.UCC
   Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the SSCC is already intended for
   assignment to individual objects and therefore does not require
   additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  Two encoding
   schemes are specified, SSCC-64 (64 bits) and SSCC-96 (96 bits).

   The Global Location Number (GLN) is defined by the EAN.UCC
   Specifications.  A GLN can represent either a discrete, unique
   physical location such as a warehouse slot, or an aggregate physical
   location such as an entire warehouse.  In addition, a GLN can
   represent a logical entity that performs a business function such as
   placing an order.  The Serialized Global Location Number (SGLN)
   includes the Company Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

   The Global Returnable Asset Identifier is (GRAI) is defined by the
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GRAI is already
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

   The Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) is defined by the
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GIAI is already
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix, and Individual Asset Reference.

   The DoD Construct identifier is defined by the United States
   Department of Defense (DoD).  This tag data construct may be used to
   encode tags for shipping goods to the DoD by a supplier who has
   already been assigned a CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code.

3.9.1.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-64 type

   The RFID-SGTIN-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGTIN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value (additional data
   that is used for fast filtering and pre-selection), Company Prefix
   Index, Item Reference, and Serial Number.  Only a limited number of
   Company Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.

3.9.2.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-96 type

   The RFID-SGTIN-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGTIN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition (an
   indication of where the subsequent Company Prefix and Item Reference

3.9.10.  Description of the RFID-GIAI-96 type

   The RFID-GIAI-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GIAI-96 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition,
   Company Prefix, and Individual Asset Reference.

3.9.11.  Description of the RFID-DoD-64 type

   The RFID-DoD-64 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The
   DoD-64 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.

3.9.12.  Description of the RFID-DoD-96 type

   The RFID-DoD-96 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The
   DoD-96 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.

3.9.13.  Description of the RFID URI types

   In some cases, it is desirable to encode in URI form a specific
   encoding of an RFID tag.  For example, an application may prefer a
   URI representation for report preparation.  Applications that wish to
   manipulate any additional data fields on tags may need some
   representation other than the pure identity forms.

   For this purpose, the fields as represented the previous sections are
   associated with specified fields in the various URI types.  For
   instance, the URI may have fields such as CompanyPrefix,
   ItemReference, or SerialNumber.  For details and encoding specifics,
   consult [EPC-Tag-Data].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.  Insofar as the
   selection of a security association may be dependent on the exact
   form of a mobile node identifier, additional specification may be
   necessary when the new identifier types are employed with the general
   AAA mechanisms for mobile node authorizations.

   Some identifiers (e.g., IMSI) are considered to be private
   information.  If used in the MNID extension as defined in this
   document, the packet including the MNID extension should be encrypted
   so that personal information or trackable identifiers would not be
   inadvertently disclosed to passive observers.  Operators can
   potentially apply IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) with

   confidentiality and integrity protection for protecting the location
   information.

   Moreover, MNIDs containing sensitive identifiers might only be used
   for signaling during initial network entry.  Subsequent binding
   update exchanges might then rely on a temporary identifier allocated
   during the initial network entry, perhaps using mechanisms not
   standardized within the IETF.  Managing the association between long-
   lived and temporary identifiers is outside the scope of this
   document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The new mobile node identifier types defined in the document should
   be assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option Subtypes"
   registry.  The following values should be assigned.
