1.  Introduction

   The Sieve Email Filtering Language [RFC5228] provides a number of
   action commands, some of which can generate additional messages on
   behalf of the user.  Two such commands are defined by the Vacation
   [RFC5230] and Notify [RFC5435] extensions.  It is sometimes desirable
   to have an archive of the messages generated by these commands.

   This extension defines a new optional tagged argument ":fcc" to
   action commands which generate additional messages to allow a copy of
   the generated message to be filed into a target mailbox.

   The capability string associated with this extension is "fcc".

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Conventions for notations are as in Section 1.1 of [RFC5228],
   including use of the "Usage:" label for the definition of action and
   tagged arguments syntax.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Tagged Argument ":fcc"

   For convenience, the "FCC" syntax element is defined here using ABNF
   [RFC4234] so that it can be augmented by other extensions.

   FCC = ":fcc" <mailbox: string>

   If the optional ":fcc" argument is specified with an action that
   generates an additional message, it instructs the Sieve interpreter
   to file a copy of the generated message into the target mailbox.  If
   the specified mailbox doesn't exist, the implementation MAY treat it
   as an error, create the mailbox, or file the message into an
   implementation-defined mailbox.

3.1.  Format of Filed Messages

   Copies of messages filed into a mailbox via this extension are
   REQUIRED to be in Internet Message Format [RFC5322].  Some messages
   generated by Sieve actions might already conform to this format and
   MAY be filed without modification.  Messages generated in other
   formats MUST be encapsulated using constructs from [RFC5322] and MIME
   ([RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2047]).

   The general requirements for encapsulating the copies of messages to
   be filed are the following:

   o  Date: The Date header field is REQUIRED and SHOULD be set to the
      date and time when the message was generated.

   o  From: The From header field is REQUIRED and SHOULD be set to the
      email address of the owner of the Sieve script, unless explicitly
      overridden by rules for encapsulating a particular message type.

   o  To: The To header field is OPTIONAL and MAY be set to the email
      address of the recipient of the generated message, if available.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                     April 2018


   o  Subject: The Subject header field is OPTIONAL and MAY be generated
      as follows: The subject is set to the characters "Fcc: " followed
      by the subject of the message being processed by the Sieve
      interpreter.

   o  In-Reply-To: The In-Reply-To header field is OPTIONAL and MAY be
      set to the Message-ID of the message being processed by the Sieve
      interpreter.

   o  Message Body: The body of the filed message is REQUIRED and is
      composed of one or more MIME-parts containing the generated
      message and any related metadata.  The Content-Type header
      field(s) MUST be set to the appropriate MIME types.  If any of the
      MIME-parts include 8-bit or binary data, the Content-Transfer-
      Encoding header field(s) MUST be set accordingly.

3.2.  Interaction with the Vacation Action

   This document extends the "vacation" [RFC5230] action (see also
   "vacation-seconds" [RFC6131]) to optionally store a copy of the auto-
   reply messages into a target mailbox.

   Usage:   vacation [FCC]
                     [":days" number | ":seconds" number]
                     [":subject" string]
                     [":from" string]
                     [":addresses" string-list]
                     [":mime"]
                     [":handle" string]
                     <reason: string>

   Example:

   require ["vacation", "fcc"];

   vacation :days 7
            :from "hemingway@example.com" "Gone Fishin'"
            :fcc "INBOX.Sent";

   Vacation auto-reply messages are MIME-compliant and MAY be filed into
   the target mailbox without modification.

3.3.  Interaction with the Notify Action

   This document extends the "notify" [RFC5435] action to optionally
   store a copy of the notification messages into a target mailbox.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                     April 2018


   Usage:   notify [FCC]
                   [":from" string]
                   [":importance" <"1" / "2" / "3">]
                   [":options" string-list]
                   [":message" string]
                   <method: string>

   Example:

   require ["enotify", "fcc"];

   notify :fcc "INBOX.Sent"
          :message "You got mail!"
          "mailto:ken@example.com";

   Messages generated using the "mailto" [RFC5436] notification method
   are MIME-compliant and MAY be filed into the target mailbox without
   modification.

   Messages generated by other notification methods (e.g. "xmpp"
   [RFC5437]) MUST be encapsulated per Section 3.1 before being filed.
   The body of the filed message MUST include the :message parameter and
   MAY include one or more of the :from, :importance, or :options
   parameters.  The MIME-type(s) of the body part(s) used to encapsulate
   the parameters is an implementation decision.

3.4.  Compatibility with the Reject and Extended Reject Actions

   "fcc" MUST be incompatible with the "reject" and "ereject" [RFC5429]
   actions.  Making "fcc" compatible with these actions violates the
   SMTP [RFC5321] principle that a message is either delivered or
   bounced back to the sender.  Namely, the saved copy of the rejection
   message will contain the original message.

   It is an error for a script to use the ":fcc" tagged argument with
   either "reject" or "ereject".

3.5.  Compatibility with Other Actions

   The "fcc" extension is not compatible with any Sieve action that does
   not generate an additional message on behalf of the user.  It is an
   error for a script to use the ":fcc" tagged argument with any such
   action.

   Future extensions that define actions that generate additional
   messages on behalf of the user should describe their compatibility
   with ":fcc", and how to MIME-encapsulate the message, if required.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                     April 2018


3.6.  Interaction with Fileinto Extensions

   The "fcc" extension can be used with some tagged arguments defined in
   extensions to the "fileinto" action.  The sections below describe its
   interaction with currently defined extensions.  Tagged arguments in
   future extensions to the "fileinto" command should describe their
   interaction with ":fcc", if any.

3.6.1.  Imap4flags Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":flags" [RFC5232] tagged
   argument so that it can optionally be used with the ":fcc" argument.

   FCC =/ [":flags" <list-of-flags: string-list>]

   If the optional ":flags" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to set the IMAP4 flags provided in
   the subsequent argument when the generated message is filed into the
   target mailbox.

3.6.2.  Mailbox Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":create" [RFC5490]
   tagged argument so that it can optionally be used with the ":fcc"
   argument.

   FCC =/ [":create"]

   If the optional ":create" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to create the target mailbox, if
   needed, before attempting to file the generated message into the
   target mailbox.

3.6.3.  Special-Use Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":specialuse"
   [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use] tagged argument so that it can
   optionally be used with the ":fcc" argument.

   FCC =/ [":specialuse <special-use-flag: string>"]

   If the optional ":specialuse" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to check whether a mailbox exists
   with the specific special-use flag assigned to it.  If such a mailbox
   exists, the generated message is filed into the special-use mailbox.
   Otherwise, the generated message is filed into the target mailbox.

Internet-Draft                  Sieve Fcc                     April 2018


   If both the optional ":specialuse" and ":create" arguments are
   specified with ":fcc", the Sieve interpreter is instructed to create
   the target mailbox per Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use], if needed.

3.6.4.  Extended Example

require ["vacation", "fcc", "mailbox", "special-use", "imap4flags"];

vacation :days 7
         :from "hemingway@example.com" "Gone Fishin'"
         :fcc "INBOX.Sent" :specialuse "\\Sent" :create :flags ["\\Seen"];

4.  Security Considerations

   The "fcc" extension does not raise any other security considerations
   that are not already present in [RFC5228], [RFC5230], [RFC5435], and
   [RFC6131].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of Sieve Extension

      To: iana@iana.org

      Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension
