               Redundancy Policy for Redundant Protection
                 draft-geng-spring-redundancy-policy-01

Abstract

   Redundancy protection is a method of service protection by sending
   copies of the same packets of one flow over multiple paths, which
   includes packet replicaiton, elimination and ordering.  This document
   defines redundancy policy as an extension to the current SR policy to
   support redundancy protection.

1.  Introduction

   Redundancy protection is a method of providing 1+1 protection by
   sending copies of the same packets of one flow over multiple paths,
   which includes packet replication, elimination and ordering.  This
   document defines redundancy policy to support redundancy protection.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Redundancy Node: the start point of redundancy protection, which is a
   network device that could implement packet replication.

   Merging Node: the end point of redundancy protection, which is a
   network node that could implement packet elimination and
   ordering(optionally).

   Redundancy Policy: an extended sr policy which includes more than one
   active segment lists to support redundancy protection.

   Editor's Note: Similar mechanism is defined as "Service Protection"
   in the [RFC8655].  In this document, we define a new term "Redundancy
   Protection" to distinguish with other service protection method.
   Some of the terms are the similar as [RFC8655].

3.  Redundancy Protection Introduction

   The figure shows how to provide redundancy protection in an Segment
   Routing Domain.

                |<---------------SR Domain--------------->|
                |                                         |
                |             +------+T2+----+            |

      | E1+----| In|--+T1+--+Red|          |Mer|--+T4+--| Eg+----+ E2|

                              +-----+T3+-----+

   The process of redundancy protection is as follows: 1) The flow is
   replicated in Reb(Redundancy Node); 2) Tow replicated flows go
   through different paths till Mer (Merging Node); When there is any
   failures happened in one the path, the service continues to deliver
   through the other path without break; 3) The first received packet of
   the flow is transmitted from Mer (Merging Node) to Eg(Egress), and
   the redundant packets are eliminated. 4) Sometimes, the packet will
   arrive out of order because of redundancy protection, the function of
   reordering may be necessary in the Merging Node.

   In this document, we introduces Redundancy Policy as a variation of
   Segment Routing Policy defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] to support redundancy
   protection.  Redundancy policy applys equally to both SR-MPLS and
   SRv6.

4.  Redudancy Policy

   Redundancy Policy is used to enable packet replication and
   instantiation more than one ordered lists of segments between
   replication node and merging node to steer the same flow through
   different paths in an SR domain.

   A Redundancy Policy is identified through the tuple <replication
   node, redundancy ID, merging node>.  Redundancy node is specified as
   IPv4/IPv6 address of the head end, which is able to do packet
   replication.  Merging node is specified as IPv4/IPv6 address of the
   end point, which is able to do packet elimination and
   ordering(optional).  Replication ID could be a specified value of
   "color" define in section 2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], which indicates the sr
   policy as a redundancy policy.  Replication ID could also be used to
   distinguish redundancy policy sharing the same redundancy node and
   merging node.

   The following elements are extended in Redundancy Policy:

   o  Redundancy ID: is used to distinguish different redundancy policy

   o  Redundancy SID: is variation of Binding SID for Redundancy policy.
      Redundancy SID will be instantiated as Redundancy Policy in
      redundancy node.  Redundancy SID is define in draft-geng-spring-
      redundancy-protection-sid-00

   o  Candidate path: more than one candidate paths are included in
      redundancy policy.  In each candidate path, the last segment
      SHOULD be merging SID.  Merging SID is defined in draft-geng-
      spring-redundancy-protection-sid-00.  The preference of the
      candidate path is used to select the best candidate path for an SR
      Policy.  The preference of candidate paths in redundancy policy
      SHOULD be the same .

   A packet is steered into a Redundancy policy at a redundancy node in
   similar ways of SR policy defined in section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]:

   o  Incoming packets have an active SID matching the redundancy SID at
      the redundancy node;

   o  Incoming packets match a BGP/Service route which recurses on an SR
      policy (BGP should be extended to support matching to a redundancy
      policy, which is supposed to be covered in the following work);

   o  Per-flow Steering: incoming packets match or recurse on a
      forwarding array of where some of the entries are Replication
      Policy.

   o  Policy-based Steering: incoming packets match a routing policy
      which directs them on a redundancy policy.
