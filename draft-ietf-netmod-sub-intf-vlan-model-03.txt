                  Sub-interface VLAN YANG Data Models
                draft-ietf-netmod-sub-intf-vlan-model-03

Abstract

   This document defines YANG modules to add support for classifying
   traffic received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to
   sub-interfaces based on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN
   frame headers.  These modules allow configuration of Layer 3 and
   Layer 2 sub-interfaces (e.g. attachment circuits) that can
   interoperate with IETF based forwarding protocols; such as IP and
   L3VPN services; or L2VPN services like VPWS, VPLS, and EVPN.  The
   sub-interfaces also interoperate with VLAN tagged traffic orginating
   from an IEEE 802.1Q compliant bridge.  Primarily the classification
   is based on VLAN identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but the model
   also has support for matching on some other layer 2 frame header
   fields and is designed to be extensible to match on other arbitrary
   header fields.

   The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in that the
   configuration is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being
   based on membership of an 802.1Q VLAN bridge.

Internet-Draft           Sub-interface VLAN YANG            October 2017


1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG [RFC7950] modules that augment the
   encapsulation choice YANG element defined in Interface Extensions
   YANG [I-D.ietf-netmod-intf-ext-yang] and the generic interfaces data
   model defined in [RFC7223].  The two modules provide configuration
   nodes to support classification of Ethernet/VLAN traffic to sub-
   interfaces, that can have interface based feature and service
   configuration applied to them.

   The purpose of these models is to allow IETF defined forwarding
   protocols, such as IPv6 [RFC2460], Ethernet Pseudo Wires [RFC4448]
   and VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762] to be configurable via YANG when
   interoperating with VLAN tagged traffic received from an IEEE 802.1Q
   compliant bridge.

   In the case of layer 2 Ethernet services, the flexible encapsulation
   module also supports flexible rewriting of the VLAN tags contained
   the in frame header.

   For reference, a comparison between the sub-interface based YANG
   model documented in this draft and an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model is
   described in Appendix A.

   In summary, the YANG modules defined in this internet draft are:

      if-l3-vlan.yang - Defines the model for basic classification of
      VLAN tagged traffic to L3 transport services

      flexible-encapsulation.yang - Defines the model for flexible
      classification of Ethernet/VLAN traffic to L2 transport services

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Sub-interface: A sub-interface is a small augmentation of a regular
   interface in the standard YANG module for Interface Management that
   represents a subset of the traffic handled by its parent interface.
   As such, it supports both configuration and operational data using
   any other YANG models that augment or reference interfaces in the
   normal way.  It is defined in Interface Extensions YANG
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-intf-ext-yang].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list or leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Objectives

   The primary aim of the YANG modules contained in this draft is to
   provide the core model that is required to implement VLAN transport
   services on router based devices that is fully compatible with IEEE
   802.1Q compliant bridges.

   A secondary aim is for the modules to be structured in such a way
   that they can be cleanly extended in future.

2.1.  Interoperability with IEEE 802.1Q compliant bridges

   The modules defined in this document are designed to fully
   interoperate with IEEE 802.1Q compliant bridges.  In particular, the
   models are restricted to only matching, adding, or rewriting the
   802.1Q VLAN tags in frames in ways that are compatible with IEEE
   802.1Q compliant bridges.

2.2.  Extensibility

   The modules are structured in such a way that they can be sensibly
   extended.  In particular:

      The tag stack is represented as a list to allow a tag stack of
      more than two tags to be supported if necessary in future.

      The tag stack list elements allow other models, or vendors, to
      include additional forms of tag matching and rewriting.  The

Internet-Draft           Sub-interface VLAN YANG            October 2017


      intention, however, is that it should not be necessary to have any
      vendor specific extensions to any of the YANG models defined in
      this document to implement standard Ethernet and VLAN services.

3.  L3 Interface VLAN Model

   The L3 Interface VLAN model provides appropriate leaves for
   termination of an 802.1Q VLAN tagged segment to a sub-interface based
   L3 service.  It allows for termination of traffic with up to two
   802.1Q VLAN tags.

   The "if-l3-vlan" YANG module has the following structure:


   module: ietf-if-l3-vlan
     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface/if-cmn:encapsulation/
                                                    if-cmn:encaps-type:
       +--:(dot1q-vlan)
          +--rw dot1q-vlan
             +--rw outer-tag!
             |  +--rw tag-type    dot1q-tag-type
             |  +--rw vlan-id     ieee:vlanid
             +--rw second-tag!
                +--rw tag-type    dot1q-tag-type
                +--rw vlan-id     ieee:vlanid


4.  Flexible Encapsulation Model

   The Flexible Encapsulation model is designed to allow for the
   flexible provisioning of layer 2 services.  It provides the
   capability to classify Ethernet/VLAN frames received on an Ethernet
   trunk interface to sub-interfaces based on the fields available in
   the layer 2 headers.  Once classified to sub-interfaces, it provides
   the capability to selectively modify fields within the layer 2
   headers before the frame is handed off to the appropriate forwarding
   code for further handling.

   The model supports a common core set of layer 2 header matches based
   on the 802.1Q tag type and VLAN Ids contained within the header up to
   a tag stack depth of two tags.

   The model supports flexible rewrites of the layer 2 frame header for
   data frames as they are processed on the interface.  It defines a set
   of standard tag manipulations that allow for the insertion, removal,
   or rewrite of one or two 802.1Q VLAN tags.  The expectation is that
   manipulations are generally implemented in a symmetrical fashion,
   i.e. if a manipulation is performed on ingress traffic on an

Internet-Draft           Sub-interface VLAN YANG            October 2017


   interface then the reverse manipulation is always performed on egress
   traffic out of the same interface.  However, the model also allows
   for asymmetrical rewrites, which may be required to implement some
   forwarding models (such as E-Tree).

   The structure of the model is currently limited to matching or
   rewriting a maximum of two 802.1Q tags in the frame header but has
   been designed to be easily extensible to matching/rewriting three or
   more VLAN tags in future, if required.

   The final aim for the model design is for it to be cleanly extensible
   to add in additional match and rewrite criteria of the layer 2
   header, such as matching on the source or destination MAC address,
   PCP or DEI fields in the 802.1Q tags, or the EtherType of the frame
   payload.  Rewrites can also be extended to allow for modification of
   other fields within the layer 2 frame header.

   The "flexible-encapsulation" YANG module has the following structure:


   module: ietf-flexible-encapsulation
     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface/if-cmn:encapsulation/
                                                    if-cmn:encaps-type:

          +--rw flexible

             |     |  +--rw dot1q-priority-tagged

11.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol RFC 6241 [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer and the mandatory to implement secure
   transport is SSH RFC 6242 [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model RFC 6536 [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module which
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e. config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g. edit-config) to
   these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

11.1.  if-l3-vlan.yang

   The nodes in the if-l3-vlan YANG module are concerned with matching
   particular frames received on the network device to connect them to a
   layer 3 forwarding instance, and as such adding/modifying/deleting
   these nodes has a high risk of causing traffic to be lost because it
   is not being classified correctly, or is being classified to a
   separate sub-interface.  The nodes, all under the subtree
   /interfaces/interface/encapsulation/dot1q-vlan, that are sensitive to
   this are:

   o  outer-tag/tag-type

   o  outer-tag/vlan-id

   o  second-tag/tag-type

   o  second-tag/vlan-id

11.2.  flexible-encapsulation.yang

   There are many nodes in the flexible-encapsulation YANG module that
   are concerned with matching particular frames received on the network
   device, and as such adding/modifying/deleting these nodes has a high
   risk of causing traffic to be lost because it is not being classified
   correctly, or is being classified to a separate sub-interface.  The
   nodes, all under the subtree
   /interfaces/interface/encapsulation/flexible/match, that are
   sensitive to this are:

   o  dot1q-vlan-tagged/second-tag/vlan-id

   There are also many modes in the flexible-encapsulation YANG module
   that are concerned with rewriting the fields in the L2 header for
   particular frames received on the network device, and as such
   adding/modifying/deleting these nodes has a high risk of causing
   traffic to be dropped or incorrectly processed on peer network
   devices, or it could cause layer 2 tunnels to go down due to a
   mismatch in negotiated MTU.  The nodes, all under the subtree

Appendix A.  Comparison with the IEEE 802.1Q Configuration Model

   In addition to the sub-interface based YANG model proposed here, the
   IEEE 802.1Q working group is also developing a YANG model for the
   configuration of 802.1Q VLANs.  This raises the valid question as to
   whether the models overlap and whether it is necessary or beneficial

Internet-Draft           Sub-interface VLAN YANG            October 2017


   to have two different models for superficially similar constructs.
   This section aims to answer that question by summarizing and
   comparing the two models.

A.1.  Sub-interface based configuration model overview

   The key features of the sub-interface based configuration model can
   be summarized as:

   o  The model is primarily designed to enable layer 2 and layer 3
      services on Ethernet interfaces that can be defined in a very
      flexible way to meet the varied requirements of service providers.

   o  Traffic is classified from an Ethernet-like interface to sub-
      interfaces based on fields in the layer 2 header.  This is often
      based on VLAN Ids contained in the frame, but the model is
      extensible to other arbitrary fields in the frame header.

   o  Sub-interfaces are just a type of if:interface and hence support
      any feature configuration YANG models that can be applied
      generally to interfaces.  For example, QoS or ACL models that
      reference if:interface can be applied to the sub-interfaces, or
      the sub-interface can be used as an Access Circuit in L2VPN or
      L3VPN models that reference if:interface.

   o  In the sub-interface based configuration model, the classification
      of traffic arriving on an interface to a given sub-interface,
      based on fields in the layer 2 header, is completely independent
      of how the traffic is forwarded.  The sub-interface can be
      referenced (via references to if:interface) by other models that
      specify how traffic is forwarded; thus sub-interfaces can support
      multiple different forwarding paradigms, including but not limited
      to: layer 3 (IPv4/IPv6), layer 2 pseudowires (over MPLS or IP),
      VPLS instances, EVPN instance.

   o  The model is flexible in the scope of the VLAN Identifier space.
      I.e. by default VLAN Ids can be scoped locally to a single
      Ethernet-like trunk interface, but the scope is determined by the
      forwarding paradigm that is used.

A.2.  IEEE 802.1Q Bridge Configuration Model Overview

   The key features of the IEEE 802.1Q bridge configuration model can be
   summarized as:

   o  Each VLAN bridge component has a set of Ethernet interfaces that
      are members of that bridge.  Sub-interfaces are not used, nor
      required in the 802.1Q bridge model.



Wilton, et al.             Expires May 3, 2018                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft           Sub-interface VLAN YANG            October 2017


   o  Within a VLAN bridge component, the VLAN tag in the packet is
      used, along with the destination MAC address, to determine how to
      forward the packet.  Other forwarding paradigms are not supported
      by the 802.1Q model.

   o  Classification of traffic to a VLAN bridge component is based only
      on the Ethernet interface that it arrived on.

   o  VLAN Identifiers are scoped to a VLAN bridge component.  Often
      devices only support a single bridge component and hence VLANs are
      scoped globally within the device.

   o  Feature configuration is specified in the context of the bridge,
      or particular VLANs on a bridge.

A.3.  Possible Overlap Between the Two Models

   Both models can be used for configuring similar basic layer 2
   forwarding topologies.  The 802.1Q bridge configuration model is
   optimised for configuring Virtual LANs that span across enterprises
   and data centers.

   The sub-interface model can also be used for configuring equivalent
   Virtual LAN networks that span across enterprises and data centers,
   but often requires more configuration to be able to configure the
   equivalent constructs to the 802.1Q bridge model.

   The sub-interface model really excels when implementing flexible L2
   and L3 services, where those services may be handled on the same
   physical interface, and where the VLAN Identifier is being solely
   used to identify the customer or service that is being provided
   rather than a Virtual LAN.  The sub-interface model provides more
   flexibility as to how traffic can be classified, how features can be
   applied to traffic streams, and how the traffic is to be forwarded.

   Conversely, the 802.1Q bridge model can also be use to implement L2
   services in some scenarios, but only if the forwarding paradigm being
   used to implement the service is the native Ethernet forwarding
   specified in 802.1Q - other forwarding paradigms such as pseudowires
   or VPLS are not supported.  The 802.1Q bridge model does not
   implement L3 services at all, although this can be partly mitigated
   by using a virtual L3 interface construct that is a separate logical
   Ethernet-like interface which is a member of the bridge.

   In conclusion, it is valid for both of these models to exist since
   they have different deployment scenarios for which they are
   optimized.  Devices may choose which of the models (or both) to
