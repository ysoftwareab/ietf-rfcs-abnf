Internet-Draft         GRE key based IPsec tunnel              June 2008


Abstract

   This document describes the IPsec Tunnel based on GRE key as the
   traffic selector.  When GRE key is used in IP packet transmission
   scenario of the wireless communication.  Several enterprise need
   different security policy when transmit the packet through some
   unguaranteeded Internet cloudy.  This document propose to adopt GRE
   key as the IPsec traffic selector.

Internet-Draft         GRE key based IPsec tunnel              June 2008


1.  Introduction

   GRE key has been used to allocate to encapsulate the traffic between
   two IP access gateways in many ways including the 3GPP [TS23.402].

   Some company have some branch office would like to access from
   wireless Internet communication technologies, and coincidently some
   operator's mobile Internet is mixed together with public Internet, in
   such scenario, they may need different security policy for each
   connections.

   In such scenarios, GRE key as the IPsec traffic selector is proposed.

Internet-Draft         GRE key based IPsec tunnel              June 2008


2.  Network Scenario

   In some wireless communication, some IP mobilty management protocol
   has mandate the IPsec tunnel between different mobility agents.

   Private addressing is common for user address allocation by
   operators.  As shown in Fig. 1, if users from different enterprise
   headquarter (A and B) roaming to the same visited network and the
   same private address is allocated to users, the access router need to
   differentiate data from the users.  In this case GRE key will be used
   to identify the tunnel from different users.

   IPsec can be used to protect the GRE encapsulated packets.  Operator
   can have its own security policy on whether to secure the data for
   users of different operators.  For example, if user is from
   enterprise A, the data will be protected by some security policy.  If
   the user is from enterprise B, the data will be protected
   differently.

   In such case, it is impossible to differentiate packets from
   different users by using current traffic selector defined in IPsec.
   GRE key is necessary to be a traffic selector for Operator to deploy
   the security policy.

3.  GRE key as IPsec traffic selector

   Current IKE/IPsec implementation does not support GRE key as the
   traffic selector.  Extensions for IKE/IPsec is needed to support GRE
   key.
