Abstract

   This document presents an use case which actually happening in our
   network, when window_size_increment in the window update frame less
   than 128 bytes and the increased window size also less than 128
   bytes, then network connection will come to an error.

1.  Introduction

   The following content is from RFC 7540[RFC7540]

   When an HTTP/2 connection is first established, new streams are
   created with an initial flow-control window size of 65,535 octets.
   The connection flow-control window is also 65,535 octets.  Both
   endpoints can adjust the initial window size for new streams by
   including a value for SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE in the SETTINGS
   frame that forms part of the connection preface.  The connection
   flow-control window can only be changed using WINDOW_UPDATE frames.

   SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE (0x4): Indicates the sender's initial
   window size (in octets) for stream-level flow control.  The initial
   value is 2^16-1 (65,535) octets.

   Window Size Increment defined in the Window_update is 31, the legal
   range for the increment to the flow-control window is 1 to 2^31-1
   (2,147,483,647) octets.

   RFC 7540 just Specifies the maximum value of Window and the Window
   Size Increment, But there is no obvious rule about minimum values.

2.  Terminology

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in.

   In addition, this document makes use of the following terms:

   Window_update:  The WINDOW_UPDATE frame (type=0x8) is used to
      implement flow control;

3.  Use Case

   This section describes use case which happens between two different
   manufacturers.  They both use HTTP2.0 protocol to transmit messages.
   We found this phenomenon, one issues a regular registration request,

   the other one receives the request, but judged to be attack
   behaviour.

  Figure 1: A normal request is considered an attack


   Why determine abnormal attack behavior, the analysis is as follows:

   The default initial window size defined by the protocol is 64K.
   After the data in the receiving window is removed, part of the window
   occupied by the original data is released.

   If there is a large backlog of data in the original receiving window
   that has not been removed, resulting in a small remaining window, the
   window added after the normal removal of data will not be too small.
   If there is little backlog of data in the original receiving window,
   the window that needs to be added after the data is removed will be
   small, but the overall available window after the adjustment will be
   larger.  In neither case will the window be too small, So the
   connection considered to be an attack.

   So when need to solve this problem, two approaches can be discussed,
   specifying a minimum value for window and window size increment, or
   increasing more detailed flow control strategies.

4.  Security Considerations

   Failure to set a minimum will result in frequent window_update if
   only process a small amount of data at a time, it is likely to occur
   Denial of service attacks, it would be fatal if it happened in an
   Internet of Things scenario.  In draft-ietf-httpbis-http2bis, there
   are also Denial-of-Service consideration in section 10.5, includes
   the misuse of some parameters and priorities.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
