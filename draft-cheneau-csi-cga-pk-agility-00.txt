Abstract

   This document defines an extension field for the CGA Parameters data
   structure specified in RFC 3972.  This extension field carries a
   Public Key that is used in Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA)
   generation.  This extension enables protocols using CGAs, such as
   SEND, to use multiple Public Key signing algorithms and/or multiple
   Public Keys.

Internet-Draft    Signature Algorithm Agility for CGAs      October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] have been
   designed to provide a binding of an internet address (IPv6) to a
   public key.  A node who claims to own a particular IPv6 address, can
   prove so in the messages (e.g.  ICMP) it sends by using a digital
   signature for authentication and integrity protection.  Since the
   IPv6 address was generated from the public key, verification of the
   respective signature is tantamount to verification of ownership of
   the claimed IPv6 address.

   CGAs [RFC3972] were defined to only use RSA as the associated
   signature algorithm.  Only one RSA public key is associated with a
   CGA and this public key is carried in the Public Key field of the CGA
   Parameters data structure.

   Due to the expected variations in cryptographic ability of IPv6
   nodes, support for signature algorithm agility in CGA is desired.
   However, since the CGA specification [RFC3972] states that SEND
   "SHOULD" use an RSA public/private key pair, backward compatibility
   must be preserved herein.

   A logical place for extending the CGA Parameters data structure to
   include other types of public keys is its "extension fields".  Some
   guidance on the format of these extensions is provided in [RFC4581].
   One type of CGA Parameters data structure extension is defined in
   Section 2 and this type of extension is able to carry public keys, in
   addition to the RSA public key defined in the Public Key field of CGA
   Parameters data structure.

   These extensions support new functionnalities for CGA based
   protocols, such as the Signature Algorithm Agility in SEND
   [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility].

2.  Public Key extension

   This section describes an extension field that conforms to the
   guidelines of [RFC4581].

   This extension allows a CGA Parameters data structure to carry public
   keys in addition to the key in the Public Key field.  This approach
   paves the way for one CGA to possibly be associated with multiple
   public keys.

   This extension allows a node to select a Public Key value that is
   different from the one in the Public Key field of the CGA Parameters
   data structure option.  This Public Key is placed in an extension
   embedded in the Extension field of the CGA Parameters data structure,
   described in [RFC3972].

   Extension Type

      TBA. (16-bit unsigned integer.  See Section 5.)

   Extension Length

      The length of the Public Key field to follow, in octets. 16-bit
      unsigned integer.

   Public Key

      This is a variable-length field containing the public key of the
      sender.  The public key MUST be formatted as a DER-encoded
      [ITU.X690.2002] ASN.1 structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
      defined in the Internet X.509 certificate profile [RFC5280].  When
      RSA is used, the algorithm identifier MUST be rsaEncryption, which
      is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1, and the RSA public key MUST be formatted
      by using the RSAPublicKey type as specified in Section 2.3.1 of

      [RFC3279].  The RSA key length SHOULD be at least 384 bits.

      Section 3 of document [cheneau-csi-ecc-sig-agility] specifies how
      to use ECC Public Key in CGA and defines the format of the Public
      Key field for the Public Key extension.

3.  CGA Generation Process

   When a node supports two or more types of signing algorithms, and is
   able to generate two or more corresponding public keys, then it can
   derive a single CGA using all these keys.  The derivation is done
   exactly as in [RFC3972]; one key is placed in the CGA Parameters data
   structure "Public Key" field while the rest of the keys are placed in
   separate extension fields, as illustrated in Figure 2.  Thus
   generation and verification of CGA as defined in Section 4 and
   Section 5 of [RFC3972] remain unchanged.

   It should be noted that the type of the public key (RSA, ECC, etc.)
   is already encoded into the "Public Key" field itself, and thus there
   is no need to identify the public key type separately.  This is due
   to the fact that the "Public Key" field, according to [RFC3972] is a
   DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of the type "SubjectPublicKeyInfo", and
   therefore includes a subfield called "AlgorithmIdentifier".

           Figure 2: CGA Parameters structure with multiple keys

   Note that an implementation should choose the number of simultaneous
   Public Key Extension fields used so as the total length of the
   extension fields does not exceed a threshold that requires
   fragmentation support at the SEND or other upper-layer protocol.

   Support for RSA Public Keys and signature algorithm is only
   RECOMMENDED for backward compatibility.  This specification does not
   mandate support for any particular public key signature algorithm.
   Therefore, nodes can be configured to choose/support only a single
   additional signature algorithm besides RSA.  However, a node is also
   free to not support RSA and still claim compatibility with this

   specification.

3.1.  Specific usage with SEND

   [RFC3972] recommends the use of RSA keys in the Public Key field when
   using SEND [RFC3971].  A node compatible with [RFC3972] will only
   extract the RSA public key from the Public Key field and ignore the
   extension fields.  Therefore, in order to achieve backward
   compatibility, if a node uses a CGA associated with multiple public
   keys (through the use of the Public Key extension), the following
   procedures are in place: if one of the public keys is of RSA type,
   then that key SHOULD be placed in the Public Key field of the CGA
   Parameters data structure, while the other key(s) SHOULD be placed in
   the Extension field(s).

4.  Security Considerations

   The document specifies a CGA extension field format.  No additional
   vulnerabilities are introduced besides those described in section 7
   of [RFC3972].

   However, it should be noted that the resulting security level of a
   multiple-key CGA, that this document enables to use, is only that of
   the weakest key.  Therefore, when RSA is used, the RSA key length
   SHOULD be the minimum length recommended in Section 3 of [RFC3972] or
   the current minimum recommended by leading standards bodies such as
   NIST.  In this document, we state that every key in use SHOULD have a
   security level matching or exceeding that of a 384-bit RSA key.

   Whenever protocols negotiate signature algorithms, downgrade attacks
   are considered.  This document only provides the ability for CGA
   options to carry multiple public keys; negotiations of signature
   algorithms or public keys are out of the scope of this document.
