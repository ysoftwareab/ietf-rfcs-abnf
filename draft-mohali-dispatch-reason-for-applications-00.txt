Abstract

   This document defines a new protocol value "Application" for the
   Reason Header field and a new IANA Registry for registering
   application types.  This new value enables signaling that a request
   or response has been issued as a result of a decision made by a
   particular type of application or that an initial request has been
   retargeted as a result of an application decision.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft  Reason Header extension for Applications        May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Reason header field [RFC3326] provides a mechanism to signal the
   reason why a SIP request or response was issued or why an initial
   request was retargeted.  This document requests IANA registration of
   a new protocol value "Application" for the Reason Header field and a
   new IANA Registry for registering application types.  This extension
   enables signaling that a request or response has been issued as a
   result of a decision made by a particular type of application or that
   an initial request has been retargeted as a result of an application
   decision (e.g.  Freephone number translation).

1.1.  Problem Statment

   Service interaction is often defined as the situation that arises
   when two features or more, involved in the same call session,
   interact in such a way that one at least exhibits an undesirable
   behavior.  Advanced applications increase the number of issues
   related to services/features interaction.

   To avoid such a situation it is necessary that each application has
   the ability to indicate to subsequently triggered services/
   applications the relevant information:

   1.  Need to convey a list of services/applications having "acted" on
       the call, in order to allow a downstream application to manage
       services interactions (e.g. to decide whether to execute a
       particular feature depending on the call history).

   2.  Need to convey the identity of the application having caused a
       specific number translation and allow the transfer target to
       easily find out the original number that this application had
       received, even in case multiple successive number translations
       occured.

   3.  Need to convey the identity of the application having released
       the call towards an upstream application that can take specific
       decisions.


2.  Reason header field extension

   The syntax of the Reason header field as defined in [RFC3326] is as
   follows:

Internet-Draft  Reason Header extension for Applications        May 2011


  Reason             =  "Reason" HCOLON reason-value *(COMMA reason-value)
   reason-value      =  protocol *(SEMI reason-params)
   protocol          =  "SIP" / "Q.850" / token
   reason-params     =  protocol-cause / reason-text
                      / reason-extension
   protocol-cause    =  "cause" EQUAL cause
   cause             =  1*DIGIT
   reason-text       =  "text" EQUAL quoted-string
   reason-extension  =  generic-param



   This document adds a new protocol value "Application".

   This protocol value can be used anywhere the presence of a Reason
   Header field is allowed.

   When this protocol value is used, the protocol-cause and the reason-
   text fields shall be set to values registered in a new IANA Registry
   for registering application types.

   A unique cause value and reason-text is registered for each new
   reason-value added with protocol value "Application".

   For each new registered value, it has to be defined the following:


   Cause value:  this is an identifier number corresponding to the cause
      value of the protocol-cause parameter in the Reason header field.

   Reason text:  this is a unique string identifying the application
      name.  The reason text is intended to give a short textual
      description of the application.

   Description:  this is a description of the application and the
      conditions under which this reason-value is used.  The description
      shall be sufficiently clear to differentiate the new reason from
      all other existing reasons.


   This document registers protocol causes for the following cases:


      Cause value: 1
      Reason text: Universal Access Number
      Description: A Universal Access Number application has influenced
      processing of the call (e.g. by translating a dialed Universal
      Access number to a routable directory number).

      Cause value: 2
      Reason text: Freephone
      Description: A Freephone application has influenced processing of
      the call (e.g. by translating a dialed Free Phone number to a
      routable directory number).

      Cause value: 3
      Reason text: Premium Rate
      Description: A Premium Rate application has influenced processing
      of the call (e.g. by translating a dialed Premium Rate number to a
      routable directory number).

      Cause value: 4
      Reason text: Directory Enquiry
      Description: A Directory Enquiry application has influenced
      processing of the call (e.g. completion of the call to the
      Directory Number responding to the enquiry).

      Cause value: 5
      Reason text: VPN
      Description: A VPN application has influenced processing of the
      call (e.g. by translating a private number to a routable Directory
      Number).

      Cause value: 6
      Reason text: Credit Card Calling
      Description: A Credit Card Calling application has influenced
      processing of the call (e.g. it has completed the call to a
      directory number dialed in-band by the calling user).

      Cause value: 7
      Reason text: Voice Activated Dialing
      Description: A Voice-Activated Dialing application has influenced
      processing of the call (e.g. it has retargeted the call to a
      directory number determined by speech recognition).

      Cause value: 8
      Reason text: Customized Call Routing
      Description: An Customized Call Routing application has influenced
      processing of the call (e.g. by translating a dialed number into a
      routable directory number based on customized criteria such as
      time of day or caller's location).

      Cause value: 9
      Reason text: Prepaid
      Description: A Prepaid application has influenced processing of
      the call (e.g. it has requested that the call be released due to
      exhaustion of credit available on the user account).

3.  Use Cases

   The following text provides two examples illustrating when this new
   class of Reason values could be used.  The first example describes a
   use in a SIP request and the second example describes a situation
   when the Reason header is used in a SIP request as a parameter of the
   History-Info header [RFC4244].

3.1.  Reason header field in a SIP request

   This section presents the case where an application inserts the
   Reason header in a BYE request to signal that a call is cleared due
   to a failure caused by this particular application:

   A served user having a prepaid calling card wants to call a friend.
   First, the served user joins the Prepaid application where it gets
   authenticated.  Then, the user dials a number corresponding to an
   international destination.  Unfortunately, the user has not enough
   credits left on his card and at some point in time the Prepaid
   application ends the call by sending a BYE method with a Reason
   header set as follows:

   Reason: application ;cause=9 ;text="Prepaid",

   SIP ;cause=402; text="Payment Required"

   Note: [RFC3326] states that a SIP message MAY contain more than one
   Reason value (i.e., multiple Reason lines), but all of them MUST have
   different protocol values and an implementation is free to ignore
   Reason values that it does not understand.

3.2.   header field in a SIP History-Info header field

   [RFC4244] defines a SIP header field, History-Info, to provide a
   standard mechanism for capturing requests history information.

   The History-Info header field allows receiving applications to
   determine hints about how and why the call arrived at the
   application/user.  The History-Info header field can contain optional
   reason information by including the Reason header field[RFC3326] as a
   SIP or SIPs URI component in the hi-targeted-to-uri parameter.

   The History-Info header field can be added by proxies and other SIP
   intermediaries when requests are retargeted.  Retargeting could be
   due to a failure or redirection responses but also to normal
   forwarding of requests.  When the call is retargeted as a result of
   receiving a SIP response (e.g. 3XX response), the Reason Header
   contains the received SIP status code.  When the call is retargeted

Internet-Draft  Reason Header extension for Applications        May 2011


   as a result of an application decision (e.g.  Freephone service), the
   extension of the Reason header defined in this document allows to
   convey the identification of this application in the signaling.  This
   might help other applications invoked downstream to take appropriate
   decisions to avoid undesired service interactions.

   The following example illustrates this last case where the Reason
   header is set due to retargeting by a Freephone service running in a
   SIP Application Server.


   Reason: application ;cause=2 ;text="Freephone"


   More specifically, in such a case, the Reason header would appear in
   a History-Info header as described in [RFC4244] and illustrated
   below:

   Alice calls the Company dialing a Freephone service number.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds to one existing IANA Registry and creates one new
   namespace Registry according to Section 27 of [RFC3261].


   The existing IANA Registry for the SIP Reason Header is as follows:

      Protocol Value   Protocol Cause            Reference
      --------------   --------------            ---------
      SIP              Status code               RFC 3261
      Q.850            Cause value in decimal    ITU-T Q.850
      Preemption       Cause value in decimal*   RFC 4411

   This document adds to that Registry with the following entry:

      Protocol Value   Protocol Cause            Reference
      --------------   --------------            ---------
      Application      Cause value in decimal    [RFCXXXX]


   Below is a new IANA Registry for initial values of reason-params
   fields (protocol-cause and reason-text) associated with the protocol
   value "Application".  Per [RFC3326], the reason-text string is a
   quoted default string with only human understandability meant.  These
   strings can be changed by local policy.

   The following cause values and associated reason text are defined:

                   Reason-
      Protocol     param      Reason-text                Reference
      --------     -------    ------------               ---------
      Application  Cause=1    Universal Access Number    [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=2    Freephone                  [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=3    Premium Rate               [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=4    Directory Enquiry          [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=5    VPN                        [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=6    Credit Card Calling        [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=7    Voice Activated Dialing    [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=8    Customized Call Routing    [RFCXXXX]
      Application  Cause=9    Prepaid                    [RFCXXXX]



   Note to the RFC-Editor: RFCXXXX should be replaced by this RFC
   reference when available.

   The cause values created by the Application Protocol namespace in

Internet-Draft  Reason Header extension for Applications        May 2011


   this document are described in Section 2.  Each cause value has a
   reason-text string and a detailed description of what the cause value
   is for.  Section 3 provides an example for the above cause codes with
   a message flow diagram.

   The above cause values are included in this Application namespace
   registry.

   Note: The cause number MAY either be requested by the requester or,
   if not requested, assigned by IANA.


   Public and Private values:

   o  The process for registering a public reason is deemed to be
      "specification required" as per [RFC5226].  Each new public reason
      value will be compared against existing work to see that it does
      not duplicate existing values.

   o  The process for registering a private reason is deemed to be
      "First Come First Served" as per [RFC5226].  A specification is
      not required but is encouraged.



   Cause values range:

   o  Public cause values MUST be given in the range 0x0001-0x7fff.

   o  Private cause values MUST be given in the range 0x8000-0xffff.

   o  Cause value 0 is reserved.


5.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not add any security constraint beyond the
   security considerations for the Reason header field described in
   [RFC3326] apply.
