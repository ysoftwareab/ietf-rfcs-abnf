Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols (PIM-SM and BIDIR-
   PIM).  This document obsoletes RFC 2934.

Internet-Draft                   PIM MIB                      April 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols (PIM-SM [I-D.ietf-pim-
   sm-v2-new] and BIDIR-PIM [I-D.ietf-pim-bidir]).

   This document obsoletes RFC 2934 [RFC2934].  RFC 2934 defined an
   experimental MIB module for managing the PIM protocols.  The MIB
   module defined by this document is a complete re-working of the MIB
   module from RFC 2934, with major changes that include the following.

   o  This MIB module is independent of IP version, whereas RFC 2934
      only supported IPv4.

   o  This MIB module includes support for managing BIDIR-PIM.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-DM.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-SM v1.

   o  This MIB module does not depend on the IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB
      defined in RFC 2932 [RFC2932].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains the following tables.

Internet-Draft                   PIM MIB                      April 2005


   1.  The PIM Interface Table, which contains one row per IP version
       for each interface of the router which is running PIM.

   2.  The PIM Neighbor Table, which contains one row for each of the
       router's PIM neighbors.

   3.  The PIM Neighbor Secondary Address Table, which contains one row
       for each secondary address advertised by each of the router's PIM
       neighbors.

   4.  The PIM Multicast Route Table, which contains one row for each
       multicast routing entry created by PIM.

   5.  The PIM Next Hop Table, which contains one row for each outgoing
       interface list entry in the multicast routing table whose
       interface is running PIM.

   6.  The PIM Bidir DF-Election Table, which contains one row per
       interface for each Rendezvous Point (RP) for which Bidirectional-
       PIM Designated Forwarder (DF) election state is maintained.

   7.  The PIM RP-Set Table, which contains information about all the
       available Rendezvous Points for IP multicast group addresses with
       particular address prefixes.

   8.  The PIM Candidate-RP Table, which contains the IP multicast group
       prefixes for which the local router is to advertise itself as a
       Candidate-RP.

   9.  The PIM Scope Zone Table, which contains one row for each of the
       admin scoped zones in the PIM domain to which the router is
       connected.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863] and the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TODO.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TODO.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-STD-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the PIM-STD-MIB module specified
   in this document.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is based on the original work in RFC 2934 [RFC2934]
   by K. McCloghrie, D. Farinacci, D. Thaler and W. Fenner and has been
   updated based on feedback from the IETF's Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) Working Group.

   Jonathan Nicholas was the editor of early versions of this document.
