                       BGP Path Record Attribute
                       draft-raszuk-idr-bgp-pr-00

Abstract

   BGP protocol today contains number of build in mechanisms which
   record critical for its loop free operation data along the path of
   BGP message propagation.  Those are encoded in AS_PATH, CLUSTER_LIST
   or ORIGINATOR_ID attributes.  However in the same time there is no
   provisioning to record other useful information along the path which
   can be helpful to the operator in order to enhance end to end
   visibility of BGP control plane.

   In order to solve this problem this document proposes a new single
   BGP attribute designed as an generic and extensible container to
   carry number of new optional information corresponding to the BGP
   speakers given BGP advertisement (or withdraw) message traverses.

1.  Introduction

   Ability to record various information from the mid points given
   control plane packets traverses seems as a useful tool in number of
   control plane protocols in use today.  For some protocols such
   information is critical and mandatory for correct operation while in
   other cases can be used as a set of data for further processing on or
   offline.

   Recently there have been two proposals discussing need to carry
   opaque to BGP operation data in the two new BGP Attributes proposed
   for such purposes.  As it seems that there can be much more types of
   such data it seems much more efficient to define a single TLV based
   placeholder to carry all optional hop parameters along the path given
   BGP prefix traverses in the network.

   To facilitate such transport this document proposed a definition of
   new BGP Attribute called BGP Path Record Attribute which can be used
   to to carry such new optional information.

   Furthermore the new attribute next to set of predefined types of data
   to be carried can also accommodate local to the particular autonomous
   system set of information to be added at each hop per operator's
   local configuration at given set of BGP speakers in the control plane
   path.

2.  Protocol Extensions

   This document describes a new BGP attribute known as BGP Path Record
   Attribute, along with definition of new TLV and number of sub-TLVs
   which can be used to carry new type of information either defined
   below in this document or already identified in other IETF proposals
   which are included here for illustration purposes only.

   The TLV is defined for both easy extensibility of other then BGP
   speaker related data which may be attached to the advertisements, but
   also due to the fact that such grouped information will be added by
   each capable and participating BGP node as one entity.  The TLVs are
   appended by each participating BGP speaker in the ordered fashion.
   When storing BGP Path Record attribute the TLVs which it contained
   upon reception from peer MUST not be reordered.

   The sub-TLVs on the other hand allow for very easy definition of new
   types of data which may be required to be carried both within this
   document as well as by new subsequent documents.

2.1.  BGP Path Record Attribute

   The BGP Path Record attribute is a new BGP optional transitive
   attribute.  The attribute type code for the Path Record attribute is
   to be assigned by IANA.  The value field of the Path Record attribute
   is defined as a set of one or more Path Record TLVs along with their
   sub-TLVs.

3.  Operation

   The proposed new BGP Path Record attribute is an opaque entity for
   BGP operation and as such there is no requirement for any direct
   modification to BGP operation or BGP state machine based on the
   information it contains.  It is expected that such feedback loop will
   be performed by operator either by automated or manual process.

   Operator should be able to allow or deny origination of BGP Path
   Record attribute or insertion of any TLV or sub-TLV into BGP UPDATE
   message.  It is however recommended that given BGP implementation

   adds available sub-TLVs to BGP Hop TLV when particular prefix has
   been received with BGP Path Record Attribute already containing such
   sub-TLVs.

   BGP policy should be enhanced to allow for easy filtering of BGP Path
   Record attribute both on egress as well as ingress eBGP sessions.

   BGP Path Record attribute can be used within any AFI/SAFI.

4.  Deployment considerations

   It needs to be recognized that some sub-TLVs of BGP Hop TLV of BGP
   Path Record attribute can break update packing.  Therefor it is
   strongly recommended that sub-TLVs type 2, 4, 7 as defined above are
   to be used only for specific beacon prefixes injected into BGP
   control plane by operator and flagged with the "B" bit within the
   originating BGP Hop TLV.

   Beacon prefixes due to the store-and-forward nature of P2MP BGP
   distribution for information correctness should be carefully injected
   and withdrawn from entire network before subsequent injection is to
   take place again.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP attribute known as a BGP Path Record
   Attribute.  The code point for a new BGP Path Record attribute has to
   be assigned by IANA from the BGP Path Attributes registry.

   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "BGP Path Record Attribute TLV types".  The reserved pool of
   0x0000-0xFFFF has been defined for its allocations.  The allocations
   policy is on a first come first served basis.  The recommended
   allocation of 0x0001 is to be allocated for BGP Hop TLV.

   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "BGP Hop sub-TLV types".  The reserved pool of 0x0000-0xFFFF
   has been defined for its allocations.  The allocations policy is on a
   first come first served basis.  The recommended allocation of first 7
   sub-TLVs are indicated in section 2.2 titled: BGP Hop TLV.

6.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.
