1  Introduction

   Currently, ISIS doesn't have any mechanism that provides
   confidentiality for its data sent across the network. Authentication
   mechanisms can only authenticate routers and cannot avoid replay
   attacks. Further checksums and Authentications in LSPs don't include
   "Remaining Lifetime field" in its calculations and hence, are prone
   to replay attacks that can exploit this behavior (Lifetime field
   could be modified and replayed). Hence, it is possible for an
   attacker to snoop the ISIS packets and replay it with modifications
   to affect the overall functioning of the protocol in the network.

   The IETF Draft ([I-D.chunduri-isis-extended-sequence-no-tlv])
   proposes the use of optional sequence number TLVs. Although it
   provides a way to counter replay attacks, no mechanism is available
   to maintain the data confidentiality of the packets. 

   Hence, its possible for the intruders to initiate LSPs with zero
   "Remaining Lifetime field" and thereby causing the LSPs to purge in
   the network. The Target Router may retransmit the LSP with higher
   sequence numbers but this could again be compromised by the attacker.
   This continuous LSP re-transmissions and purges could cause flood the
   network creating a havoc and may also cause the sequence number of
   all the LSPs to increase fast. If the sequence number increases to
   the maximum (0xFFFFFFFF), the IS-IS process must shut down for around
   20 minutes (the product of MaxAge +ZeroAgeLifetime) to allow the old
   LSPs to age out of all the router databases.

INTERNET DRAFT       Data Confidentiality in IS-IS     November 12, 2014


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Fields for Encryption

   The "Remaining Life Time" field is generally not included in the
   Checksum calculations and Authentications and hence remains the most
   vulnerable field in LSP packet. Any changes made to the rest of the
   packet can be identified during evaluation at receiving systems. 

   Proposal is to encrypt the key parameters in ISIS packets so as to
   increase the confidentiality of data exchanged. Practically, the
   entire PDU could be encrypted. But the most important part here is to
   maintain the confidentiality and also reduce the processing overload
   as much as possible at the Intermediate Systems. Since sequence
   numbers play a major role in finding out duplicate packets, it is
   more logical to encrypt the sequence numbers in the packets. Hence
   this reduces the probability of intruder to easily deduce the overall
   flow of packets.

   Hence the combination of proposed data confidentiality mechanism with
   Authentications will help to improve the overall security of data
   exchanged in network.

3  Implementation and Backward Compatibility

   For maintaining backward compatibility of legacy systems, the use of
   proposed sequence Number TLVs ([I-D. chunduri-isis-extended-sequence-
   no-tlv]) could be more useful since only the systems implementing
   this mechanism may process this TLV and other systems may neglect it
   thereby maintaining backward compatibility with legacy systems and
   help in easier deployment. Encryption could be carried out for the
   Packet Sequence Number (PSN) alone or for the Extended Session
   Sequence Number (ESSN) too (as referred in the [I-D. chunduri-isis-
   extended-sequence-no-tlv]). 

4  Other considerations 

   The keying mechanisms to be followed is out of scope for this draft
   and implementation specific. The focus of this draft is only to
   introduce a way to maintain the data confidentiality in ISIS LSPs and
   avoid possible replay attacks.
