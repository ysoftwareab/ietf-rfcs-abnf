<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This paper describes a simple distance vector protocol that exposes only a default route
towards the infrastructure in a nested NEMO configuration.
The draft extends the <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>Neighbor Discovery Protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4861]
in order to carry information and metrics which will help a Mobile Router select its
Attachment Router(s) in an autonomous fashion and provides generic rules which
guarantee that the interaction of different selection processes will not create loops.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
   As per <a class='info' href='#RFC3963'>Nemo Basic support<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V., Wakikawa, R., Petrescu, A., and P. Thubert, &ldquo;Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3963],
   a Mobile Router autoconfigures a single
   Care of Address (CoA)
 to register to its Home Agent and terminate its Mobile Router-Home Agent
   tunnel. That Care of Address is the Mobile Router point of
   attachment to the nested Nemo.

</p>
<p>
     Consequently, if loops are avoided, the nested Nemo assumes the
     shape of a tree. The nodes of the tree are Mobile Routers, the root is
     either a fixed or a Mobile Router, called in the latter case the
     root Mobile Router in
     <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nemo-terminology'>NEMO terminology<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ernst, T. and H. Lach, &ldquo;Network Mobility Support Terminology,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nemo&#8209;terminology].
     The leaves are mobile or fixed hosts, called Local Fixed Nodes,
     Local Mobile Nodes and Visiting Mobile Nodes in the NEMO terminology.

</p>
<p>
     This paper provides (1) a minimum extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
     Router Advertisements in order to ensure that Mobile Routers
     attaching to one another actually avoid loops and end up
     forming a tree, and (2) the minimum common part of all Mobile Router algorithms
     that is required to ensure that whatever their specific decisions,
     loops between Mobile Routers will be avoided.

</p>
<p>
     The method is based on an autonomous decision by each Mobile Router with
     no global state convergence such as a MANET proactive routing protocol.
     In fact, Mobile Routers may make different decisions from a same input,
     based on their own configuration and their own algorithms.

</p>
<p>
     In order to build trees of Mobile Routers, we propose an
     extension to the ICMP Router Advertisement (RA) message, the Tree
     Information Option (TIO). The TIO allows Mobile Routers to advertise the
     tree they belong to, and to select and move to the best
     location within the available trees. Mobile Routers propagate the TIO in RA down
     the tree, updating some metrics such as the tree depth, leaving
     alone root information such as the tree identifier, and sending
     the result in RAs over the ingress interfaces.

<dt>Nemo clusterhead:</dt>
<dd>
	    The root of a tree of mobile routers. When the tree of
            Mobile Routers is attached to the infrastructure, the
            fixed Access Router may act as cluster head if it supports
            the Tree Information Option described in this document. If
            it does not, then the clusterhead coincides with the root
            Mobile Router in NEMO terminology. A clusterhead is elected even when
            the tree is not attached to the infrastructure. A
            stand-alone Mobile Router is a clusterhead.
     
</dd>

<dd>
	    A Nested Nemo whose clusterhead is attached to the

</dd>
<dt>Propagation:</dt>
<dd>
	    The action by a Mobile Router that consists in receiving a
	    Router Advertisement Tree Information Option from its Attachment Router, recomputing a few

	    the resulting TIO to RAs sent over the ingress interfaces.

Multi-Homed nested mobile network</h3>

<p>

A nested mobile network that is made of multiple Mobile Routers having a direct
connection to the Internet is said to be multi-homed. Multihoming in Nemo
offers useful properties to Mobile Network Nodes. The <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nemo-multihoming-issues'>NEMO multihoming issues<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ng, C., &ldquo;Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nemo&#8209;multihoming&#8209;issues] draft lists potential
multi-homed configurations for Nemo and explains the different problems
and advantages that some configurations may introduce. Multihoming
offers three main abilities to the Nemo: it allows route recovery on
failure, redundancy and load-sharing between Mobile Routers (or between
interfaces of a given Mobile Router).
However, for the moment, there is no requirements nor
protocol that would define in interaction between
several egress interfaces inside a Nemo.


</p>
<p>

In a nested Nemo, the hierarchy of Mobile Routers increases the complexity of the
route and/or router selection for Mobile Network Nodes. Each level of a Nemo implies
the usage of a new tunnel between the Mobile Router and its home agent. Thus if a
Mobile Network Node connects to a sub-Nemo which is also a sub-Nemo, packets from the
Mobile Network Node will be encapsulated three times.


</p>
<p>

When the Nemo where the MN is connected to is multi-homed, the MN may
have the choice between several Attachment Router to be its default router. 
Reference <a class='info' href='#RFC4191'>[RFC4191]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R. and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> introduces
new options in Router Advertisement to allow any node on a link to
choose between several routers. This option mainly consists of a
2-bits flag that indicates the preference of the router (low, medium
or high). Furthermore, the same flag can be set in the Route
Information option indicating the preference of a specific
prefix. Therefore, any node can determine its best default router(s)
according to a given destination and its best router for default,
which will be used by default.


</p>
<p>

However this preference is only useful in a flat topology; It gives a
way to the node to choose between different attachment routers advertising
prefixes on the node link. But if the node is inside a hierarchical
topology the node can not learn the depth of each attachment router, and
might not select the most efficient path. In particular, there is a need for 
Uniform Path Metric that accounts for a multihop wireless path.


</p>
<p>

One of the usage of the new option introduced in this document is to
distribute information on the hierarchy of Mobile Routers. 
This information can be distributed to Attachment Routers, Mobile Routers 
and Mobile Network Nodes as well in order to allow better
route selection and to increase the knowledge of the Nemo
topology on each node.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Loops in nested Nemo</h3>

<p>

When several Mobile Routers attach to each other to form a nested Nemo,
loops can be created if they are not explicitly avoided.

In the simplest case, when egress and ingress interfaces of A Mobile Router are
all wireless, a mobile router may be listening to
Router Advertisement from its own ingress interface,
creating a confliction problem.

In the general case, arbitrary attachment of Mobile Routers will form graphs that
are not exempt of loops. For instance:

Assume a nested Nemo where Mobile Router1 is connected to the
infrastructure, and Mobile Router3 is attached to Mobile Router2. Say that
Mobile Router2 can hear both Mobile Router3 and
Mobile Router1 over its wireless egress interface. If Mobile Router2 select Mobile Router1, the
connectivity to the infrastructure is provided for all. But if Mobile Router2
selects Mobile Router3, Mobile Router2 and Mobile Router3 end up forming a loop and are disconnected from
their Home Agents.


</p>
<p>
With Nemo basic support, a Mobile Router uses a single primary Care Of Address to attach to the
nested structure. As a result, if loops are avoided, the nested NEMO
end up forming a tree. It is beneficial to be able to form that tree
in an optimum fashion for a given set of metrics such as tree
depth.


</p>
<p>
The shape of a nested Nemo may change rapidly due to Mobile Routers movement.
It is thus impractical
to expect each Mobile Router to be able to maintain states about the whole tree
structure in a link state fashion. On the contrary,
it is also beneficial to allow each Mobile Router to make its own
independent selection based on a minimum information about its
immediate neighbors, in order to reestablish the tree quickly upon erratic
movements.


</p>
<p>

Each Mobile Router should be able to make its own attachment router selection
based on its own condition (eg battery level), its own set of
constraints that may not apply to other Mobile Routers in the
tree, and in general its own algorithm. As a result, the
standardization effort should concentrate on a common minimum set of
rules that must be common to all Mobile Routers in order to prevent routing loops
in the nested NEMO while leaving Mobile Routers independent in their Attachment Router
selection algorithms.

<dt>Length:</dt>
<dd>
      8-bit unsigned integer set to 4 when there is no suboption.
      The length of the option (including the type and length fields
      and the suboptions) in units of 8 octets.

</dd>
<dt>Grounded (G):</dt>
<dd>

The Grounded (G) flag is set when the clusterhead is attached to a fixed
network infrastructure (such as the Internet).


</dd>
<dt>Home (H):</dt>
<dd>
The Home (H) flag is set when the Mobile Router is bound to its home
network over NEMO. With NEMO Basic Support,a MR that is not bound Home
cuts off its visitors from the Internet as well. This can be solved by
techniques such as Reverse Routing Header <a class='info' href='#I-D.thubert-nemo-reverse-routing-header'>[I&#8209;D.thubert&#8209;nemo&#8209;reverse&#8209;routing&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Thubert, P. and M.

</dd>
<dt>Battery (B):</dt>
<dd>

The Battery (B) flag is indicates that a parent in the tree operates on batteries, an indication of a costly operation.
It is set by a mobile router which operates on battery and when set,
it is left set as it is propagated down the tree.


</dd>
<dt>Reserved:</dt>
<dd>

5-bit unsigned integer set to 0 by the clusterhead.


</dd>
<dt>Sequence Number:</dt>
<dd>

8-bit unsigned integer set by the clusterhead and incremented with each new TIO it sends on a link and
propagated with no change down the tree.


</dd>
<dt>TreePreference:</dt>
<dd>

8-bit unsigned integer set by the clusterhead to its preference and unchanged
at propagation. Default is 0 (lowest preference). The tree preference provides a mechanism to engineer
the mesh of mobile routers, for instance indicating the most preferred home gateway or the communication
ship in a fleet at sea.


</dd>
<dt>BootTimeRandom:</dt>
<dd>

A random value computed at boot time and recomputed in case
of a duplication with another Attachment Router. The concatenation of the Preference
and the BootTimeRandom is a 32-bit extended preference that is used to
resolve collisions.
It is set by each Mobile Router at propagation time.


</dd>
<dt>Preference:</dt>
<dd>

The administrative preference of that (mobile) Access Router.
Default is 0. 255 is the highest possible preference.
Set by each Mobile Router at propagation time.


</dd>
<dt>TreeDepth:</dt>
<dd>

8-bit unsigned integer.
The tree depth of the clusterhead is 0 if it is a fixed router
	and 1 if it is a Mobile Router. The tree Depth of a tree Node is
	the depth of its attachment router as received in a TIO,
	incremented by at least one. All nodes in the tree advertise their tree
	depth in the Tree Information Options that they append to the RA
	messages over their ingress interfaces as part of the propagation
	process.

</dd>
<dt>TreeDelay:</dt>
<dd>

16-bit unsigned integer set by the clusterhead indicating the delay before
changing the tree configuration, in milliseconds. A default value is 128ms.
It is expected to be an order of magnitude smaller than the
RA-interval so if the clusterhead has a sub-second RA-interval, the
Tree delay may be shorter than 100ms. It is also expected to be an order
of magnitude longer than the typical propagation delay inside the nested Nemo.


</dd>
<dt>PathDigest:</dt>
<dd>

32-bit unsigned integer CRC, updated by each Mobile Router. This is the result of
a CRC-32c computation on a bit string obtained by appending the
received value and the Mobile Router Care of Address. clusterheads use a 'previous value'
of zeroes to initially set the PathDigest.


</dd>
<dt>TreeID:</dt>
<dd>

128-bit unsigned integer which uniquely identify a tree. This value is set by the
clusterhead. The global IPv6 home address of the clusterhead can be used.


</dd>

Path Free Medium Time Suboption</h3>

<p>
   This suboption carries the Free Medium Time available up the tree via a specific parent at a given point of time.
   It is an indication of whether bandwidth is available to place VoIP calls for instance.

   As defined by the Quality of Service (QoS) Task Group of the Wi-Fi Alliance, the
   Medium Time describes the amount of time admitted to access the medium, in units of 32 microsecond periods per second.

</p>
<p>
   The Free Medium Time is the amount of time left the medium, in other words ((1000000/32) - SIGMA(MT)).
   The Path Free Medium Time is the lowest available Free Medium Time along the way and it reflects the actual use of those links in run time.

   The Path Free Medium Time suboption does not have any alignment requirements. Its format
   is as follows:

Tree Discovery</h3>

<p>
	Tree Discovery is a form of distance vector protocol for use in wireless mesh networks.
	TD locates the nearest exit and forms a Directed Acyclic Graphs towards that exit, usually a tree.
	TD enables Mobile Routers to implement different policies for selecting their preferred parent
	in the Tree by introducing the concept of plug-in, and does not specify the plug-in operation. 
	Rather, TD specifies a set of rules to be implemented by all plug-ins to ensure interoperation.
	TD also standardizes the format that is used to advertize the most common information that is
	used by the plug-ins in order to perform the parent selection.

</p>
<p>
	One of these information, the tree depth, is used by Tree Discovery to provide loop avoidance 
	between plug-ins even if they implement different policies, and even if these policies do 
	not use the depth as a routing metric. For instance, 
	a MR might use the Uniform Path Metric to select the nearest exit and the best parent from 
	the standpoint of that metric. Once attached to that parent, the MR exposes a depth which is 
	incremented from the parent's depth, and that depth provides a comparable basis with routers
	which would not use UPM at all. 

</p>
<p>
    In order organize and maintain loopless structure, the selection plug-ins in the Mobile Routers 
	MUST obey to the following rules and definitions:

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
      A Mobile Router that is not attached to an Attachment Router is the Nemo clusterhead of
      its own floating tree. It's depth is 1. A Mobile Router will end up in that situation when
      it looses its current parent and there is no alternate parent that it can attach to.
      In that case, the MR SHOULD remember the treeID and the sequence counter in the TIO of the lost parent
      for a period of time which covers multiple TIO.


</li>
<li>
      A Mobile Router that is attached to an Attachment Router that does not support TIO,
      is the clusterhead of its own grounded tree. It's depth is 1.

</li>
<li>
     A router sending a RA without TIO is considered a grounded Attachment Router at
     depth 0.

</li>
<li>
      The Nemo clusterhead of a tree exposes the tree in the Router Advertisement
      Tree Information Option and Mobile Routers
      propagate the TIO down the tree with the RAs that they forward
      over their ingress links.

</li>
<li>
      A Mobile Router that is already part of a tree MAY move at any time and
      with no delay in order to be as close or closer to the clusterhead of its
      current tree - i.e. as long as that does not augment its own tree depth.
      But A Mobile Router MUST NOT move down the tree that it is attached
      to. Mobile Routers MUST ignore RAs that are received from other routers
      located at the same depth or deeper within the same tree.


</li>
<li>
      A Mobile Router may move from its current tree into any different tree at
      any time and whatever the depth it reaches in the new tree,
      but it may have to wait for a Tree Hop timer to elapse in order
      to do so.
      A MR SHOULD NOT join a previous tree (identified by its treeID) unless the
      sequence number in the TIO was incremented since the MR left that tree,
      indicating that the candidate parent was not attached behind this MR and
      kept getting subsequent TIOs from the same tree.
      The Mobile Router MAY join that other tree if it is more preferable for
      reasons of connectivity, configured preference, free Medium Time, size, security,
      bandwidth, tree depth, or whatever metrics the Mobile Router cares to use.

</li>
<li>   If a Mobile Router has selected a new attachment router but has not moved
      yet (because it is waiting for Tree Hop timer to elapse), the
      Mobile Router is unstable and refrains from sending Router Advertisement - Tree Information Options.


</li>
<li>
      When A Mobile Router joins a tree, moves within its tree, or when it
      receives a modified TIO from its current attachment router, the Mobile Router
      sends an unsolicited Router Advertisement message on all its
      mobile networks (i.e. all its ingress interfaces).
      The RA contains a TIO that propagates the new tree information.
      At the same time, the Mobile Router MAY send a Binding Update to its home
      agent or a local proxy of some sort, because the tree it is
      attached to has changed. If the Mobile Router fails to reach its Home Agent, it
      MAY attempt to roll back the movement or to retry the Home Agent
      discovery procedure.

</li>
<li>
     This allows the new higher parts of the tree to take place first
          eventually dragging their sub-tree with them, and allowing
     stepped sub-tree reconfigurations, limiting relative movements.

tree selection</h3>

<p>
      The tree selection is implementation and algorithm dependent. In
      order to limit erratic movements, and all metrics being equal,
      Mobile Routers SHOULD stick to their previous selection. Also, Mobile Routers SHOULD
      provide a mean to filter out candidate Attachment Routers whose availability is
      detected as fluctuating, at least when more stable choices are
      available.
      For instance, the Mobile Router MAY place the failed Attachment Router in a Hold Down
      mode that ensures that the Attachment Router will not be reused for a given
      period of time.

</p>
<p>
     The known trees are associated with the Attachment Router that advertises them
     and kept in a list by extending the Default Router List. DRL entries
     are extended to store the information received from the last TIO.
     These entries are managed by states and timers described in the next
     section.

</p>
<p>
     When connection to a fixed network is not possible or preferable
     for security or other reasons, scattered trees should aggregate
     as much as possible into larger trees in order to allow inner connectivity.
     How to balance these trees is implementation dependent, and MAY
     use a specific visitor-counter suboption in the TIO.

</p>
<p>  A Mobile Router SHOULD verify that bidirectional connectivity is available with a candidate Attachment
     Router before it attaches to that candidate. Some layer 2 such as 802.11 infrastructure mode will provide
     for this, while others such as 802.11 adhoc mode will not. If the layer 2 does not guarantee the
     bidirectional connectivity, then the MR needs to make sure that it can reach the AR. This can be achieved
     using Neighbor Sollicitation and refraining from attaching to an AR for which no neighbor cache exists,
     or the state is still INCOMPLETE.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Sub-tree mobility</h3>

<p>   It might be perceived as beneficial for a sub-tree to move as a whole.
      The way it would work is for a Mobile Router to stay clusterhead even if itself is
      attached into a parent tree. But the loop avoidance is based on the
      knowledge of the tree that the Mobile Router visit, preventing a Mobile Router to move down a same
      tree. So without additional support, tree-level loops could form.

</p>
<p>   To avoid this, it is possible to add a path vector suboption to the TIO
      that reflects the nesting of trees. If a root-Mobile Router joins a parent tree, then
      it needs to add its treeID to the path vector, but it can not join if the treeID
      is already listed.

</p>
<p>   A specific case is the root-Mobile Router of a tree that attaches to a fixed Access Router.
      That root-Mobile Router might omit to consider a TIO that comes from the new Attachment Router and
      decide to stay root, in order to keep the tree consistency from the nested
      Mobile Routers standpoint. This does not create loops, even if the path vector is not present

Administrative depth</h3>

<p>
When the tree is formed under a common administration, or when a Mobile Router performs a certain role
within a community, it might be beneficial to associate a range of acceptable depth with that MR. For instance,
a MR that has limited battery should be a leaf unless there is no other choice, and thus expose an exagerated
depth. On the other hane, a MR that is designed for backhaul should operate in a low range of depth.

</p>
<p>
With Tree Discovery, a MR has to expose a depth that is incremented from its parent's depth as receive in the TIO.
In particular, a MR might expose a depth which is incremented by more than one from its parent's depth,
in order to fit in its own administrative range. So a depth of N does not mean that there is precisely N Mobile Routers
on the way, but at most N.

Held-Up</h3>

<p> This state is managed by the tree Hop timer, it serves 2 purposes:
     </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
         Delay the reattachment of a sub-tree that has been forced
         to detach. This is not as safe as the use of the sequence but still covers that when a sub-tree has
         detached, the Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option that is initiated by the new clusterhead
         has spread down the sub-tree so that two different trees have formed.
     
</p>
<p>
         Limit Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option storms when two trees collide. The idea is that
         between the nodes from tree A that wish to move to tree B,
         those that see the highest place in tree B will move first
         and advertise their new locations before other nodes from
         tree A actually move.
     
</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
      A new tree is discovered upon a router advertisement message
      with or without a Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option. The Mobile Router joins the tree by selecting the
      source of the RA message as its attachment router (default gateway)
      and propagating the TIO accordingly.

</p>
<p>
      When a new tree is discovered, the candidate Attachment Router that advertises the
      new tree is placed in a held up state for the duration of a Tree Hop
      timer. If the new Attachment Router is more preferable than the current one, the
      Mobile Router expects to jump and becomes unstable.

</p>
<p>
      A Mobile Router that is unstable may discover other Attachment Routers from the same new tree
      during the instability phase. It needs to start a new Tree Hop timer
      for all these. The first timer that elapses for a given new tree
      clears them all for that tree, allowing
      the Mobile Router to jump to the highest position available in the new tree. 

</p>
<p>
     The duration of the Tree Hop timer depends on the tree delay of
     the new tree and on the depth of Attachment Router that triggers it:
     
<p>
         (AR's depth + random) * AR's tree_delay (where 0 &lt;= random &lt; 1).
     
</p>
     It is randomized in order to limit collisions and synchronizations.

Held-Down</h3>

<p>
      When a router is 'removed' from the Default Router List, it is

      prevent flapping. This happens when an Attachment Router disappears (upon
      expiration timer), and when an Attachment Router is tried but can not reach the
      Home Agent (upon expiration of another Attachment Router, or upon tree hop for that
      Attachment Router).

</p>

     An Attachment Router that is held down is not considered for the

Collision</h3>

<p>
      A race condition occurs if 2 Mobile Routers send Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option at the same time and
      wish to join each other. This might happen between routers at a same depth, or routers which act as
      clusterhead of their own tree. In order to detect the situation, Mobile Routers
      time stamp the sending of Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option.
      Any Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option received within a
      short media-dependant period introduces a risk. To divide the
      risk, A 32bits extended preference is added in the TIO. The
      first byte is the clusterhead (tree) preference, the remaining 24 bits is a  boot time computed random.

</p>
<p>
      A Mobile Router that decides to join an Attachment Router will do so between (Attachment Router depth) and
      (Attachment Router depth + 1) times the Attachment Router tree delay. But since a Mobile Router is unstable
      as soon as it receives the Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option from the preferred Attachment Router, it will
      restrain from sending a Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option between the time it receives the
      RA and the time it actually jumps. So the crossing of RA may
      only happen during the propagation time between the Attachment Router and the
      Mobile Router, plus some internal queuing and processing time within each
      machine. It is expected that one tree delay normally covers that
      interval, but ultimately it is up to the implementation and the
      configuration of the Attachment Router to define the duration of risk window.


</p>
<p>
      There is risk of a collision when a Mobile Router receives an
      RA, for an other mobile router that is more
      preferable than the current Attachment Router, within the risk window.

      In the face of a potential collision, the Mobile Router
      with the lowest extended preference
      processes the Router Advertisement - Tree Information Option normally, while the router with the highest
      preference places the other in collision state, does not
      start the tree hop timer, and does not become instable.
      It is expected that next RAs between
      the two will not cross anyway.

Instability</h3>

<p>
      A Mobile Router is instable when it is prepared to move shortly to another
      Attachment Router. This happens typically when the Mobile Router has selected a more
      preferred candidate Attachment Router and has to wait for the tree hop timer to
      elapse before roaming.
      Instability may also occur when the current Attachment Router is lost
      and the next best is still held up.  Instability is resolved
      when the tree hop timer of all the Attachment Router (s) causing instability
      elapse. Such Attachment Router is changes state to Current or Held-Down.


</p>
<p>
      Instability is transient (in the order of tree hop
      timers). When a Mobile Router is unstable, it MUST NOT send RAs with
      TIO. This avoids loops when Mobile Router A wishes to attach to Mobile Router B and Mobile Router
      B wishes to attach to Mobile Router A. Unless RA cross (see Collision section),
       a Mobile Router receives TIO from stable Attachment Routers, which do not
      plan to attach to itself, so the Mobile Router can safely attach to them.

Density</h3>

<p>
     In a dense environment, it is useless that all routers that can provide backhauling 
	 service actually do so; in practice, limiting the number of routers that accept 
	 visitors saves memory in the visitors and reduces the cost of signalling. Also, 
	 limiting the number of nodes (mobile routers that is) in the tree improves 
	 the multicast operations.

</p>
<p>
     Algorithms such a Trickle could be used by a Mobile Router to decide to stop providing its access
	 services for visitors if there are a number of neighboring routers that provide similar services. 
	 The simplest abstraction of such similarity is that of multiple routers advertising a same depth, 
	 though such a simple similarity does not address the specifics of a router selection in the plugins.
	 In a more general fashion, a Mobile Router can associate the concept of similarity with the
	 characteristics of its own attachment router selection plug in.

</p>
<p>
     The Trickle algorithm must be tuned in such a fashion that the susceptibility to stop advertising
	 services is inversely proportional to the number of nodes attached to the Mobile Router, and that
	 the susceptibility to restore services is also inversely proportional to the time 
	 it has been suspending those services. 
	 Once a router suspends its services, it should do so for a period of time that is exponentially 
	 growing each time the decision is made again to keep suspending thise services. That period is
	 interrupted if a neighbor is found that does not have a parent.

Directed Acyclic Graph Discovery</h3>

<p> Tree Discovery builds trees, which are a specific form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In a more general Fashion, TD can be adapted to form DAGs, oriented towards the clusterhead. This is DAG Discovery.

</p>
<p> In <a class='info' href='#adepth'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Administrative depth</span><span>)</span></a>, TD enables a given MR to expose a depth that is incremented by more than one with regards
to its parent. When it does so, a MR can elect a number of alternate parents as feasible successors.
A feasible successor belongs to the same tree as the MR parent, and has a depth that is less than that of the MR.

</p>
<p>The links MR to feasible successors complete the tree as built by TD into a DAG towards the clusterhead.
The DAG enables alternate exit paths for a multihomed Mobile Router.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
   At the current level of this draft, the TIO bears the security level of the
  RA and the link. Nothing is added to it. A deeper threat analysis would be
required to eventually propose additional security.

Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The editor wishes to thank Marco Molteni for his early participation to this design and the review of the document,
Massimo Villari for his early work on simulation and research on the subject and
Julien Abeille for his advanced participation in simulation and real testing.
Also the authors wish to thank Christopher Dearlove for his suggestion for
additional protection against loops in TD, and Philip Levis, David Cueller and
Jonathan Hui for the suggestions about Trickle.
This work is also based on prior publications, in particular
<a class='info' href='#I-D.cho-nemo-hmra'>HMRA<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cho, H., &ldquo;Hierarchical Mobile Router Advertisement for nested mobile networks,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.cho&#8209;nemo&#8209;hmra] by Hosik Cho
and Eun-Kyoung Paik from Seoul National University
and other non IETF publications coauthored with Thierry Ernst
and Thomas Noel. Finally, the editor heartily thanks Marcelo Bagnulo Braun 
and Teco Boot for their very constructive reviews.
