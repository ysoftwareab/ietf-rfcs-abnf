Abstract

   syslog specifies both a logging format and a set of protocols to
   communicate that format over.  This memo specifies a set of URIs that
   administrators and configuration systems may use to inform syslog
   senders of their collectors or relays and protocols.

Internet-Draft               URIs for syslog                    May 2007


1.  Introduction

   The syslog protocol [1] has been used as a logging mechanism for
   close to three decades, in one form or another.  Its reach has
   extended from UNIX mail systems to printers to routers to many
   different devices.  In many cases the logging configuration is as
   simple as an IP address.  This configuration may be in a file,
   specified by an administrator on a device console, or perhaps
   retrieved by a device through a configuration protocol, such as DHCP
   [8].

   With the formal specification of the syslog transport protocols for
   UDP [3], TLS [2], and BEEP [4], a simple means is needed to provide a
   concise way to tell systems which host and which protocol to use as
   either a collector or relay.  Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [5] provide a flexible and concise means to accomplish this task.

   This memo specifies three such URIs.  They are "syslog.udp",
   "syslog.tls", and "syslog.beep;".  A description of each URI scheme
   follows in the next section.  It is recommended that future syslog
   transports include an appropriate URI scheme that begins with
   "syslog.".

   syslog terminology used in this draft is taken from [1].


2.  syslog URI Scheme Registrations and Description

   Each section below consists of a completed template from RFC 4395
   [6].

2.1.  syslog.udp Schema Registration
   URI scheme name

      syslog.udp

   Status

      Permanent

   Syntax

      The following syntax makes use of Augmented BNF (ABNF) [7] and the
      definitions found in RFC 3986.


       syslog-udp-uri = "syslog.udp:" host [ ":" port ]

Internet-Draft               URIs for syslog                    May 2007


   URI semantics

      This URI is used to specify a syslog collector or relay running
      over a specific UDP port. syslog senders will make a connection to
      the host and transmit any appropriate logging as prescribed by the
      sender's configuration.

   Encoding Considerations

      As only a host and a port number are provided, encoding of these
      portions of the URI are specified in [5].

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name

      syslog senders will primarily make use of this URI to configure
      themselves.  The syslog protocol is specified in [1].  UDP
      transport of syslog is specified in [3].

   Interoperability considerations

      None

   Security Considerations

      [3] discusses the underlying concerns of syslog over udp.
      Additionally, as URIs tend to be portable, some additional concern
      should be given to protecting the host in a syslog.udp URI from
      unauthorized access.

Internet-Draft               URIs for syslog                    May 2007


   URI scheme name

      syslog.tls

   Status

      Permanent

   Syntax

      The following syntax makes use of ABNF and the definitions found
      in RFC 3986.


       syslog-tls-uri = "syslog.tls:" host [ ":" port ]



   URI semantics

      This URI is used to specify a syslog collector or relay running
      over TLS. syslog senders will make a connection to the host,
      initiate TLS, and transmit any appropriate logging as prescribed
      by the sender's configuration over the encrypted channel.

   Encoding Considerations

      As only a host and a port number are provided, encoding of these
      portions of the URI are specified in [5].

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name

      syslog senders will primarily make use of this URI to configure
      themselves.  The syslog protocol is specified in [1].  TLS
      transport of syslog is specified in [2].

   Interoperability considerations

      None

   Security Considerations

      [2] discusses issues and concerns of using syslog over TLS.
      Additionally, as URIs tend to be portable, some additional concern
      should be given to protecting the host in a syslog.tls URI from
      unauthorized access.

2.3.  syslog.beep Schema Registration
   URI scheme name

      syslog.beep

   Status

      Permanent

   Syntax

      The following syntax makes use of ABNF and the definitions found
      in RFC 3986.


     syslog-beep-uri = "syslog.beep:" host [ ":" port ]



   URI semantics

      This URI is used to specify a syslog collector or relay running
      over BEEP. syslog senders will make a TCP connection to the host,
      utilize an appropriate BEEP profile for syslog, and transmit any
      appropriate logging as prescribed by the sender's configuration
      over the BEEP channel.

   Encoding Considerations

      As only a host and a port number are provided, encoding of these
      portions of the URI are specified in [5].

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name

      syslog senders will primarily make use of this URI to configure
      themselves.  The syslog protocol is specified in [4].  BEEP
      transport of syslog is specified in [4].

   Interoperability considerations

      None

   Security Considerations

      [4] discusses issues and concerns of using syslog over BEEP.
      Additionally, as URIs tend to be portable, some additional concern
      should be given to protecting the host in a syslog.beep URI from
      unauthorized access.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Use of a URI to configure the syslog service requires some thought
   about potential circular dependencies.  For instance, if a domain
   name is used to configure the service, the URI cannot be resolved if
   name service is unavailable.  Implementers are reminded to obey the
   rules set forth in Section 3.2.2 of [5].  Administrators must balance
   the requirements of flexible management against the need for logging
   resiliency, when making use of these URIs.  In some cases devices may
   be able to store messages locally until they are able to resolve the
   address of a collector or relay.  In other cases, logging information
   may be time critical.

4.  Security Considerations

   Please see the above sections as well as the underlying protocol
   documents for security considerations.  Use of this URI to configure
   devices should be considered in the same light as other potentially
   sensitive configuration information.  The underlying content being
   logged may or may not warrant additional protections, depending on
   environment and circumstances.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register the profiles in Section 2.
