Abstract

   This document describes two usages of the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) that allow a client to
   provide authorization decisions regarding watchers of their presence.
   The first of these usages, called permission-statements, contains
   statements about what permissions are to be granted to watchers of
   presence. The second usage, called supported-permissions, allows a
   client to determine what permissions are understood by the provider.

1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant Messaging and
   Presence (SIMPLE) specifications allow a user, called a watcher, to
   subscribe to another user, called a presentity [13], in order to
   learn their presence information [14]. This subscription is handed by
   a presence agent. In order to process the subscription, the presence
   agent must make a determination about whether the subscription is
   authorized. This authorization decision includes whether or not to
   accept the subscription, but also includes decisions about when the
   watcher should receive notifications, and when it does receive them,
   what the content of those notifications should be.

   Typically, the authorization decision will be a combination of the
   authorization policies of the provider, combined with the
   authorization policices of the presentity. In order for the PA to
   compute the final authorization decision, it needs access to the
   presentity's authorization policies.

   In order to provide this access, the XML Configuration Access
   Protocol (XCAP) [2] is used. XCAP allows a client to manipulate XML
   documents stored on a server. Those XML documents represent per-user
   provisioning data on how an application should operate. XCAP has the
   notion of an application usage, which is a definition of the XML
   schema used by a particular application, along with other relevant
   information. Each application usage is given a unique application
   usage ID (AUID) which identifies it. This specification makes use of
   three application usages.

2. Structuring Presence Authorization

   This specification defines three application usages (each with their
   own XML schema) that, put together, present a comprehensive solution
   for allowing clients to specify authorization policies that a PA can
   use when processing a subscription. The first of these application
   usages has the AUID of permission-statements. This usage allows a
   client to make statements about which permissions are granted to
   which watchers. Each statement contains a definition of the watchers
   to whom it applies, and then contains a list of permissions which are
   granted to those watchers. The concept of a permission is central to
   this specification. A permission is an atomic statement of consent. A
   permission can indicate a condition under which a subscription is
   accepted or rejected, a condition under which a notification is or is
   not sent, or a piece of information which is revealed in a presence
   document. The overall authorization for a watcher is represented by
   the union of the permissions granted to that watcher.

   This specification contains a basic set of primitive permissions. It
   is anticipated that new ones will be standardized in the future. It
   is also anticipated that vendors will define proprietary permissions.
   In order for a client to connect to a server, and achieve
   interoperability, it is neccesary for the client to know what
   permissions are supported by the server. The second application
   usage, supported-permissions, allows a client to read the list of
   permissions understood by the server.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

4. Permission Statements

4.1 Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the "permission-statements" AUID within the
   IETF tree, via the IANA registration in Section 6.

4.2 Structure of Permission Statements

   A permission statement is an XML [3] document that MUST be
   well-formed and SHOULD be valid. Permission statement documents MUST
   be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This
   specification makes use of XML namespaces for identifying permission
   statement documents and document fragments. The namespace URI for
   elements defined for this purpose is a URN [5], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [7] and extended by [11]. This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permission-statements

   A permission statement document begins with the root element tag
   "permission-statements".  It consists of any number of "statement"
   elements. Each statement element defines a set of permissions and
   identifies to whom they are granted.

   Each "statement" element has a single attribute:

   id: This is a string which serves as a way to uniquely identify
      statements in the document. The attribute MUST be unique amongst
      all statement elements in the document. This attribute is
      mandatory.

   Each statement is composed of a single "applies-to" element and a
   single "permissions" element. The "permissions" element is composed
   of one or more elements that grant permissions.

4.2.1 Applying Statements to Watchers

   The "applies-to" element defines the set of watchers to whom the
   statement applies. It contains one or more "uri" elements, "domain"
   elements, "on-list" elements or a single "any" element, followed by
   any number of "except" elements. The "uri" element identifies a
   single watcher by specifying its URI. The "domain" element says that
   the statement applies to all watchers from the specified domain. The
   "on-list" element says that the statement applies to all users on the
   specified presence list [17], identified with an HTTP URI that points
   to the list. Finally, the "any" element says that the statement



Rosenberg                Expires April 26, 2004                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        XCAP Usage for Authorization          October 2003


   applies to all watchers. Additional elements can be added that
   express other ways of identifying the watchers to whom the statement
   applies. When unioned together, the result of the "uri", "domain",
   "on-list" and "any" elements define a set of users to whom the
   permission statement applies. This list is reduced in size by the
   "except" element, which removes a user or domain from the set. The
   "except" element contains instances of the "uri", "domain" and
   "on-list" elements, which specify the users, domains, lists to be
   removed from the set.

   The "uri", "domain", "on-list", and "any" elements all have the
   following attributes:

   id: This is a string which serves as a way to uniquely identify an
      instance of this element within the enclosing "applies-to"
      element. The attribute MUST be unique amongst all elements of the
      same name within the enclosing "applies-to" element. This
      attribute is mandatory.

   display-name: This is a string that contains a display name, suitable
      for rendering to a human user, the identity of the user or domain
      implied by the element. This attribute is optional.

   lang: This attribute identifies the language used to represent the
      display name. It is imported from the XML namespace. This
      attribute is optional.

   When a subscription arrives at the PA, the PA performs an
   authentication operation to determine the identity of the watcher. It
   then uses the "applies-to" element in each statement within the
   presentity's document, and determines the set of statements that
   apply to the watcher. It is possible that multiple statements can
   match a single subscription. In that case, the union of the
   permissions across those statements is applied to the subscription.
   It is also possible that none of the statements match, in which case
   the subscription is considered "pending".

   For example, the following XML fragment includes two statements, one
   that applies to the user joe@example.com, and another that applies to
   example.com. When Joe subscribes, both statements match. Therefore,
   he is granted the union of the permissions across the two statements.

         <!-- permissions for example.com go here -->
       </permissions>
     </statement>

   </permission-statements>


4.2.2 Specifying Permissions

   The remainder of the content of the "statement" element contains
   specific permissions that are granted to watchers to whom the
   statement applies. Each permission is represented by a single XML
   element.

   Primitive permissions can be grouped into two categories:

   1.  Acceptance permissions allow the watcher to subscribe. Without an
       acceptance permission, a subscription is rejected outright.

   2.  Content permissions indicate which information the watcher is
       permitted to see, in the event a notification is sent in the
       first place (based on the rule permissions).


4.2.2.1 Acceptance Permissions

   Acceptance permissions grant the ability of the watcher to subscribe
   to the presentity. Without an acceptance permission, none of the
   other permissions make any sense. There are only two primitive



Rosenberg                Expires April 26, 2004                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        XCAP Usage for Authorization          October 2003


   acceptance permissions, each of which is an XML element. These are
   "accept" and "accept-if". The "accept" element has no content and no
   attributes. It simply grants permission to the watcher to subscribe.
   Only one such element can be present in any statement. The
   "accept-if" element also grants permission to subscribe, but the
   granting of this permissions is predicated on some condition. The
   content of the "accept-if" element is a condition element. Condition
   elements describe characteristics of the subscription, or of the
   operating environment of the server, which are either true or false.
   If the condition within the "accept-if" element is true, an
   acceptance permission is granted.

   The following represent the conditions which can be checked:

   auth-mechanism: This element contains an enumerated type that
      describes authentication mechanisms. The defined values are none,
      digest (referring to the HTTP digest [8] mechanism used in RFC
      3261 [9]), smime (referring to SIP's S/MIME authentication), tls
      (meaning that the watcher authenticated themself using a client
      certificate in a mutual TLS exchange with the server), and
      p-asserted-id (as defined in RFC 3325 [16]). The condition
      evaluates to true if the client was authenticated using the listed
      algorithm.

   anonymous: This element contains no values. The condition evaluates
      to true if the watcher is anonymous. They are considered anonymous
      if the From header field of the request is equal to "Anonymous".
      Note that a user can be anonymous and also have authenticated
      themselves with digest. This occurs when the "anonymous" username
      and password, as defined in RFC 3261 [9], are used.

   can-encrypt: This element contains no values. The condition evaluates
      to true if it is possible to encrypt, using S/MIME, notifications
      sent to this watcher. Generally, this can be determined when the
      Accept header field in the subscription indicates support for the
      application/pkcs7-mime [10] MIME type.

   As an example, the following statement grants permission for watcher
   sip:joe@example.com to subscribe if he authenticates with digest:

         </accept-if>
       </permissions>
     </statement>
   </permission-statements>


4.2.2.2 Content Permissions

   Content permissions specify the information that is to be sent to a
   watcher. Each permission specifies a piece of information that is to
   be sent, or to be used in general in the computation of the presence
   document. The defined permissions are:

   all-content: This permission specifies that all presence information
      can be sent. The element has no attributes or value.

   show-contact-element: This permission specifies that the contact
      component of the tuple can be sent. The element has no attributes
      or value.

   show-note: This permission specifies that the note component of the
      tuple can be sent. The element has no attributes or value.

   show-tuple: This permission specifies that the identified tuples can
      be sent to the watcher. The element has no attributes. Its content
      is a string that matches the "class" element present within the
      tuple [12].

   show-element: This permission specifies that the XML element
      identified by "show-element" can be presented to the watcher. The
      content of "show-element" is a qualified element name. When
      present, it that the specified element, if present in any
      published documents from publishers, can be used by the presence
      server and then distributed to watchers.

   show-namespace: This permission specifies that elements and
      attributes in the presence document within the specified namespace
      can be presented to the watcher. When present, it that content

      from the specified element, if present in any published documents
      from publishers, can be used by the presence server and then
      distributed to watchers.

   encrypt: This permission specifies that the presence document should
      be sent to the watcher encrypted. It should never be present in a
      statement without the presence of an "accept-if" element which
      conditions acceptance of the subscription on the ability of the
      watcher to receive encrypted presence documents.


4.2.2.2.1 Examples

   The following example specifies that a watcher is only allowed to see
   baseline pidf information:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <permission-statements
     xmlns:pidf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf">
     <statement id="as8f">
       <applies-to>
         <uri>sip:joe@example.com</uri>
       </applies-to>

       <permissions>
         <accept/>
         <show-namespace>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf</show-namespace>
       </permissions>

     </statement>
   </permission-statements>

   The following example shows that the watcher is allowed to see PIDF
   information along with the placetype element from RPIDS:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <permission-statements

     xmlns:rpids="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sip-rpids">

       <applies-to>
         <uri>sip:joe@example.com</uri>
       </applies-to>

       <permissions>
         <accept/>
         <show-namespace>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf</show-namespace>
         <show-element>rpids:placetype</show-element>
       </permissions>

     </statement>
   </permission-statements>


4.3 Additional Constraints

   The following are additional constraints not described by the schema:

   o  The content of a "show-element" element indicates the name of an
      XML element, and may be fully qualified (i.e., prefixed with a
      namespace identifier followed by a colon).

   o  The value of the "domain" element MUST be compliant to the BNF for
      "host" as defined in RFC 3261 [9].

   o  The value of the "on-list" element MUST be a valid HTTP URI that
      represents a presence list, as defined in [17].

   o  TODO: Complete this list.


4.4 Naming Conventions

   When a presence agent receives a subscription for some user foo
   within a domain, it will look for all documents within http://[xcap
   root services uri]/permission-statements/users/foo, and use all
   documents found beneath that point to guide authorization policy.

4.5 Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
   documents. A server can allow priveleged users to modify documents

5. Supported Permissions

   Supported permissions allow a presentity to determine what the
   capabilities of the PA are, in terms of expressing authorization
   policy. This capability is expressed as a list of primitive
   permissions, primitive conditions, and compound permissions. When a
   client starts up, it reads this set of permissions from a well known
   URI (see Section 5.3). It then knows which permissions, both
   primitive and compound, that it can include in its permission
   statements.

5.1 Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the "supported-permissions" AUID within the
   IETF tree, via the IANA registration in Section 6.

5.2 Structure of Supported Permissions

   A supported permission is an XML [3] document that MUST be
   well-formed and SHOULD be valid. Supported permission documents MUST
   be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This
   specification makes use of XML namespaces for identifying supported
   permission documents and document fragments. The namespace URI for
   elements defined for this purpose is a URN [5], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [7] and extended by [11]. This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-permissions

   A supported permission document begins with the root element tag
   "supported-permissions".  It consists of one "primitive-permissions"
   element, and zero or one "conditions" elements.

   The "primitive-permissions" element has, for its content, a
   "permissions" element. This element contains a valid permission
   statement which purposefully includes all primitive permissions that
   are supported by the server. All PA's which allow for xcap-based
   configuration of authorization MUST support, at a minimum, the
   "accept", and "all-content" primitive permissions.

   The "conditions" element contains a sequence of conditions which can
   be used within the "accept-if" element. Clearly, the "conditions"
   element will not be present if "accept-if" is not listed as a
   supported permission. There is no minimum requirement for a PA in
   terms of the conditions that need to be supported.

5.3 Naming Conventions

   When a client starts, it can fetch the permissions understood by the
   server in one of two places. If the server capabilities differ on a
   user by user basis, the supported permissions for user foo can be
   found in http://[xcap root services uri]/supported-permissions/users/
   foo/sp.xml. A client SHOULD check this file first. If this document
   doesn't exist, the client should next check for the system wide
   permissions by checking http://[xcap root services uri]/
   supported-permissions/global/sp.xml.

5.4 Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
   documents. A server can allow priveleged users to modify documents
   that they don't own, but the establishment and indication of such
   policies is outside the scope of this document.

5.6 Example Document

   This example document describes a PA that allows very simple
   primitive types. Instead, it defines several compound ones that are
   the preferred way for clients to express permissions.

6. IANA Considerations

   There are several IANA considerations associated with this
   specification.

6.1 XCAP Application Usage IDs

   This section registers three XCAP Application Usage IDs (AUID)
   according to the IANA procedures defined in [2].

6.1.1 Permission Statements

      Name of the AUID: permission-statements

      Description: Permission-statements are documents that describe the
      permissions that a presentity [13] has granted to users that seek
      to watch their presence.


6.1.2 Supported Permissions

      Name of the AUID: supported-permissions

      Description: Supported permissions are documents that describe the
      types of permissions which are supported by a presence agent [14].
      These permissions specify the information that watchers [13] of
      presence are allowed to see.


6.2 URN Sub-Namespace Registrations

   This section registers several new XML namespaces, as per the
   guidelines in [11]

6.2.1 urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permission-statements

      URI: The URI for this namespace is
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:permission-statements.
