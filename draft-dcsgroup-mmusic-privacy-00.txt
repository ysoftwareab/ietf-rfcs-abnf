1. Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application layer
   control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
   sessions with one or more participants. In the current PSTN, call
   signaling messages travel through switches which act as trusted
   intermediaries. The signaling messages typically include calling
   party identification information which may be delivered to the
   called party. The calling party is able to suppress the delivery of
   such information to the called party in order to maintain privacy.

   In a Voice over IP environment using SIP user agents as the
   equivalent of telephones and SIP proxies as trusted intermediaries,
   calling parties may also desire to maintain their privacy. In this
   document, we describe a proposed SIP extension that may be used to
   request calling party privacy in the above mentioned environment.
   This includes a recognition that privacy in a VoIP environment
   extends beyond simply hiding SIP level user information to
   potentially hiding calling party IP address information as well.

3. Introduction

   In the telephone network, the Calling Number Delivery and Calling
   Name Delivery services provide the called party with identity
   information about the calling party prior to the called party
   answering the call; the calling party is here identified as the
   station originating the call. In order for this service to be
   dependable, the called party must be able to trust that the calling
   identity information being presented is valid. Consider for example
   a tele-marketer presenting himself with the identity of one of your
   co-workers, or, even worse, an automated credit-card activation
   system using calling identity information as an authorization check.

   In order for the calling identity information to be trustworthy, the
   information must come from a trusted source.

   One scenario for establishing such trust is for a SIP user agent to
   require that all incoming SIP invitations arrive through a set of
   trusted SIP proxies; for simplicity we will assume that each SIP
   user agent is associated with a single SIP proxy, which we will
   refer to as a DCS-proxy in this document. DCS-proxies are
   interconnected and maintain a transitive trust relationship. Thus if
   a SIP user agent originates a call through a DCS-proxy, it trusts
   that the DCS-proxy will carry out the service requested, even if
   other DCS-proxies are involved. DCS-proxies however do not trust SIP
   user agents, since these will typically reside at the customer
   premise.

   When a call is placed, the calling identity delivery services reveal
   privacy information to the called party, and the calling party
   therefore has the option to block the delivery of this information
   to the called party. This is typically achieved by subscribing to a
   Calling Identity Delivery Blocking service but can be done on an
   individual call basis as well. When the Calling Identity Delivery
   Blocking Service is invoked, information about the calling party is
   still passed through the trusted intermediaries, however
   presentation restriction indicators are set in the signaling
   messages to signal the far-end side, that the calling identity
   information is not to be provided to the called party.

   More generally, we may say that the service provided is that of
   preventing the called party from obtaining information about the
   calling party that may either be used to identify the party or
   reveal location information about the party. In an IP environment,
   IP addressing information may provide the called party with
   information to reach or identify the calling party. IP addressing
   information may reveal some level of location information, for
   instance if one has knowledge of which addresses are deployed where,
   or by revealing that a given caller is using a different IP-address
   or address block than usual.

   When such a privacy service is to be provided in a SIP environment,
   it leads to two requirements. First, calling identity information
   present in SIP messages must not be delivered in an intelligible
   form to the called party. Secondly, when using SIP in an IP
   environment, IP addressing information must be hidden from the
   called party.

   We assume that a SIP user agent can recognize invitations arriving
   through its trusted DCS-proxy. Furthermore, as in the current
   telephone network, the trusted DCS-proxy is expected to either
   receive or possess calling party information enabling it to identify
   the calling party.

   The calling party identification information can be provided to the
   called party's DCS-proxy as the "display-name" in the "name-addr"

   part of a From header field [2]. In such a scenario, the calling
   party may have excluded the "display-name" field from the invitation
   it issued in order to not reveal its identity to the called party.
   The absence of this field could by itself be an indication to the
   DCS proxy, that privacy was requested. For DCS-proxy to DCS-proxy
   communication, where the information would still be passed, a
   presentation restriction indicator would then be needed.

   In order to maintain complete privacy in an IP environment, calling
   party IP-address information may have to be concealed from the
   terminating party as well. The cost and complexity of providing IP
   address level privacy rather than simply SIP level privacy is likely
   to differ enough to warrant two separate services. The calling party
   will thus need to signal the DCS-proxy which privacy service it is
   requesting.

4. SIP Extension

   In the following we first present a proposed SIP extension to
   address the privacy issues identified. We then present an example of
   how this may be used to provide the privacy service.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3].

4.1 PRIVACY

   We propose to extend SIP with a new header field called DCS-Privacy
   which allows the calling party to indicate the degree of privacy
   that should be provided by the DCS-proxy.

   The syntax of the proposed extension is as follows:

     Privacy  = "Privacy" ":"  *privacy-tag

     privacy-tag  = "Full" | "Caller-Num" | "Caller-Name" | "IPAddr"

   The value "Caller-Num" requests the originating phone number not be
   displayed to the destination.  The value "Caller-Name" requests the
   calling name not be displayed.  The value "IPAddr" requests IP
   privacy such that the destination is not given the originator's IP
   address. The value "Full" requests both Caller-Num and Caller-Name
   blocking and IP address privacy.  Any combination of these values
   may appear in this header.

4.2 Example of Use

   In this Section, we will illustrate how the request for privacy may
   work in practice. It should be noted that the privacy service
   described can be implemented in a number of ways; we merely describe
   one possible solution in this section.

   +------+                                             +------+

                Figure 1 - Basic Privacy Example


   The originating user agent (MTA-o) sends an INVITE (1) message
   requesting caller-name privacy to DCS-proxy-o. DCS-proxy-o ensures
   that authentic calling identity information is included in the
   message before it sends INVITE (2) to DCS-proxy-t. DCS-proxy-t
   examines the DCS-caller header field included in the INVITE and sees
   that caller-name privacy is requested. Consequently, DCS-proxy-t
   replaces the caller-name in "display-name" with the string
   "anonymous".

   While this illustrates the basic operation of the service, there are
   additional issues that need to be considered. In SIP, there are
   other fields than "display-name" that can reveal the identity of the
   calling party, either in part or completely. In the cases of calling
   name and calling number privacy, the "addr-spec", e.g. SIP-URL, part
   of the From header field may contain calling party information. This
   privacy problem can be overcome by having MTA-o encrypt the SIP-URL
   and supplying a user parameter indicating that the SIP-URL is
   encrypted. The key used is shared between MTA-o and DCS-proxy-o.
   Also, when the session description protocol (SDP) is used to
   describe the media in the session, the use of SDP fields revealing
   calling identity information needs to be examined as well. Similar
   concerns apply to the use of RTCP.

   The second example we look at is one where full privacy is
   requested, i.e. both calling name and number privacy, as well as IP
   address privacy. The Figure below illustrates how IP address privacy
   can be achieved by inserting a trusted intermediary, an anonymizer,
   for the media streams between MTA-o and MTA-t.

                Figure 2 - Full Privacy Example


   For all signaling and media exchange purposes, the anonymizer adds a
   level of indirection thereby hiding the IP address(es) of MTA-o from
   MTA-t. This indirection is used both for the media streams and SIP
   signaling, beyond the initial INVITE, exchanged directly between
   MTA-o and MTA-t.

   Also, the following commonly used header fields may reveal privacy
   information, which can be remedied as described:

   @ The From header field must not reveal any calling identity
     information in the SIP-URL, e.g. by encrypting it. The "display-
     name" must be anonymous.
   @ A Contact header field must be set to point to the anonymizer to
     prevent any direct signaling between MTA-o and MTA-t
   @ Via header fields identifying either MTA-o or DCS-proxy-o must be
     hidden, e.g. by encryption or simple stateful removal and re-
     insertion by DCS-proxy-t.
   @ Call-ID should not be based on MTA-o's IP-address

   Furthermore, when SDP is used to describe the media in the session,
   the session descriptions exchanged by the user agents need to be
   modified to direct the media streams to the anonymizer. Again, the
   use of SDP fields revealing calling identity information needs to be
   considered as well. Similar concerns apply to the use of RTCP.


5. Security Considerations

   A user requesting complete privacy must still authenticate himself
   to the DCS-Proxy, and therefore the SIP messages between MTA-o and

   DCS-proxy-o must be protected.  Likewise, it is necessary that the
   proxies take precautions to protect the user identification
   information from eavesdropping and interception.  Use of IPSec
   between MTA and DCS-proxy and between proxies is recommended.
