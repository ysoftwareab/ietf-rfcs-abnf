3. Introduction 
    
   This document describes a method for encapsulating time division 
   multiplexed (TDM) digital signals for transmission over packet-
   switched networks.   
    
   The transmission system for circuit-oriented TDM signals is the 
   Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) [3], [6] / Synchronous Digital 
   Hierarchy (SDH) [4]. To support TDM traffic (which includes voice, 
   data, and private leased line services) PSNs must emulate the 
   circuit characteristics of SONET/SDH payloads.  MPLS labels and a 
   new circuit emulation header are used to encapsulate TDM signals and 
   provide the Circuit Emulation Service over MPLS (CEM) function.  The 
   MPLS encapsulation may be further encapsulated in IP for carriage 
   across IP PSNs [8]. 
    
   This document also describes an optional extension to CEM called 
   Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA).  This is a method for 
   dynamically reducing the bandwidth utilized by emulated SONET/SDH 
   circuits in the packet network.  This bandwidth reduction is 
   accomplished by not sending the SONET/SDH payload through the packet 
   network under certain conditions such as AIS-P or STS SPE 
   Unequipped. 
    
   This document is closely related to references [5], which describes 
   the control protocol methods used to signal the usage of CEM, [7], 
   which describes a related method of encapsulating Layer 2 frames 
   over MPLS and which shares the same signaling, and [11] which 
   describes a MIB for controlling and observing CEM services. 
    
    
4. Scope 
    
   This document describes how to provide CEM for the following digital 
   signals: 
    
   1. SONET STS-1 synchronous payload envelope (SPE)/SDH VC-3 
    
   2. STS-Nc SPE (N = 3, 12, or 48)/SDH VC-4, VC-4-4c, VC-4-16c 
    
   3. Unstructured SONET Emulation, where the entire SONET bit-stream 
   (including the transport overhead) is packetized and transported 
   across the PSN.

   For the remainder of this document, these constructs will be 
   referred to as SONET/SDH channels.   
    
    
   Other SONET/SDH signals, such as virtual tributary (VT) structured 
   sub-rate mapping, are not explicitly discussed in this document; 
   however, it can be extended in the future to support VT and lower 
   speed non-SONET/SDH services. OC-192c SPE/VC-4-64c are also not 
   included at this point, since most PSNs use OC-192c or slower 
   trunks, and thus would not have sufficient capacity.  As trunk 
   capacities increase in the future, the scope of this document can be 
   accordingly extended. 
    
5. CEM Encapsulation Format 
    
   In order to transport SONET/SDH SPEs through a packet-oriented 
   network, the SPE is broken into fragments.  A 32-bit CEM Header is 
   pre-pended to each fragment.  The Basic CEM packet appears in Figure 
   1.

   The above fields are defined as follows: 
    
   D bit: Signals DBA Mode.  MUST be set to zero for Normal Operation.  
   MUST be set to one if CEM is currently in DBA mode.  DBA is an 
   optional mode during which trivial SPEs are not transmitted into the 
   packet network.  See Table 1 and sections 7 and 8 for further 
   details.  Note: for unstructured CEM, the D-bit MUST be set to zero.

   R bit: CEM-RDI.  This bit is set to one to signal to the remote CEM 
   function that a loss of packet synchronization has occurred.   
    
   Rvd: These bits are reserved for future use, and MUST be set to 
   zero. 
    
   Sequence Number:  This is a packet sequence number, which MUST 
   continuously cycle from 0 to 1023.  It SHOULD begin at zero when a 
   CEM LSP is created. 
    
   Structure Pointer: The Structure Pointer MUST contain the offset of 
   the J1 byte within the CEM payload. The value is from 0 to 1,022, 
   where 0 means the first byte after the CEM header. The Structure 
   Pointer MUST be set to 0x3FF (1,023) if a packet does not carry the 
   J1 byte.  See [3], [4] and [6] for more information on the J1 byte 
   and the SONET/SDH payload pointer.  Note: for unstructured CEM, the 
   Structure Pointer field MUST be set to 0x3FF. 
    
   The N and P bits: Indicate negative and positive pointer adjustment 
   events.  They are also used to relay SONET/SDH maintenance signals 
   such as AIS-P.  See Table 1 and sections 7 and 8 for more details.  
   Note: for unstructured CEM, the N and P bits MUST both be set to 0.

   ECC-6: An Error Correction Code to protect the CEM header.  This 
   offers the ability to correct single bit errors and detect up to two 
   bit errors.  The ECC algorithm is described in Appendix B.  The ECC-
   6 can be optionally disabled at provisioning time.  If the ECC-6 is 
   not utilized it MUST be set to zero. 
    
   Note: Normal CEM packets are fixed in length for all of the packets 
   of a particular emulated TDM stream.  This length is signaled using 
   the CEM Payload Bytes parameter defined in [5], or is statically 
   provisioned for each TDM stream.  Therefore, the length of each CEM 
   packet does not need to be carried in the CEM header. 
    
5.1 Transport Encapsulation

   In principle, CEM packets can be transported over any packet-
   oriented network.  The following sections describe specifically how 
   CEM packets MUST be encapsulated for transport over MPLS or IP 
   networks. 
    
5.1.1 MPLS Transport 
    
   To transport a CEM packet over an MPLS network, an MPLS label-stack 
   MUST be pushed on top of the CEM packet. 
    
   The last two labels prior to the CEM header are referred to as the 
   Tunnel and Virtual Circuit (VC) labels.   
    
   The VC label is required, and is the last label prior to the CEM 
   Header.  The VC label MUST be used to identify the CEM connection 
   within the MPLS tunnel.   
    
   The optional tunnel label is immediately above the VC label on the 
   label stack.  If present, the tunnel label MUST be used to identify 
   the MPLS LSP used to tunnel the TDM packets through the MPLS network 
   (the tunnel LSP).   
    
   This is similar to the label stack usage defined in [5] and [7].

                 | Additional MPLS Labels (Optional) |

                 |            CEM Header             |

                 |       SONET/SDH SPE Fragment      | 
                 |                                   |

5.1.1 IP Transport 
    
   It is highly desirable to define a single encapsulation format that 
   will work for both IP and MPLS.  Furthermore, it is desirable that 
   the encapsulation mechanism be as efficient as possible.   
    
   One way to achieve these goals is to map CEM directly onto IP by 
   mapping the previously described MPLS packets onto IP.

   A mechanism for carrying MPLS over IP is described in [8]. 
    
   Using this encapsulation scheme would result in the packet format 
   illustrated in figure 4.

6. CEM Operation 
    
   The following sections describe CEM operation.   
    
6.1 Introduction and Terminology 
 
   There are two types of CEM: structured and unstructured.   
    
   Unstructured CEM packetizes the entire SONET/SDH bit-stream 
   (including transport overhead).   
    
   Structured CEM terminates the transport overhead and packetizes 
   individual channels (STS-1/Nc) within the SONET/SDH frame.  Because 
   structured CEM terminates the transport overhead, structured CEM 
   implementations SHOULD meet the generic requirements for SONET/SDH 
   Line Terminating Equipment as defined in [3], [4], and [6]. 
    
   Implementations MUST support structured CEM and MAY support 
   unstructured CEM. 
    
   Structured CEM MUST support a normal mode of operation and MAY 
   support an optional extension called Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation 
   (DBA).  During normal operation, SONET/SDH payloads are fragmented, 
   pre-pended with the CEM Header, the VC label, and the PSN header, 
   and then transmitted into the packet network.  During DBA mode, only 
   the CEM header, the VC label, and PSN header are transmitted.  This 
   is done to conserve bandwidth when meaningful user data is not 
   present in the SPE, such as during AIS-P or STS SPE Unequipped.   
    
6.1.1 CEM Packetizer and De-Packetizer 
 
   As with all adaptation functions, CEM has two distinct components: 
   adapting TDM SONET/SDH into a CEM packet stream, and converting the 
   CEM packet stream back into a TDM SONET/SDH.  The first function 
   will be referred to as CEM Packetizer and the second as CEM De-
   Packetizer.  This terminology is illustrated in figure 5. 
    
    
             +------------+              +---------------+

   SONET --> |    CEM     | --> PSN  --> |      CEM      | --> SONET  
    SDH      | Packetizer |              | De-Packetizer |      SDH 
             |            |              |               |        
             +------------+              +---------------+ 
    
   Figure 5. CEM Terminology 
    
   Note: the CEM de-packetizer requires a buffering mechanism to 
   account for delay variation in the CEM packet stream.  This 
   buffering mechanism will be generically referred to as the CEM  
   jitter buffer.

6.1.2 CEM DBA 
    
   DBA is an optional mode of operation for structured CEM that only 
   transmits the CEM Header, the VC label, and PSN Header into the 
   packet network under certain circumstances such as AIS-P or STS 
   Unequipped.   
    
   If DBA is supported by a CEM implementation, the user SHOULD be able 
   to configure if DBA will be triggered by AIS-P, STS Unequipped, 
   both, or neither on a per channel basis.   
    
   If DBA is supported, the determination of AIS-P and STS Unequipped 
   MUST be based on the state of SONET/SDH Section, Line, and Path 
   Overhead bytes.  DBA based on pattern detection within the SPE (i.e. 
   all zeros, 7Es, or ATM idle cells) is for further study. 
    
   During AIS-P, there is no valid payload pointer, so pointer 
   adjustments cannot occur.  During STS Unequipped, the SONET/SDH 
   payload pointer is valid, and therefore pointer adjustments MUST be 
   supported even during DBA.  See Table 1 for details. 
    
6.2 Description of Normal CEM Operation 
    
   During normal operation, the CEM packetizer will receive a fixed 
   rate byte stream from a SONET/SDH interface.  When a packets worth 
   of data has been received from a SONET/SDH channel, the CEM Header, 
   the VC Label, and PSN Header are pre-pended to the SPE fragment and 
   the resulting CEM packet is transmitted into the packet network.  
   Because all normal CEM packets associated with a specific SONET/SDH 
   channel will have the same length, the transmission of CEM packets 
   for that channel SHOULD occur at regular intervals.   
    
   At the far end of the packet network, the CEM de-packetizer will 
   receive packets into a jitter buffer and then play out the received 
   byte stream at a fixed rate onto the corresponding SONET/SDH 
   channel.  The jitter buffer SHOULD be adjustable in length to 
   account for varying network delay behavior.  The receive packet rate 
   from the packet network should be exactly balanced by the 
   transmission rate onto the SONET/SDH channel, on average.  The time 
   over which this average is taken corresponds to the depth of the 
   jitter buffer for a specific CEM channel. 
    
   The CEM sequence numbers provide a mechanism to detect lost and/or 
   mis-ordered packets.  The CEM de-packetizer MUST detect lost or mis-
   ordered packets.  The CEM de-packetizer MUST play out a programmable 
   byte pattern in place of any dropped packets.  The CEM de-packetizer 
   MAY re-order packets received out of order.  If the CEM de-
   packetizer does not support re-ordering, it MUST drop mis-ordered 
   packets. 
    
6.3 Description of CEM Operation during DBA 
    
   (Note: DBA is only applicable to structured CEM.)

   There are several issues that should be addressed by a workable CEM 
   DBA mechanism.  First, when DBA is invoked, there should be a 
   substantial savings in bandwidth utilization in the packet network.  
   The second issue is that the transition in and out of DBA should be 
   tightly coordinated between the local CEM packetizer and CEM de-
   packetizer at the far side of the packet network.  A third is that 
   the transition in and out of DBA should be accomplished with minimal 
   disruption to the adapted data stream. 
    
   Another goal is that the reduction of CEM traffic due to DBA should 
   not be mistaken for a fault in the packet network or vice-versa.  
   Finally, the implementation of DBA should require minimal 
   modifications beyond what is necessary for the nominal CEM case.  
   The mechanism described below is a reasonable balance of these 
   goals. 
    
   During DBA, packets MUST be emitted at exactly the same rate as they 
   would be during normal operation.  This SHOULD be accomplished by 
   transmitting each DBA packet after a complete packet of data has 
   been received from the SONET/SDH channel.  The only change from 
   normal operation is that the CEM packets during DBA MUST only carry 
   the CEM header, the VC Label, and the PSN Header.   
    
   Because some links have a minimum supported packet size, the CEM 
   packetizer MAY append a configurable number of bytes immediately 
   after the CEM-header to pad out the CEM packet to reach the mimumum 
   supported packet size.  The value of the padding bytes is 
   implementation specific.  The D-bit MUST be set to one, to indicate 
   that DBA is active.   
    
   The CEM de-packetizer MUST assume that each packet received with the 
   D-bit set represents a normal-sized packet containing an AIS-P or 
   SPE Unequipped payload as noted by N and P.  See Table 1.  The CEM 
   de-packetizer MUST accept DBA packets with or without padding. 
    
   This allows the CEM packetization and de-packetization logic during 
   DBA to be similar to the nominal case.  It insures that the correct 
   SONET/SDH indication is reliably transmitted between CEM adaptation 
   points.  It minimizes the risk of under or over running the jitter 
   buffer during the transition in and out of DBA.  And, it guarantees 
   that faults in the packet network are recognized as distinctly 
   different from line conditioning on the SONET/SDH interfaces. 
    
6.4 Packet Synchronization 
    
   A key component in declaring the state of a CEM service is whether 
   or not the CEM de-packetizer is in or out of packet synchronization.  
   The following paragraphs describe how that determination is made. 
    
6.4.1 Acquisition of Packet Synchronization 
    

  
Malis, et al.           Expires February 2002                [Page 9] 

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS       July 2001 
 
 
   At startup, a CEM de-packetizer will be out of packet 
   synchronization by default.  To declare packet synchronization at 
   startup or after a loss of packet synchronization, the CEM de-
   packetizer must receive a configurable number of CEM packets with 
   sequential sequence numbers.   
    
6.4.2 Loss of Packet Synchronization 
    
   Once a CEM de-packetizer is in packet sync, it may encounter a set 
   of events that will cause it to lose packet synchronization.   
    
   As discussed in section 6.2, a CEM de-packetizer MAY or MAY NOT 
   support re-ordering of mis-ordered packets.   
    
   If a CEM de-packetizer supports re-ordering, then the determination 
   that packet synchronization has been lost cannot be made at the time 
   the packets are received from the PSN.  Instead, the determination 
   MUST be made as the packets are being played out onto the SONET/SDH 
   interface.  This is because it is only at play-out time that the 
   determination can be made as to whether the entire emulated 
   SONET/SDH stream was received from the PSN.   
    
   If a CEM de-packetizer does not support re-ordering, a number of 
   approaches may be used to minimize the impact of mis-ordered or lost 
   packets on the final re-assembled SONET/SDH stream.  For example, 
   AAL1 [9] uses a simple state-machine to re-order packets in a sub-
   set of possible cases.  The algorithm for these state-machines is 
   outside of the scope of CEM.  However, the final determination as to 
   whether or not to declare loss of packet synchronization MUST be 
   based on the same criteria as for implementations that do support 
   re-ordering. 
    
   Whether or not a CEM implementation supports re-ordering, the 
   declaration of loss of packet synchronization MUST be based on the 
   following criteria.   
    
   As packets are played out towards the SONET/SDH interface, the CEM 
   de-packetizer will encounter Ÿempty÷ packets in the place of packets 
   that were dropped by the PSN, or effectively dropped due to 
   limitations of the CEM implementation.  If the CEM de-packetizer 
   encounters more than a configurable number of sequential dropped 
   packets, the CEM de-packetizer MUST declare loss of packet 
   synchronization.   
    
7. SONET/SDH Maintenance Signals 
    
   There are several issues that must be considered in the mapping of 
   maintenance signals between SONET/SDH and a PSN.  A description of 
   how these signals and conditions are mapped between the two domains 
   is described below. 
    
   For clarity, the mappings are split into two groups: SONET/SDH to 
   PSN, and PSN to SONET/SDH.

7.1.1 AIS-P Indication 
    
   In a SONET/SDH network, SONET/SDH Path outages are signaled using 
   maintenance alarms such as Path AIS (AIS-P).  In particular, AIS-P 
   indicates that the SONET/SDH Path is not currently transmitting 
   valid end-user data, and the SPE contains all ones.   
    
   It should be noted that for structured CEM nearly every type of 
   service-effecting section or line defect will result in an AIS-P 
   condition. 
    
   The SONET/SDH hierarchy is illustrated below.

   Should the Section Layer detect a Loss of Signal (LOS) or Loss of 
   Frame (LOF) condition, it sends AIS-L up to the Line Layer.  If the 
   Line Layer detects AIS-L or Loss of Path (LOP), it sends AIS-P to 
   the Path Layer.   
    
   In normal mode during AIS-P, structured CEM packets are generated as 
   usual.  The N and P bits MUST be set to 11 binary to signal AIS-P 
   explicitly through the packet network.  The D-bit MUST be set to 
   zero to indicate that the SPE is being carried through the packet 
   network.  Normal CEM packets with the SPE fragment, CEM Header, the 
   VC Label, and PSN Header MUST be transmitted into the packet 
   network. 
  
Malis, et al.           Expires February 2002               [Page 12] 

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS       July 2001 
 
 
    
   However, to conserve network bandwidth during AIS-P, DBA MAY be 
   employed.  If DBA has been enabled for AIS-P and AIS-P is currently 
   occurring, the N and P bits MUST be set to 11 binary to signal AIS, 
   and the D-bit MUST be set to one to indicate that the SPE is not 
   being carried through the packet network.  Only the CEM header, the 
   VC Label, and the PSN Header MUST be transmitted into the packet 
   network. 
    
   Also note that this differs from the outage mechanism in [5], which 
   withdraws the VC label as a result of an endpoint outage.  TDM 
   circuit emulation requires the ability to distinguish between the 
   de-provisioning of a circuit (which causes the VC label to be 
   withdrawn), and temporary outages (which are signaled using AIS-P).   
 
    
7.1.2 STS SPE Unequipped Indication 
    
   The STS SPE Unequipped Indication is a slightly different case than 
   AIS-P.  When byte C2 of the Path Overhead (STS path signal label) is 
   00h and Byte B3 (STS Path BIP-8) is valid, it indicates that the SPE 
   is unequipped.  Note: this is typically signaled by setting the 
   entire SPE to zeros. 
    
   For normal structured CEM operation during SPE Unequipped, the N and 
   P bits MUST be interpreted as usual.  The SPE MUST be transmitted 
   into the packet network along with the CEM Header, the VC Label, and 
   PSN Header, and the D-Bit MUST be set to zero.  
    
   If DBA has been enabled for STS SPE Unequipped and the Unequipped 
   condition is occurring on the SONET/SDH channel, the D-bit MUST be 
   set to one to indicate DBA is active.  Only the CEM Header, the VC 
   Label, and PSN Header MUST be transmitted into the packet network.  
   The N and P bits MUST be used to signal pointer adjustments as 
   normal.  See Table 1 and section 8 for details. 
 
7.1.3 CEM-RDI 
 
   The CEM function MUST send CEM-RDI towards the packet network during 
   loss of packet synchronization.  This MUST be accomplished by 
   setting the R bit to one in the CEM header.  This applies for both 
   structured and unstructured CEM. 
    
7.2 PSN to SONET/SDH 
 
   The following sections discuss how the various conditions on the 
   packet network are converted into SONET/SDH indications. 
    
7.2.1 AIS-P Indication 
 
   There are several conditions in the packet network that will cause 
   the structured CEM de-packetization function to send an AIS-P 
   indication onto a SONET/SDH channel.   
  
Malis, et al.           Expires February 2002               [Page 13] 

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS       July 2001 
 
 
    
   The first of these is the receipt of structured CEM packets with the 
   N and P bits set to one, and the D-bit set to zero.  This is an 
   explicit indication of AIS-P being received at the far-end of the 
   packet network, with DBA disabled for AIS-P.  The CEM de-packetizer 
   MUST play out the received SPE fragment (which will incidentally be 
   carrying all ones), and MUST configure the SONET/SDH Overhead to 
   signal AIS-P as defined in [3], [4], and [6]. 
    
   The second case is the receipt of structured CEM packets with the N 
   and P bits set to one, and the D-bit set to one.  This is an 
   explicit indication of AIS-P being received at the far-end of the 
   packet network, with DBA enabled for AIS-P.  The CEM de-packetizer 
   MUST play out one packetËs worth of all ones for each packet 
   received, and MUST configure the SONET/SDH Overhead to signal AIS-P 
   as defined in [3], [4], and [6]. 
    
   A third case that will cause a structured CEM de-packetization 
   function to send an AIS-P indication onto a SONET/SDH channel is 
   loss of packet synchronization.   
    
    
7.2.2 STS SPE Unequipped Indication 
 
   There are three conditions in the packet network that will cause the 
   CEM function to transmit STS SPE Unequipped indications onto the 
   SONET/SDH channel.  
    
   The first, which is transparent to CEM, is the receipt of regular 
   CEM packets that happen to be carrying an SPE that contains the 
   appropriate Path overhead to signal STS SPE unequipped.  This case 
   does not require any special processing on the part of the CEM de-
   packetizer. 
    
   The second case is the receipt of structured CEM packets that have 
   the D-bit set to one to indicate DBA active and the N and P bits set 
   to 00 binary, 01 binary, or 10 binary to indicate SPE Unequipped 
   with or without pointer adjustments.  The CEM de-packetizer MUST use 
   this information to transmit a packet of all zeros onto the 
   SONET/SDH interface, and adjust the payload pointer as necessary. 
    
   The third case when a structured CEM de-packetizer MUST send an STS 
   SPE Unequipped Indication towards the SONET/SDH interface is when 
   the VC-label has been withdrawn due to de-provisioning of the 
   circuit.   
    
8. Clocking Modes 
    
   It is necessary to be able to regenerate the input service clock at 
   the output interface.  Two clocking modes are supported: synchronous 
   and asynchronous.  Selection of the clocking mode is made as part of 
   service provisioning.  Both ends of the emulated circuit must be 
   configured with the same clocking mode.

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS       July 2001 
 
 
    
8.1 Synchronous 
    
    
   When synchronous SONET/SDH timing is available at both ends of the 
   circuit, the issue of clock recovery becomes much simpler. 
    
8.1.1 Synchronous Unstructured CEM 
    
   For unstructured CEM, the external clock is used to clock each bit 
   onto the optical carrier.   
    
8.1.2 Synchronous Structured CEM 
    
   For structured CEM, the external clock is used to clock the 
   SONET/SDH carrier.  The N and P bits are used to signal negative or 
   positive pointer justification events between structured CEM end-
   points.  
    
   If there is a frequency offset between the frame rate of the 
   transport overhead and that of the SONET/SDH SPE, then the alignment 
   of the SPE shall periodically slip back or advance in time through 
   positive or negative stuffing. The N and P bits are used to replay 
   the pointer adjustment events and eliminate transport jitter. 
    
   During a negative pointer adjustment event, the H3 byte from the 
   SONET/SDH stream is incorporated into the CEM packet payload in 
   order with the rest of the SPE.  During a positive pointer 
   adjustment event, the stuff byte is not included in the CEM packet 
   payload.   
    
   The pointer adjustment event MUST be transmitted in three 
   consecutive packets by the packetizer. The de-packetizer MUST play 
   out the pointer adjustment event when the first packet of the three 
   with N/P bit set is received.   
    
   The CEM de-packetizer MUST utilize the CEM sequence numbers to 
   insure that SONET/SDH pointer adjustment events are not played any 
   more frequently than once per every three CEM packets transmitted by 
   the remote CEM packetizer.   
    
   References [3],[4],and [6] specify that pointer adjustment events 
   MUST be separated by three SONET/SDH frames without a pointer 
   adjustment event.  In order to relay all legal pointer adjustment 
   events, the packet size for a specific circuit MUST be no larger 
   than (783 * 4 * N)/3, where N is the STS-Nc multiplier. 
    
   However, some SONET/SDH equipment allows pointer adjustments to 
   occur in back to back SONET/SDH frames.  In order to support this 
   possibility, the packet size for a particular circuit SHOULD be no 
   larger than (783*N)/3.  Where N is the STS-Nc multiplier.   
    

  
Malis, et al.           Expires February 2002               [Page 15] 

                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS       July 2001 
 
 
   Since the minimum value of N is one, CEM implementations SHOULD 
   support a minimum payload length of 783/3 or 261 bytes.  Smaller 
   payload lengths MAY be supported as an option. 
    
    
8.2 Asynchronous 
    
    
   If synchronous timing is not available, other methods MAY be 
   employed to regenerate the circuit timing.   
    
   For structured CEM, the CEM packetizer SHOULD generate the N and P 
   bits as usual.  However, without external synchronization, this 
   information is not sufficient to reliably justify the SPE within the 
   SONET/SDH transport framing at the CEM de-packetizer.  The de-
   packetizer MAY employ an adaptive algorithm to introduce pointer 
   adjustment events to map the CEM SPE to the SONET/SDH transport 
   framing.  Regardless of whether the N and P bits are used by the de-
   packetizer as part of the adaptive clock recovery algorithm, they 
   MUST still be used in conjunction with the D-bit to signal AIS-P, 
   SPE Unequipped, and DBA. 
    
   For unstructured CEM, the CEM de-packetizer MAY use an adaptive 
   clock recovery technique to regenerate the SONET/SDH transport 
   clock.   
    
   An example adaptive clock recovery method can be found in section 
   3.4.2 of [10]. 
 
 
9. CEM LSP Signaling 
    
   For maximum network scaling in MPLS applications, CEM LSP signaling 
   may be performed using the LDP Extended Discovery mechanism as 
   augmented by the VC FEC Element defined in [5].  MPLS traffic 
   tunnels may be dedicated to CEM, or shared with other MPLS-based 
   services.  The value 8008 is used for the VC Type in the VC FEC 
   Element in order to signify that the LSP being signaled is to carry 
   CEM.  Note that the generic control word defined in [6] is not used, 
   as its functionality is included in the CEM encapsulation header. 
    
   Alternatively, static label assignment may be used, or a dedicated 
   traffic engineered LSP may be used for each CEM service. 
    
   Normal CEM packets are fixed in length for all of the packets of a 
   particular emulated TDM stream.  This length is signaled using the 
   CEM Payload Bytes parameter defined in [5], or is statically 
   provisioned for each CEM service. 
    
   At this time, other aspects of the CEM service MUST be statically 
   provisioned.  The CEM-MIB [11] provides a method for statically 
   provisioning CEM services.

   In [5], Parameter ID 0x05 is allocated for †CEM OptionsË.  At this 
   time, the CEM Options parameter is reserved and MUST be set to zero.  
   The use of the CEM Options parameter is for future consideration.   
    
10. Open Issues 
    
   Future revisions of this document may discuss the following items. 
    
   Underlying MPLS QoS requirements are not covered by this revision of 
   the draft.  Future revisions may discuss underlying QoS 
   requirements. 
    
   Support for VT and lower speed non-SONET/SDH services are not 
   covered in this revision of the draft.  Future revisions may address 
   VT and non-SONET/SDH TDM services. 
    
   Use of the CEM Options parameter in [5] is currently undefined.  
   Future revision of this draft will determine how the CEM Options 
   word will be used. 
    
   The CEM-MIB[11] calls out a number of CEM performance parameters 
   such as Errored Seconds, Severely Errored Seconds, and Unavailable 
   Seconds.  These terms are currently not defined in this draft.  The 
   definition of these terms is for future consideration. 
    
   The current draft only considers DBA based on SONET/SDH Overhead.  
   It may be desirable to extending DBA to include pattern-based 
   suppression such as long runs of HDLC flags (i.e. 0x7E).   
    
      
    
11. Security Considerations 
    
   As with [5], this document does not affect the underlying security 
   issues of MPLS.

   Appendix A. SONET/SDH Rates and Formats 
    
   For simplicity, the discussion in this section uses SONET 
   terminology, but it applies equally to SDH as well.  SDH-equivalent 
   terminology is shown in the tables. 
    
   The basic SONET modular signal is the synchronous transport signal-
   level 1 (STS-1). A number of STS-1s may be multiplexed into higher-
   level signals denoted as STS-N, with N synchronous payload envelopes 
   (SPEs). The optical counterpart of the STS-N is the Optical Carrier-
   level N, or OC-N. Table 2 lists standard SONET line rates discussed 
   in this document. 
    
    
     OC Level          OC-1    OC-3    OC-12      OC-48     OC-192 
     SDH Term             -   STM-1    STM-4     STM-16     STM-64 
     Line Rate(Mb/s) 51.840 155.520  622.080  2,488.320  9,953.280 
    
                    Table 2. Standard SONET Line Rates 
    
    
   Each SONET frame is 125 ³s and consists of nine rows. An STS-N frame 
   has nine rows and N*90 columns. Of the N*90 columns, the first N*3 
   columns are transport overhead and the other N*87 columns are SPEs. 
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate 
   signal with only one SPE. The optical super-rate signal is denoted 
   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N. 
    
   The first 9-byte column of each SPE is the path overhead (POH) and 
   the remaining columns form the payload capacity with fixed stuff 
   (STS-Nc only).  The fixed stuff, which is purely overhead, is N/3-1 
   columns for STS-Nc.  Thus, STS-1 and STS-3c do not have any fixed 
   stuff, STS-12c has three columns of fixed stuff, and so on. 
    
   The POH of an STS-1 or STS-Nc is always nine bytes in nine rows. The 
   payload capacity of an STS-1 is 86 columns (774 bytes) per frame. 
   The payload capacity of an STS-Nc is (N*87)-(N/3) columns per frame.  
   Thus, the payload capacity of an STS-3c is (3*87 - 1)*9 = 2,340 
   bytes per frame. As another example, the payload capacity of an STS-
   192c is 149,760 bytes, which is exactly 64 times larger than the 
   STS-3c. 
    
   There are 8,000 SONET frames per second. Therefore, the SPE size, 
   (POH plus payload capacity) of an STS-1 is 783*8*8,000 = 50.112 
   Mb/s. The SPE size of a concatenated STS-3c is 2,349 bytes per frame 
   or 150.336 Mb/s. The payload capacity of an STS-192c is 149,760 
   bytes per frame, which is equivalent to 9,584.640 Mb/s. Table 2 
   lists the SPE and payload rates supported.

   To support circuit emulation, the entire SPE of a SONET STS or SDH 
   VC level is encapsulated into packets, using the encapsulation 
   defined in section 5, for carriage across packet-switched networks. 
    
    
Appendix B. ECC-6 Definition 
    
   ECC-6 is an Error Correction Code to protect the CEM header.  This 
   provides single bit correction and the ability to detect up to two 
   bit errors.  
    
    
   Error Correction Code: 
 
 
   |---------------Header bits 0-25 -------------------| ECC-6 code|

                      Figure 7. ECC-6 Check Matrix X 
    
    
   The ECC-6 code protects the 32 bit CEM header as follows: 
    
   The encoder generates the 6 bit ECC using the matrix shown in Figure 
   7.  In brief, the encoder builds another 26 column by 6 row matrix 
   and calculates even parity over the rows.  The matrix columns 
   represent CEM header bits 0 through 25. 
    
   Denote each column of the ECC-6 check matrix by X[], and each column 
   of the intermediate encoder matrix as Y[].  CEM[] denotes the CEM 
   header and ECC[] is the error correction code that is inserted into 
   CEM header bits 26 through 31.

   for i = 0 to 25 { 
        if CEM[i] = 0 { 
                Y[i] = 0; 
        } else {         
                Y[i] = X[i]; 
        } 
   } 
    
   In other words, for each CEM header bit (i) set to 1, set the 
   resulting matrix column Y[i] according to Figure 7. 
    
   The final ECC-6 code is calculated as even parity of each row in Y 
   (i.e. ECC[k]=CEM[25+k]=even parity of row k). 
    
   The receiver also uses matrix X to calculate an intermediate matrix 
   YË based on all 32 bits of the CEM header.  Therefore YË is 32 
   columns wide and includes the ECC-6 code. 
    
   for i = 0 to 31 { 
        if CEM[i] = 0 { 
                YË[i] = 0; 
        } else {         
                YË[i] = X[i]; 
        } 
   } 
 
   The receiver then appends the incoming ECC-6 code to Y as column 32 
   (ECC[0] should align with row 0) and calculates even parity for each 
   row.  The result is a single 6 bit column Z.  If all 6 bits are 0, 
   there are no bit errors (or at least no detectable errors).  
   Otherwise, it uses Z to perform a reverse lookup on X[] from Figure 
   7.  If Z matches column X[i], then there is a single bit error.  The 
   receiver should invert bit CEM[i] to correct the header.  If Z fails 
   to match any column of X, then the CEM header contains more than one 
   bit error and the CEM packet MUST be discarded. 
    
   Note that the ECC-6 code provides single bit correction and 2-bit 
   detection of errors within the received ECC-6 code itself
