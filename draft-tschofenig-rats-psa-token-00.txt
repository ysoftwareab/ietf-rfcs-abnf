      Arm's Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Attestation Token
                   draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token-00

Abstract

   The insecurity of IoT systems is a widely known and discussed
   problem.  The Arm Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is being
   developed to address this challenge by making it easier to build
   secure systems.

   This document specifies token format and claims used in the
   attestation API of the Arm Platform Security Architecture (PSA).

   At its core, the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) format is used and
   populated with a set of claims.  This specification describes what
   claims are used by the PSA and what has been implemented within Arm
   Trusted Firmware-M.

1.  Introduction

   Modern hardware for Internet of Things devices contain trusted
   execution environments and in case of the Arm v8-M architecture
   TrustZone support.  TrustZone on these low end microcontrollers
   allows the separation between a normal world and a secure world where
   security sensitive code resides in the secure world and is executed
   by applications running on the normal world using a well-defined API.

   Various APIs have been developed by Arm as part of the Platform
   Security Architecture [PSA]; this document focuses on the
   functionality provided by the attestation API.  Since the tokens
   exposed via the attestation API are also consumed by services outside
   the device, interoperability needs arise.  In this specification
   these interoperability needs are addressed by a combination of

   -  a set of claims encoded in CBOR,

   -  embedded in a CBOR Web Token (CWT),

   -  protected by functionality offered by the CBOR Object Signing and
      Encryption (COSE) specification.

   Figure 1 shows the architecture graphically.  Apps on the IoT device
   communicate with services on the secure world using a defined API.
   The attestation API exposes tokens, as described in this document,
   and those tokens may be presented to network or application services.

   -  'TS': a component of a Trusted Subsystem

4.  Token Encoding

   The report is represented as a token, which must be formatted in
   accordance to the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) [I-D.mandyam-eat].
   The token consists of a series of claims declaring evidence as to the
   nature of the instance of hardware and software.  The claims are
   encoded in CBOR [RFC7049] format.

5.  Claims

   The token is modelled to include custom values that correspond to the
   following claims suggested in the EAT specification:

   -  nonce (mandatory); arm_psa_nonce is used instead

   -  UEID (mandatory); arm_psa_UEID is used instead

   -  origination (recommended); arm_psa_origination is used instead

   Later revisions of this documents might phase out those custom claims
   to be replaced by the EAT standard claims.

   As noted, some fields must be at least 32 bytes long to provide
   sufficient cryptographic strength.

   3.  Reserved

   4.  Text string (version)

   5.  Byte string (signer ID, >=32 bytes)

   6.  Text string (measurement description)

   The following key values will be present in the software components
   claim: 1 (Type), 2 (Measurement Value), 4 (Version) and 5 (Signer
   ID).  Keys 3 (Reserved) and 6 (Measurement Description) will not be
   present.  Instead of a referenced Measurement Description it is
   defined that all cases, the software measurement value is taken as a
   SHA256 hash of the software image, prior to it executing in place.

6.  Example

   The following example shows an attestation token that was produced
   for a device that has a single-stage bootloader, and an RTOS with a
   device management client.  From a code point of view, the RTOS and
   the device management client form a single binary.

7.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   This specification re-uses the CWT and the EAT specification.  Hence,
   the security and privacy considerations of those specifications apply
   here as well.

   Since CWTs offer different ways to protect the token this
   specification profiles those options and only uses public key
   cryptography.  The token MUST be signed following the structure of
   the COSE specification [RFC8152].  The COSE type MUST be COSE-Sign1.

   Attestation tokens contain information that may be unique to a device
   and therefore they may allow single out an individual device for
   tracking purposes.  Implementation must take to ensure that only
   those claims are included that fulfil the purpose of the application
   and that users of those devices consent to the data sharing.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the claims defined in Section 5 to the
   [RFC8392] created CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims registry [IANA-CWT].
   The change controller are the authors and the reference is this
   document.

Appendix B.  Reference Implementation

   Trusted Firmware M (TF-M) [TF-M] is the name of the open source
   project that provides a reference implementation of PSA APIs, created
   for the latest Arm v8-M microcontrollers with TrustZone technology.
   TF-M provides foundational firmware components that silicon
   manufacturers and OEMs can build on (including trusted boot, secure
   device initialisation and secure function invocation).
