INTERNET DRAFT       Post-Repair Non-RLE loss Count    December 12, 2014


1  Introduction

   RTCP Sender Reports (SR)/Receiver Reports (RR) [RFC3550] contains
   some rough statistics about the data received from the particular
   source indicated in that block. One of them is the cumulative number
   of packets lost, which is called pre- repair loss metric in this
   document. This metric conveys information regarding the total number
   of RTP data packets that have been lost since the beginning of the
   RTP session. However, this metric is measured on media stream before
   any loss repair mechanism, e.g., retransmission [RFC4588] and Forward
   Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109], is applied. Using a repair
   mechanism usually results in recovering some or all of the lost
   packets. Hence, the sending endpoint cannot assess the performance of
   the repair mechanism by observing the change in fraction loss and the
   cumulative loss statistics from RTCP SR/RR [RFC3550]. Consequently,
   [RFC5725] specifies a post-repair loss Run-length Encoding (RLE) XR
   report block to address this issue. The sending endpoint is able to
   infer which packets were repaired from the RLE report block, but at
   the cost of higher overhead. When applications use multiple XR
   blocks, the endpoints may require more concise reporting to save
   bandwidth.

   This document defines a new XR block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] and complement the report block defined in [RFC5725] for
   use in a range of RTP applications. This new block type reports the
   number of primary source RTP packets that are still lost after
   applying one or more loss repair mechanisms. The metrics defined in
   this document are packet level rather than slice/picture level, which
   means the partial recovery of a packet will not be regarded as a
   repaired packet. In addition,  another metric, repaired loss count,
   is also introduced in this report block for calculating the pre-
   repair loss count during the this range, so that the RTP sender or a
   third-party entity is able to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   repair methods used by the system.

   The metrics defined in this document belong to the class of
   transport-related metrics defined in [RFC6792] and are specified in
   accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and [RFC6792]. These
   metrics are applicable to any RTP application, especially those that
   use loss repair mechanisms.

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   sender for the first time. A lost primary source RTP packet may be
   repaired by some other RTP packets used in repair mechanisms like FEC
   or retransmission.


3  Post-Repair Loss Count Metrics Report Block

   This block reports the number of packets lost after applying repair
   mechanisms to complement the RTCP XR metrics defined in [RFC5725].
   This packet may be stacked with other RTCP packets to form compound
   RTCP packets and share the average reporting interval calculated by
   the RTCP method described in [RFC3550]. When comparing this metric
   with pre-repair loss metric of RTCP SR/RR, ambiguity may occur as
   noted in [RFC5725]: Some packets will not be repaired in the current
   RTCP interval. Thus it is RECOMMENDED that this report block should
   be generated only for those source packets that have no further
   chance of being repaired and not for any other packets. This block
   needs to specify its own measurement period to avoid ambiguity in
   calculating the post-repair loss count. The sequence number range
   reported by RTCP SR/RR may contain some sequence numbers of packets
   for which repair might still be possible. To avoid the ambiguity, we
   use begin sequence number and end sequence number to explicitly
   indicate the actual sequence number range that this RTCP XR report
   block reports on as the measurement timing. These metrics defined in
   this report block are all interval metrics and the measurement of
   them is made at the RTP receiver. The relationship between the
   metrics in this report block and the pre-repair loss metric of RTCP
   XR could be expressed in the following formula:

      cumulative number of packets lost = unrepaired loss count +
      repaired loss count + to be repaired lost packet

   "cumulative number of packets lost" is the metric from RTCP SR/RR.
   "unrepaired loss count" and "repaired loss count" are the metrics
   defined in this draft.

   The post-repair loss count metrics report block has the following
   format:

      0               1               2               3               4

          Figure 1: Format for the Post-Repair Loss Count Metrics Report
          Block

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      A Post-Repair Loss Count Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant PRLR.

      [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace PRLR with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]

   Reserved: 8 bits

      These bits are reserved for future use. They MUST be set to zero
      by senders and ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).

   block length: 16 bits

      This field is in accordance with the definition in [RFC3611]. In
      this report block, it MUST be set to 4. The block MUST be
      discarded if the block length is set to a different value.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   begin_seq: 16 bits

      The first sequence number that this block reports on.

   end_seq: 16 bits

      The last sequence number that this block reports on plus one.

   unrepaired loss count: 16 bits

      Total number of packets finally lost after one or more loss-repair
      methods, e.g., FEC and/or retransmission, during this interval.
      This metric MUST NOT count the lost packets for which repair might
      still be possible. Note that this metric MUST measure only primary
      source RTP packets.

   repaired loss count: 16 bits

      Total number of packets fully repaired after one or more loss-

      repair methods, e.g., FEC and/or retransmission, during this
      interval. Note that this metric MUST measure only primary source
      RTP packets.

4  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) for
   signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks. However XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling (see section 5 of [RFC3611]).

4.1  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in Section
   5.1 of [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-prlr-block

   xr-prlr-block = "post-repair-loss-count"

4.2  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameters, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

5  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no new security
   considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611]. This block does
   not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to confidentially
   documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611] does not apply.

   An attacker may put incorrect information in the Post-Repair Loss
   Count reports, which will be affect the performance of loss repair
   mechanisms. Implementers should consider the guidance in [RFC7202]
   for using appropriate security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a
   concern, the implementation should apply encryption and
   authentication to the report block. For example, this can be achieved
   by using the AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP profile as
   defined in [RFC3711]; an appropriate combination of the two profiles
   (an "SAVPF") is specified in [RFC5124]. However, other mechanisms
   also exist (documented in [RFC7201]) and might be more suitable.

6  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration. For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" to
   the "Post-Repair Loss Count Metrics Report Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace PRLR with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

   This document also registers a new parameter "post-repair-loss-count"
   in the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".
