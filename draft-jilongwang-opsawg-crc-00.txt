1.  Introduction

   Network resources have existed objectively, including physical
   resources such as traditional network facilities and access devices,
   as well as virtual resources such as application services and
   information resources, which can be detected using software or
   hardware tools based on certain methods, techniques and standards.
   At present, network resources have not been systematically defined
   and classified.  Most of them are given corresponding names depending
   on their purpose or vendor, but they seem to be in a "divine" state.
   Each resource cannot find its own location in network.

   The complexity and diversity of network resources make the
   traditional categorization methods difficult to cover, unify and
   integrate.  Therefore, it is necessary to establish a framework for
   network resources to systematically classify, define, identify and
   describe all the network.  The objective of this draft is to
   illustrate the applicability of framework for network resources
   categorization through use cases, then discuss the basic methodology
   and propose a not relatively mature framework for continued
   supplement and improvement

   This memo discusses and defines a framework for network resources
   categorization that can identify and describe all the network to
   assist network management.  Network resources are systematically
   named, defined, classified and described to meet the completeness,
   measurability, scalability and relative orthogonality of resources
   categorization from the point of view of the network architecture.
   We provide a unified description of network elements and their
   attributes to support integration and management of surveying and
   mapping information.  The overall standard framework helps to
   establish a network resources database, which can be used as the
   basis for network information storage and sharing in the future.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Methods of linear classification: The classification objects are
   divided into several levels according to specific forms and
   attributes, and each level is divided into several categories.  The



Wang, et al.             Expires March 19, 2020                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Network Resources Categorization      September 2019


   same level category constitutes a parallel relationship, and
   different level categories form a affiliation relationship.

   category in higher level: In the methods of linear classification , a
   category is called category in higher level relative to the next-
   level category directly divided by it.

   category in lower level: In the methods of linear classification, a
   category is called category in lower level relative to the upper-
   level category that classifies the category.

   category in same level: In the methods of linear classification, a
   number of lower-level categories directly classified by a category
   are called category in same level.

3.  Use cases

   The following sections highlight some of the most common framework
   for network resources categorization use case scenarios and are in no
   way exhaustive.

3.1.  Network Management

   Network management is the process of administering and managing
   computer networks.  Services provided by this discipline include
   fault analysis, performance management, provisioning of networks and
   maintaining the quality of service.  Now The variety of resources
   lead to confusion in network.  Network resources as the object of
   network management need to be paid more attention.  But for network
   managers, there is a lack of uniform identification, location and
   management of resources.

   The framework for network resources categorization offers a way for
   network managers to divide the managed resources.  It provides unique
   identities for each resource, that is, all resources can find the
   appropriate location in the resources framework tree.  Then the
   corresponding code, name and attributes are added into the database
   to facilitate unified management.  At the same time, for resources
   with abnormal properties ,it can be located and fixed vulnerabilities
   in time.

3.2.  Network Search

   Now many platforms(Shodan, Censys etc.) detect network from the
   network layer to the application layer based on multiple detection
   technologies.  The main goal is to identify network resources,
   including websites, network hardware, etc and provide network
   identifiable resources search and classification, establish



Wang, et al.             Expires March 19, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Network Resources Categorization      September 2019


   corresponding database to support user full-text search, regular
   expression, boolean logic and digital range search.  But the lack of
   a unified standardized model will lead to inaccurate and incomplete
   retrieval of resources.

   This framework classifies the resources of the whole network.  It can
   be used to fill the resources search database, and cover the
   resources that have not been covered before.  At the same time,
   standardize the storage of network resources and improve the search
   efficiency.

3.3.  Network Security

   Network viruses and worms themselves are also a kind of network
   resources.  With the deepening of network opening and complexity,
   network viruses and worms are evolving constantly, and the
   characteristics of diversity and spatial discretization are
   increasing, resulting in a great hidden danger of network security.

   The framework for network resources categorization can locate the
   network resources more accurately and distinguish the benign or
   malignant network resources, study the process of virus evolution and
   the possible effects according to the attached attributes , and
   provide a clearer way to safeguard the operation of network space
   security, such as anti virus, antivirus and so on.

4.  Methodology for Network Resources Categorization

4.1.  Basic Principles

   The network resources categorization rules SHOULD follow the
   following principles to meet the completeness, measurability,
   scalability and relative orthogonality of resources categorization.

4.1.1.  Scientific principle

   Categorization rules SHOULD be consistent with the basic.
   organizational rules of network resources.

   The resources categorization perspective SHOULD meet the traditional
   internet resources integration requirements, and meet the mapping
   entity integration requirements of the multi-sources mapping
   platform.

   The resources categorization system SHOULD start from the traditional
   network resources system and cover resource elements and have certain
   compatibility.

Internet-Draft      Network Resources Categorization      September 2019


4.1.2.  Systematic principle

   The network resources categorization architecture can sort and
   systemize all network resources according to their characteristics,
   correctly reflect the vertical and horizontal architecture, and form
   a reasonable categorization system.

   Each resource in the system occupies a position.  And it SHALL
   reflect the certain relationship between resources, and profoundly
   reveal the network relationship and the whole picture between
   resources.

4.1.3.  Orthogonality principle

   Each taxonomic unit of each categorization level in the resources
   categorization system SHOULD be mutually incompatible, so that any
   network resource cannot belong to two groups at the same time.  That
   is, the unique encoding allows the network resources to be uniquely
   identified and described.

4.1.4.  Consistency principle

   Categorization design SHOULD be consistent with other national
   standards in related fields, and at the same time meets the original
   information concept and semantic consistency when resources coding
   and code expansion, addition and deletion.

4.1.5.  Scalable principle

   It SHALL meet the needs of the development and change of network
   resources to a great extent.  It can increase the categorization of
   different levels and can also be extended for expansion of unknown
   resources.

4.2.  Requirements on categorization

   This section describes the requirements for categorization of network
   resources . The network resources categorization SHOULD meet these
   requirements to make sure it is orthogonal and accurate.  Note that
   the requirements listed in this section have been separated from the
   context in which they may appear.

   The following template is used for the definition of the
   Requirements:

   Req-ID: An ID composed of a unique two-digit number.

   Description: The rationale and description of the requirement.



Wang, et al.             Expires March 19, 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Network Resources Categorization      September 2019


   The detail requirements on categorization are listed as following:

   Req-ID: 01

   Description: The total range of categories in lower level classified
   by categories in higher level SHOULD be the same as the range of
   categories in higher level.

   Req-ID: 02

   Description: When dividing category in higher level, SHOULD choose
   the same classification perspective to get the categories in lower
   level.

   Req-ID: 03

   Description: The categories in same level SHALL do not intersect, do
   not repeat, and only correspond to a category in higher level.

   Req-ID: 04

   Description: Categorization SHOULD be carried out from high to low,
   and there MUST be no jump.

5.  Framework for Network Resources Categorization

   This framework for network resources categorization uses methods of
   linear classification to classify them into five categories:
   category, sub-category, large, medium and small-category based on the
   above principles and requirements.  It specifies the classification
   names of the categories, Class-I, Class-II, Class-III, Class-IV,
   Class-V, and the small-categories are subdivided and named according
   to the application requirements.

5.1.  Class-I

   Firstly, The categories of network resources are divided into four
   categories: the network infrastructure, the network application
   service, the network data resource and the network virtual body based
   on the sources, applications and activities of network resources.
   Then the 4 categories are further subdivided into 12 sub-categories.

   The following template is used for the definition of the
   categorization of network resources:

   Class-I: The name of network resources category in highest level

5.2.1.  Network Infrastructure

   The Network infrastructure is the physical part of the network
   resources which provides basic support, including various hardware
   devices.  It is the material basis of all network services and is
   divided into the following 5 sub-category based on the internet
   architecture and its network functions, device roles and network
   levels .

5.2.2.  Network application service

   Network application service is an application running on top of the
   network application layer and provide data storage, manipulation,
   rendering, communication, or other capabilities.  These capabilities
   typically use an application layer network protocol.  It is
   classified into inorganic services and organic services based on the
   internet architecture and the unity of a network application service.

5.2.4.  Network virtual subject

   The virtual subject of network refers to the account behavior of the
   network virtual feature stored on the Internet.  The carrier of the
   user in network is a virtual account, So The network virtual subject
   is divided into the following sub- category.

   Class-II: Network account

5.3.  Class-III and Class-IV

   Note that Network infrastructure, the categorization of the large-
   categories are organized from the hierarchical location of the
   network infrastructure in the network architecture and the role
   played by it.

   Note that Network application service, first organize the
   categorization of large-category from the perspective of whether the
   application is based on ports, and then classify these categories
   according to the types of services provided by the application.

   Note that Network data source, firstly the categorization of large-
   categories are organized from whether the data resources need to be
   compiled, the storage mode , structure of the data resources and the
   functions of the data resources are completed.  And then classify
   these categories according to the application scenarios of the data
   and the data are performed.

   On the basis of category and sub-category, the resources are further
   classified and named according to methods of linear classification.
   On the basis of 4 Class-I and 13 Class-II, there are 22 categories,
   of which there are 10 network infrastructure categories,5 network
   application services categories and 7 network data resources
   categories.

5.3.1.  Autonomous domain

   We continue "Autonomous domain" sub-category categorization.

   Class-III: Autonomous domain.
