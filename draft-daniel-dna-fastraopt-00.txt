Abstract

   To minimize router delay in response to Router Solicitation message,
   several scheme are being discussed in IETF.  This document suggests a
   new Neighbor Discovery option which is included in Router
   Solicitation and/or Router Advertisement messages to achieve fast
   network attachment.

1.  Introduction

   All router must delay a response to a Router Solicitation message by
   a random delay between 0 and 500 miliseconds which is defined in

   [RFC2461].  It is because if there is more than one router on the
   link, simultaneously transmitted responses will collide if the
   routers try to answer the Router Solicitation immediately, and,
   additionally, to avoid congestion when a link comes up and all hosts
   on the link solicit.  It's not problem in wired networks, however,
   seems not appropriate in mobile environment since above ramdan delay
   cause a critical problem to achieve fast and seamless handover.

   In general, one proposel is being used to fast Router Solicitation /
   Router Advertisement messages exchange called Fast Router
   Advertisement [I-D.mkhalil-ipv6-fastra].  It newly defines a router
   variable to allow for faster response times in the process of Router
   Solicitations.  Thus, network administrator must configure this
   variable on its router manually.  In addition, routers enabling Fast
   RA will send Router Advertisement in response to all host request on
   the link although fixed hosts do not need fast response in the
   process of Router Solicitation.

   Along with this scheme, DNA Working Group defines new options and
   flags into Router Advertisement messages to eliminate the delays
   introduced by [RFC2461] in discovering the configuration.

   This document suggests a new Neighbor Discovery option which is
   included in Router Solicitation and/or Router Advertisement messages
   to allow the routers to answer the Router Solicitation immediately.
   It does not require any network administrator configuration at all.
   Network entities which can not recognize this option will silently
   discard this option.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Fast Neighbor Discovery Option

   The new option is defined in this section.

   o  Option Type: To be defined by IANA

   o  Option Length: 8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option
      (including the type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The
      value 0 is invalid.  Nodes MUST silently discard an Neighbor
      Discovery packet that contains an option with length zero.

   o  Reserved: Reserved fields for further extensions.

   This option does not have any alignment requirements.

4.  Procedure of Fast Neighbor Discovery

   The processing of Fast ND option is handled like any other ND option
   and no new procedure is needed.  It is so hard to encode a new option
   into current ND stack which is already widely implemented in IPv6
   equipment, so author recommends this option to be accomplished by DNA
   WG when defining its new ND options.

   The Router Solicitation sent by hosts which do not need fast ND
   message exchange in its link will not contain the new Fast ND option
   defined by this document.  Routers which can not recognize the option
   will silently discard this option.

   Mobile entities (routers connected to wireless interface and mobile
   hosts) are able to be configured selectively by network
   administrator.  Thus, mobile nodes will only receive fast Router
   Advertisement in response to Router Solicitation with Fast ND option.

   Once a node has IP-level connectivity with neighboring nodes, the
   node sends a Router Solicitation to obtain an advertisement quickly,
   rather than waits for an unsolicited advertisement from router.  A
   host sends one or more Router Solicitations to the all-routers
   multicast group.  To reduce packet flooding caused by Fast ND on its
   link, the host enabling Fast ND will send Router Solicitations as few
   as it can when generating its golbal scope addresses (I.e., defining
   a new host parameter).  Also, the router enabling Fast ND will only
   answer Router Advertisements in response to link-local source address
   assigned to the sending host.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of Fast ND option is the same as ND protocol security
   concern.  This option does not add any new vulnerability.

   Security issues regarding the ND protocol have been discussed at IETF
   SEND (Securing Neighbor Discovery) Working Group.
