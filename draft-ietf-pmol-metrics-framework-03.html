<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document describes a framework and a process for developing 
      performance metrics for IP-based applications that operate
      over reliable or datagram transport protocols, and that can be used to
      characterize traffic on live networks and services. The framework refers 
      to a Performance Metrics Entity, or PM Entity, which may in future be a 
      working group or directorate or a combination of these two.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Many networking technologies, applications, or services, are distributed
      in nature, and their performance may be impacted by IP impairments, server 
      capacity, congestion and other factors. It is important to measure the 
      performance of applications and services to ensure that quality objectives 
      are being met and to support problem diagnosis. Standardized metrics help to
      ensure that performance measurement is implemented consistently and to
      facilitate interpretation and comparison.
</p>
<p>There are at least three phases in the development of performance
      standards. They are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Definition of a Performance Metric and its units of measure
</li>
<li>Specification of a Method of Measurement
</li>
<li>Specification of the Reporting Format
</li>
</ol><p>During the development of metrics, it is often useful to define
      performance objectives and expected value ranges. However, this is not
      defined as part of the metric specification. 
</p>
<p>This document refers to a Performance Metrics Entity, or PM Entity, which
      may in future be a working group or directorate or a combination of
      these two.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Background and Motivation</h3>

<p>Although the IETF has two active Working Groups dedicated to the
        development of performance metrics, they each have strict limitations
        in their charters:
</p>
<p>- The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has addressed a range of
        networking technologies and protocols in their long history (such as
        IEEE 802.3, ATM, Frame Relay, and Routing Protocols), but the charter
        strictly limits their performance characterizations to the laboratory
        environment.
</p>
<p>- The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group has developed a set of 
        standard metrics that can be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability 
        of Internet data delivery services.  The IPPM metrics development is applicable 
        to live IP networks, but it is specifically prohibited from developing metrics that 
        characterize traffic at upper layers, such as a VoIP stream.
</p>
<p>A BOF held at IETF-69 introduced the IETF community to the
        possibility of a generalized activity to define standardized
        performance metrics. The existence of a growing list of
        Internet-Drafts on performance metrics (with community interest in
        development, but in un-chartered areas) illustrates the need for
        additional performance work. The majority of people present at the BOF
        supported the proposition that IETF should be working in these areas,
        and no one objected to any of the proposals.
</p>
<p>The IETF does have current and completed activities related to the
        reporting of application performance metrics: for example the Real-time 
        Application Quality-of-Service Monitoring (RAQMON) Framework <a class='info' href='#RFC4710'>RFC 4710<span> (</span><span class='info'>Siddiqui, A., Romascanu, D., and E. Golovinsky, &ldquo;Real-time Application Quality-of-Service Monitoring (RAQMON) Framework,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4710], which extends the remote network monitoring
        (RMON) family of specifications to allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS)
        monitoring of various applications that run on devices such as IP phones, 
        pagers, Instant Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other 
        handheld computing devices.
</p>
<p>The IETF is also actively involved in the development of reliable 
        transport protocols which would affect the relationship between IP 
        performance and application performance.
</p>
<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm not sure what the previous sentence refers to?
</p>
<p>Thus there is a gap in the currently chartered coverage of IETF
        WGs: development of performance metrics for non-IP-layer protocols
        that can be used to characterize performance on live networks.
</p>
<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: must extend on the "non-IP-layer". Could be above L4 
        such as voice specific metrics, but also L2 such as (G)MPLS

Quality of Service</h3>

<p>The Quality of Service (QoS) is defined similarly to the ITU

        Totality of characteristics of a telecommunications service that bear 
        on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs of the user of the service.

Quality of Experience</h3>

<p>The Quality of Experience (QoE) is defined similarly to the ITU

        <a class='info' href='#E800'>E800<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ITU-T Recommendation E.800. SERIES E: OVERALL NETWORK            OPERATION, TELEPHONE SERVICE, SERVICE OPERATION AND HUMAN FACTORS,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [E800], i.e.:
        a statement expressing the level 
        of quality that customers/users believe they have experienced.
</p>
<p>NOTE 1 – The level of QoS experienced and/or perceived by the customer/user 
        may be expressed by an opinion rating.
</p>
<p>NOTE 2 – QoSE has two main man components: quantitative and qualitative. 
        The quantitative component can be influenced by the complete end-to-end 
        system effects (network infrastructure).
</p>
<p>NOTE 3 – The qualitative component can be influenced by user expectations, 
        ambient conditions, psychological factors, application context, etc.
</p>
<p>NOTE 4 – QoSE may also be considered as QoSD received and interpreted by a 
        user with the pertinent qualitative factors influencing his/her perception 
        of the service.

Purpose and Scope</h3>

<p>The purpose of this document is to define a framework and a process for
      developing performance metrics for IP-based applications that operate
      over reliable or datagram transport protocols, and that can be used to
      characterize traffic on live networks and services. As such, this document 
      will not define any performance metrics.
</p>
<p>The scope of this document includes the support of metric definition for
      any protocol developed by the IETF. However this document is not intended to
      supercede existing working methods within Working Groups that have existing
      chartered work in this area. 
</p>
<p>This process is not intended to govern performance metric development
      in existing IETF WG that are focused on metrics development, such as
      IPPM and BMWG. However, the framework and guidelines may be useful in
      these activities, and MAY be applied where appropriate. A typical example 
      is the development of performance metrics to be exported with the IPFIX
      protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC5101'>RFC 5101<span> (</span><span class='info'>Claise, B., &ldquo;Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5101], with specific IPFIX information
      elements <a class='info' href='#RFC5102'>RFC 5102<span> (</span><span class='info'>Quittek, J., Bryant, S., Claise, B., Aitken, P., and J. Meyer, &ldquo;Information Model for IP Flow Information Export,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5102], which would benefit from
      the framework in this document. 
</p>
<p>The framework in this document applies to performance metrics derived from
      both active and passive measurements.

QoS versus Application Performance Metrics versus QoE</h3>

<p>QoS deals with the network and protocol, while QoE deals with the 
      notion of a user in a context of a task or a service. As a consequence, 
      QoE leads to the notion of Application Performance Metrics. For example, 
      QoS performance metrics contain the one-way delay and the delay variation 
      <a class='info' href='#RFC5481'>RFC 5481<span> (</span><span class='info'>Morton, A. and B. Claise, &ldquo;Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5481] and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) 
      <a class='info' href='#P.800'>P.800<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ITU-T Recommendation P.800. : Methods for subjective            determination of transmission quality,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [P.800] can be modelled and calculated as an 
      Application Performance Metric for multimedia applications. However, the MOS 
      for a particular user in the specific context such as a conference call, 
      an IPTV or an emergency call are different QoE's. Finally, QoS and 
      Application Performance Metrics are quantitative, while QoE is 
      qualitative.
</p>
<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: not too happy about the MOS example, as it's debatable 
      whether MOS is QoE or Applicatoin Performance Metric? If there is a
      better example...

Identifying and Categorizing the Audience</h3>

<p>Many of the aspects of metric definition and reporting, even the 
        selection or determination of the essential metrics, depend on who 
        will use the results, and for what purpose: in order to properly maintain 
        service quality? or to identify and quantify problems? The question, "How 
        will the results be used?" usually yields important factors to consider 
        when developing performance metrics.
</p>
<p>All documents defining performance metrics SHOULD identify the primary
        audience and its associated requirements.  The audience can influence

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Definitions of a Metric</h3>

<p>A metric is a measure of an observable behavior of an networking technology, 
        an application, or a service. Most of the time, the metric can be 
        directly measured. However, sometimes, the metric definition is computed:
        it assumes some implicit or explicit underlying statistical process. 
        In such case, the metric is an estimate of a parameter of this process, 
        assuming that that the statistical process closely models the behavior 
        of the system.
</p>
<p>A metric should serve some defined purpose. This may include the
        measurement of capacity, quantifying how bad some problem is,
        measurement of service level, problem diagnosis or location and other
        such uses. A metric may also be an input to some other process, for
        example the computation of a composite metric or a model or simulation
        of a system. Tests of the "usefulness" of a metric include:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(i) the degree to which its absence would cause significant
            loss of information on the behavior or performance of the application or
            system being measured
</p>
<p>(ii) the correlation between the performance metric, the QoS 
            <a class='info' href='#G1000'>G1000<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;ITU-T Recommendation G.1000. Communications Quality of			 	             Service: A framework and definitions,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [G1000] and QoE delivered to the 
            user (person or other application)
</p>
<p>(iii) the degree to which the metric is able to support the
            identification and location of problems affecting service
            quality.
</p>
<p>(iv) the requirement to develop policies (Service Level Agreement,
            and potentially Service Level Contract) based on the metric.
</p>
</blockquote><p>For example, consider a distributed application operating
        over a network connection that is subject to packet loss. A Packet
        Loss Rate (PLR) metric is defined as the mean packet loss rate over
        some time period. If the application performs poorly over network
        connections with high packet loss rate and always performs well when
        the packet loss rate is zero then the PLR metric is useful to some
        degree. Some applications are sensitive to short periods of high loss
        (bursty loss) and are relatively insensitive to isolated packet loss
        events; for this type of application there would be very weak
        correlation between PLR and application performance. A "better" metric
        would consider both the packet loss rate and the distribution of loss
        events. If application performance is degraded when the PLR exceeds
        some rate then a useful metric may be a measure of the duration and
        frequency of periods during which the PLR exceeds that rate.

Composed Metrics</h3>

<p>Some metrics may not be measured directly, but may be composed from
        base metrics that have been measured. A composed metric is derived from 
        other metrics by applying a deterministic process or function (e.g., 
        a composition function). The process may use metrics that are identical 
        to the metric being composed, or metrics that are dissimilar, or some 
        combination of both types.Usually the base metrics have a limited scope 
        in time or space, and they can be combined to estimate the performance 
        of some larger entities.
</p>
<p>Some examples of composed metrics and composed metric definitions 
        are:
</p>
<p>Spatial Composition is defined as the composition of metrics of the
        same type with differing spatial domains 
        <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ippm&#8209;framework&#8209;compagg]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Morton, A., &ldquo;Framework for Metric Composition,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> 
        <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ippm&#8209;spatial&#8209;composition]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Morton, A. and E. Stephan, &ldquo;Spatial Composition of Metrics,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. For spatially
        composed metrics to be meaningful, the spatial domains should be non-
        overlapping and contiguous, and the composition operation should be
        mathematically appropriate for the type of metric.
</p>
<p>Temporal Composition is defined as the composition of sets of metrics
        of the same type with differing time spans <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;ippm&#8209;framework&#8209;compagg]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Morton, A., &ldquo;Framework for Metric Composition,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. For temporally
        composed metrics to be meaningful, the time spans should be
        non-overlapping and contiguous, and the composition operation should
        be mathematically appropriate for the type of metric.
</p>
<p>Temporal Aggregation is a summarization of metrics into a smaller
        number of metrics that relate to the total time span covered by the
        original metrics. An example would be to compute the minimum,
        maximum and average values of a series of time sampled values of a
        metric.

<p>An Index is a metric for which the output value range has been

Outline</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>A metric definition MUST have a normative part that defines what

        informative part that describes the metric and its application.

<a name="rfc.section.6.4.2"></a><h3>6.4.2.&nbsp;
Normative parts of metric definition</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>The normative part of a metric definition MUST define at least the
        following: 
</p>
<p>(i) Metric Name
</p>
<p> Metric names MUST be unique within the set of metrics being defined	 		
	        and MAY be descriptive.
</p>
<p> (ii) Metric Description
</p>
<p> The description MUST explain what the metric is, what is being	 		
	        measured and how this relates to the performance of the system being			
	        measured.
</p>
<p> (iii) Collection Method
</p>
<p> EDITOR'S NOTE: remove "measurement" in "measurement method" as this
        this method can be measured, estimated or computed". Looking for a generic 
        term -> collection method? Do we want to change from measurement to 
        collection all over?
</p>
<p>This MUST define what is being measured, estimated or computed and
           the specific algorithm to be used. Terms such as "average" should be
           qualified (e.g. running average or average over some interval).
           Exception cases SHOULD also be defined with the appropriate handling
           method. For example, there are a number of commonly used metrics
           related to packet loss; these often don't define the criteria by
           which a packet is determined to be lost (vs very delayed) or how
           duplicate packets are handled. For example, if the average packet
           loss rate during a time interval is reported, and a packet's arrival
           is delayed from one interval to the next then was it "lost" during
           the interval during which it should have arrived or should it be
           counted as received?
</p>
<p>Some parameters linked to the method MAY also be reported, in 
          order to fully interpret the performance metric. For example, the 
          time interval, the load, the minimum packet loss, etc...
</p>
<p>(iv) Units of measurement 
</p>
<p>The units of measurement MUST be clearly stated.
</p>
<p> (v) Measurement Point(s)
</p>
<p>If the measurement is specific to a measurement point this SHOULD be
        defined. The measurement domain MAY also be defined. Specifically, if 
        measurement points are spread across domains, the measurement domain 
        (intra-, inter-) is another factor to consider.
</p>
<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: discuss that the collection is not necessarily 
         scoped to a single observation point.
</p>
<p> (vi) Measurement timing
</p>
<p>The acceptable range of timing intervals or sampling intervals for a
           measurement and the timing accuracy required for such intervals MUST
           be specified. Short sampling intervals or frequent samples provide
           a rich source of information that can help to assess application
           performance but may lead to excessive measurement data. Long 
           measurement or sampling intervals reduce the amount of reported
           and collected data such that it may be insufficient to understand
           application performance or service quality insofar as the measured 
           quantity may vary significantly with time.
</p>
<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: explain that, in case of multiple measurement points,
        synchronized clocks might be required. See RFC5481

Informative parts of metric definition</h3>

<p>The informative part of a metric specification is intended to support
              the implementation and use of the metric. This part SHOULD provide
              the following data:
</p>
<p>(i) Implementation 
</p>
<p>The implementation description MAY be in the form of text, algorithm
              or example software. The objective of this part of the metric
              definition is to assist implementers to achieve a consistent result.
</p>
<p>(ii) Verification
</p>
<p>The metric definition SHOULD provide guidance on verification
              testing. This may be in the form of test vectors, a formal
              verification test method or informal advice.
</p>
<p>(iii) Use and Applications
</p>
<p>The Use and Applications description is intended to assist the "user"
              to understand how, when and where the metric can be applied, and what
              significance the value range for the metric may have. This MAY
              include a definition of the "typical" and "abnormal" range of the
              metric, if this was not apparent from the nature of the metric.
</p>
<p>For example: 
</p>
<p>(a) it is fairly intuitive that a lower packet loss rate
                 would equate to better performance. However the user may
                 not know the significance of some given packet loss rate,
</p>
<p>(b) the speech level of a telephone signal is commonly expressed
                 in dBm0. If the user is presented with:
</p>
<p>Speech level = -7 dBm0 
</p>
<p>this is not intuitively understandable, unless the user is a
               telephony expert. If the metric definition explains that the
               typical range is -18 to -28 dBm0, a value higher than -18
               means the signal may be too high (loud) and less than -28
               means that the signal may be too low (quiet), it is much
               easier to interpret the metric. 
</p>
<p>(iv) Reporting Model
</p>
<p>The Reporting Model definition is intended to make any relationship
              between the metric and the reporting model clear. There are often
              implied relationships between the method of reporting metrics and the
              metric itself, however these are often not made apparent to the
              implementor. For example, if the metric is a short term running average 
              packet delay variation (e.g. PPDV as defined in RFC3550) and this value is
              reported at intervals of 6-10 seconds, the resulting measurement may 
              have limited accuracy when packet delay variation is non-stationary.

             hour, per day). If Gmin is set to 0 then a burst of packet loss
             would comprise only consecutive lost packets, whereas a Gmin of 16
             would define bursts as periods of both lost and received packets
             (sparse bursts) having a loss rate of greater than 5.9%.
</p>
<p>Method: Bursts may be detected using the Markov Model
             algorithm defined in RFC3611. The BurstPacketLossFrequency is
             calculated by counting the number of burst events within the defined
             measurement interval. A burst that spans the boundary between two
             time intervals shall be counted within the later of the two
             intervals.
</p>
<p>Units of Measurement: Bursts per time interval (e.g. per second, per
             hour, per day)
</p>
<p>Measurement Timing: This metric can be used over a wide range of time
             intervals. Using time intervals of longer than one hour may prevent
             the detection of variations in the value of this metric due to time-
             of-day changes in network load. Timing intervals should not vary
             in duration by more than +/- 2%.
</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines: See RFC3611.
</p>
<p>Verification Testing: See Appendix for C code to generate test
             vectors.
</p>
<p>Use and Applications: This metric is useful to detect IP network
             transients that affect the performance of applications such as
             Voice over IP or IP Video. The value of Gmin may be selected to
             ensure that bursts correspond to a packet loss rate that would
             degrade the performance of the application of interest (e.g. 16 for
             VoIP).
</p>
<p>Reporting Model: This metric needs to be associated with a defined
             time interval, which could be defined by fixed intervals or by a
             sliding window.

Timing accuracy</h3>

<p>The accuracy of the timing of a measurement may affect the accuracy
              of the metric. This may not materially affect a sampled value metric
              however would affect an interval based metric. Some metrics, for
              example the number of events per time interval, would be directly
              affected; for example a 10% variation in time interval would
              lead directly to a 10% variation in the measured value. Other
              metrics, such as the average packet loss rate during some time
              interval, would be affected to a lesser extent.
           
</p>
<p>If it is necessary to correlate sampled values or intervals then it
              is essential that the accuracy of sampling time and interval start/
              stop times is sufficient for the application (for example +/- 2%).

Dependencies of metric definitions on related events or metrics</h3>

<p>Metric definitions may explicitly or implicitly rely on factors that
              may not be obvious. For example, the recognition of a packet as
              being "lost" relies on having some method to know the packet was
              actually lost (e.g. RTP sequence number), and some time threshold
              after which a non-received packet is declared as lost. It is
              important that any such dependencies are recognized and incorporated
              into the metric definition.

<ul class="text">
<li>singleton, an elementary instance, or "atomic" value.

Parameters, the variables of a metric</h3>

<p>Metrics are completely defined when all options and input variables

        indicates that the user must set them and report them with the 
        results.  Such variables are called "parameters" in the IPPM metric 
        template.  The scope of the metric, the time at which it was 
        conducted, the settings for timers and the thresholds for counters 
        are all examples of parameters.

</p>
<p>Proposals SHOULD be vetted by the corresponding protocol
        development Working Group prior to discussion by the PM Entity. This
        aspect of the process includes an assessment of the need for the
        metrics proposed and assessment of the support for their development
        in IETF.
</p>
<p>Proposals SHOULD include an assessment of interaction and/or
        overlap with work in other Standards Development Organizations.
</p>
<p>Proposals SHOULD specify the intended audience and users of the
        metrics. The development process encourages participation by members
        of the intended audience.
</p>
<p>Proposals SHOULD survey the existing standards work in the area and
        identify additional expertise that might be consulted, or possible
        overlap with other standards development orgs.
</p>
<p>Proposals SHOULD identify any security and IANA requirements.
       Security issues could potentially involve revealing of user
       identifying data or the potential misuse of active test tools. IANA
       considerations may involve the need for a metrics registry.

Proposal Approval</h3>

<p>New work item proposals SHALL be approved using the existing IETF
           process.
</p>
<p>The process depends on the form that the PM Entity ultimately takes, 
           Directorate or working group.
</p>
<p>In all cases, the proposal will need to achieve consensus, in the 
           corresponding protocol development working group (or alternatively, 
           an "Area" working group with broad charter), that there is interest 
           and a need for the work.
</p>
<p>IF the PM Entity is a Directorate,
</p>
<p>THEN Approval SHOULD include the following steps
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>consultation with the PM Directorate, using this framework document
</li>
<li>consultation with Area Director(s)
</li>
<li>and possibly IESG approval of a new or revised charter for the
           working group
</li>
</ul>

<p>IF the PM Entity is a Working Group, and the protocol development 
           working group decides to take up the work under its charter,
</p>
<p>THEN the approval is the same as the PM Directorate steps above, with 
           the possible additional assignment of a PM Advisor for the work item.
</p>
<p>IF the PM Entity is a Working Group, and the protocol development 
           working group decides it does not have sufficient expertise to 
           take-up the work, or the proposal falls outside the current charter,
</p>
<p>THEN
</p>
<p>Approval SHOULD include the following steps
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>identification of protocol expertise to support metric development
</li>
<li>consensus in the PM working group that there is interest and a
           need for the work, and that a document conforming to this framework

PM Entity Interaction with other WGs</h3>

<p>The PM Entity SHALL work in partnership with the related protocol

        performance metrics for a protocol. A sufficient number of individuals
        with expertise must be willing to consult on the draft. If the related
        WG has concluded, comments on the proposal should still be sought from
        key RFC authors and former chairs, or from the WG mailing list if it
        was not closed.
</p>
<p>Existing mailing lists SHOULD be used however a dedicated mailing
        list MAY be initiated if necessary to facilitate work on a draft.
</p>
<p>In some cases, it will be appropriate to have the IETF session
        discussion during the related protocol WG session, to maximize
        visibility of the effort to that WG and expand the review.
