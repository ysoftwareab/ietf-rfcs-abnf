Abstract

      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
      (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
      community.  In particular, it defines a basic set of managed
      objects for SNMP-based monitoring and management of the Internet
      Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP).

      This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to
      the SMIv2.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
      framework and existing SNMP standards.

      This memo is a product of the IP Storage (IPS) working group

1.  Introduction

      The iFCP protocol provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality on
      a IP network in which TCP/IP switching and routing elements
      replace Fibre Channel components.  This draft provides a
      mechanism to manage an iFCP connection using SNMP.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

      The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
      components:

       o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

       o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
           the purpose of management.  The first version of this
           Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
           and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC
           1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version,
           called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578],
           STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

       o   Message protocols for transferring management information.
           The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
           SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A
           second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an
           Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and
           described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The
           third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
           described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC
           2574 [RFC2574].

       o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.

   Internet Draft              iFCP MIB                       May 2002

           The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
           formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A
           second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats
           is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

       o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
           [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
           described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

      A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
      Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

      Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
      termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
      MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

      This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
      A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
      appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be
      semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are
      omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
      Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
      textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
      However, this loss of machine readable information is not
      considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

      The iFCP protocol can be used by IP based storage devices for FCP
      compatible storage.  The iFCP MIB is designed to allow SNMP to be
      used to monitor and manage an iFCP gateway.

4.  Technical Description

      The MIB is divided into several sections for iFCP local device
      and N Port information, remote iFCP device information, iFCP
      sessions, and iFCP session statistics.

6.  Security Considerations

      There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
      have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
      objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
      environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
      environment without proper protection can have a negative effect
      on network operations.

      SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
      network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
      access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
      this MIB.

      It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
      features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
      use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the
      View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is
      recommended.

      It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
      entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
      configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
      (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
      (change/create/delete) them.
