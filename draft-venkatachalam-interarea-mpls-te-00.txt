1. Abstract

In this draft, we propose architecture for the inter-area LSP setup 
based on criteria (combination of constraints). We derive the
architectural requirements for the routing protocols, signaling
protocols and the MIBs to support such an idea. We also demonstrate
how such a mechanism will reduce the crankback during LSP setup.
A possible outline of the modifications to the CSPF algorithm and
examples are presented. In the companion document [INTER_AREA_EXT]
we elaborate on the extensions required for such architecture.

3. Introduction

Current work in the MPLS traffic engineering group (such as 
[TE_FRAMEWORK], [QOS_CONST]) focuses only on the intra-area LSP setup 
issues. In this work we propose an architecture to extend the 
traffic engineering capability across IGP areas and recommend relevant 
modifications to the routing protocols, signaling protocols and MIBs. 

The ISP's networks are divided into Autonomous Systems (Ass), where 
each AS is divided into IGP areas to allow the hiding and aggregating 
of routing information. Although this concept of hierarchical routing 
by an IGP makes sense from the routing perspective, it is a bottleneck 
for traffic engineering as it hides the path taken by a packet to 
destinations in the other routing areas. Hence, from the TE 
perspective, requirements such as path selection and crankback need 
different architectural additions to the existing IGPs and 
signaling protocols for inter-area LSP setup.

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

Traffic engineering practice currently involves the setup and use of 
Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as dedicated bandwidth pipes between two 
end points. LSPs can be setup across several routers, either through 
the use of manually specified routes, or routes that are computed. 
The routes can be computed offline through the use of a dedicated tool, 
or through the use of online constraint based routing using an IGP 
[IGP_REQ, RSVP_EXT]. 

The offline tool will be centralized, and has the advantage of being 
able to consider the traffic pattern history over a large period of 
time, and hence will be efficient in optimizing the resources over 
time, not just the particular instant when the request is received. 
The offline traffic engineering tool, if also used for LSP setup in 
addition to routing, may be able to optimize the resources across LSPs. 
This would include mechanisms to tear down LSP segments and reroute 
them when better resources become available or new requests arrive.

The online constraint based routing model [IGP_REQ] requires 
(1) a constraint based routing process implemented on certain LSRs 
that serve as LERs to the LSPs, and (2) a set of mechanisms to 
flood out and maintain the TE characteristics of the topology. 

>From [TOOL_VS_RP] discussion, it is clear that traffic engineering 
can be implemented with the help of tools and routing protocol 
extensions, as initiated by [IGP_REQ]. Although there has been 
some work in the area of realizing some of the issues such as 
TE crankback [CRANKBACK] and DiffServ realizations [QOS_CONST], 
[QOS_TE_EXT], no work has been performed that is either directly 
related to the inter-area extensions or a framework for such in the 
TE working group.

In our solution, we propose to send across IGP areas, the summary 
routes containing criteria-based route attributes, which will be 
used at the ASBRs in their TE path computation. Since an off-line 
TE tool cannot compute the complete explicit path from ASBR to ASBR 
unless it knows the complete routing table of the AS, we expect to have 
loose path specification, which can be translated into explicit path 
in-steps at the intermediate ABRs. The solutions we are providing in 
this draft are applicable to the destination networks inside the AS 
or outside the AS. For the sake of simplicity we consider the 
customer networks inside an autonomous system.

In section 4, we present the outline of the architecture, which will be
used to derive the routing and signaling requirements in section 5. 
We present examples in section 6 to consolidate the ideas presented 
in this document. Scalability issues of these solutions are discussed 
in section 7. Security considerations, acknowledgements and references 
follow in sections 8, 9 and 10.

4. Architecture

4.1 Definitions

LSP section: An LSP section is that part of the inter-area LSP that 
lies completely inside an IGP area; the inter-area LSP is a sequence 
of LSP sections, connected at the ABRs. Each LSP section lies in a 
different area.

Criteria: A criteria is a combination of the constraints (as specified 
in the works in progress, such as [CR_ROUTING], [QOS_CONST]), which 
will provide a path setup mechanism to choose between different paths 
available between two end-points of the LSP.

4.2 Approach

The current inter-area approaches try to setup an LSP across areas 
without prior knowledge of the resources available across the area 
boundaries. If the required constraints on the resources is not met, 
crankback schemes [CRANCKBACK] are used to backtrack to the previous 
nodes and take an alternate path. This may turn out to be very 
expensive in terms of the time needed to compute a new alternate path, 
resources needed to maintain the state information to determine an 
alternate path (which is different from the current path kept as state 
information in memory), and the complexity of the setup algorithm. 

This draft presents an approach to solving the problem of LSP setup 
across IGP areas, through the use of the following components:

- IGP intra-area TE advertisements [INTRA_AREA, IGP_REQ] 
- IGP inter-area TE summary advertisements [INTER_TE_OSPF, INTER_TE_EXT]
  and 
- Extensions to the signaling protocols [INTER_TE_EXT]

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

Our approach relies on the inter-area summary TE resource availability 
information to determine efficiently whether an inter-area path to the 
destination is at all possible with the constraints given. This 
inter-area TE resource availability information is obtained from the 
link state IGPs based on TE extensions [INTER_TE_OSPF, INTER_TE_EXT]. 

These extensions provide a means to summarize the TE resource 
availability attributes of destinations outside an area and advertise 
these summaries into the target area by its ABR. Our solution is 
independent of the TE attributes that need to be summarized with some 
restrictions as discussed in the following sections. Since these 
summaries provide a clear picture of the resources available across 
areas, the probability of encountering a node (in another area) where 
resources cannot be allocated to the LSP, is minimized. The summary TE 
resource availability information also helps in determining the ABR 
that is "closest" to the destination in terms of the resources required 
for the LSP section. This determination is similar to the route 
calculation based on summarized routes across areas in the link state 
IGPs. Our draft presents a two criteria approach when selecting 
the ABR. 

At the originating node of the LSP, the ABR that is in the path to 
the destination with the most resources is determined using the 
TE summary LSAs. The originating node will then compute an intra-area 
path to this ABR based on the constraints. Such an intra-area path 
computation will be based on the intra-area TE LSAs [INTRA_AREA]
[IGP_REQ]. Once a path to the ABR determined, an LSP is setup from the 
originating node to the ABR using the MPLS signaling mechanisms of 
RVSP-TE or CR-LDP. The signaling mechanisms of RSVP and CR-LDP will be 
extended to carry the constraints of the LSP. Hence at the transit ABR,
the original constraints are available for any further routing 
calculations. 

Once the first LSP section is setup up from the originating node of 
the LSP to the ABR (say ABR1), ABR1 will try to setup the next LSP 
section. If the final destination (of the inter-area LSP) 
is in one of ABR1's directly connected areas, the next LSP section 
is the last LSP section and terminates at the final destination of 
the inter-area LSP. Else, if the final destination (of the inter-area 
LSP) is in an area that can only be reached through another ABR 
(say ABR2), the next LSP section is a transit LSP section between 
ABR1 and ABR2.

S. Venkatachalam, S. Dharanikota  Expires February 2001         [Page 5]

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

ABR1 will perform an intra-area route computation to determine a path 
for the next LSP section based on the constraints. ABR1 will then 
perform the signalling to setup this next LSP section. Once this 
LSP section is setup, ABR1 will splice the previous LSP section and 
the new LSP section such that the egress of the previous LSP section 
feeds directly into the ingress of the new LSP section.

If the LSP section just setup is the last LSP section, the constraint 
based LSP setup process is complete.

Else, if the LSP section just setup is a transit LSP section to ABR2, 
the process of setting up an new LSP section toward the destination 
continues at ABR2, just like at ABR1. This process of setting up LSP 
sections is iterative, till the destination node is reached. 

If at any point in the LSP setup process an LSP setup is a failure, 
due to unavailability of resources, the LSP setup cranks back to the 
immediately preceding ABR. 

In an OSPF domain with no virtual links, a maximum of three LSP 
sections are possible (when the originating node and destination 
nodes are in different areas, neither of which is the backbone area). 

4.3 Concept of criteria

The LSP path setup mechanisms will use the criteria to determine 
the best possible path for the LSPs. We introduce the concept of 
primary and secondary criteria to determine the possible alternative 
paths for the LSPs. The application, which is requesting for an LSP 
setup, should be able to request for both the criteria, which will be 
used by the transit ABRs to determine the alternative path in case of 
a path with the primary criteria is not available.

The concept of primary and secondary criteria is useful in the 
following cases:

- The resources to satisfy the primary criteria are not available in 
  the intermediate areas - use the secondary instead of the primary 
  criteria to reduce the crankback,
- The LSAs propagated by the IGP are not up-to-date and hence a failure 
  occurs at the intermediate routers, and
- The intermediate ABRs make their own decisions based on the secondary 
  criteria to reduce LSP setup time during crankback.

S. Venkatachalam, S. Dharanikota  Expires February 2001         [Page 6]

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

The following are the guidelines for the proper operation of this 
concept:

- The Secondary criteria SHOULD be a subset of the primary criteria 
  or at least SHOULD be lower/inferior in terms of the resource 
  requirements. 
- Both the primary and the secondary criteria SHOULD consist of TE 
  attributes that are derivable from the summary information allowed 
  to propagate across the ABRs, according to the proposed MIB 
  requirements in the following sections.
- The LSP constraints for the inter-area LSP can be a combination of 
  several TE attributes which can be satisfied during intra-area path 
  computation. However, the primary criteria (and hence the secondary 
  criteria) used for inter-area computations SHOULD be a subset of 
  these LSP constraints so that the inter-area computations are not 
  expensive.
- Once a secondary criteria section is setup during path establishment, 
  the remaining path computation SHOULD be performed based on the 
  secondary criteria.
- (Primary/secondary criteria, Primary LSP) SHOULD be complimentary to 
  (Primary/Secondary criteria, Backup LSP), i.e., the primary and 
  backup LSPs SHOULD not have any intersecting path.

4.3.1 Example for the selection of criteria

Consider the following TE constraints:

- Class types [QOS_CONST],
- Available bandwidth [TE_FRAMEWORK],
- Color [TE_FRAMEWORK],
- TE metric [TE_FRAMEWORK],
- Delay,
- Number of hops, etc.

S. Venkatachalam, S. Dharanikota  Expires February 2001         [Page 7]

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

A criterion can be a combination of the above constraints, such as 
(Class type 1, Available bandwidth = 10, Red color). If this is the 
primary criteria, then the secondary criteria should be a subset of 
the primary, such as (Class type 2, Color Red) where Class type 2 is 
inferior to Class type 1 in terms of "some" requirements. Also note 
that the available bandwidth requirement is also relaxed in the 
secondary criteria.

Although it is not recommended that a summary LSA should advertise 
all the above constraints into other areas (from scalability 
point-of-view), note that for a  criteria to be accepted 
(either primary or secondary) for LSP setup, it should be derivable 
from the summary LSA TE constraints. This poses the MIB requirements 
as mentioned in the above subsection on the guidelines.

4.4 Routing algorithm

The process of setting up an LSP across areas is as follows:

   1. Determine the closest ABR that has the best possible route based 
      on the constraints, to the inter-area destination,
   2. Calculate an intra-area route from the originating node to the 
      transit ABR that satisfies the constraints,
   3. Setup an LSP section (intra-area) from the originating node to 
      the transit ABR,
   4. Transfer the constraints to the routing process of the transit 
      ABR,
   5. If the final destination is not in this area, repeat the setup 
      process of 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the next LSP section, with the ABR 
      at the head of the LSP section. Splice the egress of the upstream 
      LSP section and the ingress of the downstream LSP section.
   6. If the destination is in this area, calculate an intra-area route 
      from the originating node to the destination that satisfies the 
      constraints, and splice the egress of the original LSP and the 
      ingress of the new LSP.
   7. If at any time in the setup of any LSP section is a failure, 
      then crankback to the immediately preceding ABR and perform 
      a new LSP section setup, up to a maximum of certain number of 
      attempts.

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

   The routing process at the head node of each LSP section performs 
   the following calculation:
   1. If the destination is in the same area, perform a complete
      intra-area route calculation based on all the constraints.
   2. If the destination is outside the area, do the following 
      computation:
      2.1 ABR-list = {list of all ABRs in the area}
      2.2 While (ABR-list != {})  /* do while ABR-list is not empty */
	  {
	    2.2.1 Use the inter-area TE summary LSAs to determine 
		  the ABR with the greatest resources that satisfies 
		  the primary criterion
            2.2.2 If no such ABR, break to 2.3
	    2.2.3 Use the intra-area TE LSAs to determine a path
		  to the selected ABR that satisfies all the 
		  constraints of the LSP
            2.2.4 If such a path is found, start the signalling process
		  to setup the LSP section to the selected ABR.
            2.2.5 Else, ABR-list = ABR-list - {selected ABR}
          }
      2.3 ABR-list = {list of all ABRs in the area}
      2.4 While (ABR-list != {})  /* do while ABR-list is not empty */
	  {
	    2.4.1 Use the inter-area TE summary LSAs to determine 
		  the ABR with the greatest resources that satisfies 
		  the secondary criterion
            2.4.2 If no such ABR, break to 2.5
	    2.4.3 Use the intra-area TE LSAs to determine a path
		  to the selected ABR that satisfies all the 
		  constraints of the LSP
            2.4.4 If such a path is found, start the signalling process
		  to setup the LSP section to the selected ABR.
            2.4.5 Else, ABR-list = ABR-list - {selected ABR}
          }
      2.5 LSP setup is a failure - signal back

   In the case of backup LSP computation, the above algorithm applies 
   with the following changes:
   1) In 2.1 and 2.3:
      ABR-list = {list of all ABRs in the area} - {list of ABRs in the 
						   primary LSP}
   2) In 2.2.3 and 2.4.3, calculate the inter-area path that doesn't 
      include any nodes in the primary path

The following sections detail the requirements for the routing and 
signaling components, crankback and general applicability.

5. Requirements of the solution

The requirements of criteria-based inter-area routing are separated 
into routing protocol requirements, signaling protocol requirements 
and other requirements.

5.1 Requirements for the IGP

5.1.1  Intra-area requirements

The IGP SHOULD support [INTRA_TE] to advertise and distribute the TE 
information of the interfaces of the area. When there is a request 
for the setup of a constraint based LSP within the area, the IGP will 
determine the best path that satisfies the constraints by performing 
a CSPF computation on the TE resources of the area, as specified by 
the intra-area TE-LSAs.

With respect to the setup of LSPs within an area, the constraints 
on the LSP can be one or more of the TE attributes flooded by the IGP 
in the intra-area TE LSA.

5.1.2 Inter-area requirements

The Inter-area TE summary information is used by the route computation 
process:

- to determine if a path to the inter-area destination that satisfies 
  the constraints does exist, and
- to determine the ABR to reach the next area. 

To do such a computation, the IGP SHOULD be able to support 
TE attribute summarization across areas, such as in [INTER_TE_OSPF] and 
[INTER_TE_EXT].

To allow traffic engineering across areas, the ABRs of the IGP SHOULD 
perform TE attribute summarization; similar to the route summarization 
that is already a part of the link state IGPs. In the general case of 
TE attribute summarization, any number of TE attributes such as 
bandwidth, delay to a destination can be summarized. These attributes 
can be summarized through the use of a dijkstra or dijkstra-like 
algorithm depending on whether the TE attribute is an additive metric, 
or Max-Min metric, or some other type. The value of the TE summary 
attribute to a destination advertised by an ABR represents the 
TE resources of the best path available from the ABR to that 
destination based on that TE attribute alone. For example, the value 
of the summarized unreserved bandwidth attribute may be defined 
as in [INTER_TE_OSPF]:

S. Venkatachalam, S. Dharanikota  Expires February 2001        [Page 10]

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

   "The unreserved bandwidth to the summary destination is the largest
   of all path-unreserved bandwidths, each associated with a possible
   path to the destination. The path-unreserved bandwidth is the
   smallest unreserved bandwidth of all the links in the path. Hence,
   the unreserved bandwidth is the maximum amount of traffic that can
   currently be sent to that destination, the other traffic on the
   links being steady."

   
The summarized TE attributes will be distributed inside the areas 
by the use of new link state messages for the purpose in OSPF and 
ISIS as defined in [INTER_TE_OSPF] and [INTER_TE_EXT].

5.1.3 Virtual links (TBD)

5.2 Signaling requirements

The signaling requirements are divided into setting up the initial 
LSP (both primary and backup) and usage of the crankback facility 
during LSP setup.

5.2.1 LSP setup

5.2.1.1 Primary LSP setup

Signaling SHOULD be extended to carry the criteria based elements, such 
as:

- Primary criteria (Attribute 1, ... , Attribute N)
- Secondary criteria (Attribute 1, ... , Attribute N)

Signaling SHOULD trigger IGP computation for the explicit route in 
an area at the transit ABRs. If a path which satisfies the primary 
criteria is not available, then it should trigger an IGP computation 
for a path that satisfies the secondary criteria. It MAY inform the 
initiating node about the change in the criteria for the path set up 
in the intermediate path. This deliberate notification can also be 
derived when the actual setup is completed.

5.2.1.2 Setting up the backup LSP

As this architecture distributes the LSP setup decisions, the 
intermediate ABRs SHOULD know the path taken by the primary and the 
backup LSPs. This enables the signaling component to request for a 
backup path that's different from the path taken by the primary LSP, 
during backup LSP setup. Hence, signaling SHOULD be extended to 
carry the complete path of the primary LSP when setting up the 
backup LSP.

S. Venkatachalam, S. Dharanikota  Expires February 2001        [Page 11]

Internet Draft  draft-venkatachalam-interarea-mpls-te-00.txt August 2000

The same mechanisms used for the primary LSP setup SHOULD be used 
for the backup LSP setup also. During the computation of the 
backup LSP, the algorithm SHOULD consider the guidelines proposed 
in section 4.3.

5.2.2 Crankback during LSP setup

Crankback in an area SHOULD always be performed from the upstream ABR 
of that LSP section. The mechanisms defined in section 5.2.1 will be 
used for the setting up of the primary or the backup LSP. If the path 
is not available, the information will be sent to the immediately 
preceding area to retry the computation.

5.3 MIB requirements

The configuration requirements for such an architecture can be divided 
into:

- Routing configuration, such as criteria filtering, 
  criteria-constraint mapping etc.
- LSP Setup configuration, such as primary criteria and backup criteria 
  etc.
- Signaling configuration, such as the criteria change in the 
  intermediate segment notification, crankback in-progress notification 
  required etc.

These configuration items are further elaborated in the extensions to 
the inter-area draft for the signaling and routing [INTER_AREA_EXT].

6. Examples for the criteria-based route advertisement

Let us assume that, as shown in Figure 1, an autonomous system has 
three areas, Area 1 with network N1, and area border routers ABR1, 
ABR3 with area 0; and Area 2 with network N2, with area border 
routers ABR 2 and ABR 4 with area 0. Consider the case when a host 
on N1 wishes to setup a criteria-based LSP to N2 with the primary 
criteria being: (required bandwidth = 10 Mbps and required interfaces = 
color red) and the secondary criteria being: (required interfaces = 
color red).

Figure 1: An example for basic LSP setup across areas in an autonomous 
system

The originating router and the area border routers calculate the 
primary LSP, primary criteria sections in their area. As shown in 
Figure 1, the sections PPS1, PPS3, PPS5 may represent the desired path. 
Similarly, the secondary path from N1 to N2 is PSS2, PSS4, PSS6. 
During the computation of the primary path, as a fallback when the 
primary criterion is not available (as on PPS3) the setup mechanism 
can take sections from secondary path (such as PSS7). Note that once 
the secondary criteria is used in a section, the later sections 
should also use the secondary criteria and convert the previous 
sections with primary criteria into secondary during the reservation 
phase.

6.2 Backup LSP creation example

The same logic used in the previous case needs to be used except that 
the path selected for the backup should be non-intersecting with the 
above path. This can be done in a distributed manner if the primary 
LSP path is known.

Figure 2: An example for crankback LSP setup in an autonomous system

If PPS5 fails, as shown in Figure 2, the crankback can be done from 
ABR2 to by pass PPS5.

7 Scalability (TBD)

8 Security considerations

Security issues are will be considered in the later versions of the 
document.
