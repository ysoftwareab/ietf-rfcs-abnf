1  Introduction

   This document discusses the problems of IP Multicast use in
   Differentiated Services (DS) networks, expanding on the discussion
   in RFC 2475 ("An Architecture of Differentiated Services"). It also
   suggests possible solutions to these problems, describes a potential
   implementation model, and presents simulation results.

   The "Differentiated Services" (DiffServ or DS) approach [1, 2, 3]
   defines certain building blocks and mechanisms to offer
   qualitatively better services than the traditional best-effort
   delivery service in an IP network. In the DiffServ Architecture [2]
   scalability is achieved by avoiding complexity and maintenance of
   per-flow state information in core nodes and by pushing unavoidable
   complexity to the network edges. Therefore, individual flows
   belonging to the same service are aggregated, thereby eliminating
   the need for complex classification or managing state information
   per flow in interior nodes.

   On the other hand, the reduced complexity in DS nodes makes it more
   complex to use those "better" services together with IP Multicast
   (i.e., point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint
   communication). Problems emerging from this fact are described in
   section 2. Although the basic DS forwarding mechanisms also work
   with IP Multicast, some facts have to be considered which are
   related to the provisioning of multicast resources. However, it is
   important to integrate IP Multicast functionality right from the
   beginning into the architecture, and, to provide simple solutions
   for those problems not defeating the gained advantages so far.

1.1 Management of Differentiated Services

   At least for Per-Domain Behaviors and services based on the EF PHB,
   admission control and resource reservation are required.
   Furthermore, installation and updating of traffic profiles in
   boundary nodes is necessary. Most network administrators cannot
   accomplish this task manually, even for long term service level
   agreements (SLAs). Furthermore, offering services on demand requires
   some kind of signaling and automatic admission control procedures.

   However, no standardized resource management architecture for
   DiffServ domains exists. So for the rest of the document, it is
   assumed that at least some logical resource management entity is
   available that performs resource-based admission control and
   allotment functions. This entity may also be realized in a
   distributed fashion, e.g., within the routers themselves. Detailed

   aspects of the resource management realization within a DiffServ
   domain as well as the interactions between resource management and
   routers or end-systems (e.g., signaling for resources) are out of
   scope of this document.

   Protocols for signaling a reservation request to a Differentiated
   Services Domain are required. For accomplishing end-system signaling
   to DS domains RSVP [4] may be used with new DS specific reservation
   objects [5]. RSVP provides support for multicast scenarios and is
   already supported by many systems. However, application of RSVP in a
   DiffServ multicast context may lead to problems that are also
   described in the next section.

2  Problems of IP Multicast in DS Domains

   Although potential problems and the complexity of providing
   multicast with Differentiated Services are considered in a separate
   section of [2], both aspects have to be discussed in greater detail.
   The simplicity of the DiffServ Architecture and its DS node types is
   necessary to reach high scalability, but it causes also fundamental
   problems in conjunction with the use of IP Multicast in DS domains.
   The following subsections describe these problems for which a
   generic solution is proposed in section 3. This solution is as
   scalable as IP Multicast and needs no resource separation by using
   different codepoint values for unicast and multicast traffic.

   Because Differentiated Services are unidirectional by definition,
   the point-to-multipoint communication is also considered as
   unidirectional. In traditional IP Multicast any node can send
   packets spontaneously and asynchronously to a multicast group
   specified by their multicast group address. I.e., traditional IP
   Multicast offers a multipoint-to-multipoint service, also referred
   to as Any-Source Multicast. Implications of this feature are
   discussed in section 2.3.

   For subsequent considerations we assume, unless stated otherwise, at
   least a unidirectional point-to-multipoint communication scenario in
   which the sender generates packets which experience a "better" Per-
   Hop Behavior than the traditional default PHB, resulting in a
   service of better quality than the default best-effort service. In
   order to accomplish this, a traffic profile corresponding to the
   traffic conditioning specification has to be installed in the
   sender's first DS-capable boundary node. Furthermore, it must be
   assured that the corresponding resources are available on the path
   from the sender to all the receivers, possibly requiring adaptation
   of traffic profiles at involved domain boundaries. Moreover, on
   demand resource reservations may be receiver-initiated, too.

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

2.1 Neglected Reservation Subtree Problem (NRS Problem)

   Typically, resources for Differentiated Services must be reserved
   before actually using them. But in a multicast scenario group
   membership is often highly dynamic, therefore limiting the use of a
   sender-initiated resource reservation in advance. Unfortunately,
   dynamic addition of new members of the multicast group using
   Differentiated Services can adversely affect other existing traffic,
   if resources were not explicitly reserved before use. A practical
   proof of this problem is given in section 8.

   IP Multicast packet replication usually takes place when the packet
   is handled by the forwarding core (cf. Fig. 1), i.e., when it is
   forwarded and replicated according to the multicast forwarding
   table. Thus, a DiffServ capable node would also copy the content of
   the DS field [1] into the IP packet header of every replicate.
   Consequently, replicated packets get exactly the same DS codepoint
   (DSCP) as the original packet, and, therefore experience the same
   forwarding treatment as the incoming packets of this multicast
   group. This is also illustrated in Fig. 1 where each egress
   interface comprises functions for (BA-) classification, traffic
   conditioning, and queueing.

        Figure 1: Multicast packet replication in a DS node


   Normally, the replicating node cannot test whether a corresponding
   resource reservation exists for a particular flow of replicated
   packets on an output link (i.e., its corresponding interface). This
   is caused by the fact that flow-specific information (e.g., traffic
   profiles) is usually not available in every boundary and interior
   node.

   When a new receiver joins an IP Multicast group, a multicast routing
   protocol (e.g., DVMRP [6], PIM-DM [7] or PIM-SM [8]) grafts a new

   branch to an existing multicast tree in order to connect the new
   receiver to the tree. As a result of tree expansion and missing per-
   flow classification and policing mechanisms, the new receiver will
   implicitly use the service of better quality, because of the copied
   "better" DSCP.

   If the additional amount of resources which are consumed by the new
   part of the multicast tree are not taken into account by the domain
   resource management (cf. section 1.1), the currently provided level
   of quality of service of other receivers (with correct reservations)
   will be affected adversely or even violated. This negative effect on
   existing traffic contracts by a neglected resource reservation -- in
   the following designated as Neglected Reservation Subtree Problem
   (NRS Problem) -- must be avoided under all circumstances.

   One can distinguish two distinct major cases of the NRS Problem.
   They show a different behavior depending on the location of the
   branching point. In order to compare their different effects a
   simplistic example of a share of bandwidth is illustrated in Fig. 2
   and is used in the following explanations. Neither the specific PHB
   types nor their assigned bandwidth share are important, whereas
   their relative priority with respect to each other is of importance.

                                      output link bandwidth

        Figure 2: An example bandwidth share of different
                  behavior aggregates

   The bandwidth of the considered output link is shared by three types
   of services (i.e., by three behavior aggregates): Expedited
   Forwarding, Assured Forwarding and the traditional Best-Effort
   service. In this example we assume that routers perform simple
   priority queueing, where EF has the highest, AF a middle, and Best-
   Effort the lowest assigned priority. Were Weighted Fair Queueing
   (WFQ) to be used, the described effects would essentially also
   occur, only with minor differences. In the following scenarios it is
   illustrated that PHBs of equal or lower priority (in comparison to
   the multicast flow's PHB) are affected by the NRS problem.

   The Neglected Reservation Subtree problem appears in two different
   cases:

   o Case 1: If the branching point of the new subtree (at first only a
    branch) and the previous multicast tree is an (egress) boundary

    node, as shown in Fig. 3, the additional multicast flow now
    increases the total amount of used resources for the corresponding
    behavior aggregate on the affected output link. The total amount
    will be greater than the originally reserved amount. Consequently,
    the policing component in the egress boundary node drops packets
    until the traffic aggregate is in accordance to the traffic
    contract. But during dropping packets, the router can not identify
    the responsible flow (because of missing flow classification
    functionality), and, thus randomly discards packets, whether they
    belong to a correctly behaving flow or not. As a result, there will
    be no longer any service guarantee for the flows with properly
    reserved resources.

     domain. Furthermore, resources are properly reserved along the
     path to receiver A and packets that are marked correspondingly.
     When receiver B joins the same group as receiver A, packets are
     replicated and forwarded along the new branch towards the second
     domain with the same PHB as for receiver A. If this PHB is EF, the
     new branch possibly exhausts allotted resources for the EF PHB,
     adversely affecting other EF users that receive their packets over
     the link that is marked with the *). The BN usually ensures that
     outgoing traffic aggregates to the next domain are conforming to
     the agreed traffic conditioning specification. The egress BN will,
     therefore, drop packets of the PHB type that is used for the
     multicast flow. Other PHBs of lower or higher priority are not
     affected adversely in this case. The following example in Fig. 4.
     illustrates this for two PHBs.

     Fig. 4 shows the resulting share of bandwidth in cases when (a)
     Expedited Forwarding and (b) Assured Forwarding is used by the
     additional multicast branch causing the NRS Problem. Assuming that
     the additional traffic would use another 30% of the link
     bandwidth, Fig. 4 (a) illustrates that the resulting aggregate of
     Expedited Forwarding (70% of the outgoing link bandwidth) is
     throttled down to its originally reserved 40%. In this case, the
     amount of dropped EF bandwidth is equal to the amount of excess
     bandwidth. Consequently the original Expedited Forwarding
     aggregate (which had 40% of the link bandwidth reserved) is
     affected by packet losses, too. The other services, e.g., Assured
     Forwarding or Best-Effort, are not disadvantaged.

     Fig. 4 (b) shows the same situation for Assured Forwarding. The
     only difference is that now Assured Forwarding is solely affected
     by discards, the other services will still get their guarantees.
     In either case, packet losses are restricted to the misbehaving
     service class by the traffic meter and policing mechanisms in
     boundary nodes. Moreover, the latter problem (case 1) occurs only
     in egress boundary nodes, because they are responsible, that not
     more traffic is leaving the Differentiated Services domain, than
     the following ingress boundary node will accept. Therefore, those
     violations of SLAs will be already detected and processed in
     egress boundary nodes.

   o Case 2: The Neglected Reservation Subtree problem can also occur,
     if the branching point between the previous multicast tree and the
     new subtree is located in an interior node (as shown in Fig. 5).
     In Fig. 5 it is assumed that receivers A and B have already joined
     the multicast group and have reserved resources accordingly. The
     interior node in the second domain starts replication of multicast
     packets as soon as receiver C joins. Because the router is not
     equipped with metering or policing functions it will not recognize
     any amount of excess traffic and will forward the new multicast
     flow. If the latter belongs to a higher priority service, such as
     Expedited Forwarding, bandwidth of the aggregate is higher than
     the aggregate's reservation at the new branch and will use
     bandwidth from lower priority services.

                  Expedited Forwarding flow or (b) an Assured
                  Forwarding flow


     The result of case 2 is, that there is no restriction for
     Expedited Forwarding, but as Fig. 6 (a) shows, other services will
     be extremely disadvantaged by this use of non-reserved resources.
     Their bandwidth is used by the new additional flow. In this case,
     the additional 30% Expedited Forwarding traffic preempts resources
     from the Assured Forwarding traffic, which in turn preempts
     resources from the best-effort traffic, resulting in 10% packet
     losses for the Assured Forwarding aggregate and complete loss of
     best-effort traffic. The example in Fig. 6 (b) shows that this can
     also happen with lower priority services like Assured Forwarding.
     When a reservation for a service flow with lower priority is
     neglected, other services (with even lower priority) can be
     reduced in their quality (in this case the best-effort service).
     As shown in the example, the service's aggregate causing the NRS
     problem can itself be affected by packet losses (10% of the

     Assured Forwarding aggregate is discarded). Besides the described
     problems of case 2, case 1 will occur in the DS boundary node of
     the next DS domain, that performs traffic metering and policing
     for the service aggregate.

   Directly applying RSVP to Differentiated Services would also result
   in an temporary occurrence of the NRS Problem. A receiver has to
   join the IP multicast group to receive the sender's PATH messages,
   before being able to send a resource reservation request (RESV
   message). Thus, the join for receiving PATH messages can cause the
   NRS Problem, if this situation is not handled in a special way
   (e.g., by marking all PATH messages with codepoint 0 and filtering
   or re-marking all other data packets of the multicast flow).

2.2 Heterogeneous Multicast Groups

   Heterogeneous multicast groups contain one or more receivers, which
   would like to get another service or quality of service as the
   sender provides or other receiver subsets currently use. A very
   important characteristic which should be supported by Differentiated
   Services is that participants requesting a best-effort quality only
   should also be able to participate in a group communication which
   otherwise utilizes a better service class. The next better support
   for heterogeneity provides concurrent use of more than two different
   service classes within a group. Things tend to get even more complex
   when not only different service classes are required, but also
   different values for quality parameters within a certain service
   class.

   A further problem is to support heterogeneous groups with different
   service classes in a consistent way. It is possible that some
   services will not be comparable to each other so that one service
   cannot be replaced by the other and both services have to be
   provided over the same link within this group.

   Because an arbitrary new receiver that wants to get the different
   service can be grafted to any point of the current multicast
   delivery tree, even interior nodes may have to replicate packets
   using the different service. At a first glance, this seems to be a
   contradiction with respect to simplicity of the interior nodes,
   because they do not even have any profile available and should now
   convert the service quality of individual receivers. Consequently,
   in order to accomplish this, interior nodes have to change the
   codepoint value during packet replication.

2.3 Dynamics of Any-Source Multicast

   Basically, within an IP multicast group any participant (actually,
   it can be any host not even receiving packets of this multicast
   group) can act as a sender. This is an important feature which
   should also be available in case a specific service other than best-
   effort is used within the group. Differentiated Services possess
   conceptually a unidirectional character. Therefore, for every
   multicast tree implied by a sender, resources must be reserved
   separately if simultaneous sending should be possible with a better
   service. This is even true if shared multicast delivery trees are
   used (e.g., with PIM-SM or Core Based Trees). If not enough
   resources are reserved for a service within a multicast tree
   allowing simultaneous sending of more than one participant, the NRS
   problem will occur again. The same argument applies to half-duplex
   reservations which would share the reserved resources by several
   senders, because it cannot be ensured by the network that exactly
   one sender sends packets to the group. Accordingly, the
   corresponding RSVP reservation styles "Wildcard Filter" and "Shared-
   Explicit Filter" [4] cannot be supported within Differentiated
   Services. The Integrated Services approach is able to ensure the
   half-duplex nature of the traffic, because every router can check
   each packet for its conformance with the installed reservation
   state.

3  Solutions for Enabling IP-Multicast in Differentiated Services
   Networks

   The problems described in the previous section are mainly caused by
   the simplicity of the Differentiated Services architecture.
   Solutions have to be developed which do not introduce additional
   complexity which would otherwise diminish the scalability of the
   DiffServ approach. This document suggests a straightforward solution
   for most of the problems.

3.1 Solution for the NRS Problem

   The proposed solution consists conceptually of the following three
   steps that are described in more detail later.

     1. A new receiver joins a multicast group that is using a DiffServ
        service. Multicast routing protocols accomplish the connection
        of the new branch to the (possibly already existing) multicast
        delivery tree as usual.

     2. The unauthorized use of resources is avoided by re-marking at
        branching nodes all additional packets leaving down the new
        branch. At first, the new receiver will get all packets of the
        multicast group without quality of service. The management

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

        entity of the correspondent DiffServ domain may get informed
        about the extension of the multicast tree.

     3. If a pre-issued reservation is available for the new branch or
        somebody (receiver, sender or a third party) issues one, the
        management entity instructs the branching router to set the
        corresponding codepoint for the demanded service.

   Usage of resources which were not reserved before must be prevented.
   In the following discussed example, the case is considered when the
   join of a new receiver to a DS multicast group requires grafting of
   a new branch to an already existing multicast delivering tree. The
   connecting node that joins both trees converts the codepoint (and
   therefore the Per-Hop Behavior) to a codepoint of a PHB which is
   similar to the default PHB in order to provide a best-effort-like
   service for the new branch. More specifically, this particular PHB
   can provide a service that is even worse than the best-effort
   service of the default PHB.

   The conversion to this specific PHB could be necessary in order to
   avoid unfairness being introduced otherwise within the best-effort
   service aggregate, and, which results from the higher amount of
   resource usage of the incoming traffic belonging to the multicast
   group. If the rate at which re-marked packets are injected into the
   outgoing aggregate is not reduced, those re-marked packets will
   probably cause discarding of other flow's packets in the outgoing
   aggregate if resources are scarce.

   Therefore, the re-marked packets from this multicast group should be
   discarded more aggressively than other packets in this outgoing
   aggregate. This could be accomplished by using an appropriate
   configured PHB (and a related DSCP) for those packets. In order to
   distinguish this kind of PHB from the default PHB, it is referred to
   as Limited Effort (LE) PHB (which can be realized by an
   appropriately configured AF PHB [9] or Class Selector Compliant PHB
   [1]) throughout this document. Merely dropping packets more
   aggressively at the re-marking node is not sufficient, because there
   may be enough resources in the outgoing behavior aggregate (BA) to
   transmit every re-marked packet and not requiring discarding any
   other packets within the same BA. However, resources in the next
   node may be short for this particular BA. Those "excess" packets,
   therefore, must be identifiable at this node.

   Re-marking packets is only required at branching nodes, whereas all
   other nodes of the multicast tree (such with outdegree 1) replicate
   packets as usual. Because a branching node may also be an interior
   node of a domain, re-marking of packets requires conceptually per-
   flow classification. Though this seems to be in contradiction to the
   DiffServ philosophy of a core that avoids per-flow states, IP
   multicast flows are different from unicast flows: traditional IP

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

   multicast forwarding and multicast routing require to install states
   per multicast group for every outgoing link anyway. Therefore, re-
   marking in interior nodes is to the same extent scalable as IP
   multicast is (cf. section 4).

   Re-marking with standard DiffServ mechanisms [10] for every new
   branch requires activation of a default traffic profile. The latter
   accomplishes re-marking by using a combination of an MF-classifier
   and a marker at an outgoing link that constitutes a new branch. The
   classifier will direct all replicated packets to a marker that sets
   the new codepoint. An alternative implementation is described in
   section 7.

   The better service will only be provided if a reservation request
   was processed and approved by the resource management function. That
   means an admission control test must be performed before resources
   are actually used by the new branch. In case the admission test is
   successful, the re-marking node will be instructed by the resource
   management to stop re-marking and to use the original codepoint
   again (conceptually by removing the profile).

   In summary, only those receivers will obtain a better service within
   a DiffServ multicast group, which previously reserved the
   corresponding resources in the new branch with assistance of the
   resource management. Otherwise they get a quality which might be
   even lower than best-effort.

3.2 Solution for Supporting Heterogeneous Multicast Groups

   In this document considerations are limited to provisioning
   different service classes, but not different quality parameters
   within a certain service class.

   The proposed concept from section 3.1 provides also a limited
   solution of the heterogeneity problem. Receivers are allowed to
   obtain a Limited Effort service without a reservation, so that at
   least two different service classes within a multicast group are
   possible. Therefore, it is possible that any receiver may
   participate in the multicast session without getting any quality of
   service. This is useful if a receiver just wants to see whether the
   content of the multicast group is interestingly enough, before
   requesting a better service which must be paid for (like snooping
   into a group without prior reservation).

   Alternatively, a receiver might not be able to receive this better
   quality of service (e.g., because it is mobile and uses a wireless
   link), but it may be satisfied with the reduced quality, instead of
   getting no content at all.

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

   Additionally, applying the RSVP concept of listening for PATH
   messages before sending any RESV message is now feasible again.
   Without using the proposed solution this would have caused the NRS
   Problem.

   Theoretically, the proposed approach also supports more than two
   different services within one multicast group, because the
   additional field in the multicast routing table can store any DSCP
   value. However, this would work only if PHBs can be ordered, so that
   the "best" PHB among different required PHBs downstream is chosen to
   be forwarded on a specific link. This is mainly a management issue
   and out of scope for this document.

3.3 Solution for Any-Source Multicast

   Every participant would have to initiate an explicit reservation if
   he wants to make sure that it is possible to send with a better
   service quality to the group, regardless whether other senders
   within the group already use the same service class simultaneously.
   This would require a separate reservation for each sender-rooted
   multicast tree.

   However, in the specific case of best-effort service (the default
   PHB), it is nevertheless possible for participants to send packets
   anytime to the group without requiring any additional mechanisms.
   The reason for this is that the first DS-capable boundary node will
   mark those packets with the DSCP of the default PHB because of a
   missing traffic profile for this particular sender. The first DS
   capable boundary nodes should therefore always classify multicast
   packets based on both the sender's address and the multicast group
   address.

4  Scalability Considerations

   The proposed solution does not add complexity to the DS architecture
   or to a DS node, and, it does not change the scalability properties
   of DiffServ. With current IP multicast routing protocols a multicast
   router has to manage and hold state information per traversing
   multicast flow. The suggested solution scales to the same extent as
   IP multicast itself, because the proposed re-marking may occur per
   branch of a multicast flow. This re-marking is logically associated
   with an addition to the multicast routing state that is required
   anyway. In this respect, re-marking of packets for multicast flows
   in interior nodes is not considered as a scalability problem or to
   be in contradiction to the DiffServ approach itself. It is important
   to distinguish the multicast case from existing justifiable
   scalability concerns relating to re-marking packets of unicast flows
   within interior routers. Moreover, the decision when to change a re-
   marking policy is not performed by the router, but by some

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

   management entity at a time scale which is different from the time
   scale at the packet forwarding level.

5  Deployment Considerations

   The solution proposed in section 3.1 and can be deployed on most
   nowadays available router platforms. Especially architectures that
   perform routing and forwarding functions in software could be
   updated by a new software release.

   However, there may be some specialized hardware platforms which
   could currently not be able to deploy the proposed solution from
   section 7. This may be the case when a multicast packet is directly
   duplicated on the backplane of the router, so that all outgoing
   interfaces read the packet in parallel. Consequently, the codepoint
   cannot be changed for a subset of these outgoing interfaces and the
   NRS problem can not be solved directly in the branching point.

   In this case, there exist several alternative solutions:

     1. As mentioned in section 3.1, if traffic conditioning mechanisms
        can be applied on the outgoing packets at the individual output
        interfaces, a combination of classifier and marker may be used
        for each branch.

     2. The change of the codepoint for subtrees without properly
        allocated resources could take place in the following
        downstream router. There, for every incoming packet of the
        considered multicast group, the codepoint would be changed to
        the value that the previous router should have set. If a LAN
        (e.g., a high-speed switching LAN) is attached to the
        considered outgoing interface, then on every router connected
        to the LAN, packets of the considered group should be changed
        on the incoming interface by standard DiffServ mechanisms.


   Future releases of router architectures may support the change of
   the codepoint directly in the replication process as proposed in
   section 7.

6  Security Considerations

   Basically, the security considerations in [1] apply. The proposed
   solution does not imply new security aspects. If a join of arbitrary
   end-systems to a multicast group is not desired (thereby receiving a
   lower than best-effort quality) the application usually has to
   exclude these participants. This can be accomplished by using
   authentication, authorization or ciphering techniques at application
   level -- like in traditional IP multicast scenarios.

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

   Moreover, it is important to consider the security of corresponding
   management mechanisms, because they are used to activate re-marking
   of multicast flows. On the one hand, functions for instructing the
   router to mark or re-mark packets of multicast flows are attractive
   targets to perform theft of service attacks. On the other hand,
   their security depend on the router management mechanisms which are
   used to realize this functionality. Router management should
   generally be protected against unauthorized use, therefore
   preventing those attacks as well.

7  Implementation model example

   One possibility to implement the proposed solution from section 3.1
   is described in the following. It has to be emphasized that other
   realizations are also possible, and, this description should not be
   understood as a restriction on potential implementations. The
   benefit of the following described implementation is, that it does
   not require any additional classification of multicast groups within
   an aggregate. It serves as a proof of concept that no additional
   complexity is necessary to implement the proposed general solution
   described in section 3.

   Because every multicast flow has to be considered by the multicast
   routing process (in this context, this notion signifies the
   multicast forwarding part and not the multicast route calculation
   and maintenance part, cf. Fig. 1), the addition of an extra byte in
   each multicast routing table entry containing the DS field, and,
   thus its DS codepoint value, per output link (resp. virtual
   interface, see Fig. 8) results in nearly no additional cost. Packets
   will be replicated by the multicast forwarding process, so this is
   also the right place for setting the correct DSCP values of the
   replicated packets. Their DSCP values are not copied from the
   incoming original packet, but from the additional DS field in the
   multicasting routing table entry for the corresponding output link
   (only the DSCP value must be copied, while the two remaining bits
   are ignored and are present for simplification reasons only). This
   field contains initially the codepoint of the LE PHB if incoming
   packets for this specific group do not carry the codepoint of the
   default PHB.

   When a packet arrives with the default PHB, the outgoing replicates
   should also get the same codepoint in order to retain the behavior
   of nowadays common multicast groups using the default PHB. A router
   configuration message changes the DSCP values in the multicast
   routing table and may also carry the new DSCP value which should be
   set in the replicated packets. It should be noted that although re-
   marking may also be performed by interior nodes, the forwarding
   performance will not be decreased, because the decision when and
   what to re-mark is made by the management (control plane).

8  Proof of the Neglected Reservation Subtree Problem

   In the following, it is shown that the NRS problem actually exists
   and occurs in reality. Hence, the problem and its solution was
   investigated using a standard Linux Kernel (v2.4.18) and the Linux-
   based implementation KIDS [11].

   Furthermore, the proposed solution for the NRS problem has been
   implemented by enhancing the multicast routing table as well as the
   multicast routing behavior in the Linux kernel. In the following
   section, the modifications are briefly described.

   Additional measurements with the simulation model simulatedKIDS [12]
   will be presented in section 9. They show the effects of the NRS
   problem in more detailed and also the behavior of the BAs using or
   not using the Limited Effort PHB for re-marking.

8.1 Implementation of the proposed solution

   As described in section 3.1, the proposed solution for avoiding the
   NRS Problem is an extension of each routing table entry in every
   Multicast router by one byte. In the Linux OS the multicast routing
   table is implemented by the "Multicast Forwarding Cache (MFC)". The
   MFC is a hash table consisting of an "mfc-cache"-entry for each
   combination of the following three parameters: sender's IP address,
   multicast group address and incoming interface.

Internet-Draft     IP Multicast in DiffServ Networks        August 2003

   The routing information in a "mfc-cache"-entry is kept in an array
   of TTLs for each virtual interface. When the TTL is zero, a packet
   matching to this "mfc-cache"-entry will not be forwarded on this
   virtual interface. Otherwise, if the TTL is less than the packet's
   TTL, the latter will be forwarded on the interface with a decreased
   TTL.

   In order to set an appropriate codepoint if bandwidth is allocated
   on an outgoing link, we added a second array of bytes -- similar to
   the TTL array -- for specifying the codepoint that should be used on
   a particular virtual interface. The first six bits of the byte
   contain the DSCP that should be used and the seventh bit indicates,
   whether the original codepoint in the packet has to be changed to
   the specified one (=0) or has to be left unchanged (=1).  The
   default entry of the codepoint byte is zero, so initially all
   packets will be re-marked to the default DSCP.

   Furthermore, we modified the multicast forwarding code for
   considering this information while replicating multicast packets. To
   change an "mfc-cache"-entry we implemented a daemon for exchanging
   the control information with a management entity (e.g., a bandwidth
   broker). Currently, the daemon uses a proprietary protocol, but it
   is planned to migrate to the COPS protocol (RFC 2748).

         Figure 8.1: Evaluation of NRS-Problem described in
                     Figure 3


   In order to prove case 1 of the NRS problem, as described in section
   2.1, a testbed shown in Figure 8.1 was built. It is a reduced
   version of the network shown in Figure 5 and consists of two DS-
   capable node, an ingress boundary node and an egress boundary node.
   The absence of interior nodes does not have any effects on to the
   proof of the described problem.

   The testbed comprises of two Personal Computers (Pentium III at 450
   Mhz, 128 MB Ram, 3 network cards Intel eepro100) used as DiffServ
   nodes, as well as one sender and three receiver systems (also PCs).
   On the routers KIDS has been installed and a mrouted (Multicast
   Routing Daemon) was used to perform multicast routing. The network
   was completely built of separate 10BaseT Ethernet segments in full-
   duplex mode. In [11] we evaluated the performance of the software
   routers and found out that even a PC at 200Mhz had no problem to
   handle up to 10Mbps DS traffic on each link. Therefore, the
   presented measurements are not a result of performance bottlenecks
   caused by these software routers.

   The sender generated two shaped UDP traffic flows of 500kbps
   (packets of 1.000 byte constant size) each and sends them to
   multicast group 1 (233.1.1.1) and 2 (233.2.2.2). In both

   measurements receiver A had a reservation along the path to the
   sender for each flow, receiver B has reserved for flow 1 and C for
   flow 2. Therefore, two static profiles are installed in the ingress
   boundary node with 500kbps EF bandwidth and a token bucket size of
   10.000byte for each flow.

   In the egress boundary node one profile has been installed for the
   output link to host B and one related for the output link to host C.
   Each of them permits up to 500kbps Expedited Forwarding, but only
   the aggregate of Expedited Forwarding traffic carried on the
   outgoing link is considered.

   In measurement 1 the hosts A and B joined to group 1 and A, B and C
   joined to group 2. Those joins are using a reservation for the group
   towards the sender. Only the join of host B to group 2 has no
   admitted reservation. As described in section 2.1 this will cause
   the NRS problem (case 1). Metering and policing mechanisms in the
   egress boundary node throttle down the EF aggregate to the reserved
   500kbps, no depending on whether individual flows have reserved or
   not.

                     host B share the reserved aggregate of
                     group 1.

   Figure 8.2 shows the obtained results. Host A and C received their
   flows without any interference.  But host B received data from group
   1 only with half of the reserved bandwidth, so one half of the
   packets have been discarded. Figure 8.2 also shows that receiver B
   got the total amount of bandwidth for group 1 and 2, that is exactly
   the reserved 500kbps. Flow 2 got Expedited Forwarding without
   actually having reserved any bandwidth and additionally violated the
   guarantee of group 1 on that link.

   For measurement 2 the previously presented solution (cf. section
   3.1) has been installed in the boundary node. Now it checks during
   duplicating the packets, whether the codepoint has to be changed to
   Best-Effort (or Limited Effort) or whether it can be just

                     gets the reserved bandwidth of group 1.
                     The flow of group 2 has been re-marked to
                     Best-Effort.

   Results of this measurement are presented in Figure 8.3. Each host
   received its flows with the reserved bandwidth and without any
   packet loss. Packets from group 2 are re-marked in the boundary node
   so that they have been treated as best-effort traffic. In this case,
   they got the same bandwidth as the Expedited Forwarding flow,
   because there was not enough other traffic on the link present, and
   thus no need to discard packets.

   The above measurements confirm that the Neglected Reservation
   Subtree problem is to be taken seriously and that the presented
   solution will solve it.

9  Simulative Study of the NRS Problem and Limited Effort PHB

   This section shows some results from a simulative study which shows
   the correctness of the proposed solution and the effect of re-
   marking the responsible flow to Limited Effort. A proof of the NRS
   problem has also been given in section 8 and in [13]. This section
   shows the benefit for the default Best Effort traffic when Limited
   Effort is used for re-marking instead of Best Effort. The results
   strongly motivate the use of Limited Effort.


9.1 Simulation Scenario

   In the following scenario the boundary nodes had a link speed of 10
   Mpbs and Interior Routers had a link speed of 12 Mbps. In boundary
   nodes a 5 Mbps aggregate for EF has been reserved.

   When Limited Effort was used, LE got 10% capacity (0.5Mpbs) from the
   original BE aggregate and BE 90% (4.5Mbps) of the original BE

   using WFQ scheduling.

   The following topology was used, where Sx is a sender, BRx a
   boundary node, IRx an interior node and Dx a destination/receiver.

   The following table shows the flows in the simulation runs, e.g.,
   EF0 is sent from Sender S0 to Destination D0 with a rate of 4 Mbps
   using an EF reservation.

   In the presented cases (I to IV) different amounts of BE traffic
   were used to show the effects of Limited Effort in different cases.
   The intention of these four cases is described after the table.

   In all simulation models EF sources generated constant rate traffic

   The BE sources also generated constant rate traffic, where BE0 used
   UDP and BE1 used TCP as transport protocol.

   Table 9.1: Direction, amount and Codepoint of flows in the four
              simulation cases (case I to IV)


   The four cases (I to IV) used in the simulation runs had the
   following characteristics:

   Case I: In this scenario the BE sources sent together exactly 5 Mbps
   so there is no congestion in the BE queue.

   Case II: BE is sending less than 5 Mbps, so there is space available
   in the BE queue for re-marked traffic. BE0 and BE1 are sending
   together 4.5 Mbps, which is exactly the share of BE, when LE is
   used. So when multicast packets are re-marked to LE because of the
   NRS problem, then LE should get 0.5 Mbps and BE 4.5 Mbps, which is
   still enough for BE0 and BE1. LE should not show a greedy behavior
   and should not use resources from BE.

   Case III: In this case BE is very low. BE0 and BE1 use together only
   1.5 Mbps. So when LE is used, it should be able to use the unused
   bandwidth resources from BE.

   Case IV: BE0 and BE1 send together 7.5 Mbps so there is congestion
   in the BE queue. In this case LE should get 0.5 Mbps (not more and
   not less).

   In each scenario loss rate and throughput of the considered flows
   and aggregates have been metered.

9.2 Simulation Results for different router types

9.2.1   Interior Node

   When the branching point of a newly added multicast subtree is
   located in an interior node the NRS problem can occur as described
   in section 2.1 (Case 2).

   In the simulation runs presented in the following four subsections
   D3 joins to the multicast group of sender S0 without making any
   reservation or resource allocation. Consequently a new branch is
   added to the existing multicast tree. The branching point issued by
   the join of D3 is located in IR2. On the link to BR3 no bandwidth
   was allocated for the new flow (EF0).

   The metered throughput of flows on the link between IR2 and BR3 in
   the four different cases is shown in the following four subsections.
   The situation before the new receiver joins is shown in the second
   column. The situation after the join without the proposed solution
   is shown in column three. The fourth column presents the results
   when the proposed solution of section 3.1 is used and the
   responsible flow is re-marked to LE.

   NOTE: BE1 has undefined throughput and loss in situation "after join
   (no re-marking)", because TCP is going into retransmission back-off
   timer phase and closes the connection after 512 seconds.

9.2.2   Boundary Node

   When the branching point of a newly added multicast subtree is
   located in a boundary node the NRS problem can occur as described in
   section 2.1 (Case 1).

   In the simulation runs presented in the following four subsections
   D3 joins to the multicast group of sender S1 without making any
   reservation or resource allocation. Consequently, a new branch is
   added to the existing multicast tree. The branching point issued by
   the join of D3 is located in BR3. On the link to BR4 no bandwidth
   was allocated for the new flow (EF1).

   The metered throughput of the flows on the link between BR3 and BR4
   in the four different cases is shown in the following four
   subsections. The situation before the new receiver joins is shown in
   the second column. The situation after the join but without the
   proposed solution is shown in column three. The fourth column
   presents results when the proposed solution of section 3.1 is used
   and the responsible flow is re-marked to LE.
