Abstract 
    
   In SIP-based networks, a SIP session MAY involve several application 
   servers on the originating and terminating side. In a certain case, 
   an application server needs to set some indications in SIP message to 
   indicate service information (what are invoked, what can be allowed 
   and what should blocked). This kind of information will be also 
   required for composition of SIP applications. There is a need to 
   provide indicators for service interaction between SIP application 
   servers or other SIP endpoints. 
    
   This document describes a mechanism of service interaction indicator 
   for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enhances service 
   interaction between SIP application servers in a trusted network.

1. Introduction 
    
   In SIP-based networks (RFC3261 [3]), there are several mechanisms for 
   feature interactions. They may be grouped in three categories:  
   - Identification interaction (who is calling, who will be called) 
   - History interaction (what happened in this request: it was 
   forwarded. And reasons for these happens) 
   - Capability interaction (Indicating user agent capabilities) 
    
   There is also a need to provide interaction indicator for further 
   actions of involving applications. For example, for a session between 
   user A and B, there is an application server AS1 at originating side 
   and an application server AS2 at the terminating side. The AS1 has 
   launched an application for user A like alarm call (alerting users in 
   a certain physical location for a emergence case). It makes no sense 
   if this call will be forwarded.  The "alarm call" application want to 
   indicate that a call diversion on terminating side is not wished.  
 
   A sip application server can also have the role of Service Capability 
   Interaction Manager (SCIM) as defined in 3GPP IMS. This application 
   server can coordinate applications in different sip application 
   servers. Additional service information will be required for keeping 
   service context in the SCIM server.  
    
   Interaction of services is depending on behavior of services on a SIP 
   node like application server and proxy. This document describes a 
   mechanism for service interaction in SIP. It is extensible if certain 
   applications need more indicators.

2. Mechanisms 
    
   Three private SIP header fields, "P-Interaction-Indicator", "P-App-
   Gateway" and "P-App-Chain" are defined in this document.  
    
   The "P-Interaction-Indicator" header is for transporting interaction 
   indicator that indicates application behaviors in SIP nodes in the 
   next steps. Next steps mean time after the setting of "P-Interaction-
   Indicator".  
    
   It has also an indication of direction. If an indicator is in INVITE 
   and ACK, it is applicable for application after the application that 
   sets the indicator.  It has the forward direction. If an indicator in 
   18X and 20x responses, it is applicable for application before the 
   application that sets the indicator. It has the backward direction.  
    
   Typical use cases for "P-Interaction-Indicator" are a configuration 
   with an application server on originating side and an application 
   server on terminating side for a call. The originating application 
   can use the forward "P-Interaction-Indicator" to indicate the 
   terminating application server what SHALL be allowed or not allowed. 
   The terminating application can use the backward "P-Interaction-
   Indicator" to indicate the originating application server what are 
   allowed or not allowed. 
    
   The "P-Interaction-Indicator" can also be used in case of multiple 
   application servers on terminating or originating side. For example, 
   one application server on the terminating can also set a forward 
   indicator for other application server behind him. 
    
   The "P-Interaction-Indicator" can also be used for applications in 
   other SIP UA and SIP Proxy. 
    
   The "P-App-Gateway" header is used for identifying the application 
   server who as the role of SCIM. The SCIM application server can 
   coordinate application servers for one session.  
    
   The "P-App-Chain" header is for tracking session information in each 
   application server. Because original dialog/session information like 
   call ID, To and From can changed if the application server acts as 
   B2BUA mode. 
 
    
3. Syntax 
    
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [2].

   PIndicator =  
      "P-Interaction-Indicator" HCOLON indicatorEntry  
      *(COMMA Indicator-entry)  
      indicatorEntry = "<" as-uri *( SEMI indicatorParam )">"  
      as-uri= name-addr  
      indicatorParam = indToken *(HCOLON application)  
      indToken = "allow" / "block" / "invoked" 
      application = application-string *(COMMA application-string) 
      application-string = token/application-extension 
       
    
   The P-Interaction-Indicator fully describes the interaction 
   indicator.   Its parameters are described below: 
    
   "as-uri" specifies the URI of a SIP end point (a application server 
   or other) that sets the interaction indicator. It is an optional 
 
   "inToken" specifies the attribute of a set of "application". "allow" 
   means certain "application" SHALL be enabled. "invoked" means certain 
   "application" are already executed. "block" means certain 
   "application" MUST be blocked to execute. 
    
   "application-string" specifies name of applications, which MUST be 
   understood from end to end.  
    
   There are several predefined name:  
   HOLD for Communication Hold  
   TIP for Terminating Identity Presentation  
   OIP for Originating Identification Presentation 
   OIR for Originating Identification Restriction 
   CONF for Conference 
   CDIV for Communication Diversion Services 
   CFU for Communication Forwarding Unconditional  
   CFB for Communication Forwarding Busy 
   CFNR for Communication Forwarding No Reply 
   CFNL for Communication Forwarding on Not Logged-In 
   CD for Communication Deflection 
   CW for Call Waiting 
   ACRCB for Anonymous Communication Rejection and Communication Barring 
   ECT for Explicit Communication Transfer 
   CCBS for Call Completion on Busy Subscriber (monitoring busy subs)  
   Any name for additional application name. 
    
    
   PAppGateway =  
      "P-App-Gateway" HCOLON appID 
      appID = "<" as-uri SEMI sessionID SEMI regionID ">"  
      as-uri = name-addr

      sessionID = "session=" token 
      regionID = "region=" "originating" / "terminating" 
    
   PAppChain =  
      "P-App-Chain" HCOLON appSessionID *( COMMA appSessionID ) 
      appSessionID = "<" as-uri SEMI sessionID ">" 
      sessionID = "session=" token 
    
4. Forward Indicator 
    
   A forward indicator is used to inform application server on 
   terminating side, which services MUST be blocked or SHALL be 
   activated. 
    
   Originating application server MAY set a forward indicator to 
   indicate terminating application. 
    
   Invite: marc@anywhere.com 
   ... 
   P-Interaction-Indicator: <SIP:as1.xxx.com; block:"CFU,CFU"; allow: 
   "CCBS"; invoked: "OIP">  
    
    
   The application server "as1.xxx.com" sets a forward indicator in "P-
   Interaction-Indicator", which indicates that requests for call 
   completion SHALL be accepted, call forwarding CFU and CFB MUST be 
   blocked, Originating Identification Presentation OIP is invoked. 
    
   Invite: marc@anywhere.com 
    
    
   ... 
   P-Interaction-Indicator: <SIP:as1.xxx.com;invoked: " CONF "> 
    
    
   The application server "as1.xxx.com" sets a forward indicator in "P-
   Interaction-Indicator", which indicates that a conference service is 
   already happen. This means this is an invite to join a conference. 
    
    
5. Backward Indicator 
    
   A backward indicator is used to inform application server on 
   originating side, which services MUST NOT be allowed or SHALL be 
   activated. 
    
   Terminating application server MAY sets a backward indicator to 
   indicate originating application.

   200 OK 
   P-Interaction-Indicator: <SIP:as2.xxx.com; block:"CONF"> 
    
    
   The application server "as2.xxx.com" sets a backward indicator, which 
   indicates that conference treatment on the originating side MUST be 
   blocked. 
    
   Note: Backward indicator is in 18x and 20x responses. 
    
6. Application Gateway/Router 
    
   Application Gateway is the sip application server that can coordinate 
   applications in different server. This application server (AS0) can 
   forward a sip request to a sip application server (AS1). Based on the 
   result of apps 1, can the application forwards this request (maybe 
   changed) to another application server (AS2). The Application AS0 is 
   the only application server, which is visible for S-CSCF in context 
   of 3GPP IMS. The "P-App-Gateway" header helps application servers 
   behind the application server AS0 to know where is the application 
   server master (AS0) for composition of applications. The session 
   information of AS0 and the role application  (originating or 
   terminating) are also parts of this header.  
   Example:  
   P-App-Gateway: <SIP:as0@alcatel-lucent.com; 
   session=41790@destgn0t02054; region=originating> 
    
7. Application Server Chain 
    
   Since application servers in a chain for processing a sip session can 
   act as B2BUA, session information in a SIP request and the request 
   itself can be changed. Keeping own session information in each sip 
   application server can help application server identifying related 
   session in his session table. Appending own session information and 
   keeping the P-App-Gateway header indicate that an application server 
   wants to join the application composition in application server P-
   App-Gateway. 
    
   Example: 
   P-App-Chain: <SIP: as0@alcatel-lucent.com; 
   session=41790@destgn0t02054>, <SIP: as1@alcatel-lucent.com; 
   session=82141790@destgn0t02054> 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   The mechanism provided in this document is a partial consideration of 
   the problem of service interaction in SIP. Some interactions in this 
   document result in the transfer of confidential information.

   Any intermediaries participating in the Trust Domain can inspect p-
   Interaction-Indicator, P-App-Gateway and P-App-Chain. This 
   information is secured by transitive trust, which is only as reliable 
   as the weakest link in the chain of trust. It MUST be removed at 
   border of the trusted domain.  
    
   When a trusted entity sends a message to any destination the P-
   Interaction-Indicator header field, the entity MUST take precautions 
   to protect the identity information from eavesdropping and 
   interception to protect the confidentiality and integrity of that 
   identity information.  The use of transport or network layer hop-by-
   hop security mechanisms, such as TLS or IPSec with appropriate cipher 
   suites, can satisfy this requirement. 
    
 
IANA Considerations 
 
   This document defines three new SIP private header fields "P-
   Interaction-Indicator", "P-App-Gateway" and "P-App-Chain" which 
   should be registered by the IANA in the SIP header registry. 
    
   The following are registration information: 
   RFC Number: RFC XXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of 
   this specification.] 
   Header Field Name: P-Interaction-Indicator 
   Compact Form: none 
    
   RFC Number: RFC XXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of 
   this specification.] 
   Header Field Name: P-App-Gateway 
   Compact Form: none 
    
   RFC Number: RFC XXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of 
   this specification.] 
   Header Field Name: P-App-Chain 
   Compact Form: none
