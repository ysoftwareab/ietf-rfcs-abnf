1. Introduction
 
   This document is a guide to the introduction of IPv6 in the current
   IPv4 based Internet or Intranets.  Section 2 outlines the general
   issues to start IPv6 networking in a predominantly IPv4 world.
   Things that will be handled here are ways to obtain IPv6 address 
   space, IPv6 registration issues, IPv6 DNS issues and routing issues.
 
   In section 3 short descriptions will be given of the different 
   translation and migration tools that translate between IPv6 and 
   IPv4 and/or tunnel IPv6 over IPv4.

   In sections 4 and 5 we will discuss how IPv6 can be introduced in 
   various typical environments.  Environments we distinguish are: 
   ISPs, Internet Exchanges and End User Environments.  Emphasis in 
   these sections will be on the use of the various translation and 
   integration tools that are discussed in section 3.

   In section 6 pointers to IPv6 information on the Internet will
   be given.

   This document addresses the use of IPv6 in a unicast environment.
   Migration of IPv4 to IPv6 multicast environments has not been
   considered.
 
   <DISCLAIMER> This document is not intended to describe the complete
   migration from IPv4 to IPv6 for the whole Internet.  It is however
   an attempt to describe the possibilities that exist today to
   introduce IPv6 in a predominantly IPv4 environment and have both
   IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity within the desired scope. <END DISCLAIMER>

2. General IPv6 implementation issues
   
   The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will probably follow a dual-stack
   strategy.  The transformation of IPv4 hosts to dual-stack host should
   not require too much effort considering the similarities between the
   IPv4 and IPv6 protocol.  Upgrading routers is slightly more complex.
   Besides implementing IPv6 for hosts and routers a few other things 
   need to be done before IPv6 actually can be deployed. 

   First of all IPv6 addresses need to be obtained and these IPv6 
   addresses need to be registered with Internet Registries and in the 
   Domain Name System (DNS).  Most sites will get a /48 prefix with 
   16 bits for subnetting and 64 bits for interface ID addressing.

   In the following sections it is discussed how to obtain aggregatable
   globally routable IPv6 address space and how to register this address
   space.  Furthermore, in section 2.3 it is discussed how IPv6 hosts 
   can be registered in the DNS. Section 2.4 discusses some IPv6 routing
   issues.
   
2.1 IPv6 address assignments
   
   Most of the transition mechanisms require dual stack systems and 
   thus globally routable IPv6 addresses as well as globally routable 
   IPv4 addresses.  Although sometimes private IPv4 addresses 
   [RFC1918] will suffice.  But to allow communication between IPv4 
   and IPv6 hosts over the Internet at least one globally unique IPv4 
   address is always needed.  Globally unique IPv4 addresses can be 
   obtained from one of the Regional Internet Registries (IR), Local 
   Internet Registries (LIR) or an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
   
   Without special registration a site can deploy IPv6 site local 
   addresses which are similar to IPv4 private addresses [RFC1918]. 
   However, site local addresses do not allow for communication over 
   the Internet.  For this you need to apply for globally routable 
   IPv6 addresses.
   
   At present, there is an experimental network called the "6bone" 
   which is operated based on IPv6.  For this network, a part of the
   aggregatable address space is assigned, the so-called Pseudo TLA 
   (pTLA) 3ffe::/16.  Provider pTLAs are assigned by the 6bone [6BONE].
   NLAs are assigned in turn by those organisations which have received
   pTLA assignments from the 6bone.

2.1.1 Obtaining IPv6 address space

   IPv6 addresses can be obtained from the same organisations as the
   ones who register IPv4 addresses.  Basically regional IRs delegate
   a part of the IPv6 address space to local IRs who further delegate
   parts of the address space to their customers.  The smallest
   assignment that can be made to a customer is a /48 prefix.  A 
   difference between IPv4 and IPv6 allocations is that one of the 
   main objectives of IPv6 allocation is route aggregation, i.e. to 
   minimise the number of prefixes that need to be advertised in the 
   default-free core of the Internet.
   
   The regional IRs use a slow start mechanism [IRALLOC] to allocate 
   TLAs to ISPs.  ISPs can be divided into two categories: those ISPs

   that can get a (sub-)TLA from their regional Internet Registry (IR) 
   and those ISPs that will not get a (sub-)TLA.  In this document the
   first category is referred to as "TLA ISPs" and the second category
   is referred to as "NLA ISPs", because they will get an NLA from their
   upstream provider(s).  

   TLA ISPs will get a sub-TLA first and can apply for a full TLA later.
   This sub-TLA is a /29 prefix.  The TLA ISP will allocate /48 prefixes
   to end customer sites and /(29+n) prefixes to NLA ISPs, in which "n" 
   (0<=n<=19) is the number of bits used to identify NLA ISPs [RFC2374].

                  NLA ISP identifier (n bits)
   

   An NLA ISP will be allocated a prefix between /29 and /48.  It will 
   use the remaining bits in the NLA ID to identify its customers.  
   These customers will get a /48.

2.1.2 Example of IPv6 address usage

Sites will get a /48.  An example of how to use such a /48 is given below.
In this example the site is allocated 3FFE:1234:5678::/48.


                     3FFE:1234:5678::/48

                |                 | Int3                |
        +-------+-------+         +----+          +-----+----+
        |               |              |          |    R2    |
        |               |              |          +----------+  
   +----+----+     +----+----+    +----+----+      ||||||||||
   |   R3    |     |   R4    |    |   R5    |         links
   +---------+     +---------+    +---------+
    | | | | |        |  |  |         |   |
      links           links          links

R[1-5] are routers and I[1-3] are the interfaces of R1.  Suppose the
expected number of hosts on the links is:

        router         immediate        year 1        year 2
          R2              34              50            70
          R3              19              20            25
          R4               9              10            15
          R5               3               5            10

A number plan could be like the one shown in the table below.  On R1 the
following prefixes will be used on the interfaces:

        Int1        3FFE:1234:5678:2000::/50
        Int2        3FFE:1234:5678:0000::/49
        Int3        3FFE:1234:5678:2300::/50

Initially, R2 will get 256 /64s, R3 will get 48 /64s, R4 will get 32 
/64s and R5 will get 16 /64s.

2.2 IPv6 registration issues
   
   In the current IPv4 world address space allocations are registered 
   in the various databases managed by the regional IRs.  Autonomous
   System (AS) information and routing policies are registered in the 
   distributed Internet Routing Registry database (IRR).  The IRs, LIRs
   and ISPs are supposed to register address space allocations and 
   assignments, contact persons, AS numbers, routing policies and other 
   useful data for network management in the various databases.

   A special IPv6 registration database has been setup for the 6bone 
   community, on the whois server named "whois.6bone.net".  This is a 
   special version of the RIPE database software and it is referred to 
   as the "6bone database".  This database has special objects, the
   "inet6num:" object for assigned IPv6 prefixes, and the "ipv6-site:" 
   object which is used to register specific information about a site
   connected to the 6bone, such as the configured tunnels and the 
   origin AS.  The database can be queried by using the web-based 
   "whois" service at http://www.6bone.net/whois.html.  At this time 
   only the 6bone database supports the special IPv6 objects.  
   Currently, there are no database objects to register IPv6 routing
   policies.  

   When the regional IRs will start allocating (sub-)TLAs the allocated
   and assigned IPv6 prefixes, routing policies etc. will have to be
   registered.  At this moment it is unclear how exactly IPv6 
   registrations will be done.
   
2.3 IPv6 and DNS
   
   Applications are not supposed to directly handle IP addresses but
   should use names.  The mapping between host names and IP addresses 
   in the Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial service on the Internet 
   [RFC1034, RFC1035].  This service is provided by DNS servers, 
   commonly implemented with the BIND software [BIND].  Using an "A 
   resource" record a name can point to an IPv4 address (forward 



Biemolt, Kaat, van der Pol, Steenman    Expires October 1999    [page 8]


Internet Draft             Guide to IPv6 Transition             Apr 1999



   mapping) and using a "PTR resource" record an IPv4 address can be 
   mapped back to a name (reverse mapping).
   
   This mechanism cannot easily be extended to support IPv6 addresses. 
   Some enhancements are needed to use DNS with IPv6 addresses 
   [RFC1886].
   
   To support the storage of IPv6 addresses within DNS and to facilitate
   renumbering currently other extensions are being defined [DNSLOOKUP].
   
2.3.1 Forward mapping
   
   A host's 128 bit IPv6 address can be stored with an "AAAA resource"
   record.  For example: 

   $ORIGIN ipv6.surfnet.nl.
   ...
   zesbot         IN   AAAA   3FFE:0604:0000:0001:02C0:4FFF:FEC6:9CC7

   This is similar to the use of the "A resource" record in IPv4, for 
   example:

   $ORIGIN ipv6.surfnet.nl.
   ...
   zesbot         IN   A      192.87.110.60

   Note that both "A" and "AAAA resource" records are stored in the 
   same DNS data file.
   
   If a node has more than one IPv6 address it must have more than one
   AAAA record. For example: 
   
   $ORIGIN ipv6.surfnet.nl.
   ...
   amsterdam9     IN   AAAA   3FFE:0600:8000:0000::0001
                  IN   AAAA   3FFE:0600:8000:0000::0005
                  IN   AAAA   3FFE:0600:8000:0000::0009
                  IN   AAAA   3FFE:0600:8000:0000::000D
   
   Currently a new resource record type, "A6", is being defined to map 
   a domain name to an IPv6 address, containing a reference to a 
   "prefix" [DNSLOOKUP].  The aim of the A6 resource record is to 
   facilitate network renumbering and multihoming.  Domains employing 
   the A6 record for IPv6 addresses can have automatically generated 
   AAAA records to ease transition.  After the A6 resource records are 
   widely deployed it is expected that the AAAA records are no longer 
   needed.

2.3.2 Reverse mapping
   
   IPv4 uses the "in-addr.arpa" domain for the reverse mapping.  An
   IPv4 address is represented as a name in the in-addr.arpa domain by 
   a sequence of bytes, written as decimal digits, separated by dots
   with the suffix ".in-addr.arpa".  The sequence of bytes is encoded in
   reverse order, i.e.  the low-order bytes is encoded first, followed 
   by the next low-order bytes and so on.
   
   For IPv6 addresses the special domain "ip6.int" is defined to look 
   up a record given an IPv6 address.  The process works exactly the 
   same as with IPv4.  Except that an IPv6 address is represented by
   nibbles, written as hexadecimal digits, separated by dots.  For
   example the IPv6 address 3FFE:0604:0000:0001:02C0:4FFF:FEC6:9CC7 
   is represented as a name in the ip6.int domain as:

   7.c.c.9.6.c.e.f.f.f.f.4.0.c.2.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.4.0.6.0.e.f.f.3.ip6.int.

   This name is stored in the a DNS data file as follows (assuming
   a /64 prefix):

   $ORIGIN 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.4.0.6.0.e.f.f.3.ip6.int.
   ...
   7.c.c.9.6.c.e.f.f.f.f.4.0.c.2.0   IN   PTR   zesbot.ipv6.surfnet.nl.

   This can be compared to the reverse mapping of IPv4 addresses.
   For example the IPv4 address 192.87.110.60 is represented as a name 
   in the in-addr.arpa domain as:

   60.110.87.192.in-addr.arpa.

   This name is stored in a DNS data file as follows:

   $ORIGIN 110.87.192.in-addr.arpa.
   ...
   60               IN   PTR   zesbot.ipv6.surfnet.nl. 

   Note that the IPv4 and IPv6 reverse mappings are stored in different
   DNS data files.
   
2.3.3 Implementations
   
   Most DNS implementations will be able to deal with the reverse
   mapping as used with IPv6 addresses.  However the AAAA resource
   record is only implemented in recent DNS implementations, like BIND
   version 8.1 and higher and the DNS server of Windows 2000.  At this
   moment there is no known implementation of the A6 resource record
   [DNSLOOKUP] or binary labels [BITLBL].

   Note that although these DNS servers implement extensions to support 
   the use of IPv6 addresses they are not necessarily IPv6 applications
   themselves. For IPv6 only nodes an IPv6 DNS server is crucial.
   
2.4 Routing issues in IPv6 

   To exchange reachability information routing protocols are used.  
   There are two types of routing protocols, the intra-domain (IGP) 
   and inter-domain (EGP) routing protocols.  In the IPv4 world 
   commonly used IGPs are RIP, OSPF and IS-IS and the EGP that is used 
   is mostly BGP4.  Besides the use of routing protocols static routing
   can also be used.  

   To use routing protocols in IPv6 networks they should be adjusted to
   be able to handle IPv6 routing information.  At this moment only RIP
   (RIPng) [RFC2080, RFC2081] and BGP4 (BGP4+) [RFC2283, BGP4-IPV6]
   implementations with IPv6 extensions are available.  The IETF OSPF 
   Working Group [OSPFWG] has defined IPv6 extensions to the OSPF 
   routing protocol.  Unfortunately, there are no implementations at 
   this moment.  On the 6bone static routing, BGP4+ and RIPng are used.

   IPv6 routing is very strict in aggregation.  Care must be taken what
   to announce to other ISPs, especially in peerings with other TLA
   ISPs.  ISPs should only announce sub-TLAs and smaller (i.e. at most
   a /29) to other TLA ISPs.  The TLA ISP can decide which (sub-)TLAs
   it will announce to another TLA ISPs according to its routing policy.
   The TLA ISP is allowed to announce prefixes larger than a /29 to ISPs
   and customers that fall inside its own (sub-)TLA.  Usually, a /48 is
   the largest prefix that will be announced.

   An NLA ISP can be multi-homed to several TLA ISPs.  The NLA ISP will
   get a next level NLA from all of them, but the NLA ISP should not 
   announce these NLAs to all TLA ISPs.  The NLA ISP should only 
   announce the NLA that was given by that TLA ISP to that TLA ISP.  
   On the other side, the NLA ISP will announce all NLAs to its 
   customers.

   For specific information about routing aspects of IPv6 transition 
   see [RFC2185].

3. Migration tools

   In this section a short introduction will be given on transition
   strategies for IPv6 nodes.  In section 3.2 short descriptions
   are listed for the various translation and migration tools that 
   are being developed.

3.1 Transition strategies
   
   Basically there are two different mechanisms to allow IPv6 nodes
   to maintain compatibility  with IPv4 only nodes.
    
   - Dual IP stack.  Providing complete support for both IPv4 and
     IPv6 in hosts and routers.
    
   - IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling.  Encapsulating IPv6 packets within
     IPv4 headers to carry them over IPv4 routing infrastructures.
    

    
   +-------------------+        +--------+
   |    application    |        |  IPv6  |
   +-------------------+        | domain |   +--------+
   |     TCP / UDP     |        +--------*---*        |
   +-------------------+                     |  IPv4  |
   |  IPv4   |   IPv6  |                     |networks|
   +-------------------+                     |        *---*--------+
   |   network layer   |                     +--------+   | IPv6   |
   |                   |                                  | domain |
   +-------------------+                                  +--------+
    
   a. dual stack strategy       b. route IPv6 over IPv4 only networks
    
   * Dual IP stack
   Dual stack nodes will be able to interoperate directly with both
   IPv4 and IPv6 nodes.  They must provide resolver libraries capable 
   of dealing with the IPv4 A records as well as the IPv6 AAAA records.
    
   When both A and AAAA records are listed in the DNS there are three 
   different options [RFC1933], (i) return only IPv6 address(es),
   (ii) return only IPv4 address(es) or (iii) return both IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses.  The selection of which address type to return, or,
   in which order can affect what type of IP traffic is generated.
    
   * Tunneling
   IPv6 nodes that are only connected through IPv4 networks can build a
   virtual link by configuring a tunnel.  IPv6 packets going towards 
   another IPv6 domain will then be encapsulated within IPv4 packets.  
   The tunnel end-points are two IPv4 addresses.  
   Two types of tunneling can be employed: configured and automatic.  
   Configured tunnels are created by manual configuration.  The 6bone 
   itself is an example of a network containing mainly configured 
   tunnels.  Automatic tunnels on the other hand do not need manual 
   configuration.  The tunnel end-points are automatically determined.
   For example by using special IPv6 unicast addresses that carry an 
   IPv4 address in the low-order 32-bits, e.g. IPv4-compatible IPv6

   addresses [RFC2373] or IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses [RFC2373].

3.2 A short characterisation of the different migration tools 
   
   A short description of the different translation and migration tools
   is listed below.  Note that the mentioned "applicability scope" 
   shows if the tool is intended to be used for an entire site or is to
   be implemented on a single host.  Listed is further if there are any
   general IPv4 related requirements, IPv4 address requirements, 
   specific IPv6 requirements, IPv6 address requirements or other 
   requirements.
   

   * [6TO4]:
   
   Applicability scope:        site
   IPv4 requirements:          need IPv4 inter connectivity between
                               sites
   IPv4 address requirements:  >= 1 per site
   IPv6 requirements:          global unique 6to4 prefix (624TLA)
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          IPv6 stack
   Router requirements:        implementation of special forwarding 
                               and decapsulation rules
   Other requirements:         creation of specific DNS record that
                               reflects 6TO4 prefix and "IPv4" address
                               NLA
   
   Description:
   
   The [6TO4] tool is applicable for interconnection of isolated IPv6
   domains in an IPv4 world.  The egress router of the IPv6 domain 
   creates a tunnel to the other domain.  The IPv4 endpoints of the
   tunnel are identified in the prefix of the IPv6 domain.  This prefix
   is made up of a unique 6TO4 TLA plus an NLA that identifies the site
   by the IPv4 address of the translating egress router.
   
   * [6OVER4]:
   
   Applicability scope:        host
   IPv4 requirements:          IPv4 multicast inter connectivity 
                               between hosts
   IPv4 address requirements:  1 per host
   IPv6 requirements:          none
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          IPv4/IPv6 stack
   Router requirements:        6OVER4 configuration to route between
                               different virtual links and/or virtual
                               links and the IPv6 Internet

Internet Draft             Guide to IPv6 Transition             Apr 1999



   Other requirements:         To connect IPv6 hosts on different 
                               physical links, IPv4 Multicast routing
                               must be enabled on the routers 
                               connecting the links

   Description:
   
   Interconnection of isolated IPv6 hosts in a site is realised through
   IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation.  A virtual link is created using an IPv4
   multicast group with organisational local scope.  IPv6 multicast
   addresses are mapped to IPv4 multicast addresses to be able to do
   Neighbour Discovery.  To route between the IPv6 Internet and the 
   6OVER4 domain in an organisation, a router needs to be configured as
   6OVER4 on at least one interface. 
   
   * [NAT-PT]:
   
   Applicability scope:        site
   IPv4 requirements:          none
   IPv4 address requirements:  >=1 per site
   IPv6 requirements:          none 
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          IPv6 stack
   Router requirements:        none, but the router might be the 
                               NAT-PT device
   Other requirements:         none
   
   Description: 
   
   [NAT-PT] address the communication between IPv6 only and IPv4 only
   hosts.  The communication is realised by use of a dedicated device 
   that does the translation between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and keeps 
   state during the time of the session.  The NAT-PT device also 
   includes an application layer gateway to make translation possible 
   between IPv4 and IPv6 DNS requests and answers.
   
   * [SIIT]:
   
   Applicability scope:        site
   IPv4 requirements:          none
   IPv4 address requirements:  1 temporary per IPv6 host
   IPv6 requirements:          none
   IPv6 address requirements:  IPv4-mapped and IPv4-translated
                               addresses to identify IPv4 nodes and 
                               IPv6 capable nodes respectively
   Host requirements:          IPv6 stack
   Router requirements:        none
   Other requirements:         none

   Description:
   
   The protocol describes a method to translate between IPv6 and IPv4.
   Translation is limited to the IP packet header.  The work does not
   describe a method to assign a temporary IPv4 address to the IPv6 
   node.  The translator is operating in a stateless mode, which means 
   that translation needs to be done for every packet.

   * [AIIH]:
   
   Applicability scope:        site
   IPv4 requirements:          none specific
   IPv4 address requirements:  >= 1 per site
   IPv6 requirements:          DHCPv6 extensions [DHCPv6-EXT]
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          IPv4/IPv6 stack
   Router requirements:        none
   Other requirements:         none
   
   Description:
   
   AIIH is based on cooperation between DNS and DHCPv6 [DHCPv6].  The 
   main idea is that when an IPv4/IPv6 host wants to communicate with 
   an IPv4 only host, it requests for the duration of the communication
   a temporary IPv4 address.  If an IPv4 host wants to communicate with 
   an IPv4/IPv6 host, the DNS server sends back an A record for the 
   host and co-located DHCPv6 server (that is co-located with the 
   DNS server) sends a reconfigure command to the dual stack host to 
   assign a temporary IPv4 address.

   * [SOCKS64]:
 
   Applicability scope:        site
   IPv4 requirements:          none specific
   IPv4 address requirements:  1 per host
   IPv6 requirements:          >= 1 per site
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          clients should be "socksified"
   Router requirements:        none
   Other requirements:         dual stack SOCKS server
 
   Description:
 
   The [SOCKS64] tool is a gateway system that accepts [SOCKSv5]
   connections from IPv4 hosts and relays it to IPv4 or IPv6 hosts. 
   Especially for "socksified" sites, who already use SOCKS aware 
   clients and a SOCKS server, SOCKS64 provides an easy way to let 
   IPv4 hosts connect to IPv6 hosts.  No DNS modifications or address 
   mapping is needed. The principle can also be used to allow IPv6

   hosts to connect to IPv4 hosts, IPv4 hosts over IPv6 networks and 
   IPv6 hosts over IPv4 networks [SOCKS-TRANS].  The later cases 
   resemble tunnel techniques without possible problems with 
   fragmentation or hop limits.
   
   * [BITSv6]:
   
   Applicability scope:        host
   IPv4 requirements:          none
   IPv4 address requirements:  pool of private address space per host
   IPv6 requirements:          none
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          IPv6/IPv4 stack plus extensions
   Router requirements:        none
   Other requirements:         none
   
   Description:
   
   The model allows for the use of none IPv6 capable applications on a 
   dual stack host to communicate with IPv6 only hosts.  Added to the 
   IPv4/IPv6 dual stack are three modules that intervene between the 
   application and the network, an extension to the name resolver, an 
   address mapper and a translator.  The main idea is that when an IPv4 
   application needs to communicate with an IPv6 only host, the IPv6 
   address of that host is mapped into an IPv4 address out of a pool 
   local to the dual stack hosts.  The IPv4 packet generated for the 
   communication is translated into an IPv6 packet according to SIIT.
   
   * [TunnelBroker]:
   
   Applicability scope:        host
   IPv4 requirements:          none
   IPv4 address requirements:  1 
   IPv6 requirements:          none
   IPv6 address requirements:  none
   Host requirements:          IPv4/IPv6 stack,  IPv4 Web browser
   Router requirements:        none
   Other requirements:         Tunnel Broker server
   
   Description:
   
   The tunnel broker is a web based tool that allows interactive setup 
   of an IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel.  By requesting a tunnel, the host gets
   assigned an IPv6 address out of the address space of the tunnel
   provider.  DNS will be updated automatically.  The created tunnel 
   will provide IPv6 connectivity between the tunnel provider's IPv6 
   environment and the isolated host.

4. ISP environments
   
   This section describes how different organisations (ISPs, Internet
   Exchanges) can start deploying IPv6.  It describes how IPv6 can be 
   setup in the organisation and how to connect to the global IPv6 
   infrastructure.
   
4.1 Introducing IPv6 in an ISP environment

   The network of an ISP consists of at least three main areas: the 
   core network, the connections to other IPSs and the customer access 
   network.  The next two sections will discuss how an ISP can 
   introduce IPv6 in those areas.  

   For each area a couple of steps must be taken first:
   
   * Request IPv6 address space as described in section 2.1.
   * Register the IPv6 site, routing and delegations as described in
     section 2.2.
   * Setup DNS as described in section 2.3.

4.1.1 Introducing IPv6 in the core network

   It is not really necessary to introduce IPv6 into the core of the
   network.  An ISP may decide to tunnel IPv6 over its existing IPv4
   infrastructure.  But if the ISP decides to introduce IPv6 into the
   core, this can be done in several ways.
   
   An ISP might decide to install separate dual stack or IPv6-only 
   routers in the core.  These will be interconnected by dedicated 
   lines (ATM PVCs, leased lines, etc.) or (if the routers are dual 
   stack) by IPv6 in IPv4 tunnels over the existing IPv4 core 
   infrastructure.  Routing can be setup such that IPv4 packets are 
   routed through the old IPv4 infrastructure and IPv6 packets are 
   routed through the new IPv6 infrastructure.
   
   When dual stack routers are stable enough to be used in the core, 
   things become simpler.  The ISP can configure the core routers as 
   dual stack routers which will route both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.
   
   Next a connection to the global IPv6 network should be made.  This
   can be done by a direct IPv6 connection or by some tunneling 
   mechanism.  If the core of the network supports IPv6 and the other 
   ISP also supports IPv6 a direct link can be used to transport IPv6 
   packets.
   
   When there is no direct IPv6 connection tunneling mechanisms must
   be used to reach the global IPv6 network.  Automatic tunneling can 
   be done with for example [6TO4].



Biemolt, Kaat, van der Pol, Steenman    Expires October 1999   [page 17]


Internet Draft             Guide to IPv6 Transition             Apr 1999



   
   An ISP might decide to setup one or more routers at the edge of its
   network to act as 6to4 gateways.  This enables other IPv6 islands
   to reach the ISP by 6to4 tunneling.  An alternative to the use
   of dynamic tunnels is the use of static ones as is the case on the 
   6Bone.

4.1.2 Introducing IPv6 in the customer access network

   The customer access network consists of dial up and leased lines
   connected to an access router.  There are at least two possibilities
   to introduce IPv6.  The first possibility is to upgrade access 
   routers to dual stack routers.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 customers connect
   to these dual stack routers.
   
   Another possibility is to install separate IPv6 or dual stack 
   routers.  IPv4-only customers connect to the old IPv4-only access 
   routers.  IPv6 customers connect to the new access routers.
   
   These IPv6 access routers must be connected to the global IPv6 
   network.  If the core does not support IPv6, one of the transition 
   mechanisms from section 3 must be used.  Automatic tunneling can be 
   done with for example [6TO4].  An alternative to the use of dynamic 
   tunnels is the use of statically configured ones.
   
   When the core network does support IPv6 the access routers can be
   connected to the nearest IPv6 core router (either by IPv4/IPv6 link,
   dedicated link or tunneling over IPv4).
   
   When the customer is an IPv6-only site, the ISP might decide to
   provide some transition mechanisms to help the customer reach 
   IPv4-only nodes.  To do this the ISP can install e.g. NAT-PT (see 
   section 5.3).
   
4.2 Internet Exchange
   
   Based on address space distribution we can distinguish two models 
   for the setup of an IPv6 Internet Exchange (IE). 

   1. The more or less traditional model that is most common in the 
      IPv4 world.  In this case each ISP connecting to the IE arranges
      its own IPv6 address space.  In peering arrangements between 
      ISPs the prefix for this address space is exchanged.

   2. An addressing model where the IE acts as an address space
      provider.  In this case the IE obtains a TLA and can assign NLAs 
      from this TLA address space to connected ISPs.  In order to obtain
      global connectivity for the Internet Exchange TLA, the IE needs to
      arrange for global transit through one or more global transit 



Biemolt, Kaat, van der Pol, Steenman    Expires October 1999   [page 18]


Internet Draft             Guide to IPv6 Transition             Apr 1999



      providers (TLA ISPs) which are connected to the IE.  Implicitly, 
      this means that the IE arranges transit for all connected ISPs 
      that use the address space assigned to the IE.  This requires 
      quite a different business model for an IE than in model 1. 

   Models 1 and 2 described above require the following steps to 
   be taken by the IE operator and/or the connected ISPs:

   * Model 1:

   - IE operator requests an NLA
     Obtain globally unique address space.  This can be an NLA from a
     transit provider (TLA provider) that offers connectivity for the 
     IE infrastructure.  A global prefix is preferred as next hop 
     attribute in BGP4 [BGP4-IPV6].

   - Addressing infrastructure on IE
     From the obtained address space addresses are assigned to the 
     interfaces of the routers connecting to the IE infrastructure.
  
   - Update the IPv6 registry
     The sites, allocations and route objects should be registered as
     described in section 2.
   
   - BGP announcements
     ISPs connecting to the IE advertise to their peers their own 
     address space which is independent of the IE.  This address space 
     can either be a TLA or an NLA.

   * Model 2:

   - IE operator requests a (sub-)TLA
     The IE requests a (sub-)TLA from its regional IR.  Customers on 
     the Internet Exchange get a next level NLA from this (sub-)TLA.
   
   - Addressing infrastructure on IE
     From the obtained address space addresses are assigned to the 
     interfaces of the routers connecting to the IE infrastructure.

   - Update the IPv6 registry
     The sites, allocations and route objects should be registered as
     described in section 2.
   
   - IE operator contracts global transit ISPs (TLA ISPs)
     The IE should contract several TLA ISPs that will provide 
     connectivity to the global IPv6 network.  Such a TLA ISP must 
     agree to transit traffic from all customers connected to the IE.

   - BGP announcements
     The transit providers for the IE address space announce the 
     (sub-)TLA from the IE to the global IPv6 network.  To the IE 
     customers they announce all prefixes that can be reached by them 
     and for which they have a contract with the IE.  Customers (NLA 
     ISPs) get a next level NLA from the IE.  The NLA ISPs announce 
     their NLA to the TLA ISPs.  They also announce their NLA to other 
     NLA ISPs of the IE if there is a peering agreement between them.

5. End user environments
   
   This section describes how end users can start deploying IPv6 in 
   their networks.  We define an end user environment as a network 
   consisting of a single routing domain that is not being used to 
   offer Internet access to others.  In the extreme case an end user 
   can be only one host that dials in to an ISP. 
   
   For the cases of end users we can distinguish two main situations, 
   one where the Internet provider for the end host offers IPv6 
   connectivity and the other where the Internet provider does not 
   offer IPv6 connectivity.  Next to this distinction the situation is 
   different for a single dial-in host or for a network. Last we can 
   distinguish the case where the end user is an Intranet that is not 
   connected to the Internet.
   
   The general expectation is that the introduction of IPv6 in the 
   Internet will happen with dual stack hosts and routers.  However, 
   for a very long time (one might consider decades) there will remain 
   IPv4 only applications, servers and end stations.  Also, one might 
   expect the introduction of IPv6 only stacks in devices that up till 
   now do not run on IP, for example GSM telephones, PDAs and home 
   devices.  To make inter-operability possible between the IPv6 and 
   the IPv4 world a number of tools are available.
   
   The sections below discuss the different end user situations 
   described above and the possibilities to introduce IPv6 in that 
   particular environment. 

5.1 Introducing IPv6 in an Intranet environment
   
   Methods to introduce IPv6 in an Intranet environment depend very 
   much on the scale and topology of the Intranet.  Assumed is that 
   there is no IPv4 addressing issue in the Intranet.  We distinguish 
   the following situations:
   
   * A number of isolated IPv4/IPv6 dual stack hosts.
     - In case the hosts all reside on the same link there is no issue.
     - In case the IPv6/IPv4 hosts reside on different links there are 
       several options for IPv6 communication between these hosts:



Biemolt, Kaat, van der Pol, Steenman    Expires October 1999   [page 20]


Internet Draft             Guide to IPv6 Transition             Apr 1999



       - IPv6 routing is turned on on the routers connecting the links.
       - if IPv4 multicast routing is enabled between the links, 
         [6OVER4] can be used to create virtual links.
   
   * A number of isolated IPv6 capable networks can be distinguished in 
     the Intranet. 
     - For IPv6 communication between these networks the following could
       be applied :
       - turn on routing on the routers interconnecting the networks.
       - implement [6TO4] on the egress routers connecting the networks
         to the Intranet.
      
   In all cases it might be useful to implement [BITSv6] to make it
   possible for IPv4 only applications to communicate in the IPv6 world.
   
5.2 Introducing IPv6 with IPv6 capable upstream provider

   To introduce IPv6 in end user networks where the upstream provider 
   is offering both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity the implementation 
   issues are actually the same as in the Intranet environment 
   described in the previous section.  The end user network must be 
   made capable of routing IPv6.  The upstream provider for Internet 
   connectivity will take care of routing to both the IPv4 and the 
   IPv6 world.  
   
5.3 Introducing IPv6 without IPv6 capable upstream provider

   To introduce IPv6 in an end user network if the upstream provider 
   is not offering IPv6 connectivity there are two possible
   approaches.  To implement connectivity for the end user network
   to the IPv6 world one can either use [6TO4] or a statically
   configured tunnel from the end user network egress router to an 
   IPv6 provider. 
   
   Once there is IPv6 connectivity between the end user network and the
   IPv6 world we can have the following situations:
   
   * IPv4/IPv6 hosts
     - General availability of IPv4 addresses: in this situation there 
       is no issue.
     - Limited availability of IPv4 addresses: in this case we have no 
       problems to communicate from the host at the end user network to
       an IPv6 capable host in the rest of the world.  In order to 
       communicate with the IPv4 world, assignment of a temporary IPv4 
       address to a host is necessary. This can be accomplished with 
       [AIIH].
   
   * IPv6 only hosts
     - If there are IPv6 only hosts on the end user network then

Internet Draft             Guide to IPv6 Transition             Apr 1999



       [NAT-PT] offers a solution to communicate with the IPv4 world.
   
   In all cases it might be useful to implement [BITSv6] to make it
   possible for IPv4 only applications to communicate in the IPv6 world.
   
5.4 Single host with upstream provider offering IPv6 connectivity
   
   This situation typically applies in the case of a dial-in user
   connecting to a dial-in provider.  We assume the provider takes full
   responsibility to reach both the IPv4 and the IPv6 world at the 
   network level and the dial-in user should not be concerned with this.
   We can distinguish the following situations:
   
   * If the dial-in host gets assigned both an IPv6 and IPv4 address: 
     full connectivity between both the IPv6 and IPv4 world is possible.

   * The dial-in user only gets assigned an IPv6 address: 
     in case connectivity with an IPv4 hosts is necessary, the ISP might
     typically offer interconnectivity services like [AIIH], [SIIT] or 
     [NAT-PT].

   The host might consider implementing [BITSv6] to use IPv4 only 
   applications to communicate with IPv6 servers.
           
5.5 Single host without upstream provider offering IPv6 connectivity
   
   This situation typically applies to dial-in users connecting to a
   dial-in provider with no IPv6 support or to isolated IPv6 users or
   testers in an pure IPv4 environment. 
   
   In case of a dual stack host the typical solution for this situation
   is use of the web based [TunnelBroker] application to obtain 
   connectivity to the IPv6 world.  The use of the [BITSv6] 
   implementation can be considered for the use of communicating between
   IPv4 only applications on the local host and IPv6 only servers.

6. IPv6 information on the Internet
