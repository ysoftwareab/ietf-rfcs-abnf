                    Preferred Path Routing Framework
             draft-chunduri-rtgwg-preferred-path-routing-01

Abstract

   Capacity demands, Traffic Engineering (TE) and determinism are some
   of key requirements for various cellular, edge and industrial
   deployments.  These deployments span from many underlying data pane
   technologies including native IPv4, native IPv6 along with MPLS and
   Segment Routing (SR).

   This document provides a framework for Preferred Path Routing (PPR).
   PPR is a method of providing path based dynamic routing for a number
   of packet types including IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS.  This seamlessly works
   with a controller plane which holds both complete network view of
   operator policies, while distributed control plane providing self-
   healing benefits in a near-real time fashion.

   PPR builds on existing encapsulations at the edge nodes to add path
   identity to the packet.  This reduces the per packet overhead
   required for path steering and therefore has a smaller impact on both
   packet MTU, data plane processing and overall goodput for small
   payload packets, while extending path steering benefits to any
   existing data plane.
   A number of extensions that allow expansion of use beyond simple
   point-to-point-paths are also described in this memo.

1.  Introduction

   With the deployments of more advanced services, such as 5G and
   beyond, the need for Traffic Engineering (TE) with deterministic
   services become more important.  Especially in many edge networks
   where stringent requirements must be met in terms of latency,
   throughput, packet loss and packet error rate.  Traffic steering
   provides a base to build some of these capabilities to serve various
   cellular, edge and vertical industries.  Additionally, diverse data
   planes are used in various deployments and parts of the network,
   including Ethernet, MPLS, and native IP (IPv4/IPv6) needs some of
   these capabilities.

   This document provides a framework for Preferred Path Routing (PPR).
   PPR is a method of adding explicit paths to a network using link-
   state routing protocols.  Such a path, which may be a strict or loose
   and can be any loop-free path between two points in the network.  A
   node makes an on-path check to determine if it is on the path, and,
   if so, adds a FIB entry with NextHop (NH) (computed from the SPF
   tree) set to the next element in the path description.

   The Preferred Path Route Identifier (PPR-ID) in the packet is used to
   map the packet to the PPR path, and hence to identify resources and
   the NH.  In other words, PPR-ID is the path identity to the packet
   and routing and forwarding happens based on this identifier while
   providing various services to all the flows mapped to the path.

   As described, PPR is forwarding plane agnostic, and may be used with
   any packet technology in which the packet carries an identifier that
   is unique within the PPR domain.  PPR may hence be used to add
   explicit path and resource mapping functionality with inherent TE
   properties in IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, Ethernet or similar networks.  It
   also has a smaller impact on both packet MTU and data plane
   processing.  PPR uses an IGP control plane based approach for dynamic
   path steering.

   Applications and key use case scenarios for PPR are described further
   in Section 2.
   PPR itself is described in further detail in Section 3.

   Section 3.1,Section 3.2, Section 3.3 describe various data, control
   and management plane functionalities of PPR respectively.  A number
   of extensions that allow expansion of use beyond simple point-to-
   point- paths, TE aware loop-free-alternatives and path related
   services to the flows are also described in this memo.

1.1.  Relation to Segment Routing

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] enables packet steering by including
   set of Segment Identifiers (SIDs) in the packet that the packet must
   traverse or be processed by.  In an MPLS network this is done by
   mapping the SIDs to MPLS labels and then pushing the required labels
   on the packet [RFC8660].  In SRv6, [RFC8754] defines a segment
   routing extension header (SRH) to be carried in the packet which
   contains a list of the segments.  The usefulness of PPR with SR and
   inter- working scenarios are described in Section 3.1.2 and
   Section 3.1.3.

   SR also defines Binding SIDs (BSIDs) [RFC8402] which are SIDs pre-
   positioned in the network to either allow the number of SIDs in the
   packet to be reduced, or provide a method of translating from an edge
   imposed SID to a SID that the network prefers.  One use of BSIDs is
   to define a path by associating an out-bound SID on every node along
   the path in which case the packet can be steered by swapping the
   incoming active SID on the packet with a BSID.  For both SR-MPLS and
   SRv6, PPR can reduce the number of touch points needed with BSIDs by
   dynamically signaling the path and associating the path with an
   abstract data plane identifier.

   With PPR as a data packet carries a PPR-ID Section 3.1 instead of
   individual SIDs, it avoids exposing the path; thus it avoids
   revealing topology, traffic flow and service usage, if a packet is
   snooped.  This is described as "Topology Disclosure" security
   consideration in [RFC8754].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119],
   RFC8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

2.1.  XHaul Transport

   Cellular networks predominantly use both IP and MPLS data planes in
   the transport part of the network.  For the cellular transport to
   evolve for 5G, certain underlay network requirements need to be met
   (for slices other than enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)).  PPR is a
   mechanism to achieve this, as it provides dynamic path based routing
   and traffic steering for any underlying data plane (IPv4/IPv6/MPLS)
   used, without any additional control plane protocol in the network.
   PPR acts as an underlay mechanism in cellular XHaul (N3/N9 interfaces
   below) and hence can work with any overlay mechanism including GPRS
   Tunneling Protocol (GTP).

    --- : Backhaul (N3/N9 Interfaces)

                   Figure 1: Cellular Transport Network

   Figure 1 depicts a high level view of cellular XHaul network.
   Fronthaul is generally a point-to-point link, midhaul uses Layer-2/
   IP and backhaul is an IP/MPLS network.  For the end-to-end slicing in
   these deployments, both midhaul and backhaul need to have traffic
   engineering as well as underlay QoS capabilities.

   In many cellular deployments connectivity for various 5G nodes on F1,
   N3 and N9 interfaces, topologies for example, range from subtended
   rings to Leaf- Spine Fabric (LS-Fabric) in edge deployments.  While
   there is no limitation w.r.t topologies where PPR is applicable, for
   some of these deployments PPR is more suitable for providing Traffic
   Engineering for high volume traffic with no path overhead in the
   underlying data plane.  PPR augments the SR-MPLS deployments with low
   data plane overhead and high reliability with TE aware fast reroute
   (PLFA) as described in Section 3.2.2.  In the overlay or virtual
   router environment, PPR provides lightweight service chaining with
   non-topological Path Description Element (PDEs) Section 3.2.2 along
   the preferred path.  PPR helps to achieve OAM capabilities at the
   path granularity without any additional per packet information.

   Some edge deployment underlays are predominantly IP (IPv4/IPv6)
   based.  If IGP based underlay control plane is in use, PPR can
   provide the required flexibility for creating TE paths, where native
   IP data planes (IPv4/IPv6) are used.  PPR can help operators to

   mitigate the congestion in the underlay and path related services for
   critical servers in the edge networks dynamically.

2.2.  PPR as VPN+ Underlay and Network Slicing

   There is a need to support the requirements of new applications,
   particularly applications that are associated with 5G services.  An
   approach to supporting these needs is described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].  This approach utilizes existing VPN
   and TE technologies and adds features that specific services require
   over and above traditional VPNs.  The document describes a framework
   for using existing, modified and potential new networking
   technologies as components to provide an Enhanced Virtual Private
   Network (VPN+) service.

   Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network
   slicing, but could also be of use in its own right.  It is not
   envisaged that large numbers of VPN+ instances will be deployed in a
   network and, in particular, it is not intended that all VPNs
   supported by a network will use VPN+ techniques.

   Such networks potentially need large numbers of paths each with
   individually allocated resources at each link and node.  A segment
   routing approach has the potential to require large numbers of SIDs
   in each packet; and the paths become strict source routed through
   end-to-end set of resources needed to create the VPN+ paths.  By
   using PPR, the number of segments needed in packets is reduced, and
   the management overhead of installing the large numbers of BSIDs is
   reduced.

2.3.  PPR as FRR Solution

   PPR may be used in a network as a method of providing IP Fast-ReRoute
   (IPFRR).  This is independent of whether PPR is used in the network
   for other traffic steering purposes.  It can be used to create
   optimal paths or paths congruent with the post convergence path from
   the point of local repair (PLR) as is proposed in TI-LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa].  Unlike TI-LFA PPR may be
   used in IPv4 networks.  This is discussed further in Section 4.  The
   approach has the further intrinsic advantage that no matter how
   complex the repair path, only a single header (or MPLS label) needs
   to be pushed onto the packet which may assist routers that find it
   difficult to push large headers.

2.4.  Extensible alternative to Flex Algo

   Flex-Algorithm [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] is a method that is sometimes
   used to create paths between Segment Routing (SR) nodes when it is
   required that packets traverse a path other than the shortest path
   that the SPF of the underlying IGP would naturally install.  There is
   a limit of 128 algorithms that can be installed in a network.  Flex-
   Algorithm is a cost based approach to creating a path which means
   that a path or pathlet is indirectly created by manipulating the
   metrics of the links.  These metrics affect all the paths within the
   scope of the Flex-Algorithm number (instance).  The traffic steering
   properties of Flex-Algorithm required for SR can be achieved directly
   with PPR with several advantages:

   o  The scope of a PPR path is strictly limited to the sub-path
      between the SR nodes.

   o  The path can be directly specifies rather than implicitly through
      metrics

   o  Resources (such as specialist queues etc.) may be directly mapped
      to the PPR path and hence to the SR sub-path.

2.5.  PPR for energy-optimized networks

   Improving energy efficiency and reducing power consumption are
   becoming of increasing importance for many industries, which includes
   network operators as well as users and providers of networking
   services.  Network providers can contribute to addressing those
   challenges by making their networks more energy-efficient.  This
   includes the support of power saving schemes that guide traffic along
   paths deemed particularly "energy efficient".

   A significant opportunity to reduce power consumption concerns
   powering down (or putting into power saving mode) equipment
   (including line card, ports, etc.) that may not be currently needed.
   At the same time, the incremental power consumption for additional
   traffic on ports and equipment already under power is for all
   practical purposes negligible.  Optimizing energy efficiency thus
   involves directing traffic in such a way that it allows for isolation
   of equipment that may at the moment not be needed so that it could be
   powered down or brought into power-saving mode.

   This implies that power efficiency of networks can be greatly
   affected by the paths along which traffic is directed at any
   particular point in time.  Proper engineering of those paths and the
   ability to configure them effectively thus becomes an important tool
   to optimize power usage of networks and make them more energy

   efficient.  PPR provides a mechanism that enables this, allowing to
   engineer dynamic paths that optimize the network from an energy
   savings perspective as one important set of criteria for any
   underlying data plane in the network.

3.  Preferred Path Routing (PPR)

   PPR allows the direction of traffic along an engineered path through
   the network by replacing the SID label stack or the SID list with a
   single PPR-ID.  The PPR-ID may either be a single label (MPLS) or a
   native destination prefix (IPv4/IPv6).  This enables the use of a
   single data plane identifier to describe an entire path.

   A PPR path could be an (Segmented Routed) SR path, a traffic
   engineered path computed based on some constraints, an explicitly
   provisioned Fast Re-Route (FRR) path or a service chained path.  A
   PPR path can be signaled by any node, computed by a central
   controller, or manually configured by an operator.  PPR extends the
   source routing and path steering capabilities to native IP (IPv4 and
   IPv6) data planes without hardware upgrades; see Section 3.1.

                           Figure 2: IGP Network

   In the Figure 2, consider node R1 as an ingress node, or a head-end
   node, and the node R3 may be an egress node or another head-end node.
   The numbers shown on links between nodes indicate the bi-directional
   IGP metric as provisioned (no number indicates a metric of 1).  R1
   may be configured to receive TE source routed path information from a
   central entity (PCE [RFC5440], Netconf [RFC6241] or a Controller)
   that comprises PPR information which relates to sources that are
   attached to R1.  It is also possible to have a PPR provisioned




Bryant, et al.           Expires April 28, 2022                 [Page 9]

   locally by the operator for non-TE needs (e.g., FRR or for chaining
   certain services).

   The PPR is encoded as an ordered list of path elements from source to
   a destination node in the network and is represented with a PPR-ID to
   represent the path.  The path can represent both topological and non-
   topological elements (for example, links, nodes, queues, priority and
   processing actions) and specifies the actual path towards the egress
   node.

   o  The shortest path towards R3 from R1 is through the following
      sequence of nodes: R1-R2-R3 based on the provisioned IGP metrics.

   o  The central entity in this example, can define a PPRs from R1 to
      R3 and R1 to R6 that deviate from the shortest path based on other
      network characteristic requirements as requested by an application
      or service.  For example, the network characteristics or
      performance requirements may include bandwidth, jitter, latency,
      throughput, error rate, etc.

   o  In a VPN setup, nodes R1, R3 and R6 are PE nodes and other nodes
      are P nodes.  User traffic entering at the ingress PE nodes gets
      encapsulated (e.g., MPLS, GRE, GTP, IP-IN-IP, GUE) and will be
      delivered to the egress PE.

   Consider two paths in the above network:

   o  PATH-1: A first PPR may be identified by PPR-ID = r3' with the
      path description R1-R2-L26-R6-R3 for a Prefix advertised by R3.
      This is an example of a strict path with a combination of links
      and nodes.

   o  PATH-2: A second PPR may be identified by PPR-ID = r6' with the
      path description R1-R5-R6.  This is an example of a loose path.
      Though this example shows PPRs with node identifiers it is
      possible to have a PPR with a combination of Non-Topological
      elements along the path.

   The first topological element relative to the beginning of PPR Path
   descriptor contains the information about the first node in the path
   that the packet must pass through (e.g. equivalent to the top label
   in SR-MPLS and the first SID in an SRv6 SRH).  The last topological
   sub-object or PDE contains information about the last node (e.g. in
   SR-MPLS it is equivalent to the bottom SR label).

   Each IGP node receiving a complete path description, determines
   whether the node is on the advertised PPR path.  This is called the
   PPR on-path check.  It then determines whether it is included more



Bryant, et al.           Expires April 28, 2022                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                PPR Framework                 October 2021


   than once on that path.  This PPR validation prevents the formation
   of a routing loop.  If the path is looped, no further processing of
   the PPR is undertaken.  (Note that even if it is invalid, the PPR
   descriptor must still be flooded to preserve the consistency of the
   underlying routing protocol).  If the validation succeeds, the
   receiving IGP node installs a Forwarding Information dataBase (FIB)
   entry for the PPR-ID with the NextHop (NH) required to take the
   packet to the next topological path element in the path description.
   Processing of PPRs may be done at the end of the IGP SPF computation.

   Consider PPR path PATH-1 in Figure 2.  When node R5 receives the PPR
   (PATH-1) information it does not install a FIB entry for PATH-1
   because this PPR does not include node R5 in the path description/
   ordered path list.

   However, node R5 determines that the second PPR (PATH-2), does
   include the node R5 in its path description (the on-path check
   passes).  Therefore, node R5 updates its FIB to include an entry for
   the destination address that R6 indicates (PPR-ID) along with path
   description.  This allows the forwarding of data packets with the
   PPR-ID (r6') to the next element along the path, and hence towards
   node R6.

   To summarize the control plane processing, the receiving IGP node
   determines if it is on the path by checking the node's topological
   elements in the path list.  If it is, it adds/adjusts the PPR-ID's
   shortest path NH towards the next topological path element in the
   PPR's path list.  This process continues at every IGP node as
   specified in the path description TLV.

3.1.  PPR Data Plane aspects

   Data plane type for PPR-ID is selected by the entity (e.g., a
   controller, locally provisioned by operator), which selects a
   particular PPR in the network.

3.1.1.  PPR Native IP Data Planes

   In an IPv4 network, source routing and packet steering with PPR can
   be done by selecting the IPv4 data plane type (PPR-IPv4), in PPR Path
   description with a corresponding IPv4 address/prefix as PPR-ID while
   signaling the path description in the control plane Section 3.2.
   Forwarding is done by setting the destination IP address of the
   packet as PPR-ID at the ingress node of the network.  In this case
   this is an IPv4 address in the tunneled/encapsulated user packet.
   There is no data plane change or upgrade needed to support this
   functionality.




Bryant, et al.           Expires April 28, 2022                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                PPR Framework                 October 2021


   Similarly, for an IPv6 network source routing and packet steering can
   be done in IPv6 data plane type (PPR-IPv6), along the path as
   described in PPR Path description with a corresponding IPv6 address/
   prefix as PPR-ID in the control plane Section 3.2.  Whatever
   specified above for IPv4 applies here too, except that destination IP
   address of the encapsulated data packet at the edge node is an IPv6
   Address (PPR-ID).  This doesn't require any IPv6 extension headers
   (EH).

   For a loose path in an IPv4 or IPv6 network (Native IPv4 or IPv6 data
   planes respectively) the packet has to be encapsulated using the
   capabilities (either dynamically signaled through
   [I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap] or statically provisioned on the
   nodes) of the next loose PDE in the path description.

   Consider the network fragment shown in Figure 3 which further
   illustrates loose routing, and consider PATH-3.  Node R2 can reach R5
   ECMP through R2->R3->R4, and R2->R6->R4, both at cost 2.  The path
   R2->R7->R8->R4 is longer (cost 3) and is not a path that R2 would
   choose to use it to reach R4.  Node R2 (start of the loose segment)
   is programmed to encapsulate a data packet towards the next loose
   topological PPR-PDE in the path, which is R4.  The NH computed at R1
   (for PPR-ID r5') would be the shortest path towards R5 i.e., the
   interfaces towards R2.  R2 has an ECMP towards R3 and R6 to reach R4
   (next PDE in the loose segment), as packet would be encapsulated at
   R2 for R4 as the destination.  R7 and R8 are not involved in this PPR
   path and so do not need a FIB entry for PPR-ID r5' (the on-path check
   for PATH-3 fails at these nodes).

          |              |
          |              |     r5'

          |              |     r5''

                     Figure 3: Network with Loose Path

   In a strict path, for example, PATH-4 in Figure 3, PPR-ID is
   programmed on the data plane at each node of the path, with NH set to
   the shortest path towards the next topological PPR-PDE.  In this
   case, no further encapsulation of the data packet is required.

3.1.2.  SR-MPLS with PPR

   PPR is fully backward compatible with the SR data plane.  As control
   plane PDEs can be extensible and particular data plane identifiers
   can be expressed to describe the path, in SR case PDEs can contain
   the SR SIDs.

   In SR-MPLS, a data packet contains the stack of labels (path steering
   instructions) which guides the packet traversal in the network.  For
   SR-MPLS data plane, the complete set of label stack is represented
   with a unique SR SID/Label, PPR-ID, to represent the path.  The PPR-
   ID gets programmed on the data plane of each node, with the
   appropriate NH computed as specified in Section 3.  PPR-ID here is a
   label/index from the SRGB (like another node SID or global ADJ-SID).
   PPR path description in the control plane is a set of ordered SIDs
   represented with PPR-PDEs.  Non-Topological segments described along
   with the topological PDEs can also be programmed in the forwarding
   plane to enable specific function/service, when the data packet hits
   with corresponding PPR-ID.

   For SR-MPLS data plane, either 1 label or 2 labels need to be
   provisioned on individual nodes on the path description.  In the
   example network Figure 2, for PATH-2 (a loose path), during control
   plane processing, node R1 programs the bottom label as PPR-ID and the
   top label as the next topological PPR-PDE in the path, which is a
   node SID of R5.  In the control plane, the NH computed at R1 would be
   the shortest path towards R5 i.e., the interfaces towards R2 and R4
   (ECMP).  For strict paths, a single label (PPR-ID) is programmed on
   the data plane along the path, with NH set to the shortest path
   towards the next topological PPR-PDE in the path description.

3.1.3.  SRv6, Network Programming and PPR

   One of the key benefits PPR offers for SRv6 data plane is an
   optimized data plane as individual path steering SIDs in the data
   packet is replaced with a path identifier (PPR-ID).  Thus potentially
   avoids MTU, hardware incompatibilities and processing overhead.  Few
   PPR and SRv6 inter working scenarios are listed below.

   In a simple encapsulation mode without SRH [RFC8754], an SRv6 SID can
   be used as PPR-ID.  With this approach path steering can be brought
   in with PPR and some of the network functions as defined in [RFC8986]
   can be realized at the egress node as PPR-ID in this case is a SRv6
   SID.

   In SRv6 with SRH, one-way PPR-ID can be used, by setting it as the
   destination IPv6 address and SL field in SRH is set to 0; here, SRH
   can contain any other TLVs and non-topological SIDs as needed.

Internet-Draft                PPR Framework                 October 2021


   Another inter working case can be a multi area IGP deployment.  In
   this case multiple PPR-IDs corresponding to each IGP area can be
   encoded as SIDs in SRH for an end-to-end path steering with minimal
   SIDs in SRH.

3.2.  PPR Control Plane aspects

3.2.1.  PPR-ID and Data Plane Extensibility

   The data plane identifier, PPR-ID, describes a path through the
   network.  A data plane type and corresponding PPR-ID can be specified
   with the advertised path description in the IGP.  The PPR-ID type
   allows data plane extensibility for PPR, though it is currently
   defined for IPv4, IPv6, SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.

   For native IP data planes, this is mapped to either IPv4 or IPv6
   address/prefix.  For SR-MPLS, PPR-ID is mapped to an MPLS Label/SID
   and for SRv6, this is mapped to an IPv6-SID.  This is further
   detailed in Section 3.1 and Section 3.1.3.

3.2.2.  PPR Path Description Elements (PDEs)

   The path identified by the PPR-ID is described as a set of Path
   Description Elements (PDEs), each of which represents a segment of
   the path.  Each node determines its location in the path as
   described, and forwards to the next segment/hop or label of the path
   description (see the Forwarding Procedure Example later in this
   document).

   These PPR-PDEs like SR SIDs, can represent topological elements like
   links/nodes, backup nodes, as well as non- topological elements such
   as a service, function, or context on a node with additional control
   information as needed.

   A preferred path can be described as a Strict-PPR or a Loose-PPR.  In
   a Strict-PPR all nodes/links on the path are described with SR-SIDs
   for SR data planes or IPv4/IPV6 addresses for native IP data planes.
   In a Loose-PPR only some of the nodes/links from source to
   destination are described.  More specifics and restrictions around
   Strict/Loose PPRs are described in respective data planes in
   Section 3.1 and Section 3.1.3.  Each PDE is described as either an
   MPLS label towards the NH in MPLS enabled networks, or as an IP NH,
   in the case of either 'plain'/'native' IP or SRv6 enabled networks.
   A PPR path is related to a set of PDEs using the TLVs specified in
   the respective IGPs.

Internet-Draft                PPR Framework                 October 2021


3.2.3.  ECMP Considerations

   PPR inherently supports Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) for both strict
   and loose paths.  If a path is described using nodes, it would have
   ECMP NHs established for PPR-ID along the path.  In the network shown
   in Figure 2, for PATH-2, node R1 would establish ECMP NHs computed by
   the IGP, towards R5 for the PPR-ID r6'.  However, one can avoid ECMP
   on any segment of the path by pinning the path using link identifier
   to the next segment as specified for PATH-1 in Figure 2.

3.2.4.  PPR Services along the Path

        +--------+
        | PPR-ID |
        +--------+-----------+--------+--------+---------+--------+
        |PDE-1   | Context-1 |PDE-2   |PDE-x   |Service-x|PDE-n   |
        +--------+-----------+--------+--------+---------+--------+

                Figure 4: Services along the Preferred Path

   As shown in Figure 4, some of the services specific to a preferred
   path, can be encoded as non-topological PDEs and can be part of the
   path description.  These services are applied at the respective nodes
   along the path.  In Figure 4, PDE-1,PDE-2, PDE-x, PDE-n are
   topological PDEs of a data plane.  For SR-MPLS/SRv6 data planes these
   are simply SIDs and for native IP data planes corresponding non-
   topological addresses.  When the data packet with a PPR-ID is
   delivered to node-1, the packet is delivered to Context-1.  Similarly
   on node-x, Service-x is applied.  These services/functions need to be
   pre-provisioned on the particular nodes and optionally can be
   advertised in IGPs.

   The above gives the basic and light weight service chaining
   capability with PPR without incurring any additional overhead on the
   data packet.  However, this is limited to fixed services/functions
   for a path and all data packets using the path will be applied with
   these services.  Flow level exclusions using the same path or
   differentiated services that need to be applied with in a flow cannot
   be supported with this mechanism and one has to resort to data plane
   mechanisms as defined in NSH/SFC [RFC8300].

3.2.5.  PPR Graphs

   In a network of N nodes a total O(N^2) unidirectional paths are
   necessary to establish any-to-any connectivity, and multiple (k) such
   path sets may be desirable if multiple path policies are to be
   supported (lowest latency, highest throughput etc.).

   In many solutions and topologies, N may be small enough and/or only a
   small set of paths need to be preferred paths, for example for high
   value traffic (DetNet, some of the defined 5G slices), and then a
   point-to-point path structure specified in this document can support
   these deployments.

            Figure 5: Network with a Graph Structure: PPR TREE

   However, to address the scale needed when a larger number of PPR
   paths are required and for TE aware IPFRR Section 4, PPR TREE
   structure can be used.

   Consider the network fragment in Figure 5, where two PPR paths,
   PATH-1 and PATH-5 are shown from different ingress PE nodes (R1, R4)
   to the same egress PE node (R3).  In a simple PPR Tree structure,
   these 2 paths can be combined to form a PPR Tree structure.  PPR Tree
   is one type of a graph where multiple source nodes are rooted at one
   particular destination node, with one or more branches.  Figure 5,
   shows a PPR TREE (GRAPH-1), with 2 branches constructed with
   different PDEs, has a common PDE (node R2) and with a forwarding
   Identifier Rg3' (PPR-ID) at the destination node R3.

   Each PPR Tree uses one label/SID and defines paths from any set of
   nodes to one destination, this reduces the number of entries needed.
   For example, it reduces the number of forwarding identifiers needed
   in SR-MPLS data plane Section 3.1.2 with PPR, which are derived from
   the SRGB at the egress node.  These paths are form a tree rooted at
   the destination.  In other word, PPR Tree identifiers are destination
   identifiers and PPR Trees are path engineered destination routes

   (like IP routes) and its scaling simplifies to linear in N i.e.,
   O(k*N).

   In a completely different usage paradigm, a PPR Graph can also have
   multiple forwarding identifiers (PPR-IDs).  Based on the algorithm
   specified for the Graph, path computation can be done in a
   distributed fashion in the network to establish the forwarding over
   the graph.  Various types of PPR Graphs, rules for construction and
   their usage details will be described in future revisions.

3.2.6.  PPR Multi-Domain Scenarios

   PPR can be extended to multi-domain, including multi-area scenarios
   as shown in Figure 6.

            D1             D2
          ......         ......
         .       .r2'   .      .r4'
        R1........R2--R3........R4
         .       .      .      .
          ......         ......

            PATH-6 = R1-R2-R3-R4

                  Figure 6: Multi-Domain Network with PPR

   Operation of PPR within the domain is as described in the preceding
   sections of this document.  The key difference in operation in multi-
   domain concerns the value of the PPR-ID in the packet.  There are
   three approaches that can be taken:

   1.  The PPR-ID is constant along the end-end-path.  This requires
       coordination of the PPR-ID in each domain.  This has the
       convenience of a uniform identity for the path.  However, whilst
       an IPv6 network has a large PPR identity space, this is not the
       case for MPLS and is less the case for IPv4.  The approach also
       has the disadvantage that the entirety of the domains involved
       need to be configured and provisioned with the common value.  In
       the network shown in Figure 6 The PPR-ID for PATH-6 is r4'.

   2.  The PPR-ID for each individual domain is the value that best
       suits that domain, and the PPR-ID is swapped at the boundary of
       the domains.  This allows a PPR-ID that best suits arch domain.
       This is similar to the approach taken with multi-segment
       pseudowire [RFC5659].  This approach better suits the needs of
       network layers with limited identity resources.  It also enables
       the better coordination of PPR-IDs.  In this approach the PPR-ID
       for PATH-6 would be r2' in domain D1 and r4' in domain D2.  These

       two PPR-IDs would be distributed in their own domains and the
       only inter-domain co-ordination required would be between R2 and
       R3.

   3.  A variant of (2) is that the PPR-IDs are domain specific, but a
       segment routing approach is taken in which they encoded at
       ingress (R1), and are popped at the inter-domain boarder.  This
       requires that the domain ingress and egress routers support
       segment routing data-plane capability.

   Although the example shown in Figure 6 shows the case of two domains,
   nothing limits the design to just two IGP areas.  This further
   explained below.

   In controller based deployments, each IGP area can have separate
   north bound and south bound communication end points with PCE/SDN
   controller, in their respective domain.  It is expected that PPR
   paths for each IGP level are computed and provisioned at the ingress
   nodes of the corresponding area's area boarder router.  Separate path
   advertisement in the respective IGP area should happen with the same
   PPR-ID.  With this, only PPR-ID needs to be leaked to the other area,
   as long as a path is available in the destination area for that PPR-
   ID.  If the destination area is not provisioned with path
   information, area boarder shall not leak the PPR-ID to the
   destination area.

3.3.  PPR Management Plane Aspects

3.3.1.  IGP Metric Independent Paths/Graphs

   PRR allows a considerable simplification in the design and management
   of networks.  In a best effort network the setting of the IGP metrics
   is a complex problem with competing constraints.  A set of metrics
   the is optimal for traffic distribution under normal operation may
   not be optimal under conditions of failure of one or more of the
   network components.  Nor is that choice of metrics necessarily best
   for operation under all IPFRR conditions.  When SR is introduced to
   the network a further constraint on metrics is the need to limit the
   size of the SID stack/list.  These problems further increase with the
   introduction of demanding technologies such as network slicing and
   deterministic networking.

   Some mitigation occurs with the use of FlexAlgo
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] but fundamentally this is still an approach
   that is critically dependent on the per-flex-algo provisioning of
   different metrics on participating nodes, that operate in both the
   normal and the failure case.

Internet-Draft                PPR Framework                 October 2021


   PPR allows the network to simply introduce metric independent paths
   on a strategic or tactical basis.  Being metric independent each PPR
   path operates ships-in-the-night with respect to all other paths.
   This means that the network management system can address network
   tuning on a case by case basis only needing to worry about the
   traffic matrix along the path rather than needing to deconvolve the
   impact of tuning a metric on the whole traffic matrix.  In other
   words, PPR is a direct method of tuning the traffic rather than an
   the indirect method that metric tuning provides.

   An example that makes this clear is the maximally redundant tree
   (MRT) approach to IPFRR.  MRT requires the tuning of metrics to tune
   the paths, and a common algorithm for all nodes in the network.  An
   equivalent solution can be introduced to the network by the insertion
   of a pair of PPR graphs by the network management system.
   Furthermore the topology of these graphs are independent of all other
   graphs, allowing the tuning and migration of the repair paths in the
   network management system.

   Thus PPR allows the operator to focus on the desired traffic path of
   specific groups of packets independent of the desired path of the
   packets in all other paths.

3.3.2.  Granular OAM

   For some of the deployments as described in Section 2, the ability to
   collect certain statistics about PPR path usage, including how much
   traffic a PPR path carries and at what times from any node in the
   network is a critical requirement.  Such statistics can be useful to
   account for the degree of usage of a path and provide additional
   operational insights, including usage patterns and trending
   information.

   Traffic for certain PPRs may have more stringent requirement w.r.t
   accounting for critical SLAs (e.g. 5G non-eMBB slice) and should
   account for any link/node failures along the path.  Optional per path
   attributes like Packet Traffic Accounting" and "Traffic Statistics"
   instructs all the respective nodes along the path to provision the
   hardware and to account for the respective traffic statistics.
   Traffic accounting should be applied based on the PPR-ID.  This
   capability allows a more granular and dynamic measurement of traffic
   statistics for only certain PPRs as needed.

   As routing happens on the abstracted path identifier in the packet,
   no additional per packet instruction is needed for achieving the
   above functionality regardless of the data plane used in the network
   Section 3.1.

4.  Preferred Path Loop Free Alternatives (pLFA )

   PPR can be used as a method of providing IPFRR.  Preferred Path Loop-
   Free Alternate (pLFA) allows the construction of arbitrary engineered
   backup paths pLFA and inherits the low packet overhead of PPR
   requiring a simple encapsulation and a single path identifier for any
   path of any complexity.

   pLFA provides a superset of RSVP-TE repairs (complete with traffic
   engineering capability) and Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternates
   (TI-LFA) [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa].  However, unlike
   the TI-LFA approaches PPR is applicable to a more complete set of
   data planes (for example MPLS, both IPv4 and IPv6 and Ethernet) where
   it can provide a rich set of IPFRR capabilities ranging from simple
   best-effort repair calculated at the point of local repair (PLR) to
   full traffic engineered paths.  For any repair path pLFA requires one
   encapsulation and one PPR-ID, regardless of the complexity and
   constraints of the path.

   For a basic understanding of pLFA consider the case of a link repair
   shown in this example as shown in Figure 7, we assume that we have a
   path A-B-C-D that the packet must traverse.  This may be a normal
   best effort path or a traffic engineered path.

                                    c'
                         A---B--//--C---D
                             |      |
                             E---F--G
                                 f'

                                 Figure 7

   PPR is used to inject the repair path B->E->F->G->C into the network
   with a PPR-ID of c'.  B is monitoring the health of link B->C, for
   example looking for loss-of-light, or using Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].  When B detects a failure it encapsulates
   the packet to C by adding to the packet an encapsulation with a
   destination address set as the PPR-ID for c' and then sending the
   packet to E.  At C the packet is decapsulated and sent to D.  The
   path B->E->F->G->C may be a traffic engineered path or it may be a
   best effort path.  This may of course be the post convergence path
   from B to C, as is used by TI-LFA However B may have at its disposal
   multiple paths to C with different properties for different traffic
   classes.  In this case each path to be used would require its own
   PPR-ID (c', c'' etc.).  Because pLFA only requires a single path
   identifier regardless of the complexity of the path is not necessary
   constrain the path to be a small number of loose source routed paths
   to protect against MTU or maximum SID count considerations.

   pLFA supports the usual IPFRR features such as early release into
   Q-space, node repair, and shared risk link group support, LANs, ECMP
   and multi-homed prefixes.  However the ability to apply repair graphs
   Section 3.2.5 is unique to pLFA.  The use of graphs in IPFRR repair
   simplifies the construction of traffic engineered repair paths, and
   allows for the construction of arbitrary maximally redundant tree
   repair paths.

   Of importance in any IPFRR strategy in a loosely routed network,
   including normal connectionless routing is the ability to support
   loop-free convergence.  This problem is described in [RFC5715].
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] has proposed a mitigation
   technique for failures (noted above) and pLFA is able to support
   this.  However a network supporting high reliability traffic may find
   mitigation insufficient.  Also disruption can take place on network
   component inclusion (or repair/recovery) and TI-LFA is silent on
   this.  A network using pLFA is compatible with all of the know loop-
   free convergence and loop mitigation approaches described in
   [RFC5715].

5.  Traffic Engineering Attributes

   In addition to determining the nodes to traverse, there may be other
   aspects that need to be set up for a path.  Most notably, this
   concerns the allocation and reservation of resources along the path
   to help ensure the service levels, i.e. the Quality of Service that
   is delivered across the path, will be acceptable for the traffic
   routed across the path (critical in some deployments as listed in
   Section 2).

   While SR allows packet steering on a specified path (for MPLS and
   IPv6 with SRH), it does not have any notion of QoS or resources
   reserved along the path.  The determination of which resources to
   allocate and reserve on nodes across the path, like the determination
   of the path itself, can in many cases be made by a controller.
   Accordingly, PPR includes extensions that allow to manage those
   reservations, in addition to the path itself.

   Key aspect of the solution concerns with specifying the resources to
   be reserved along the preferred path, through path attributes TLVs.
   Reservations are expressed in terms of required resources
   (bandwidth), traffic characteristics (burst size), and service level
   parameters (expected maximum latency at each hop) based on the
   capabilities of each node and link along the path.  The second part
   of the solution is providing mechanism to indicate the status of the
   reservations requested i.e. if these have been honored by individual
   node/links in the path.  This can be done by defining a new TLV/Sub-
   TLV in respective IGPs.  Another aspect is additional node level TLVs

   and extensions to IS-IS-TE [RFC7810] and OSPF-TE [RFC7471] to provide
   accounting/usage statistics that have to be maintained at each node
   per preferred path.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any allocations from IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   Advertisement of the additional information defined in this document
   introduces no new security concerns in IGP protocols.  However, for
   extensions related to SR-MPLS and SRH data planes, those particular
   data plane security considerations does apply here.
