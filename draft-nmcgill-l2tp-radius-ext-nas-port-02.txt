Internet-Draft    RADIUS & L2TP Extended NAS-Port AVPs         July 2004



1.  Introduction


   It is often desirable to send adjunct and port usage information from
   the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) to the L2TP Network Server (LNS)
   during call setup.  Such information may be used for:



      Logging
         to describe system and port related information in a
         human-readable, vendor-specific form.
      Authorization
         to restrict users to particular given access types or
         interfaces.
      Accounting
         to determine port usage on a per-user basis, for example, via
         RADIUS accounting [RFC2866].
      Auditing
         to ensure that the LNS vendor is being allocated the proper
         contractual resources by the LAC vendor.


   L2TP [RFC2661] already has a Physical Channel ID AVP that may be used
   to provide port usage information.  However, its usefulness is
   limited in multi-vendor LAC/LNS environments where the vendor-
   specific bit encoding used for this AVP will often not be understood
   by L2TP peers from differing vendors.


   This makes the task of de-constructing the Physical Channel ID AVP
   contents at the LNS for (RADIUS) authorization/accounting server
   extremely difficult.


   Additionally, it is length limited to 4 octets of information which
   is inadequate in access servers supporting multiple access types and
   large numbers of ports.


   This document defines extensions whereby such port usage information
   may be transferred in a vendor-independent fashion between
   mixed-vendor LAC and LNSs, thus facilitating detailed and matching
   logging and accounting at each end of the tunnel.

   The following diagram depicts a typical dialin scenario for L2TP with
   RADIUS accounting servers at the LNS:

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  L2TP Extended NAS-Port AVPs


   The following collection of Extended NAS-Port AVPs, attribute types
   TBD, allow detailed logging and port usage information to be
   transmitted between L2TP peers.  This format is common to all
   Extended NAS-Port AVPs; only the Attribute Type is different for
   each:


     0                   1                   2                   3

   NOTES:


   o  Each Extended NAS-Port AVP is encoded as the IETF Vendor ID 0


   o  Each AVP has defined behaviour associated with it, namely:

      Passthrough AVPs: If this AVP is received by a node participating
         in a multi-hop scenario, then the AVP MUST be copied as-is to
         the next hop.  A locally generated AVP MAY be generated if
         required and appended in the outbound message to the next hop.


      Stackable AVPs: If this AVP is received by a node participating in
         a multi-hop scenario, then the AVP MUST be copied as-is to the
         next hop.  A locally generated AVP MUST be generated and
         appended in the outbound message to the next hop.  If no value
         is appropriate then an AVP of Length 0 MUST be appended.


   o  The value of all bits MUST be preserved in any AVPs copied.



   The following are valid values for the Attribute Type field:


      TBD - Platform Information


         This AVP, length 0-253, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent with a
         human-readable description of the platform.


         Examples: "Model 457", or "TPX-1700".


         This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
         action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         The M-bit MUST be set to 0.  The H-bit MAY be set based on the
         current L2TP node's policy.  This AVP is a stackable AVP.


      TBD - System Identification Information


         This AVP, length 0-253, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent with a
         human-readable description of the router's identification
         within the provider's network.


         Examples: "CommCo LAC", or "SuperProvider AS".


         This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
         action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         The M-bit MUST be set to 0.  The H-bit MAY be set based on the
         current L2TP node's policy.  This AVP is a stackable AVP.


      TBD - Call Information


         This AVP, length 0-253, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent with a
         human-readable description of the call.

         Examples could include "Atlanta POP", or "Neptune-304x using
         frame2 module".


         This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
         action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         The M-bit MUST be set to 0.  The H-bit MAY be set based on the
         current L2TP node's policy.  This AVP is a stackable AVP.


      TBD - Software Information


         This AVP, length 0-253, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent with a
         human-readable description of the software running on the
         platform.


         Examples: "Version 4-0.12(c)-2", or "Rev 10.4.2-beta".


         This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
         action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         The M-bit MUST be set to 0.  The H-bit MAY be set based on the
         current L2TP node's policy.  This AVP is a stackable AVP.


      TBD - Vendor-Information AVP


         This AVP, length 0-253, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent with a
         human-readable description of the vendor of the platform.


         Examples: "Hudson Computer Systems", or "Lightning Networks".


         This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
         action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         The M-bit MUST be set to 0.  The H-bit MAY be set based on the
         current L2TP node's policy.  This AVP is a stackable AVP.

      TBD - Virtual Circuit
      TBD - Virtual Lan
      TBD - Virtual Interface
      TBD - Virtual Sub-interface


         This AVP, length 0 or 4, is an octet integer value,
         representing a specific Extended NAS-Port AVP value at this
         L2TP node.


         The M-bit MUST be set to 0.  The H-bit MAY be set based on the
         current L2TP node's policy.  These AVPs are passthrough AVPs.


      All Extended NAS-Port AVPs SHOULD be used in conjunction with the
      Port Type List AVP [I-D.ietf-l2tpext-sesinfo] to allow correlation
      between port type and usage.


      For incoming calls, these AVPs are valid either on ICRQ or ICCN.
      If sent on both, the ICCN AVP MUST override the ICRQ value.  For
      outgoing calls, the AVPs are valid on OCRP and OCCN, with similar
      override behavior.


3.  RADIUS Extended NAS-Port AVP


   The RADIUS Extended NAS-Port AVP closely resembles its L2TP counter-
   part and allows detailed port-usage/accounting information to be
   provided in multi-vendor environments.


   The key distinction is that for RADIUS we have a single new attribute
   with multiple Extensions, encoded as string attribute-value pairs of
   the form "<extension>=<value>".  These Extensions exist in a one-to-
   one mapping with the previously defined L2TP AVPs.


   The following format is common to all Extended NAS-Port AVPs; only
   the Extension string name is different for each:


     0                   1                   2
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

      >= 3


   Value


      This attribute is of string format, with the following definition:


      "<extension>=<value>"


      Where "<extension>" is one of the following case-sensitive
      strings:


         "platform" - Platform Information


            This AVP, length 3-255, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent
            with a human-readable description of the platform.


            Examples: "platform=Model 457", or "platform=TPX-1700".


            This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
            action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         "system-id" - System Identification Information


            This AVP, length 3-255, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent
            with a human-readable description of the routers
            identification within the provider's network.


            Examples: "system-id=CommCo LAC", or
            "system-id=SuperProvider AS".


            This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
            action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         "call" - Call Information


            This AVP, length 3-255, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent
            with a human-readable description of the call.


            Examples could include "call=Atlanta POP", or "call=Neptune-
            304x using frame2 module".


            This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination

            the platform.


            Examples: "software=Version 4-0.12(c)-2", or "software=Rev

            This information MUST NOT be parsed and as such termination
            action MUST NOT be based on the contents of this attribute.


         "vendor" - Vendor-Information AVP


            This AVP, length 3-255, allows a UTF-8 string to be sent
            with a human-readable description of the vendor of the
            platform.


            Examples: "vendor=Hudson Computer Systems", or
            "vendor=Lightning Networks".

         "port" - Port
         "channel" - Channel
         "phys-intf" - Physical Interface
         "phys-subintf" - Physical Sub-interface
         "vpi" - Virtual Path
         "vci" - Virtual Circuit
         "vlan" - Virtual Lan
         "vintf" - Virtual Interface
         "vsubintf" - Virtual Sub-interface


            These AVPs, length 3-255, allow a UTF-8 string to be sent
            with the integer value of the relevant Extended NAS-Port
            AVP.


            Examples: "vpi=3", "vci=0", "vlan=12345"


   For L2TP tunnels, these attributes MUST be used, if available, to log
   information obtained via the corresponding L2TP Extended NAS-Port
   AVPs.  See section 2.


   To cater for L2TP multi-hop environments, if an L2TP Extended NAS-
   Port AVP is available, but without a corresponding value, then the

Internet-Draft    RADIUS & L2TP Extended NAS-Port AVPs         July 2004



   associated RADIUS AVP MUST be encoded as "<extension>"


   The sequence of RADIUS Extended NAS-Port AVPs MUST follow that of any
   L2TP Extended NAS-Port AVPs received.


   For scenarios without L2TP, these attributes MAY also be used in
   preference over the RADIUS NAS-Port attribute to provide finer
   granularity during accounting.


   Where an attribute was not received from L2TP it is considered
   optional to send.


   For non L2TP environments, all Extensions are optional.


   All strings are NOT null terminated.


   Any numbers encoded as the value part of the Extension MUST be as
   strings with a minimum value of "0".  Only unsigned values MUST be
   sent.


   The use of the character '"' in this document is included purely as a
   visual aid in identifying the beginning and end of strings.  It MUST
   NOT be included as part of the end format, unless specifically
   encoded as data within the AVP Value section.


3.1  Table of Attributes


   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.


   For Authentication:


         Request  Accept  Reject  Challenge   Attribute
         0+       0       0       0           Extended NAS-Port


   For Accounting:


         Request  Response                    Attribute
         0+       0                           Extended NAS-Port



3.2  Interactions with other RADIUS attributes


   Extended NAS-Port overlaps in functionality with NAS-Port.  However,
   whereas the encoding of NAS-Port is limited to 32 bits and often
   vendor specific, Extended NAS-Port is not.  NAS-Port may still
   continue to be used but preference SHOULD be given to information
   received in Extended NAS-Port.

Internet-Draft    RADIUS & L2TP Extended NAS-Port AVPs         July 2004



   If a RADIUS vendor detects conflicting values between NAS-Port and
   Extended NAS-Port, Extended NAS-Port SHOULD be taken as the more
   accurate value.


3.3  Diameter Compatibility


   The RADIUS Extended NAS-Port attribute defined in this section may be
   translated for transmission via Diameter [RFC3588] by AAA Translation
   Agents as described by Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-nasreq].


   Such a translation might represent the extended NAS-Port information
   as a single Diameter attribute of type Grouped.  Each RADIUS
   <extension> valued defined in section 3 would map to a new Diameter
   attribute, all of which would be encapsulated in a single Grouped
   Extended-NAS-Port attribute.  The ABNF for such an attribute might
   look like:


        Extended-NAS-Port     ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
            [ NAS-Port-Platform ]
            [ NAS-Port-System-Id ]
            [ NAS-Port-Call ]
            [ NAS-Port-Software ]
            [ NAS-Port-Vendor ]
            [ NAS-Port-Shelf ]
            [ NAS-Port-Slot ]
            ...



4.  Security Considerations


   This document describes mechanisms where port termination information
   can be sent between L2TP peers.  Users of these AVPs should have the
   understanding that any information sent could be used for malicious
   purposes.  If this is a concern, any of the L2TP Extended NAS-Port
   List AVPs MAY be hidden.

   Information", and "Vendor Information" AVPs needs to be assigned an
   IETF "Attribute Type" from the "Control Message Attribute Value
   Pairs" maintained by IANA for L2TP.
