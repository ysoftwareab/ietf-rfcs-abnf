   Delay Tolerant Networking Time Synchronization - Problem Statement
                     draft-templin-dtntsync-00.txt

Abstract

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model
   in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or
   intermittent connectivity.  DTN nodes include timestamps in the
   bundles of data they send so that correspondents can identify the
   bundles and determine the length of time they have been in the
   system.  However, there is currently no specified strategy for
   synchronizing the clocks between DTN nodes.  This document therefore
   presents a problem statement for time synchronization in DTNs.

1.  Introduction

   The Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) architecture [RFC4838]
   introduces a data communications concept in which "bundles" of data
   are exchanged in store-and-forward fashion between endpoints that may
   be separated by long-delay or intermittently-connected paths.  The
   Bundle Protocol Specification [RFC5050] provides the bundle message
   format and operations, including convergence layer transmission,
   fragmentation and custody transfer.  Each bundle further may include
   extensions, among which may be security parameters designed to ensure
   confidentiality, integrity and authorization
   [RFC6257][I-D.irtf-dtnrg-sbsp].

   [WOOD08], Sections 4.2 - 4.4 has shown that time synchronization is
   an important aspect of correct operation.  In particular, the study
   points out that Bundle Protocol agents that obey [RFC5050] require a
   tightly-synchronized notion of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
   However, there may be operational use cases in which time
   synchronization without reliance on the Bundle Protocol itself may be
   difficult or impossible to achieve.  This document therefore
   discusses problematic aspects of the Bundle Protocol time
   synchronization requirement as motivation for solution proposals.


2.  Discussion

   Time synchronization in the Bundle Protocol serves three purposes:

   1.  Bundle lifetimes keep bundles from looping continuously due to
       routing loops

   2.  The lifetime allows the network to purge expired bundles

   3.  The creation timestamp is used to uniquely identify each bundle.

   However, the creation timestamp applied to each bundle is relative to
   the clock of the DTN source node that produced the bundle.  If the
   source node's clock is sufficiently drifted from UTC, this could
   result in several failure modes.  First, if a forwarding DTN node on
   the path to the final destination(s) receives a bundle whose
   timestamp appears to be in the future, the forwarding node may drop
   the bundle unconditionally and thereby deny service to the source
   node.  This can be due to either a time advancement in the source
   node's clock or a time lag in the forwarding node's clock.

   Second, if the timestamp applied by the source node is sufficiently
   advanced into the future and the bundle is not rejected by forwarding
   nodes, the bundle could spin continuously in a routing loop that is

   sustained longer than would be indicated by the bundle lifetime
   (thereby wasting network resources).  Finally, if the source node's
   clock has drifted sufficiently into the past, any forwarding nodes
   might discard the bundle based on the lifetime at a time that is
   earlier than the source node intended.

   Clearly, the current Bundle Protocol specification is dependent on
   closely synchronized clocks for proper operation, while clock
   synchronization may be difficult or impossible to achieve in some
   applications.  Also clearly, there may be other methods than strict
   clock synchronization that can address the purposes listed above.
   This document does not speculate as to alternate methods, but rather
   outlines the problems and invites solution proposals.


3.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


4.  Security Considerations

   Timestamps are an integral aspect of security, since mistaken notions
   of time may result in resource consumtion denial of service attack
   vectors..

   Bundle Protocol security considerations are discussed in
   [RFC6257][I-D.irtf-dtnrg-sbsp].


5.  Acknowledgments

   Time synchronization has been discussed broadly in DTN mailing list
   discussions as well as in many of the documents cited in this
   publication.
