1. Abstract
    This document describes the events and signals helpful for 
    signaling between CO and FXO at CPE.
    It is intended to satisfy the requirements in 
    section 12 of the Megaco RFC 3015/H.248 document.

3. FXO Package

    Package Name: FXO handling package

    PackageID: fxo (0xIANA)

    Description: This package handles various events and signals 
                 on FXO.

    Version: 1

INTERNET DRAFT            MEGACO/H.248 FXO package         February 2002

    Extends: None


3.1 Properties
    None

3.2 Events

3.2.1 Detect Ring 

      EventID: ri (0x????)

      Generated when a ring is detected on the FXO.

      EventsDescriptor parameters:
      None

      ObservedEventsDescriptor parameters:

      Caller ID

      ParameterID: cid (0x????)

      Type: String, returned as quoted string which MAY be empty.
      The string could be either in SDMF or MDMF format. If Caller
      Id information could not be detected for any reason an empty
      string SHALL be returned and SHALL NOT generate an Error 
      Descriptor.

    
3.2.2 Remote hangup

      EventID: rh (0x????)

      Generated when remote party going on-hook is detected 
      at FXO using end of call signal, which MAY vary depending
      on local CO. This event abstracts the actual signaling
      method (depending on Loop-start or Ground-start signaling 
      techniques) used by CO to indicate remote party going on-hook 
      to FXO. 

      EventsDescriptor parameters:
      None

      ObservedEventsDescriptor parameters:
      None


3.3 Signals

3.3.1 Send off-hook

      SignalID: of (0x????)

      Sends off-hook through FXO to CO.
