          Global IPv4 Address Configuration Option for DS-Lite
            draft-arifumi-softwire-dslite-global-addr-00.txt

Abstract

   When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 address
   depletion, DS-Lite is reasonable approach for solving both of the
   problems.  However, it is troublesome for an ISP to have the existing
   IPv4 service facilities and DS-Lite facilities at the same time for
   not a short period of time.  This document proposes a mechanism to
   assign an IPv4 global address in DS-Lite framework, which makes every
   customer to move to DS-Lite based network, and enables an ISP to
   maintain single facility of the service network.

Internet-Draft        DS-Lite Global Address Option           March 2010


1.  Introduction

   When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 address
   depletion, DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is reasonable
   approach for solving both of the problems.

   In the existing IPv4 service, an ISP usually provides an IPv4 global
   address for each customer.  IPv4 address depletion does not mean that
   ISP will lose already acquired IPv4 global address blocks, so they
   will continue to provide the IPv4 global address service to a part of
   the existing customers regardless of whether IPv6 connectivity
   service is provided to the customers or not.

   However, it will be troublesome for an ISP to have and maintain the
   existing IPv4 service facilities and DS-Lite facilities at the same
   time and for not a short period of time.

   This document proposes a mechanism to assign an IPv4 global address
   in DS-Lite framework, which makes every customer to move to DS-Lite
   based network, and enables an ISP to maintain single facility of the
   service network.


2.  Global IPv4 Address Assignment for B4

   A new DHCPv4 option is proposed here to assign an IPv4 global address
   for a customer.  This option is used in combination with the option
   to notify DS-Lite tunnel endpoint address defined in this draft
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option].

   When a DS-Lite capable router receives both of these options, that
   means the router should behave in DS-Lite with IPv4 global address
   manner.  When it receives just a tunnel endpoint option, that means
   the router should behave in normal DS-Lite manner.

   B4 should use the received IPv4 global address as the inner address
   of its DS-Lite tunnel interface.

   AFTR has to have IPv4 routing information, which is which DS-Lite
   tunnel should be used for forwarding IPv4 packet, for each IPv4 gobal
   address assigned customer.  AFTR just acts as a router and tunnel
   endpoint, not as a NAT device for this type of customers.  In order
   to tell whether do NATing or not, AFTR should have a list of IPv4
   global address blocks for NATing, or non-NATing, or both.  And, AFTR
   has to look at the list, when it receives a packet from tunnel
   interface and also from up-stream interface.

3.  DS-Lite Global IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4

   The DS-Lite Global IPv4 Address Option MUST NOT appear more than once
   in a message.

   The format of the DS-Lite Global IPv4 Address Option is shown in the
   following figure:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  option-code  |  option-len   |          IPv4 address         |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
       |      IPv4 address (cont.)     |
       +-------------------------------+

                 DS-Lite Global IPv4 Address DHCPv4 Option format.



4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate two DHCPv4 Option code referencing this
   document.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
