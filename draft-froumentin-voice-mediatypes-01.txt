1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the media types of the VoiceXML, SSML,
   SRGS, CCXML and PLS, the specifications of the W3C Speech Interface
   Platform

   VoiceXML is an XML language designed for creating audio dialogs that
   feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken
   and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed
   initiative conversations.  The associated media type defined in this
   document is "application/voicexml+xml".

   The Speech Synthesis Markup Language Specification (SSML) defines an
   XML-based markup language for assisting the generation of synthetic
   speech in Web and other applications.  The essential role of SSML is
   to provide authors of synthesizable content a standard way to control
   aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, rate, etc.
   across different synthesis-capable platforms.  The asociated media
   type defined in this document is "application/ssml+xml".

   The Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) defines syntax
   for representing grammars for use in speech recognition so that
   developers can specify the words and patterns of words to be listened
   for by a speech recognizer.  The syntax of the grammar format exists
   in two forms, an Augmented BNF Form and an XML Form.  The respective
   media types defined in this document are "application/srgs" and
   "application/srgs+xml".

   The Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML) is an XML
   language designed to provide telephony call control support for
   dialog systems, such as VoiceXML.  The associated media type defined
   in this document is "application/ccxml+xml".

   The Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) defines an XML syntax
   for specifying pronunciation lexicons to be used by speech
   recognition and speech synthesis engines in voice browser
   applications.  The associated media type defined in this document is
   "application/pls+xml".

2.  Registration of application/voicexml+xml, application/ssml+xml,
   application/srgs+xml, application/ccxml+xml and application/pls+xml

      MIME media type name: application
      MIME subtype names: voicexml+xml, ssml+xml, srgs+xml, ccxml+xml,
      pls+xml
      Required parameters: none
      Optional parameters:
         "charset": This parameter has identical semantics to the
         charset parameter of the "application/xml" media type as
         specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

2.1  Encoding considerations

   Identical to those of "application/xml" as described in RFC 3023
   [RFC3023], section 3.2

2.2  Interoperability considerations

   There are no known interoperability issues.

2.3  Published specifications

      Voice Extensible Markup Language 2.0 [VoiceXML2.0]
      Voice Extensible Markup Language 2.1 [VoiceXML2.1]
      Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 [SSML]
      Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 [SRGS]
      Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 [CCXML]
      Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) Version 1.0 [PLS]

2.4   Applications which use these media types

   Various W3C Speech Interface Platform implementations use these media
   types

2.5  Security Considerations

   Several instructions in the cited specifications may cause arbitrary
   URIs to be dereferenced.  In this case, the security issues of
   [RFC2396], section 7, should be considered.

   In addition, because of the extensibility features of those
   specifications, it is possible that the registered media types may
   describe content that has security implications beyond those
   described here.  However, if the processor follows only the normative
   semantics of the specifications, this content will be ignored.  Only
   in the case where the processor recognizes and processes the
   additional content, or where further processing of that content is

   dispatched to other processors, would security issues potentially
   arise.  And in that case, they would fall outside the domain of this
   registration document.

2.6  Additional Information

2.6.1  Magic numbers

   Although no byte sequences can be counted on to always be present,
   XML MIME entities in ASCII-compatible charsets (including UTF-8)
   often begin with hexadecimal 3C 3F 78 6D 6C ("<?xml"), and those in
   UTF-16 often begin with hexadecimal FE FF 00 3C 00 3F 00 78 00 6D 00
   6C or FF FE 3C 00 3F 00 78 00 6D 00 6C 00 (the Byte Order Mark (BOM)
   followed by "<?xml").  For more information, see Appendix F of [XML].

2.6.2  File extensions

   VoiceXML files: .vxml

   SSML files: .ssml

   SRGS files (XML syntax): .grxml

   CCXML files: .ccxml

   PLS files: .pls

2.6.3  Fragment identifiers

   Identical to that of "application/xml" as described in RFC 3023
   [RFC3023], section 5.

2.6.4  Macintosh File Type Code

   "TEXT"

3.  Registration of application/srgs

      MIME media type name: application
      MIME subtype names: srgs
      Required parameters: none
      Optional parameters: none

3.1  Encoding considerations

   The ABNF Form of SRGS follows the character encoding handling defined
   for XML: an ABNF grammar processor must accept both the UTF-8 and
   UTF-16 encodings of ISO/IEC 10646 and may support other character
   encodings.

3.2  Interoperability considerations

   There are no known interoperability issues.

3.3  Published specifications

      Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 [SRGS]

3.4   Applications which use this media types

   Various SRGS implementations use this media type.

3.5  Security Considerations

   Several instructions in SRGS may cause arbitrary URIs to be
   dereferenced.  In this case, the security issues of [RFC2396],
   section 7, should be considered.

   In addition, because of the extensibility features of SRGS, it is
   possible that the registered media types may describe content that
   has security implications beyond those described here.  However, if
   the processor follows only the normative semantics of the
   specifications, this content will be ignored.  Only in the case where
   the processor recognizes and processes the additional content, or
   where further processing of that content is dispatched to other
   processors, would security issues potentially arise.  And in that
   case, they would fall outside the domain of this registration
   document.

3.6  Additional Information

3.6.1  Magic numbers

   The ABNF self-identifying header must be present in any legal

   stand-alone ABNF Form grammar document.  The first character of an
   ABNF document must be the "#" symbol (x23) unless preceded by an
   optional XML 1.0 byte order mark.  The ABNF byte order mark follows
   the XML definition and requirements.  For example, documents encoded
   in UTF-16 must begin with the byte order mark.  The optional byte
   order mark and required "#" symbol must be followed immediately by
   the exact string "ABNF" (x41 x42 x4d x46) or the appropriate
   equivalent for the document's encoding (e.g.  for UTF-16
   little-endian: x23 x00 x41 x00 x42 x00 x4d x00 x46 x00).  If the byte
   order mark is absent on a grammar encoded in UTF-16 then the grammar
   processor should perform auto-detection of character encoding in a
   manner analogous to auto-detection of character encoding in XML.
   Next follows a single space character (x20) and the required version
   number which is "1.0" for this specification (x31 x2e x30).
