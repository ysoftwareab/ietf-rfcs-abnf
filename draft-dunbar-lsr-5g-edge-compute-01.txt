               draft-dunbar-lsr-5g-edge-compute-01

Abstract
   Routers in 5G Local Data Network (LDN) can use additional
   site-costs, preference, and other application related
   metrics on top of the network condition to compute
   constraint-based SPF within the 5G LDN to enhance
   performance for selected services. This draft describes
   those application server related metrics to be used in
   Flexible Algorithms.

1. Introduction

   In 5G Edge Computing (EC) environment, it is common for one
   application to be instantiated on multiple servers close in
   proximity. Those multiple server instances can share one IP
   address (ANYCAST) so that the transient network and load
   conditions can be considered when computing the IGP path.

   Flexible algorithms provide mechanisms to create
   constraint-based paths in IGP. This draft describes some
   specific metrics, that can impact application servers'
   performance, to be used in the Flexible Algorithms.


 1.1. 5G Edge Computing Background

   The network connecting the 5G EC servers with the 5G Base
   stations consists of a small number of dedicated routers
   that form the 5G Local Data Network (LDN) to enhance the
   performance of the EC services.

   When a User Equipment (UE) initiates application packets
   using the destination address from a DNS reply or its
   cache, the packets from the UE are carried in a PDU session
   through 5G Core [5GC] to the 5G UPF-PSA (User Plan Function
   - PDU Session Anchor). The UPF-PSA decapsulates the 5G GTP
   outer header, performs NAT sometimes, before handing the
   packets from the UEs to the adjacent router, also known as
   the ingress router to the EC LDN, which is responsible for
   forwarding the packets to the intended destinations.

Internet-Draft     LSR Extension for 5G EC Service

   When the UE moves out of coverage of its current gNB (next-
   generation Node B) (gNB1), the handover procedure is
   initiated, which includes the 5G SMF (Session Management
   Function) selecting a new UPF-PSA [3GPP TS 23.501 and TS
   23.502]. When the handover process is complete, the IP
   point of attachment is to the new UPF-PSA. The UE's IP
   address stays the same unless moving to different operator
   domain. 5GC may maintain a path from the old UPF to the new
   UPF for a short time for SSC [Session and Service
   Continuity] mode 3 to make the handover process more
   seamless.

 1.2. Problem#1: ANYCAST in 5G EC Environment

   ANYCAST makes it possible to load balance across server
   locations based on network conditions dynamically. With
   multiple servers having the same IP address, it eliminates
   the single point of failure and bottleneck at the
   application layer load balancers. Another benefit of using
   ANYCAST address is removing the dependency on how UEs get
   the IP addresses for their applications. Some UEs (or
   clients) might use stale cached IP addresses for an
   extended period.

   But, having multiple locations of the same IP address in
   the 5G Edge Computing environment can be problematic
   because all those edge computing Data Centers can be close
   in proximity. There might be very little difference in the
   routing distance to reach the Application Servers attached
   to a different edge router, which can cause packets from
   one flow to be forwarded to different locations, resulting
   in service glitches.

 1.3. Problem #2: Unbalanced Anycast Distribution due to UE
   Mobility

   UEs' frequent moving from one 5G site to another can make
   it difficult to plan where the App Servers should be
   hosted. When one App server is heavily utilized, other App
   servers of the same address close by can be under-utilized.
   The difference in the routing distance to reach multiple
   Application Servers might be relatively small. The traffic
   load at the router where the App Server is attached and the
   site capacity, when combined, can be more significant from
   the latency and performance perspective.

   Since the condition can be short-lived, it is difficult for
   the application controller to anticipate the moving and
   adjusting.

   Note: for the ease of description, the EC (Edge Computing)
   server, Application server, App server are used
   interchangeably throughout this document.

   A-ER:       Egress Edge Router to an Application Server,
               [A-ER] is used to describe the last router that
               the Application Server is attached. For 5G EC
               environment, the A-ER can be the gateway router
               to a (mini) Edge Computing Data Center.

   Application Server: An application server is a physical or
               virtual server that hosts the software system
               for the application.

   Application Server Location: Represent a cluster of servers
               at one location serving the same Application.
               One application may have a Layer 7 Load
               balancer, whose address(es) are reachable from
               an external IP network, in front of a set of
               application servers. From IP network
               perspective, this whole group of servers is
               considered as the Application server at the
               location.

   here.


3. Solution Overview

   The proposed solution is for the egress edge router (A-ER)
   with the EC Servers directly attached to advertise the
   "Site-Cost" [Section 3.2] within the 5G EC LDN via Flexible
   algorithms [LSR-FlexAlgo], so that constrained IGP path can
   be computed.

   The solution assumes that the 5G EC controller or
   management system is aware of the EC ANYCAST addresses that
   need optimized forwarding. To minimize the processing, only
   the addresses that match with the ACLs configured by the 5G
   EC controller will have their Site-Cost collected and
   advertised.

 3.1. Flow Affinity to an ANYCAST server

   When multiple servers with the same IP address (ANYCAST)
   are attached to different A-ERs, Flow Affinity means
   routers sending the packets of the same flow to the same A-
   ER even if the cost towards the A-ER is no longer optimal.

   Many commercial routers support some forms of flow affinity
   to ensure packets belonging to one flow be forwarded along
   the same path.

   Editor's note: for IPv6 traffic, Flow Affinity can be
   achieved by routers forwarding the packets with the same



Dunbar, et al.          Expires April 11, 2022        [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     LSR Extension for 5G EC Service

   Flow Label extracted from the IPv6 Header along the same
   path.

 3.2. IP Layer Metrics to Gauge EC Server Running Status

   Most applications do not expose their internal logic to the
   network. Their communications are generally encrypted. Most
   of them do not even respond to PING or ICMP messages
   initiated by routers.

   Here are some IP Layer Metrics that can gauge the servers
   running status and environment:

     - Capacity Index:
       a numeric number, configured on all A-ERs in the
       domain consistently, is used to represent the capacity
       of an EC server attached to an A-ER. The IP addresses
       exposed to the A-ER can be the App Layer Load
       balancers that have many instances attached.  At other
       sites, the IP address exposed is the server itself.
     - Site preference index:
       Is used to describe some sites are more preferred than
       others. For example, a site with less leasing cost has
       a higher preference value. Note: the preference value
       is configured on all A-ERs in the domain consistently
       by the Domain Controller.

     - Load Measurement for gauging the load of the attached
       prefix (i.e., EC Server):
       The Load Measurement for an EC Server is a weighted
       combination of the number of packets/bytes to the EC
       server (i.e., its IP address) and the number of
       packets/bytes from the EC server. The Load Measurement
       are collected by the A-ER that has the EC Server
       directly attached.

       An A-ER only collects those measurement for the
       prefixes instructed by the Domain Controller.

   For ease of description, those metrics with more to be
   added later are called IP Layer Site-Cost throughout the
   document.

 3.3. App Metrics Constrained Shortest Path First

   The main benefit of using ANYCAST is to leverage the
   network layer information to balance the traffic among
   multiple locations of one application server.

   For the 5G EC environment, the routers in the LDN need to
   take consideration of various measurements of the App
   Servers attached to each A-ER in addition to TE metrics to
   compute the shortest path to the A-ER.

   Here is one algorithm that computes the cost to reach the
   App Servers attached to Site-i relative to another site,
   say Site-b. When the reference site, Site-b, is plugged in
   the formula, the cost is 1. So, if the formula returns a
   value less than 1, the cost to reach Site-i is less than
   reaching the reference site (Site-b).

               CP-b * Load-i                Pref-b * Network-Delay-i
  Cost-i= (w *(----------------) + (1-w) *(-------------------------))
              CP-i * Load-b                Pref-i * Network-Delay-b


      Load-i: Load Index at Site-i, it is the weighted
      combination of the total packets or/and bytes sent to
      and received from the Application Server at Site-i
      during a fixed time period.

      CP-i: capacity index at site i, a higher value means
      higher capacity.

      Network Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to
      the A-ER that has the Application Server attached at the
      site-i.
      Noted: Ingress nodes can easily measure RTT to all the
      egress edge nodes by existing IPPM metrics. But it is
      not so easy for ingress nodes to measure RTT to all the
      App Servers. Therefore, "Network-Delay-i", a.k.a.
      Network latency measurement (RTT), is between the
      Ingress and egress edge nodes. The link cost between the
      egress edge nodes to their attached servers is embedded
      in the "capacity index".

      Pref-i: Preference index for site-i, a higher value
      means higher preference. Preference can be derived from
      the total path cost to reach the A-ER [RFC5305], as
      calculated below: 1/(total-path-cost).


Dunbar, et al.          Expires April 11, 2022        [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     LSR Extension for 5G EC Service

      w: Weight for load and site information, which is a
      value between 0 and 1. If smaller than 0.5, Network
      latency and the site Preference have more influence;
      otherwise, Server load and its capacity have more
      influence.

 3.4. Reason for using IGP Based Solution

    Here are some benefits of using IGP to propagate the IP
    Layer App-Metrics:
    - Intermediate routers can derive the aggregated cost to
      reach the EC Servers attached to different egress edge
      nodes, especially:
        - The path to the optimal egress edge node can be
           more accurate or shorter.
        - Convergence is shorter when there is any failure
           along the way towards the optimal ANYCAST server.
        - When there is any failure at the intended ANYCAST
           server, all the packets in transit can be optimally
           forwarded to another App Server attached to a
           different egress edge router.
    - Doesn't need the ingress nodes to establish tunnels with
      egress edge nodes.

    There are limitations of using IGP too, such as:

    - The IGP approach might not suit well to 5G EC LDN
      operated by multiple ISPs.
      For LDN operated by multiple IPSs, BGP should be used.
      [BGP-5G-AppMetaData] describes the BGP UPDATE message to
      propagate IP Layer App-Metrics crossing multiple ISPs.

4. IS-IS FAD with AppMetaData Constraint sub-TLVs

 4.1. ISIS FAD sub-TLV for the Aggregated cost

   If egress edge routers with EC servers directly attached
   can compute the aggregated cost, they can append the
   Aggregated Cost sub-sub-TLV directly to the IS-IS FAD Sub-
   TLV:

    0                   1                   2                   3

     A new value to be assigned by IANA to indicate the
     additional AppMetaData Metrics included in computing the
     constrained SPF.

   Calc-Type:
     A value chosen by the IGP operator to indicate a specific
     constrained SPF algorithm that takes the AppMetaData
     attributes into the path computation across the routers
     in the IGP domain.


   It worth noting that not all hosts (prefix) attached to an
   A-ER are EC servers that need network optimization. An A-
   ER only needs to advertise the site-Cost Metrics for the
   EC server addresses requested by the Controller.

   Draft [draft-wang-lsr-passive-interface-attribute]
   introduces the Stub-Link TLV for OSPFv2/v3 and ISIS
   protocol respectively. Considering the interfaces on an
   edge router that connects to the EC servers are normally
   configured as passive interfaces, these IP-layer App-
   metrics can also be advertised as the attributes of the
   passive/stub link. The associated prefixes can then be
   advertised in the "Stub-Link Prefix Sub-TLV" that is
   defined in [draft-wang-lsr-passive-interface-attribute].
   All the associated prefixes share the same characteristic
   of the link. Other link related sub-TLVs defined in
   [RFC8920] can also be attached and applied to the
   calculation of path to the associated prefixes.

5. AppMetaData SubSub-TLVs

   Two types of Load Measurement SubSub-TLVs are specified:

   a) The Aggregated Load Index based on a weighted
     combination of the collected measurements.
   b) The raw measurements of packets/bytes to/from the App
     Server address. The raw measurement is useful when the
     egress edge routers cannot be configured with a
     consistent algorithm to compute the aggregated load
     index or the raw measurements are needed by a central
     analytic system.


   The Aggregated Load Index Sub-TLV has the following format:

   Note: "Capacity Index" and "Site preference" can be

   Figure 1, the address S1 can have higher Site Preference
   when attached to R1 than R2.

6. AppMetaData Metric Advertisement

   With Flex-Algorithm, the network administrator can define a
   function that compute the SPF with consideration of the
   AppMetaData metrics advertised by the routers to which the
   EC servers are directly attached.

   This document defines a new standard metric type,
   AppMetaData, for this purpose. The AppMetaData Metric MAY
   be advertised in the Generic Metric sub-TLV with the metric
   type set to "AppMetaData Metric". ISIS and OSPF will
   advertise this new type of metric in their link
   advertisements. AppMetaData metric is a link attribute and
   for advertisement and processing of this attribute for
   Flex-algorithm purposes, MUST follow the section 12 of [I-
   D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]

   Flex-Algorithm uses this metric type by specifying the
   AppMetaData as the metric type in a FAD TLV. A FAD TLV may
   also specify an automatic computation of the AppMetaData
   metric based on a links advertised bandwidth. An explicit
   advertisement of a link's AppMetaData metric using the
   Generic Metric sub-TLV overrides this automatic
   computation. The automatic AppMetaData metric calculation
   sub-TLVs are advertised in FAD TLV and these parameters are
   applicable to applications such as Flex-algorithm that make
   use of the FAD TLV.

7. Aggregated Cost Advertisement in ISIS

   When A-ER can compute the aggregated cost to an attached EC
   server, the Aggregated Cost sub-sub-TLV can be directly
   appended to the App Specific Bit Mask. The aggregated cost
   computing algorithm can be from EC controller that take the
   Load Measurement, Capacity value, and Preference value into
   consideration across all A-ERs.

   The Application-Specific Link Attribute sub-TLV described
   in [RFC8919] can be used to carry the "Aggregated-Cost" for
   the EC server directly attached.

   When carrying the "Aggregate-Cost" sub-sub TLVs, the App
   specific Link Attribute sub-TLV can be included in TLV 22
   (extended IS reachability), 23 (IS Neighbor Attribute), or
   25(L2 bundle Member Attribute).

   The Aggregate-Cost bit is added to the Standard
   Applications Bit Mask (SABM).

8. Aggregated Cost Advertisement in OSPF

   When all egress edge routers with directly attached EC
   servers can compute the aggregated cost that takes into
   consideration the Load Measurement, Capacity value, and
   Preference value, this aggregated cost can be considered as
   the Metric of the link to the EC Server.

 8.1. OSPFv3 LSA to carry the Aggregated Cost

   For EC servers using IPv6 address, the aggregated cost
   computed by the A-ERs can be encoded in the Metric field
   [the interface cost] of Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA specified by
   Section 3.7 of the [ RFC5340].

                Figure 11: Aggregated Cost to App Server



 8.2. OSPFv2 LSA to carry the Aggregated Cost

   For EC servers in IPv4 address, the aggregated cost can be
   encoded in the "Metric" field of the Stub Link LSA [Link
   type =3] specified by Section 12.4 of the [RFC2328].

Internet-Draft     LSR Extension for 5G EC Service



9. Alternative method for Distributing Aggregated Cost

   Section 7 and Section 8 demonstrate different ways for
   OSPFv2, OSPFv3, and ISIS to propagate the aggregated cost.
   It would be better if the aggregated cost could be
   advertised the same way, regardless of OSPFv2, OSPFv3, or
   ISIS.

   Draft [draft-wang-lsr-stub-link-attributes] introduces the
   Stub-Link TLV for OSPFv2/v3 and ISIS protocol respectively.
   Considering the interfaces on an edge router that connects
   to the EC servers are normally configured as passive
   interfaces, these IP-layer App-metrics can also be
   advertised as the attributes of the passive/stub link. The
   associated prefixes can then be advertised in the "Stub-
   Link TLV" that is defined in [draft-wang-lsr-stub-link-
   attributes]. All the associated prefixes share the same
   characteristic of the link. Other link related sub-TLVs
   defined in [RFC8920] can also be attached and applied to
   the calculation of path to the associated prefixes."

   Section 6 for the advertisement of AppMetaData Metric can
   also utilize the Stub-Link TLV that defined in [draft-wang-
   lsr-stub-link-attributes]
