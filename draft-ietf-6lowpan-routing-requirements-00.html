Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
				In the context of this document, low-power wireless personal area networks 
				(LoWPANs) are formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 
				standard  <a class='info' href='#refs.IEEE802.15.4'>[6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE Computer Society, &ldquo;IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2006 (as amended),&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Most of the LoWPAN devices
				are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory
				capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
				inexpensive hardware.  In this document, the characteristics of nodes
				participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in RFC 4919 <a class='info' href='#RFC4919'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kushalnagar, N., Montenegro, G., and C. Schumacher, &ldquo;IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
			
</p>
<p>
				IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies and consist
				of two different device types: reduced-function devices (RFDs) and
				full-function devices (FFDs).  RFDs have the most limited
				capabilities and are intended to perform only simple and basic tasks,
				such as reporting sensed data. RFDs may only associate with a single FFD 
				at a time, but FFDs may form arbitrary topologies and implement more advanced
				functions, such as multi-hop routing.
			
</p>
<p>
				However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
				specification ("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) define 
				how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained.  Thus, the 6LoWPAN
				formation and multi-hop routing should be supported by higher layers,
				either the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer or the IP layer.  A number
				of IP layer routing protocols have been developed in various
				IETF working groups.  However, these existing routing protocols may not 
				satisfy the requirements of mesh routing in LoWPANs, for the following 
				reasons:
				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as primary battery-operated RFDs, battery-operated and mains-powered FFDs,
						possibly various levels of RFDs and FFDs, mains-powered and high-performance gateways, data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN
						routing protocols should support multiple device types and roles.
					
</li>
<li>
						The more stringent requirements that apply to 6LoWPANs, as opposed
						to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks, may not 
						suffice. 6LoWPAN nodes are characterized by small memory sizes, 
						low processing power, and are running on very limited power supplied
						by primary non-rechargeable batteries (a few KBytes of RAM, 
						a few dozens of KBytes of ROM/flash memory, and a few MHz of CPU is 
						typical).  A node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of 
						its battery.
					
</li>
<li>
						Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in 6LoWPANs, more than in 
						traditional ad-hoc networks. 6LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep-mode 
						for most of the time. Time synchronization is important for efficient
						forwarding of packets.
					
</li>
<li>
						Routing in LoWPANs might possibly translate to a simpler problem 
						than routing in higher-performance networks. 6LoWPANs might be either
						transit networks or stub networks.  Under the assumption that 6LoWPANs
						are never transit networks (as implied by <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> 
						and <a class='info' href='#refs.6lowpan.nd'>[8]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shelby, Z., Thubert, P., Hui, J., Chakrabarti, S., and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery Extensions, draft-shelby-6lowpan-nd-00 (work in progress),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>), routing protocols may be 
						drastically simplified. This document will primarily focus on stub 
						networks. Based on the necessity, this document may be extended 
						with 6LoWPAN network configurations that include transit networks.

					
</li>
<li>
						Routing in 6LoWPANs might possibly translate to a harder problem 
						than routing in higher-performance networks. Routing in 6LoWPANs 
						requires  power-optimization, stable operation in harsh environments,
						data-aware routing, etc.  These requirements are not easily 
						satisfiable all at once.
					
</li>
</ul><p>

				 This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable routing within LoWPANs.
			
</p>
<p>
				The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals" <a class='info' href='#RFC4919'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kushalnagar, N., Montenegro, G., and C. Schumacher, &ldquo;IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>)
				briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(a) low overhead on data packets
</p>
<p>(b) low routing overhead
</p>
<p>(c) minimal memory and computation requirements
</p>
<p>(d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving
</p>
</blockquote><p>
				These four high-level requirements only describe the need for low overhead and power saving.
				But, based on the fundamental features of LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements are presented in this document,
				which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.
			
</p>
<p>
				Using the 6LoWPAN header format <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, there are two layers routing protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to
				as "mesh-under" and "route-over". The mesh-under approach supports routing under the IP link and is directly based
				on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses. On the other hand,
				the route-over approach relies on IP routing and therefore supports routing over possibly various types of
				interconnected links (see also <a class='info' href='#NetworkStack'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mesh-under (left) and route-over routing (right)</span><span>)</span></a>). Most statements in this document consider 
				both the mesh-under and route-over cases.
				<br />

				[Note] The ROLL WG is now working on the protocol survey for Low power
				and Lossy Networks (LLNs), not specifically for 6LoWPAN. 
				After that survey, it will be decided whether new solutions will be 
				developed or not.  This document is focused on 6LoWPAN specific requirements,
				in alignment with the ROLL WG.
			
</p>
<p>
				Considering the problems above, detailed 6LoWPAN routing requirements 
				must be defined.  Application-specific features affect the design of 
				6LoWPAN routing requirements and the corresponding solutions. 
				However, various applications can be profiled by similar technical 
				characteristics, although the related detailed requirements might differ 
				(e.g., a few dozens of nodes for home lighting system need appropriate
				scalability for the applications, while billions of nodes for a
				highway infrastructure system also needs appropriate scalability). 
				This document states the routing requirements of 6LoWPAN applications 
				in general, while trying to give examples for different cases of routing.  
				This routing requirement document does not imply that a single 
				routing solution may be the best one for all 6LoWPAN applications.

Design Space</h3>

<p>
				Apart from a wide variety of routing algorithms possible for 6LoWPAN, the question remains as to whether routing should
				be performed mesh-under (in the adaptation layer defined by the 6lowpan format document <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>), or
				by the IP-layer using a route-over approach. The most significant consequence of mesh-under routing is that routing would
				be directly based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses instead of IP
				addresses, and a LoWPAN would be seen as a single IP link. In case a route-over mechanism is to be applied to a LoWPAN it
				must also support 6LoWPAN's unique properties using global IPv6 addressing. 
				One radio hop would be seen as a single IP link 
				<a class='info' href='#refs.6lowpan.nd'>[8]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shelby, Z., Thubert, P., Hui, J., Chakrabarti, S., and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery Extensions, draft-shelby-6lowpan-nd-00 (work in progress),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. In case a route-over mechanism is to be 
				applied to a LoWPAN it must also support 6LoWPAN's unique properties 
				of global IPv6 addressing.

				In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for reassembly,

</p>
				If a mesh-under routing protocol is built for operation in 6LoWPAN's
				adaptation layer, routing control packets are placed after the
				6LoWPAN Dispatch, unless a new code type is assigned for mesh-under
				routing.  Multiple routing protocols can be supported by the usage of
				different Dispatch bit sequences.  In use cases where predefined layer 
				two forwarding is appropriate, the mesh-header defined in RFC 4944

Scenario Considerations and Parameters for 6LoWPAN Routing</h3>

<p>
				IP-based low-power WPAN technology is still in its early stage of 
				development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
				tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
				make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
				environments and robust routing will be a necessity for expedient
				communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
				have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms
				<a class='info' href='#refs.bulusu'>[7]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bulusu, N. and S. Jha, &ldquo;Wireless Sensor Networks,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. Most related work focuses on optimizing 
				routing for specific application scenarios, which can largely be categorized
				into several models of communication, including the following ones:
				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Flooding (in very small networks)
</li>
<li>Data-aware routing (dissemination vs. gathering)
</li>
<li>Event-driven vs. query-based routing
</li>
<li>Geographic routing
</li>
<li>Probabilistic routing
</li>
<li>Hierarchical routing
</li>
</ul><p>
				Depending on the topology of a 6LoWPAN and the application(s) running over it, 
				different types of routing may be used. However, this document abstracts from 
				application-specific communication and describes general routing requirements 
				valid for overall routing in 6LoWPANs.
			
</p>
<p>
				The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios 
				in which the candidate routing protocols could be evaluated.

<dd>Network Properties:
</dd>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Number of Devices, Density and Network Diameter: <br />

						These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
						(e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
						list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
						be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
						entries in order to prevent memory overflow.
					
</li>
<li>
						Connectivity: <br />

						Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a 6LoWPAN
						can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
						range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
						poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
						across a LoWPAN.
					
</li>
<li>
						Dynamicity (including mobility): <br />

						Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
						factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
						changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
						LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
						volume of control messages may heavily dependent on the number
						of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed.
					
</li>
<li>
						Deployment: <br />

						In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
						or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
						occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
						affect the routing state.
					
</li>
<li>
						Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways: <br />

						Network connectivity depends on the spatial distribution of the nodes,
						and on other factors like device number, density and transmission 
						range. For instance, nodes can be placed on a grid, or can be randomly placed in
						an area (bidimensional Poisson distribution), etc.
						In addition, if the LoWPAN is connected to other networks through
						infrastructure nodes called gateways, the number and spatial
						distribution of gateways affects network congestion and available
						bandwidth, among others.
					
</li>
<li>
						Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications: <br />

						The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
						have a big impact on the network topology and the most efficient routing type to be
						used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
						multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
						architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
						introduced, such as data-aware, event-driven, address-centric,
						and geographic routing.
					
</li>
<li>
						Classes of Service: <br />

						For mission-critical applications, support of multiple classes of 
						service may be required in resource-constrained LoWPANs and may 
						require a certain degree of routing protocol overhead.
					
</li>
<li>
						Security: <br />

						LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
						level of security support where the availability, integrity,
						and confidentiality of data are primordial.  Secured messages
						cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
						routing protocols.
					
</li>
</ul>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>Node Parameters:
</dd>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Processing Speed and Memory Size: <br />

						These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing
						state. LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
						characteristics beyond the common RFD/FFD distinction.
					
</li>
<li>
						Power Consumption and Power Source: <br />

						The number and topology of battery- and mains-powered nodes in
						a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
						optimal paths for network lifetime maximization.
					
</li>
<li>
						Transmission Range: <br />

						This parameter affects routing.  For example, a
						high transmission range may cause a dense network, which in
						turn results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
						connectivity  and a larger routing state.
					
</li>
<li>
						Traffic Pattern:
						This parameter affects routing since high-loaded nodes (either
						because they are the source of packets to be transmitted or due
						to forwarding) may incur a greater contribution to delivery
						delays and may consume more energy than lightly loaded nodes.  
						This applies to both data packets and routing control messages.

6LoWPAN Routing Requirements</h3>

<p>
				This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.  The
				most important design property unique to low-power networks is that 6LoWPANs
				have to support multiple device types and roles, for example:
				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>primarily battery-operated host nodes (called "power-constrained nodes" in the following)
</li>
<li>mains-powered host nodes (an example for what we call "power-affluent nodes")
</li>
<li>power-affluent (but not necessarily mains-powered) high-performance gateway(s)
</li>
<li>possibly various levels of nodes (data aggregators, relayers, 
      etc.)

</li>
</ul><p>
				
<p>
					Due to these unique device types and roles 6LoWPANs need to consider
					the following two primary attributes:
				
</p>
				
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but most are
						battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
						with a single AA battery. Many devices are mains-powered most of
						the time, but still need to function for possibly extended periods
						from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
						is switched on for the first time).
					
</li>
<li>
						Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance 
						processors, low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.
					
</li>
</ul><p>
				These fundamental attributes of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
				solutions, so that existing routing specifications should be
				simplified and modified to the smallest extent possible when there are appropriate solutions to adapt, 
				otherwise, new solutions should be introduced in order to
				fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs, meeting the requirements 
				described in the following.

Support of 6LoWPAN Device Properties</h3>

<p>
					The general objectives listed in this section should be followed
					by 6LoWPAN routing protocols. The importance of each requirement is
					dependent on what device type the protocol is running on and what
					the role of the device is. The following requirements are based on battery-powered LoWPAN devices.
				
</p>
<p>
				    [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow to be implemented with small code size  
					and require low routing state to fit the typical 6LoWPAN node capacity 
					(e.g., code size considering its typical flash memory size, and routing table less than 32 entries).
				
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> 
						A LoWPAN routing protocol solution should consider the limited memory size 
						typically starting at 4KB.
					    RAM size of 6LoWPAN nodes often ranges between 2KB and 10KB,
						and program flash memory normally consists of 48KB to 128KB.
						(e.g., in the current market, MICAz has 128KB program flash,
						4KB EEPROM, 512KB external flash ROM; TIP700CM has 48KB program
						flash, 10KB RAM, 1MB external flash ROM).   
					
</p>
<p>	
						Due to these hardware restrictions, code length should be considered to
						fit within a small memory size; no more than 48KB to 128KB of flash memory including
						at least a few tens of KB of application code size. 
						A routing protocol of low complexity helps to achieve
						the goal of reducing power consumption, improves robustness,
						requires lower routing state, is easier to analyze, and may be
						implicitly less prone to security attacks. 
					
</p>
<p>
						In addition, operation with low	routing state (such as routing tables and neighbor lists)
						SHOULD be maintained since some typical memory sizes preclude to store 
						state of a large number of nodes. For instance, industrial monitoring applications  
						need to support at maximum 20 hops <a class='info' href='#refs.roll.industry'>[15]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pister, K., Thubert, P., Dwars, S., and T. Phinney, &ldquo;Industrial Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks, draft-ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs-01 (work in progress),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	
						Small networks can be designed to support a smaller number of hops. 
						It is highly dependent on the network architecture,
						but considering the 6LoWPAN device properties, there should be at least one mode of operation that can 
						function with 32 forwarding entries or less.
					
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> 
				    [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
					consumption by the efficient use of control packets 
					(e.g., minimize expensive multicast which cause broadcast to the entire 
					LoWPAN) and by the efficient routing of data packets. 
				
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
						One way of battery lifetime optimization is by achieving a minimal
						control message overhead. Compared to functions such as in many devices,
						computational operations or taking sensor samples, radio communications 
						is by far the dominant factor of power consumption <a class='info' href='#refs.SmartDust'>[9]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pister, K. and B. Boser, &ldquo;Smart Dust: Wireless Networks of Millimeter-Scale Sensor Nodes,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.

						and reception of the data units <a class='info' href='#refs.Shih'>[12]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shih, E., &ldquo;Physical Layer Driven Protocols and Algorithm Design for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
					
</p>
<p>
						The energy consumption of two
						example RF controllers for low-power nodes is shown in <a class='info' href='#refs.Hill'>[10]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hill, J., &ldquo;System Architecture for Wireless Sensor Networks,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
						The TR1000 radio consumes 21mW when transmitting at 0.75mW, 
						and 15mW on reception (with a receiver sensitivity of -85dBm). 
						The CC1000 consumes 31.6mW when transmitting 0.75mW, and 20mW for receiving (with a receiver sensitivity 
						of -105dBm). The power continuation under the concept of
						an idealized power source is explained in <a class='info' href='#refs.Hill'>[10]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hill, J., &ldquo;System Architecture for Wireless Sensor Networks,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>.
						Based on the energy of an idealized AA battery, 
						the CC1000 can transmit for approximately 4 days straight or receive
						for 9 consecutive days. Note that availability for reception consumes
						power as well.
					
</p>
<p>
						One multicast packet causes reception of the entire nodes in the LoWPAN, while 
						only the nodes in the path use the reception energy at unicast. Thus, 6LoWPAN routing 
						protocol SHOULD minimize the control cost by the routing packets. 
						Another document discusses control cost of routing protocols in low power and lossy networks <a class='info' href='#refs.roll.survey'>[18]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levis, P., Tavakoli, A., and S.

Support of 6LoWPAN Link Properties</h3>
