        Support for adjustable maximum router lifetimes per-link
                      draft-krishnan-6man-maxra-00

Abstract

   The neighbor discovery protocol specifies the maximum time allowed
   between sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements from a
   router interface as well as the maximum router lifetime.  It also
   allows the limits to be overridden by link-layer specific documents.
   This document specifies a mechanism for overriding these values on a
   per-link basis.

Internet-Draft         Adjustable Router Lifetimes             July 2014


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on IP multicast with the expectation
   to be efficient with respect to available bandwidth and to avoid
   generating interrupts in the network nodes.  On some datalink-layer
   network, for example IEEE 802.11 WiFi, this is not the case because
   of limitations in the services offered by the datalink-layer network
   [draft-vyncke-6man-mcast-not-efficient-01].  On such links any
   possible reduction of multicast traffic will be highly beneficial.
   Unfortunately, due to the fixed protocol constants specified in
   [RFC4861] it is difficult to relax the multicast timers for neighbor
   discovery.  There are already link technology specific clarifications
   how to tune protocol constants for certain system with the
   expectation to reduce excess Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
   traffic. 3GPP cellular links are one existing example
   [RFC6459][RFC7066].

   This document describes an IPv6 NDP [RFC4861] mechanism for
   specifying the the maximum time allowed between sending unsolicited
   multicast Router Advertisements (RA) from a router interface as well
   as the maximum router lifetime.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Maximum Advertisement Interval option

   This option is to be carried in RA messages sent out by a router on a
   given link.  It specifies the value that the router uses for the
   MaxRtrAdvInterval configuration variable as specified in section
   6.2.1 of [RFC4861] or an indication to the hosts on the links that
   there would be no periodic multicast RAs on the link.

     Type

        8-bit identifier of the type of option. The option identifier
        for the MAI option will be allocated by the IANA.

     Length

        8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including
        the type and length fields) in units of 8 octets.  It MUST be
        set to 1.

     MaxAdvInterval

        The value in seconds that the router is using for the
        MaxRtrAdvInterval configuration variable. If there are no
        periodic unsolicited RAs on the link this MUST be set to 0.

4.  Updates to RFC4861

   This document updates Section 6.2.1. of [RFC4861] to update the
   following router configuration variables.  MaxRtrAdvInterval MUST be
   no greater than 21845.  AdvDefaultLifetime MUST be between
   MaxRtrAdvInterval and 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval.

   This document also updates Sections 6.2.1., 6.2.2., 6.2.4. and 6.2.5.
   of [RFC4861] so that AdvSendAdvertisements can be set "FALSE" but the
   router would still continue be a router and respond to unsolicited
   RAs (this is indicated by advertising MaxRtrAdvInterval 0 in the
   Maximum Advertisement Interval Option).


5.  Host Behavior

   The value of Maximum Advertisement Interval provided in this option
   is purely informational.  It helps the hosts to determine how long
   they need to wait for an unsolicited RA before assuming that the
   router no longer exists.  Since there is no timestamp in the received

   RA, the moment the host receives the RA the router lifetime
   calculated based on the indicated interval is a rough estimate.


6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to modify the information provided inside
   this option to make hosts lose their default routers unintentionally.
   These attacks can easily be prevented by using SeND [RFC3971]


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 neighbor discovery option for
   carrying the maximum advertisement interval.  IANA is requested to
   assign the a new neighbor discovery option type in the registry
   maintained at
