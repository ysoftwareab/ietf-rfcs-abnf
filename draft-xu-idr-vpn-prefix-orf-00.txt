        VPN Address Prefix Based Outbound Route Filter for BGP-4
                     draft-xu-idr-vpn-prefix-orf-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for
   BGP, refered to as "VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that
   can be used to perform VPN address-prefix-based route filtering.
   This ORF-type supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild-
   card-based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address
   prefix matching for VPN address families.  The VPN Address Prefix ORF
   is applicable in the context of Virtual Subnet and may also be
   applicable in other BGP/MPLS IP VPN environments.

1.  Introduction

   The Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) Capability defined in [RFC5291]
   provides a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a set
   of ORFs that can be used by its peer to filter its outbound routing
   updates to the speaker.  The Address Prefix ORF defined in [RFC5292]
   is used to perform address-prefix-based route filtering.  However,
   the Address Prefix ORF is not much suitable for VPN route filting
   since there is no Route-Target (RT) field contained in the Address
   Prefix ORF entry.

   This document builds on [RFC5292] and defines a new ORF-type for BGP,
   refered to as "VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter (VPN Address
   Prefix ORF)", that can be used to perform VPN address-prefix-based
   route filtering.  The VPN Address Prefix ORF supports prefix-length-
   or range-based matching, wild-card-based address prefix matching, as
   well as the exact address prefix matching for VPN address families.
   The VPN Address Prefix ORF is applicable in the context of Virtual
   Subnet [I-D.xu-l3vpn-virtual-subnet] and may also be applicable in
   other BGP/MPLS IP VPN [RFC4364] environments.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5292] and [RFC4364].

3.  VPN Address Prefix ORF Encoding

   A VPN Address Prefix ORF entry includes a Route Target field in
   addition to those fields which have been contained in the Address
   Prefix ORF.  That's to say, the VPN Address Prefix ORF entry consists
   of the fields <Sequence, Match, Route-Target, Length, Prefix, Minlen,
   Maxlen>.  Note that the Prefix field here doesn't include the Route
   Distinguisher (RD) part of a VPN address prefix.  For example, in the
   case of VPNv4 address prefix, only the IPv4 address prefix part is
   contained in that Prefix field.

4.  VPN Address Prefix ORF Matching

   When performing route matching search on those VPN routes which are
   assocaited with the Route Target as specified in the received VPN
   Adress Prefix ORF, the Address-Prefix-ORF-specific matching rules
   defined in [RFC5292] are almost preserved except that the RD SHOULD
   be ingored.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Mach Chen and Shunwan Zhuang for
   their comments on this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The type code of the VPN Address Prefix ORF needs to be assigned by
   the IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
