 1. Abstract
 
 This document describes an architecture for unified multimedia 
 messaging -- capable of supporting clients of varying capabilities 
 but based on extending existing IETF Internet Mail standards and 
 infrastructure.

 this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.
 
 
 3. Introduction
 
 The architecture proposed in this document arises from two recent 
 trends in Internet messaging œ one may be referred to as evolution 
 towards "unified messaging" and the other is the increasing support 
 for terminals of varying capabilities.
 
 "Unified messaging" appears to have a number of different meanings. 
 The unified messaging in this discussion is the Internet unified 
 messaging from [UMREQ]. Internet unified messaging provides a single 
 infrastructure, mailbox and set of interfaces for a user to get, 
 respond to and manipulate all of their messages, no matter what the 
 media or source. [UMREQ] gives a set of requirements for Internet 
 unified messaging. A subset of these requirements germane to the 
 discussion here is the need to reuse existing email protocols, 
 maintain their existing semantics and the semantics of the current 
 email entities (e.g. MTAs, UAs, etc.)
 
 The Internet is evolving toward the support of new devices less 
 powerful than traditional computers as hosts for messaging clients 
 (e.g., PDAs, cellular phones, tablet computers, etc.) In particular, 
 [UMISS] gives the requirements for a telephone based client with a 
 telephone user interface (TUI). We will refer to a client based on a 
 cellular phone or wireless enabled PDA as having a wireless user 
 interface (WUI).
 
 The architecture presented in the rest of this document is an 
 infrastructure for unified messaging based on extending existing 
 messaging standards and infrastructure and capable of supporting 
 clients of varying capabilities such as TUIs and WUIs.

 4. Internet Mail and Messaging
 
 This section reviews very briefly protocols supporting the existing 
 architecture for Internet Mail and outlines an approach to extending 
 this architectureÿs capabilities without modifying its existing 
 semantics.
 
 4.1 Mail Server
 
 [RFC2821] specifies the most recent version (currently an IETF 
 proposed standard that resulted from the DRUMS WG) of SMTP which is 
 the transport protocol between messaging servers. This document 
 includes a description of the extension model for the SMTP protocol.
 
 
           |------|                     |------|
           |      |        SMTP         |      |
           |server|---------------------|server|
           |      |                     |      |
           |------|                     |------|
    
 4.2 Message Format
 
 [RFC2822] gives the current message and header format (also a 
 proposed standard). A series of five MIME RFCs [RFC2045 to 
 RFC2049](draft standards except RFC2048 BCP) extend the Internet 
 mail system to allow the transport of general media beyond just 
 restricted text including contents generated by other applications. 
 It also allows messages to have multi-part bodies consisting of 
 mixed media types.
 
 4.3 Client Access
 
 Messaging clients communicate with messaging servers using either 
 the POP3 [RFC1939] (standard) or the IMAP4 [RFC2060] (proposed 
 standard) protocols. The POP3 protocol assumes a simple message 
 delivery functionality on the part of the mail server. IMAP4 
 requires that the server can act as a remote store of messages for a 
 client this is an important feature for diverse client support.  The 
 message store is in the form of multiple mailboxes which the client 
 can manipulate. Neither protocol defines message posting which is 
 specified by SMTP. 
 
                             |------|
         |-------|   pop3    |      |
         |client1|-----------|      |
         |-------|           |      |
                             |server|
         |-------|   imap4   |      |
         |client2|-----------|      |
         |-------|           |      |
                             |------|

 5. Profiles
 
 A variety of client and server types other than traditional email 
 can be supported. The clients may be adapted for host restrictions 
 such as limited processing power, message store, display window 
 size, etc. Alternatively clients may be adapted for different 
 functionality (e.g. voice mail, fax, etc.).  Servers may support 
 optional mail features that would allow better handling of different 
 media ((e.g. voice mail, fax, video, etc.).  A useful way to 
 identify features that would be important to support for a 
 particular application is to define a profile of Internet Mail for 
 that application.
 
 5.1 Voice (VPIMv2)
 
 These profiles [RFC2421 to RFC2424] (proposed standards) enable the 
 transport of voice messages using the internet mail system. One of 
 the drivers for this work was support of IP transport for voice mail 
 systems. As voice mail clients are accustomed to a higher degree of 
 responsiveness and certainty as to message delivery, the 
 functionality added by VPIMv2 includes Message Disposition 
 Notification and Delivery Status Message as well as the addition of 
 voice media to multi-part message bodies.
 
 5.2 Fax
 
 This set of profiles [RFC2301 to RFC2306] (proposed standards) 
 enables the transport of fax using the internet mail system. This 
 work defined the image/tiff MIME type. Support for fax clients also 
 required extensions to Message Delivery Notification.
 
 5.3 TUI
 
 Traditional voice mail clients have telephone-based (TUI) clients. 
 To enable a TUI based client to support media types other than 
 voice, (i.e. become a unified messaging client) additional 
 functionality needs to be added [UMISS] to the client access 
 protocols. E.g. a command to forward an undownloaded message would 
 be useful in the handling of long text messages where text-to-speech 
 (TTS) may be awkward. In the diagram below, this might require IMAP 
 to be augmented to a form of IMAP+. The design of IMAP+ would 
 require careful consideration.
 
 
 |----------|       |------------------------------|
 |  client  |       |         UM server            |
 |          |       |                              |
 | |------| |  DTMF | |------|   IMAP+  |--------| |
 | | TUI  | |-------| |  UA  |----------| server | |
 | |------| | voice | |------|          |--------| |
 |----------|       |------------------------------|

 5.4 WUI
 
 Wireless-based (WUI) clients (e.g. wireless enabled PDAs, cell 
 phones, etc.) can be considered in an analogous manner to the TUI 
 above.  However, the WUI offers the potential of simultaneous voice 
 and data (with a limited screen size) interfaces that leads to a 
 more complex architecture.  The first step would be a compilation of 
 the requirements which a WUI would force on a client access protocol 
 to allow for a useful form of unified messaging. (E.g. in the 
 diagram below, what are the requirements on IMAP++ to allow for 
 useful unified messaging with a WUI.)
 
 
 |----------|                      |---------------------------|
 |  client  |                      |         UM server         |
 |          |      voice-band      |                           |
 | |------|~|----------------------|~|----|  IMAP++ |--------| |
 | |      | |                      | | UA |---------|        | |
 | | WUI  | |-----------|          | |----|         |        | |
 | |      |      |----| |  IMAP++  |                | server | |
 | |      |------| UA |~|----------|  ~     ~    ~  |        | |
 | |------|      |----| |          |                |--------| |
 |                      |          |                           |
 |----------------------|          |---------------------------|
 
 
 The extended mail client access protocol (IMAP++) is seen as the 
 application level protocol to be used over the air to the wireless 
 device. Other architectures have proposed the use of more wireless 
 specific message formats and/or application level protocols. See for 
 instance [MMS] (this presentation overviews the 3GPP approach to a 
 Multimedia Messaging Service(MMS)). To handle Internet Mail, this 
 service requires messages to be transformed from native formats into 
 specialized formats and protocols.
 
 As a result of the potentially complex interactions that can occur 
 given the splitting of the UA function between the client and the 
 server, the design of IMAP++ will require additional consideration. 
 
 The presentation of use-cases in a future revision of this draft 
 will explore some of the possible complexities.  This may result in 
 the identification that enhancements or profiles are needed to 
 additional Internet Mail protocols in order to support the WUI.
 
 
 6. Security Considerations
 
 Security considerations would be specific to the profiles supported.
