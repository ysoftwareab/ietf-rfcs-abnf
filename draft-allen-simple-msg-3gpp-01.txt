Abstract

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is using SIP RFC 3261
   [1] as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia
   Core Network Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem, IMS).  3GPP has recently
   started working on messaging over the IM CN Subsystem.  It is
   intended that this will utilize the IM CN Subsystem for delivery and
   may be based on IETF protocols including the work being performed in
   the SIMPLE working group.  In this document is provided an outline
   and areas of interest of the 3GPP work on IMS messaging for the
   information of the SIMPLE working group.

Internet-Draft    3GPP work related to SIP based messaging     June 2002


1. Introduction

   3GPP has selected SIP RFC 3261 [1].  as the protocol to establish and
   tear down multimedia sessions in the IP Multimedia Core Network
   Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem).  A description of the IM CN Subsystem
   can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2].

   An overview of, and requirements for the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem can be
   found in 3GPP Requirements draft [3].

   3GPP is currently working towards the definition of the system
   requirements for messaging utilizing the SIP based IM CN subsystem.
   The plan is for messaging for the SIP based IM CN subsystem to be
   part of the 3GPP release 6 which is currently scheduled to be fully
   completed by June 2003.

   The intention of the authors of this draft is to write a future
   detailed messaging requirements draft once the requirements
   definition phase within 3GPP has reached maturity.  It is expected
   that such a draft will be available prior to IETF 55.

2. Messaging in current GSM cellular networks

   The Global System for Mobiles (GSM) short message service (SMS) has
   been very successful with over 15 billion SMS text messages being
   sent worldwide every month.  SMS enables mobile users to exchange
   text messages with other mobile users and also with computers, and
   fax machines.  Recently SMS has been enhanced as the Enhanced
   Messaging Service (EMS) which enables graphical icons, animations and
   audio tunes to be sent along with text.  The most recent development
   is the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) which enables the mobile
   user to exchange digital images, graphics, voice, video and audio
   clips with other mobile users and also to send such content to email
   addresses.

   The SMS, EMS and MMS architectures all contain both agents in the
   user equipment (terminals) and servers in the network.  Messages may
   be initiated by terminals or by network servers.  Messages may be
   exchanged between a number of different types of external
   applications such as fax and email.Details of SMS and EMS can be
   found in 3GPP TS 23.040 [4] and details of the Multimedia Messaging
   Service can be found in 3GPP TS 22.140 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.140 [6].

3. Messaging in the internet

   Instant messaging (IM) has been higly successful in the fixed
   Internet.  Typical characteristics of the service are instant
   delivery of the messages and interaction with presence information.

   Users are able to see who is on-line as well as their status.

   Another popular Internet service is chat.  A Chat room is a "place"
   where multiple persons can join, follow and contribute to the ongoing
   discussion and leave the "room" at any time.  The chat rooms are more
   permanent in nature compared to IM exchange and they can be further
   divided to the private and public chat rooms.  The user in the chat
   will receive all messages that are sent by the other participants to
   the chat room.  Similarly, the user is able to send her messages to
   the chat room or even privately to some participant.

4. Scope of the messaging work in 3GPP

   The goal of 3GPP is to extend the SIP based IM CN Subsystem (IMS)
   with messaging services, while defining the interaction of these new
   messaging services with the existing SMS, EMS, and MMS messaging, as
   well as Internet based messaging (IM, chat) services.  Such
   interaction of services may introduce interworking requirements to
   the 3GPP Release 6 IMS, and will define the interaction of IMS
   messaging with other IMS service capabilities, e.g., the presence
   service, and the privacy, security, and charging aspects of IMS.
   Overall, the goal is to enable a rich set of messaging services for
   the end user.

   There is an expectation that the introduction of IMS messaging will
   require standardized mechanisms for the creation of messaging groups
   (chatrooms), as well as mechanisms to manage and authorize the
   members of such entities.  The main driver for these standardized
   mechanisms is the interoperability of IMS messaging across different
   terminals and networks.

   Messaging should also integrate well with the Presence service also
   being currently developed by 3GPP.  Requirements for 3GPP Presence
   services have been provided to IETF in 3GPP Presence Requirements
   [7].

6. Security Considerations

   This draft does not specify a protocol and so raises no security
   issues, however security and privacy issues with messaging will need
   to be addressed in later requirements.
