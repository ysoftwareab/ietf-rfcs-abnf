1.  Motivation

   The primary motivation for this draft is to enlist different issues
   with RPL operation and invoke a discussion within the working group.
   This draft by itself is not intended for RFC tracks but as a WG
   discussion track.  This draft may in turn result in other work items
   taken up by the WG which may improvise on the issues mentioned
   herewith.

2.  Introduction

   RPL [RFC6550] specifies a proactive distance-vector routing scheme
   designed for LLNs (Low Power and Lossy Networks).  RPL enables the
   network to be formed as a DODAG and supports storing mode and non-
   storing mode of operations.  Non-storing mode allows reduced memory
   resource usage on the nodes by allowing non-BR nodes to operate
   without managing a routing table and involves use of source routing
   by the Root to direct the traffic along a specific path.  In storing
   mode of operation the routing happens on hop-by-hop basis and
   intermediate routers need to maintain routing tables.

   DAO messaging helps to install downstream routing paths in the DODAG.
   DAOs are generated on hop-by-hop basis.  DAO may contain multiple RPL
   Control Options.  The Target Option identifies the address prefix for
   which the route has to be installed and the corresponding Transit
   Information Option identifies the parameters (such as lifetime,
   freshness-counter, etc) for the target.  The DAO base object contains

   the 'K' flag indicating that a DAO-ACK is sought by the sender.  The
   DAO, DAO-ACK progresses on hop-by-hop basis all the way till Root.

   This draft highlights various issues with RPL DAO-ACK handling in
   Storing MOP.  The draft provides requirements to solve the issues and
   provides an updates to RFC6550 based on these requirements.

2.1.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   MOP = Mode of Operation

   NS-MOP = RPL Non-Storing Mode of Operation

   S-MOP = RPL Storing Mode of Operation

   This document uses terminology described in [RFC6550].

3.  Problems with DAO-ACK in Storing MOP

   Consider the following topology for the subsequent description:

Internet-Draft              Storing Root Ack                  April 2020


3.1.  End to End Path Establishment Indication

   Nodes need to know whether the end to end path till the Root has been
   established before they can initiate application traffic.  In case of
   NS-MOP, the DAO is addressed to the Root from the Target node and the
   Root sends DAO-ACK directly addressed back to the target node.  Thus
   in case of NS-MOP, the node can make use of this DAO-ACK as an
   indication whether the necessary routes have been installed.
   However, in case of Storing MOP, the DAO/DAO-ACK signalling happens
   at every hop.

                 Non-Storing MOP

                 | D ======== B ======== A ======== (Root)
                 |  ---------------DAO------------>
                 |  <-----------DAO-ACK------------
                 |
                 V
                 time

                 Storing MOP

                 | D ======== B ======== A ======== (Root)
                 |  ---DAO--->
                 |  <-DAO-ACK-
                 |             ---DAO--->
                 |             <-DAO-ACK-
                 |                        ---DAO--->
                 |                        <-DAO-ACK-
                 V
                 time


                Figure 3: Storing MOP DAO/DAO-ACK handling

   Consider Figure 1, when node D sends a DAO, the node B receives the
   DAO and instantly sends back DAO-ACK.  Node B then subsequently
   generates the DAO with Target as Node D and sends it to node A.  The
   DAO with Target as Node D may take time (since the DAO is scheduled
   with DAO_DELAY timer by every node) to finally reach the Root at
   which point the end to end path is established.  There is no way for
   node D to know when the end to end path is established.  This
   information is needed for node D to initiate its application traffic.
   Initiating application traffic prior to this might almost certainly
   lead to application packet retries causing congestion in the network.

3.2.  Target node unaware if it needs to retry the DAO

   It is possible that the intermediate 6LR goes down while attempting
   to generate DAO on behalf of the target node.  In this case, the
   target node has no way of knowing to retry the DAO, in which case the
   route installation may not happen until the target node's DAO
   lifetime expires.

   Consider Figure 1, assume that node A was generating DAO with Target
   node D and sending it to Root.  Node A reboots before attempting to
   send DAO to Root.  Node A has already sent DAO-ACK downstream to node
   B.  In this case, the target node D is not aware that sending DAO has
   failed somewhere upstream.  Note that as per RFC6550 upstream DAO is
   scheduled based on DAO_DELAY but DAO_ACK is sent instantaneously on
   DAO reception from downstream node.

4.  Requirements for DAO-ACK handling in Storing MOP

   Following are the requirements:

   Indicate end to end path establishment  The Target node must know
      when to initiate the application traffic based on end to end path
      establishment.

   Handle multiple targets in DAOs  A DAO message may contain multiple
      Target Options.  The DAO-ACK mechanism must handle multiple
      targets in DAO.

   Handle DAOs with address prefix  RPL DAO Target Option may contain an
      address prefix i.e., not the full address.

   Provide suitable way for target node to retry  The Target node must
      have a way to know and retry the DAO in case the DAO transmission
      fails enroute.

   Backward compatible with current DAO-ACK  The current per hop DAO-ACK
      must function as it is.  Legacy nodes should be able to operate
      without any changes.

5.  DAO-ACK from Root

   The draft defines a way for the RPL Root to send the DAO-ACK back
   directly addressed to the Target node.  The Target node can receive
   the DAO-ACK directly thus getting an indication that the end to end
   path till the Root has been successfully established.

5.1.  Transit Information Option update in DAO message

   The Target node indicates that it wishes to receive DAO-ACK directly
   from Root by setting the newly defined 'K' flag in Transit
   Information Option.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Figure 4: Updated Transit Information Option (New K flag added)

5.2.  Root sends DAO-ACK addressed to Target

   On receiving a DAO with Transit Information Option with 'K' flag set,
   the Root MUST respond with a DAO-ACK immediately to the address
   extracted from the corresponding Target Option.

   The DAO-ACK MUST contain the Transit Information Option with
   parameters copied from the DAO's Transit Information Option based on
   which this DAO-ACK was generated.  The PathSequence in the Transit
   Information Option helps the Target node to identify for which DAO it
   generated it has received the DAO-ACK.  The DAOSequence in the base
   DAO object is ignored by the Target node.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate bit 2 from the Transit Information
   Option Flags registry for the 'K' flag (Section 5.1).
