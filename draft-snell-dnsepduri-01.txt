Abstract

   This memo introduces the "ws:" URI scheme for use in conjunction with
   DNS-Based Web Services Discovery.  The URI is used to identify Web
   services that have been advertised in DNS.

Internet-Draft                DNS-EPD URI                  November 2004


1.  Introduction

   The DNS Endpoint Discovery (DNS-EPD) specification [5] defines two
   new DNS resource records types that may be used to advertise
   references to Web service endpoints deployed within a given DNS
   domain.  The goal of the ws: URI scheme is to provide a means of
   identifying and referencing endpoint references advertised in DNS
   using the DNS-EPD mechanisms.

   URI's conforming to the ws: URI Scheme are hereafter referred to as
   DNS-EPD URIs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

2.  URI Syntax

   A DNS-EPD URI has the following syntax:

   dnsepdURI        ::= "ws:" serviceName "@" domain
   serviceName      ::= label | label "." label
   domain           ::= subdomain | " "
   subdomain        ::= label | subdomain "." label
   label            ::= letter [ [ ldh-str ] let-dig ]
   ldh-str          ::= let-dig-hyp | let-dig-hyp ldh-str
   let-dig-hyp      ::= let-dig | "-"
   let-dig          ::= letter | digit
   letter           ::= a-zA-Z
   digit            ::= 0-9

   eprName is subject the exact construction and encoding rules as DNS
   domain names as specified in RFC 1035 [4] and MUST reference EPR
   resource records as defined in [5].

   DNS-EPD URI's are case insensitive.  DNS-EPD URI's are lexically
   equivalent if the eprName for each are identical in a
   case-insensitive character-by-character comparison.  DNS-EPD URI's
   are semantically equivalent if they reference EPR resource records
   that contain the same information (e.g.  same flags, same priority
   and weight, same target, etc).

3.  URI Semantics

   Unlike URI schemes that reference specific network hosts, DNS-EPD
   URI's reference records contained in DNS.  The eprName portion of the
   URI is the DNS name of either an EPR resource record as defined by
   [5] or a CNAME record used to specify an alias for an EPR resource

   record.

   DNS-EPD URIs are dereferencable by submitting a DNS query for all EPR
   resource records associated with the name specified in the eprName
   portion of the URI.

4.  Examples

     ws:inquire.uddi@example.com

   This example references an EPR resource record advertising UDDI
   services within the example.com DNS domain.

   The eprName given above would be used to retrieve zero or more EPR
   records from DNS as in the following example query.

     >nslookup -q=EPR inquire.uddi._ws.example.com
     inquire.uddi._ws.example.com EPR 10 0 0 uddi.example.com
                                              /services/inquire
                                              urn:uddi-v2
                                              Inquire

   Following resolution of the EPR resource record, clients would use
   the information returned by DNS to connect to and invoke the
   advertised Web service endpoint.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for DNS-EPD are discussed in the Security
   Considerations section of [5].  Beyond those discussed in the DNS-EPD
   specification, the DNS-EPD URI introduces no new security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the URL registration template found in
   Appendix A in accordance with [3]
