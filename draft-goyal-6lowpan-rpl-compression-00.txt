1.  Introduction

   RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] is an IPv6 routing protocol for low power and
   lossy networks.  It defines a number of ICMPv6 control messages for
   its operation.  These messages are susceptible to fragmentation when
   RPL is deployed on a 6lowpan with a small MAC layer payload (e.g.
   IEEE 802.15.4, where the MAC payload can be as small as 81 bytes).
   This document specifies a compression format for ICMPv6 RPL control
   messages to minimize such fragmentation.  The specified format is in
   accordance with 6lowpan IPv6 header compression format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc].  This document currently defines the
   compression format for RPL's DODAG Information Object (DIO) and some
   of the options that are carried inside a DIO.  Later versions of this
   document may include the compression formats for other RPL messages
   as well as non-RPL ICMPv6 messages used in a 6lowpan.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc], [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] and
   [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl].

            Figure 1: LOWPAN_NHC Encoding for an ICMPv6 Message

   This document defines the single octet LOWPAN_NHC encoding for an
   ICMPv6 message as shown in Figure 1.  The ID field in the octet
   identifies the particular ICMPv6 message being compressed.  The ID
   field values are as follows:

   o  0: RPL DODAG Information Object (DIO)

   o  1-31: Unassigned

   Various fields of the ICMPv6 messages are treated in the following
   manner:

Internet-Draft   draft-goyal-6lowpan-rpl-compression-00         May 2011


   o  Type, Code: Always elided.  The Type and Code of the ICMPv6
      message being compressed are evident from the LOWPAN_NHC encoding
      of the message.

   o  Checksum: The 16-bit Checksum is carried inline immediately
      following the LOWPAN_NHC octet for the message.

   o  Base: The Base object carried in the message is compressed in the
      manner described in Section 3.

   o  Option(s): Any options carried in the ICMPv6 message are
      compressed as described in Section 4.  The LOWPAN_NHC encoding for
      the Base object identifies if any options are present in the
      message.


3.  Compressing the Base Object

   This section defines the LOWPAN_NHC compression format for various
   Base objects that can be carried inside an ICMPv6 message.

3.1.  Compressing the DODAG Information Object

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
        |I|L|V|R|G|T|F|O|  Ra   | Compr | Inline Fields
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

       Figure 2: The Compression Format for DODAG Information Object

   The format of a compressed DODAG Information Object (DIO) base object
   is shown in Figure 2 and consists of the following fields:

   o  I: This flag indicates whether the RPLInstanceID field is elided
      or not.  This flag is set to 1 if the RPLInstanceID field is
      present inline in the compressed DIO.  This flag is set to 0 if
      the RPLInstanceID field is elided.  In this case, the implicit
      value of the RPLInstanceID depends on the value of the L flag as
      discussed next.

   o  L: This flag indicates whether the elided RPLInstanceID field is
      global or local.  The flag is set to 1 if the RPLInstanceID field
      is local.  In this case, the implicit value of the RPLInstanceID
      field is 128.  The flag is set to 0 if the RPLInstanceID field is
      global.  In this case, the implicit value of the RPLInstanceID
      field is 0.  The L flag is meaningful only if the I flag is set to
      0.  If the I flag is set to 1, the L flag MUST be set to 0 on

      transmission and ignored on reception.

   o  V: This flag indicates whether the Version Number field of the DIO
      is elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if the Version Number is
      carried inline.  The flag is set to 0 if the Version Number is
      elided.  In this case, the implicit value of the Version Number is
      assumed to be zero.

   o  R: This flag indicates whether the Rank field in the DIO is
      shortened or not.  This flag is set to 1 if the full 16-bit Rank
      is present inline in the compressed DIO.  The flag is set to 0 if
      the 4-bit long Ra field contains the rank value.

   o  G: This flag indicates whether the byte containing the Grounded,
      Mode of Operation and DODAG Preference fields is elided or not.
      This flag is set to 1 if the above-mentioned byte is carried
      inline.  The flag is set to 0, if this byte is elided.  In this
      case, the implicit values of Grounded, Mode of Operation and
      DODAGPreference fields are as follows:

      *  The Grounded flag has implicit value 0, i.e., the DODAG is not
         grounded.

      *  The Mode of Operation field has implicit value 0, i.e., the
         DODAG does not maintain any downward routes.

      *  The DODAG Preference field has implicit value 0, i.e., least
         preferred.

   o  T: This flag indicates whether the DTSN field is elided or not.
      This flag is set to 1 if the DTSN field is carried inline.  The
      flag is set to 0, if the DTSN field is elided.  In this case, the
      implicit value of the DTSN field is assumed to be zero.

   o  F: This flag indicates whether the Flags and Reserved fields in
      the DIO are elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if these fields
      are carried inline.  The flag is set to 0, if these fields are
      elided.  In this case, both fields are assumed to be zero.

   o  O: The O flag is set if the first RPL option following the
      compressed DIO base object has been compressed in the manner
      described in this document.  If the O flag is set, the first
      (compressed) RPL option follows the inline fields of the DIO.  The
      O flag is set to 0 if the RPL control message does not contain any
      option or if the first RPL option is not compressed in the manner
      described in this document.

   o  Ra: This field contains the 4-bit rank value if the R flag is set
      to 0.

   o  Compr: This field contains the number of prefix octets that are
      elided from the DODAGID field.  For example, the Compr value will
      be zero if full 16-octet DODAGID field is carried inline in the
      compressed DIO.

   o  Inline Fields: Any inline fields in the compressed DIO appear in
      the same order as in the uncompressed format defined in
      [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].


4.  Compressing the RPL Options

   This section defines the compression format for some of the RPL
   options that may be carried inside an RPL control message.  These RPL
   options SHOULD be compressed when carried inside an RPL control
   message compressed in the manner described in this document.  The
   other RPL options, for which a compression format is not specified in
   this document, MUST follow the format in which they are defined when
   carried inside an RPL control message compressed as described in this
   document.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+----------------


                Figure 3: Format of a Compressed RPL Option

   The compression format of an RPL option is shown in Figure 3.  It
   consists of:

   o  Option Type: The Option Type value for a compressed RPL option is
      same as that of the uncompressed option with the most significant
      bit (MSB) set to 1.

   o  Option Length: The Option Length is 8 bits long as in case of an
      uncompressed RPL option.

        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+- - - - - - - -

        Figure 4: Format of a Compressed DODAG Configuration Option

   The format of the compressed DODAG Configuration Option is shown in
   Figure 4.  The compressed DODAG Configuration option begins with an
   octet consisting of flags that specify whether the individual fields
   in the option are elided or not:

   o  F: This flag indicates whether the byte in the uncompressed DODAG
      Configuration option, consisting of the Flags, A and PCS fields,
      is elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if this byte is carried
      inline.  The flag is set to 0, if this byte is elided.  In this
      case, the implicit values of the A and PCS fields are zero and
      DEFAULT_PATH_CONTROL_SIZE (as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl])
      respectively.

   o  T1: This flag indicates whether the DIOIntervalDoublings and
      DIOIntervalMin fields are elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if
      these fields are carried inline.  The flag is set to 0, if these
      fields are elided.  In this case, these fields assume their
      default values as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   o  T2: This flag indicates whether the DIORedundancyConstant field is
      elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if DIORedundancyConstant is
      carried inline.  The flag is set to 0, if this field is elided.
      In this case, the field assumes its default value as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   o  I1: This flag indicates whether the MaxRankIncrease field is
      elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if this field is carried
      inline.  The flag is set to 0 if this field is elided.  In this
      case, the MaxRankIncrease field assumes its default value (as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]).

   o  I2: This flag indicates whether the MinHopRankInc field is elided
      or not.  This flag is set to 1 if this field is carried inline.
      The flag is set to 0 if this field is elided.  In this case, the
      MinHopRankInc field assumes its default value (as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]).

   o  O: This flag indicates whether the OCP field is elided or not.
      This flag is set to 1 if this field is carried inline.  The flag

      is set to 0 if this field is elided.  In this case, RPL Objective
      Function 0 [I-D.ietf-roll-of0] is the OCP in effect.

   o  R: This flag indicates whether the byte marked as Reserved in the
      uncompressed format is elided or not.  This flag is set to 1 if
      this byte is carried inline.  The flag is set to 0 if this byte is
      elided.  In this case, the Reserved byte is assumed to have value
      0.

   o  L: This flag indicates whether the Default Lifetime and Lifetime
      Unit fields in the uncompressed format are elided or not.  This
      flag is set to 1 if these fields are carried inline.  The flag is
      set to 0 if these fields are elided.  In this case, the life time
      of the routes associates with this DODAG is infinity.

   o  Inline fields: Any inline fields in the compressed DODAG
      Configuration option appear in the same order as in the
      uncompressed format.
