1.  Introduction

   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of resource-consuming
   attack, which exploits a large number of attack resources and uses
   standard protocols to attack target objects.  With the cost of DDoS
   attack become more cheaper, DDoS attack become more and more
   frequently, a single mitigator unable to cope with all the DDoS
   attack, so DOTS come up to solve the problem.

   From the charter of DOTS working group, it writes that elements may
   be deployed as part of a wider strategy incorporating multiple points
   of DDoS detection, classification, traceback and mitigation, both on
   premise or service provider based.  As so far, DDoS classification
   have not written to DOTS.  This draft will from the perspective of
   the type of DDoS attack to do DDoS classification.

   Different understanding of DDoS attacks will result in different
   classification and that's why do we need uniform attack types.  At
   present, telecom operators, cloud service providers and third-party
   manufacturers have their own anti-ddos solutions.The construction of
   DDoS attack mitigation and disposal system involves two devices,
   namely detection equipment and cleaning equipment.  In the actual
   network deployment, the core nodes of the network will deploy
   detection equipment and cleaning equipment at the same time to detect
   and dispose attacks.  After an alarm is given, the cleaning equipment
   will be triggered to carry out traffic drainage and cleaning
   operations.  At present, the detection equipment adopts the coarse-
   grained attack type determination method, which greatly reduces the
   false alarm rate of attack.Different disposal of cleaning equipment
   is different for different attack types.  For example, TCP attack
   types can be discarded directly after matching, but HTTP CC Flood can
   be further determined only after interactive operation is required at
   the disposal.  Interactive operation may be redirection or
   verification code sending.  In the actual environment, there are many

   manufacturers of detection equipment and cleaning equipment, and each
   manufacturer has its own definition method of attack type, so it is
   easy to lead to the same attack, but the field of attack type
   detected by different equipment manufacturers is different, which may
   easily lead to disposal confusion.  The attack type is inconsistently
   defined, it is difficult or controversial to judge the ability of
   test selection of DDoS attack detection and clean equipment.

   Volume based distributed denial-of-service attack have many types
   based on different protocol layer, for the service providers to
   immediately protect their network services from DDoS attacks, DDoS
   mitigation needs to be automated.  DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS)
   is a protocol to standardize real-time signaling, threat-handling
   requests[I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel], when attack target is under
   attack, dots client send mitigation request to dots server for help,
   If the mitigation request contains enough messages of the attack,
   then the mitigator can respond very effectively.  This document
   recommand a method for attack type unification.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119]

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases]

   The terminology related to YANG data modules is defined in [RFC7950]

   In addition, this document uses the terms defined below:

   Attack Type:  used to distinguish between different methods of ddos
      attack.

   Attack type definition:  General definition method, Covers most
      current attack types.

3.  DDoS Attack Type Classification Framework

   The existing classification of DDoS attack type is divided into
   multiple dimensions: by the protocol used, such as SYN Flood, HTTP
   Flood, ICMP Flood; by attack effect, such as bandwidth occupancy
   attack, Connection attack, slow attack; by the attack method, such as
   abnormal message attack, reflection amplification attack;

Internet-Draft              dots-attack-type                October 2019


   In the above definition of multiple types of attacks, there is
   partial overlap.  Combined with the existing classification of DDoS
   attack, the consensus of classifying DDoS attack by protocol layer is
   the highest.

   This draft of protocol layer is based on the TCP/IP model, the basic
   classification framework of DDoS attack as follows: Firstly, protocol
   layer, such as Network layer, transport layer and application layer;
   Secondly, Protocol and Messaging, Divide by protocol exploited by the
   attack, Then define the message and port involved in the protocol,
   User-defined (Protocol+port) format identifies attack types that are
   not well defined or standardized.Finally, Attack method, defined
   according to the method used in DDoS attack.

4.  DDoS Attack Definition Description

   In view of the difference in attack definition, the method of this
   draft is based on the basic classification framework to standardize
   the format as follows.

   [attack methods feature description field 1] [attack methods feature

   description field 2] [attack methods describe the standard field].
   Note1: the field of [message name/operation name/port] and [attack
   methods feature description field 1] and [attack methods feature
   description field 2] are optional.  Note2: [protocol name] and
   [message name/operation name/port] must contain at least one in the
   abbreviation.  Note3: The fields should be distinguished by the space
   character.

   The field of [message name/operation name/port] can have many
   choices, such as "Get/Post/SYN/ACK/Query/Memcached"; The field of
   [attack methods feature description field 1 or 2] can represent by
   "Connection", "Fragment", "Amplification", "Reflection", "Misuse",
   "BandWidth", or "Slow"; The field of [attack methods describe the
   standard field] just have two choice, one is "Flood" and the other is
   "Attack".
