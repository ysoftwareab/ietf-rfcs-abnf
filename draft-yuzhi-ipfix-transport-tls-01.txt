1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to provide a secure
   communication for the transport of IPFIX protocol.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   o  An Exporter is a device which hosts one or more Exporting
      Processes.  An Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more
      Collecting Process.

   o  A Collector is a device which hosts one or more Collecting
      Processes.  A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or
      more Exporting Processes.

   o  A TLS client is an application that can initiate a TLS connection
      by sending a Client Hello to a peer.

   o  A TLS server is an application that can receive a Client Hello
      from a peer and reply with a Server Hello.

   o  A DTLS client is an application that can sent Client Hello to a
      peer.

   o  A DTLS server is an application that can receive a Client Hello
      from a peer and reply with a Hello Verify Request.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   This document uses terminology specific to SCTP as defined in section
   "Terminology" of RFC 2960 [2]..  This document uses terminology
   specific to IPFIX as defined in section "Terminology" of "IPFIX
   Protocol Specification" .

1.2.  Overview

   This document discusses how IPFIX can be secured using TLS or DTLS.
   IPFIX can be transported over SCTP, PR-SCTP, TCP and UDP, and can be
   secured using TLS or DTLS.  If IPFIX runs over SCTP or TCP, TLS is
   used to provide secure connection.  If IPFIX runs over UDP or PR-
   SCTP, DTLS is used.  An IPFIX Exporter acts as the TLS/DTLS client
   and an IPFIX Collector acts as the TLS/DTLS server.

2.  IPFIX over TLS or DTLS

2.1.  Port Assignment

   The IANA-assigned TCP port <TBD> is used as the default port for
   IPFIX over TLS.  The IANA-assigned SCTP port <TBD> is used as the
   default port for IPFIX over TLS.  The IANA-assigned PR-SCTP port
   <TBD> is used as the default port for IPFIX over DTLS.The IANA-
   assigned UDP port <TBD> is used as the default port for IPFIX over
   DTLS.

2.2.  Initiation

2.2.1.  SCTP

   When the transport protocol is SCTP, the Exporter should initiate an
   association with the Collector and then send the TLS Client Hello to
   begin the TLS handshake.  Because TLS requires bi-directional
   connection for handshake, and IPFIX protocol need at least two uni-
   directional streams from Exporting Process to carry its data and
   templates records separately, so there MUST have at least two bi-
   directional SCTP streams per association.

   The TLS handshake layer assumes that handshake messages are delivered
   reliably and breaks if those messages are lost.  An implementation
   MUST NOT use partial reliability extension for SCTP when a TLS
   handshake is pending.

2.2.2.  TCP

   When the transport protocol is TCP, the Exporter should initiate a
   connection to the Collector and then send the TLS Client Hello to
   begin the TLS handshake.

2.2.3.  PR-SCTP

   When the transport protocol is PR-SCTP, the Exporter should send the
   DTLS Client Hello to initiate the TLS handshake.  All DTLS control
   message MUST be transported on PR-SCTP stream 0 with unlimited
   reliability and with the ordered deliver feature.

2.2.4.  UDP

   When the transport protocol is UDP, the Exporter should send the DTLS
   Client Hello to initiate the TLS handshake.  Once the Exporter has
   sent Client Hello, it expects to receive a Hello Verify Request from
   the Collector.  If either the Client Hello or the Hello Verify
   Request is lost, the Exporter should retransmit Client Hello message.

2.3.  Sending data

   Once TLS or DTLS handshake has finished, an application data
   protocol, such as IPFIX, is layered on the TLS/DTLS record protocol.
   ALL IPFIX Flow Records MUST be sent as "application data" of TLS/
   DTLS.

   When the transport protocol is SCTP, there MUST be at least two bi-
   directional SCTP streams per association.  The first bi-directional
   stream (referred to as bi-directional stream 0 in the rest of this
   document), is used to send the IPFIX Template Set and Options
   Template Set. Bi-directional stream 0 MUST be fully reliable.  IPFIX
   Data Sets MUST NOT be sent on Bi-directional streams 0.

   When the transport protocol is PR-SCTP, there SHOULD be at least one
   bi-directional PR-SCTP stream per association.The first bi-
   directional stream (referred to as bi-directional stream 0 in the
   rest of this document), is used to send the IPFIX Template Set and
   Options Template Set. Bi-directional stream 0 MUST be fully reliable.
   IPFIX Data Sets MAY be sent on Bi-directional stream 0, but SHOULD be
   sent on other streams for better performance.

   When the transport protocol is UDP, IPFIX Templates sent from
   Exporter to Collector MUST be resent at regular intervals in case
   previous copies were lost.

2.4.  Closure

   A closure_notify alert MUST be sent over each TLS stream before
   closing the SCTP association.

   A closure_notify alert MUST be sent before closing the TCP
   connection.

   A Exporter MAY choose not to wait for the Collector's closure_notify
   alert and simply close the association or the connection, thus
   generating an incomplete close on the Collector side.  Once the
   Collector gets closure_notify from the Exporter, it MUST reply with a
   closure_notify unless it becomes aware that the association or the
   connection has already been closed by the Exporter (e.g., the closure
   was indicated by TCP or SCTP).

   When a Collector no longer wants to receive IPFIX messages, it SHOULD
   close its end of the association or the connection.  The Collector
   MUST attempt to initiate an exchange of closure_notify alerts with
   the Exporter before closing the association or the connection.  When
   the Exporter has received the closure_notify alert from the Collector
   and still has pending data to send, the Exporter SHOULD send the

   pending data before sending the closure_notify alert.  The Collector
   SHOULD continue to read IPFIX Messages until the Exporter has closed
   its end.

2.5.  TLS/DTLS to secure IPFIX

   TLS/DTLS transport can provide different levels of security
   protection.

2.5.1.  IPFIX End-point Authentication

   It is important to make sure that the IPFIX Exporter is talking to
   the "right" Collector and vice versa.

   TLS supports three authentication modes: authentication of both
   parties, server authentication with an unauthenticated client, and
   total anonymity.

   TLS or DTLS uses certificate [RFC3280] to authenticate the peers.
   When an Exporter authenticates a Collector it MUST validate the
   certificate.  It SHOULD check the common name (CN) of the certificate
   against the host name of the collector if it has knowledge of a
   common name/host name mapping.  If the common name does not match the
   host name, the Exporter SHOULD send an "access_denied" error alert
   using the TLS or DTLS alert protocol to terminate the handshake, and
   then it SHOULD close the communication between them.  When a
   Collector authenticates an Exporter, the same procedure applies.

   It is up to the application (administrator) to decide whether one-way
   authentication, mutual authentication or total anonymity is
   appropriate for the application.

2.5.2.  Data Security

   The IPFIX data may exist in both the IPFIX Exporter and the
   Collector.  In addition, the data is also transferred on the wire
   from the IPFIX Exporter to the Collector when it is exported.  To
   provide security, the data should be protected from common network
   attacks.  The protection of IPFIX data within the IPFIX Device and
   Collector is out of scope for this document.

   TLS supports both stream cipher and block cipher.  The key for
   encryption is derived from a secret established by the handshake
   protocol.  An IPFIX implementation SHOULD permit administrators to
   select the cryptographic level they desire.

3.  Security Considerations

   Note: This section is not complete yet.

3.1.  Encryption

   The data encryption option adds overhead to the IPFIX data transfer.
   It may limit the rate that an Exporter can report its Flow Records to
   the Collector due to the resource requirement for running encryption.
   If the IPFIX messages do not carry sensitive information, then the
   TLS/DTLS Record Protocol can be used to carry data without
   encryption.

3.2.  Authentication

   TLS authentication and the establishment of secrets are based on
   certificates and asymmetric cryptography.  This makes TLS/DTLS
   transport much more expensive.  One-way authentication may be used
   when the Exporter's identity can be assured.  Mutual authentication
   SHOULD be required when the identities of the IPFIX Device and the
   Collector can't be assured.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign one SCTP port number, one PR-SCTP port
   number, one TCP port number and one UPD number which will be the
   default port for IPFIX/TLS over SCTP , IPFIX/TLS over TCP , IPFIX/
   DTLS over PR-SCTP and IPFIX/DTLS over UDP separately, as defined in
   this document.
