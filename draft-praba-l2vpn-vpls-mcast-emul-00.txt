1. Introduction 
    
   In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the Provider Edge (PE) 
   devices provide a logical interconnect such that Customer Edge (CE) 
   devices belonging to a specific VPLS instance appear to be connected 
   by a single LAN. Forwarding information base for particular VPLS 
   instance is populated dynamically by source MAC address learning. 
   This is a straightforward solution to support unicast traffic, with 
   reasonable flooding for unicast unknown traffic.  Since a VPLS 
   provides LAN emulation for IEEE bridges as wells as for routers, the 
   unicast and multicast traffic need to follow the same path for 
   layer-2 protocols to work properly.  As such, multicast traffic is 
   treated as broadcast traffic and is flooded to every site in the 
   VPLS instance. 
    
   VPLS solutions (i.e., [VPLS-LDP] and [VPLS-BGP]) perform replication 
   for multicast traffic at the ingress PE devices.  When replicated at 
   the ingress PE, multicast traffic wastes bandwidth when: 1. 
   Multicast traffic is sent to sites with no members, 2. Pseudo wires 
   to different sites go through a shared path, and 3. Multicast 
   traffic is forwarded along a shortest path tree as opposed to the 
   minimum cost spanning tree.  This document addresses the issue of 
   wasting bandwidth in the above 1 and 2 cases by using LDP signaling 
   to emulate Multicast operation over VPLS with out using IGMP and PIM 
   snooping.  Using VPLS in conjunction with the small modification in 
   LDP signaling has the following advantages: 
      - It improves VPLS to support IP multicast efficiently (not 
        necessarily optimum, as there can still be bandwidth waste), 
      - It prevents sending multicast traffic to sites with no members, 
      - It keeps P routers in the core stateless, 
      - The Service Provider (SP) does not need to perform the tasks to 
        provide multicast service (e.g., running PIM, managing P-group 
        addresses, managing multicast tunnels), 
      - The SP does not need to maintain PIM adjacencies with the 
        customers, 
      - This Multicast Emulation over VPLS feature avoids the

        dependency over multicast protocols like IGMP and PIM snooping 
        or any other multicast routing protocols DVMRP and MOSPF. 
    
   In this document, we describe the procedures for using LDP  
   signaling to emulate Multicast service without using Internet Group 
   Management Protocol (IGMP) and Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) 
   snooping over VPLS for efficient distribution of IP multicast 
   traffic. 
    
    
2. Overview of VPLS 
       
   In case of VPLS, the PE devices provide a logical interconnect such 
   that CE devices belonging to a specific VPLS appear to be connected 
   by a single LAN.  End-to-end VPLS consists of a bridge module and a 
   LAN emulation module ([L2VPN-FR]). 
    
   In a VPLS, a customer site receives Layer-2 service from the SP. 
   The PE is attached via an access connection to one or more CEs. The 
   PE performs forwarding of user data packets based on information in 
   the Layer-2 header, that is, MAC destination address.  The CE sees  
   a bridge. 
    
   The details of VPLS reference model, which we summarize here, can be 
   found in [L2VPN_FR].  In VPLS, the PE can be viewed as containing a 
   Virtual Switching Instance (VSI) for each L2VPN that it serves.  A 
   CE device attaches, possibly through an access network, to a bridge 
   module of a PE.  Within the PE, the bridge module attaches, through 
   an Emulated LAN Interface to an Emulated LAN.  For each VPLS, there 
   is an Emulated LAN instance.  The Emulated LAN consists of VPLS 
   Forwarder module (one per PE per VPLS service instance) connected by 
   pseudo wires (PW), where the PWs may be traveling through Packet 
   Switched Network (PSN) tunnels over a routed backbone.  VSI is a 
   logical entity that contains a VPLS forwarder module and part of the 
   bridge module relevant to the VPLS service instance [L2VPN-FR]. 
   Hence, the VSI terminates PWs for interconnection with other VSIs 
   and also terminates attachment circuits (ACs) for accommodating CEs. 
   A VSI includes the forwarding information base for a L2VPN [L2VPN- 
   FR] which is the set of information regarding how to forward Layer-2 
   frames received over the AC from the CE to VSIs in other PEs 
   supporting the same L2VPN service (and/or to other ACs), and contains 
   information regarding how to forward Layer-2 frames received from PWs 
   to ACs.  Forwarding information bases can be populated dynamically 
   (such as by source MAC address learning) or statically (e.g., by 
   configuration).  Each PE device is responsible for proper forwarding 
   of the customer traffic to the appropriate destination(s) based on 
   the forwarding information base of the corresponding VSI.

3. Multicast Traffic over VPLS 
    
   In VPLS, if a PE receives a frame from an Attachment Circuit (AC) 
   with no matching entry in the forwarding information base for that 
   particular VPLS instance, it floods the frame to all other PEs 
   (which are part of this VPLS instance) and to directly connected ACs 
   (other than the one that the frame is received from).  The flooding 
   of a frame occurs when: 
      - The destination MAC address has not been learned, 
      - The destination MAC address is a broadcast address, 
      - The destination MAC address is a multicast address. 
    
   Malicious attacks (e.g., receiving unknown frames constantly) aside, 
   the first situation is handled by VPLS solutions as long as 
   destination MAC address can be learned.  After that point on, the 
   frames will not be flooded.  A PE is REQUIRED to have safeguards, 
   such as unknown unicast limiting and MAC table limiting, against 
   malicious unknown unicast attacks. 
    
   There is no way around flooding broadcast frames.  To prevent 
   runaway broadcast traffic from adversely affecting the VPLS service 
   and the SP network, a PE is REQUIRED to have tools to rate limit the 
   broadcast traffic as well. 
    
   Similar to broadcast frames, multicast frames are flooded as well, 
   as a PE can not know where multicast members reside.  Rate limiting 
   multicast traffic, while possible, should be done carefully since 
   several network control protocols relies on multicast.  For one 
   thing, layer-2 and layer-3 protocols utilize multicast for their 
   operation.  For instance, Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) use an 
   IEEE assigned "all bridges multicast MAC address", while OSPF packets 
   are multicast to the "all OSPF routers multicast MAC address".  If 
   the rate-limiting of multicast traffic is not done properly, the 
   customer network will experience instability and poor performance.  
    
   A VPLS solution MUST NOT affect the operation of customer layer-2 
   protocols (e.g., BPDUs).  Additionally, a VPLS solution MUST NOT 
   affect the operation of layer-3 protocols. 
    
   In the following section, we describe procedures to constrain the 
   flooding of IP multicast traffic in VPLS.   
    
    
4. Constraining of IP Multicast in a VPLS 
    
   The objective of improving the efficiency of VPLS for multicast 
   traffic that we are trying to optimize here has the following

   constraints: 
      - The service is VPLS, i.e., a layer-2 VPN, 
      - In VPLS, ingress replication is required, 
      - There is no layer-3 adjacency (e.g., PIM) between a CE and a 
        PE. 
    
   Under these circumstances, the one approach is emulating Multicast 
   implementation in VPLS without using IGMP, PIM snooping or any other 
   multicast routing protocols DVMRP and MOSPF.   
    
   Another approach to constrain multicast traffic in a VPLS is to 
   utilize point-multipoint LSPs (e.g., [PMP-RSVP-TE]).  This approach 
   is outside the scope of this document. 
    
   Note that, in some extremely controlled cases, such as a ring 
   topology of PE routers with no P routers or a tree topology, the 
   efficiency of the replication of IP multicast can be improved.  For 
   instance, spoke PWs of a hierarchical VPLS can be daisy-chained 
   together and some replication rules can be devised.  These cases are 
   not expected to be common and will not be considered in this 
   document. 
    
   In the following sections, we provide some guidelines for the 
   implementation of Multicast emulation over VPLS without using IGMP 
   and PIM snooping. 
    
    
4.1 General Rules for multicast emulation over VPLS using LDP 
    
   The following rules for the correct operation of multicast emulation  
   over VPLS using LDP signaling MUST be followed. 
    
   Rule 1: PEs MUST follow the split-horizon rule for mesh PWs as 
   defined in [VPLS-LDP]. 
    
   Rule 2: Multicast emulation states in a PE MUST be per VPLS instance. 
    
   Rule 3: If the PE does not have any entry for the multicast emulation 
   state, the multicast traffic to that group in the VPLS instance MUST 
   be flooded. 
    
   Rule 4: A PE MUST support multicast emulation mode selection per VPLS 
   instance via CLI and/or EMS.

   A new PW Multicast Flow Status TLV is proposed in this document. The 
   PW Multicast Flow Status TLV will be used in the Label Mapping and 
   Notification messages of LDP. PW Multicast Status TLV manipulates the 
   multicast traffic flooding onto the PWs.  
    
   The description of the PW Multicast Flow Status TLV is stated below. 
    
4.2.1 PW Multicast Flow Status TLV 
    
   The format of the PW Multicast Flow(MF) Status TLV is: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |MF Status Code |                 Reserved                      | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   PW MF Status 
    
      [Note: MF Status TLV type 0x096D as defined in [IANA] pending IANA 
   allocation] 
    
   Length 
    
      The length contains the length of the PW Multicast Flow status 
   value in bytes.  The length is always 4. 
 
   MF Status Code 
 
      MF Status code is specified as bit mask indicating which 
   combination of the option is enabled in MF Status code. The bit 
   fields indicating the MF status code are: 
 
      00000001 : MF emulation enable 
      00000010 : MF emulation disable 
      00000100 : MF un-register 
      00001000 : MF register 
      00010000 : Reserved (unused) 
      00100000 : Reserved (unused) 
      01000000 : Reserved (unused) 
      10000000 : Reserved (unused) 
 
      The above-mentioned bits are OR-ed to get the final MF status 
   code.  When MF emulation disable bit is set then the remaining bit 
   fields are in-significant.  The only allowed OR-ing combination is MF

   emulation enable with MF register or MF un-register and the rest of 
   the combinations are in-significant. 
 
   Reserved 
 
      The reserved field is always set to zero and it is unused. 
    
4.2.2 Signaling of Pseudo Wire Multicast Flow Status TLV  
 
   The PEs MUST send PW label mapping messages to their peers as soon as 
   the PW is configured and administratively enabled.  When the PWs is 
   first set up, the PEs MUST attempt to check the multicast emulation 
   supported capable, if supported, the PW Multicast Flow Status TLV 
   MUST include it in the initial label mapping signaling following 
   label mapping TLV, the PW FEC, and the interface parameters field. 
   The PW Multicast Flow Status TLV will then be used for the lifetime 
   of the Pseudowire. This is shown in the following diagram: 
    
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

   If PW status TLV is sent following the label mapping TLV in the 
   initial PW FEC Message, then the PW Multicast Flow Status TLV MUST be 
   included after the PW status TLV.  Note that if the PW Multicast Flow 
   Status TLV is not supported, by the remote peer, it will 
   automatically be ignored, since the LDP ignore bit is set. The PW 
   Multicast Flow Status TLV, therefore, will not be present in the

   corresponding FEC advertisement from the remote LDP peer resulting in 
   exactly the above behavior. 
    
   If the PW Multicast Flow Status TLV is not present following the 
   label mapping TLV in the initial PW FEC Message received by a PE, 
   then the PW Multicast Flow Status TLV will not be used. 
    
   Initial label mapping messages between peer results in the usage of 
   the PW Multicast Flow status TLV. Subsequent updates of PW 
   Multicast Flow status is conveyed through the Notification messages. 
    
   The PW Multicast Flow Status TLV is transported to the remote PW peer 
   via the LDP notification message for PW Multicast Flow status update. 
   The general format of the Notification Message is:

   The Status TLV status code is set to 0x0000002B "PW Multicast Flow

   Code 0x0000002B as defined in [IANA] pending IANA allocation ] 
    
   The PW FEC TLV processing SHOULD be done similar to the procedure 
   specified in section 5.3.2 of [PW-CTRL-PROT].

4.3.1 LDP signaling 
    
   Multicast emulation over VPLS feature capable PE peers by default 
   sets the MF emulation enable bit field in the PW MF status TLV along 
   with either MF register bit field set or with MF un-register bit 
   field set.  If the former case is set, the label mapping message 
   receiving PE MUST forward the multicast traffic onto the PW, if the 
   later case is set, the label mapping message receiving PE MUST not 
   send the multicast flow onto the PW.  
    
   This can be done in the initial label mapping messages between peers 
   or MF emulation enable alone in the initial label mapping and the 
   subsequent update either MF register or MF un-register via 
   notification messages. 
    
   By default the MF Status code SHOULD set MF emulation enable bit to 
   support this multicast emulation over VPLS feature.

   emulation over VPLS capable peer:

   Case 1: MF emulation disable bit field is set  
   Initial label mapping messages between PEs with PW MF status TLV has 
   MF emulation disable bit field set, triggers the existing multicast 
   default VPLS behavior and the subsequent update is done using 
   notification messages.  
    
   Case 2: MF emulation enable bit field is set  
   Initial label mapping messages between PEs with PW MF status TLV has 
   MF emulation enable bit field set, indicates to the peer that the  
   multicast emulation over VPLS feature is supported and the subsequent 
   update is done using notification messages. 
    
   Case 3: MF emulation enable bit and MF register bit fields are set 
   Initial label mapping messages between PEs with PW MF status TLV has 
   MF emulation enable bit and MF register bit fields set, indicates to 
   the peer that the multicast emulation over VPLS feature is supported 
   and the multicast flow SHOULD be forwarded onto the PW and the 
   subsequent update is done using notification messages. 
    
   Case 4: MF emulation enable bit and MF un-register bit fields are set 
   Initial label mapping messages between PEs with PW MF status TLV has 
   MF emulation enable bit and MF un-register bit fields set, indicates 
   to the peer that the multicast emulation over VPLS feature is 
   supported and the multicast flow SHOULD NOT be forwarded onto the PW 
   and the subsequent update is done using notification messages. 
    
   The standard LDP error conditions during LDP signaling SHOULD be 
   handled as detailed in [LDP]. It is also strongly RECOMMENDED that 
   the PW MF status TLV signaling procedures said above is fully 
   implemented. By using the above procedures in LDP signaling, the 
   multicast data traffic filtering is done with out using IGMP and PIM 
   snooping.   
    
4.3.2 Data forwarding 
    
   The existing default VPLS forwarding behavior states that the 
   received multicast traffic is treated as broadcast traffic and is 
   flooded to every site in the VPLS instance.  If we enable Multicast 
   emulation over VPLS feature, the multicast data traffic should not be 
   flooded on the PWs which are requested explicitly not to send 
   multicast data traffic.  This can be achieved easily by having  
   normal data forwarding table and multicast data forwarding table at 
   the forwarder.  Whenever the multicast traffic is received, the 
   forwarder checks the multicast data forwarding table for the VPLS 
   instance and the corresponding PWs. The multicast data traffic is 
   sent only to the PWs which are all interested in multicast data 
   traffic, this check is done based on the MF un-register flag set at 
   the forwarder level during LDP signaling. The implementation depends

   on the forwarder architecture and its details are outside the scope 
   of this document. 
    
    
5 Interoperability considerations 
 
   The feature described in this document would be operational only if 
   both the PE routers support the LDP extensions described above.  If 
   one of them does not support the LDP extensions then the un-
   supporting PE may silently ignore the additional TLV processing or it 
   may return appropriate advisory notification messages. If, [VPLS-
   MCAST] draft is implemented then implementing this feature is not 
   much useful.  
    
 
6. IANA Considerations 
 
6.1 LDP TLV TYPE 
 
   This document uses a new LDP TLV type, IANA already maintains a 
   registry of name "TLV TYPE NAME SPACE" defined by RFC3036. The 
   following value is suggested for assignment: 
    
      TLV type    Description 
       0x096D     Multicast Flow(MF) Status TLV 
    
6.2 LDP status messages 
    
   This document uses a new LDP status code, IANA already maintains a 
   registry of name "STATUS CODE NAME SPACE" defined by RFC3036. The 
   following value is suggested for assignment: 
    
      0x0000002B "PW Multicast Flow status" 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations provided in VPLS solution documents (i.e., 
   [VPLS-LDP] and [VPLS-BGP) apply to this document as well.
