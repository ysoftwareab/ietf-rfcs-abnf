          Internet Draft          SNMP over IPX              August 1992



          2. Abstract

          This document defines a convention for encapsulating Simple
          Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [1] packets over the
          transport mechanism provided via the Internetwork Packet
          Exchange (IPX) protocol [2].


          3. Introduction

          The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined in
          [1] is now used as an integral part of the network management
          framework for TCP/IP-based internets.  Together with its
          companion standards, which define the Structure of Management
          Information (SMI) [3,4], and the Management Information Base
          (MIB) [5], the SNMP has received widespread deployment in many
          operational networks running the Internet suite of protocols.

          The success of SNMP in the TCP/IP environment has led to its
          deployment in non TCP/IP-based internets. This specification
          describes the mapping of SNMP onto the Internetwork Packet
          Exchange (IPX) protocol [2] used in Novell NetWare
          environments.

          As noted in [6], the preferred mapping for SNMP is onto UDP
          [7].  As such, this specification is intended for use in
          environments where UDP transport is not available.  No aspect
          of this specification should be construed as a suggestion
          that, in a heterogeneous transport environment, a managed
          agent should support more than one mapping. Conversely,
          management stations are strongly encouraged to support
          mappings of SNMP onto all popular transports.


          4.  Mapping SNMP onto IPX

          Mapping SNMP onto IPX is straight-forward since IPX provides a
          datagram service very similar to that provided by IP/UDP.

          Although modifications have been made elsewhere in the NetWare
          protocol suite, IPX is identical to the Xerox Internet
          Datagram Protocol (IDP) [8].  The socket address space
          authority is administered by Novell.

          SNMP packets will always set the Packet Type field in the IPX
          header to 4 (i.e., Packet Exchange Packet).

          Internet Draft          SNMP over IPX              August 1992



          4.1  Socket Assignments

          SNMP protocol entities will receive GetRequest-PDU,
          GetNextRequest-PDU, and SetRequest-PDU messages on socket
          36879 (Destination Socket field set to hexadecimal 900F), and
          Trap-PDU messages on socket 36880 (Destination Socket field
          set to hexadecimal 9010).

          GetResponse-PDU messages will be addressed to the IPX address
          and socket from which the corresponding GetRequest-PDU,
          GetNextRequest-PDU, or SetRequest-PDU originated.


          4.2  Traps

          When SNMP traps are sent over IPX, the agent-addr field in the
          Trap-PDU contains the IP-address "0.0.0.0".  An SNMP manager
          may ascertain the source of the trap based on information
          provided by the transport service


          4.3  Maximum Message Size

          Although SNMP does not require conformant implementations to
          accept messages whose length exceeds 484 bytes, it is
          recommended that implementations support a maximum SNMP
          message size of 546 bytes (the maximum size allowed under
          IPX).  Furthermore, this limit is the maximum packet length
          guaranteed to traverse IPX routers which do not provide
          fragmentation.  Implementors may choose to use longer packet
          lengths if the maximum is known, which depends on the
          intermediate routers and/or intermediate datalink layer
          protocols.


          4.4  SNMP Party Information

          There are occasions when it is necessary to represent a
          transport service address in a MIB.  For instance, the SNMP
          party MIB [9] uses an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to define the
          transport domain (IP, IPX, etc.) and an OCTET STRING to
          represent an address within that domain.  The following
          definitions are provided for use in such a scheme.

          RFCyyyy-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

          IMPORTS
               experimental
                    FROM RFC1155-SMI;

          Internet Draft          SNMP over IPX              August 1992



          snmpOverIpx
               OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { experimental xx }

          snmpOverIpxDomain
               OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { snmpOverIpx 1}

          -- For snmpOverIpxDomain, a TAddress is 12 octets long and
          -- comprises 3 fields, each in network-byte (high-low) order.

          -- The first field is 4 octets long and contains the network
          -- number.



          -- The next field is 6 octets long and contains the physical
          -- address of the node.  Since IPX can run over a variety of
          -- subnet architectures, the physical node address may not
          -- require all 6 octets.  As specified in [2], the physical
          -- node address will occupy the least significant portion of
          -- the field and the most significant octets should be set
          -- to zero.

          -- The last field is 2 octets long and contains the socket
          -- number.


          -- When devices are installed, they need to be configured
          -- with an initial set of SNMP parties.  The configuration
          -- of SNMP parties requires (among other things) the
          -- assignment of several  OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.  Any local
          -- network administration can obtain the delegated authority
          -- necessary to assign its own OBJECT IDENTIFIERs. However,
          -- to cater for those administrations who have not obtained
          -- the necessary authority, this document allocates a branch
          -- of the naming tree for use with the following
          -- conventions.

          initialIPXPartyId
               OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { snmpOverIpx 2 }

          -- This prefix is used in an analogous fashion as
          --
          --   initialPartyId
          --
          -- as defined in [9].  For an SNMP protocol entity residing
          -- at IPX transport address 'N', the identities of its six
          -- initial parties are formed by appending 12 sub identifiers,
          -- one sub-identifier for each octet in the IPX transport
          -- address, to
          --
