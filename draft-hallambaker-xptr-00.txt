1.  Definitions

   The following definitions are used in this document:

   DNS Resource Record  A DNS Resource Record as defined in [TBS]

   Prefixed Record  A DNS Resource Record in which one or more labels
      contain characters that are not valid DNS host names.  [TBS]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Prefixed resource records, first introduced in the SRV specification
   provide a means of extending the DNS without allocating a new
   resource record

   The principle disadvantage faced when using prefixed DNS records is
   that the existing DNS specifications do not provide a 'midpoint
   wildcard' of the form _prefix.*.example.com.  While a DNS server can
   implement such a wildcard in response to a DNS query as a 'synthetic'
   wildcard this usage is not compatible with the mechanisms of DNSSEC
   or Zone Transfer.

   While support for wildcarding of prefixed records has not been
   considered an essential requirement in service discovery applications
   such as SRV and NAPTR, wildcarding is considered an essential
   requirement for publication of protocol policy statements.  In
   particular the ability to make policy statements of the form 'All
   mail from *.example.com is signed' is frequently a requirement.

   While such a requirement could be satisified by issuing separate DNS
   RRs for each protocol policy advertisement, this approach is only
   acceptable if the number of policy advertisements is expected to be
   small.  While the number of official prefix registrations is small,
   informal registrations number in excess of 500 in June 2007.  This
   number is likely to rise rapidly as the use of Web Services
   increases.

   The DNS resource record is expressed as a fixed 16 bit field giving
   65,336 possible values.  An architecture which limits the Internet to
   65,336 possible protocols for machine-machine interaction is not
   sustainable.

3.  Resolving Prefix records with XPTR

   XPTR allows a resolution algorithm to be defined that supports the
   use of wildcards in conjunction with prefixed DNS records by
   introducing an additional step of indirection.  Although a wildcard
   cannot be applied to prefixed DNS record itself, a wildcard can be
   applied to the XPTR indirection record.

3.1.  Basic Prefix Resolution

   The basic XPTR prefix resolution (basic) algorithm MAY be specified
   as the means of resolving a particular DNS record prefix.

   The basic resolution algorithm resolves a triple consisting of a DNS
   node, a DNS prefix label and a DNS record type.  The resolution
   algorithm returns either the record requested or the result ?not
   present?.

   The resolution algorithm always produces a result in a maximum of
   three steps when applied to DNS nodes in the forward DNS.  The
   requestor first looks for a prefix record at the query node itself.
   If this search fails the requestor looks for a PREPTR record at the
   query node and if this is found:


   Record BasicPrefixResolve (
                     String node, String prefix, RecordType  record)
      1.   Record F1 =  Lookup (prefix + "." + node, record)
         If  (F1 <> NIL) Return F1
      2.   Record F2 = Lookup (node, PREPTR)
         If (F2 = NIL) Return NIL
      3.   Record F3 = Lookup (prefix + "." + F2.domain)
         Return F3



3.2.  Reverse Prefix Resolution

   In most cases an Internet service is identified by means of a domain
   name.  In certain circumstances it is desirable to perform service
   and policy discovery by means of the IP address.  This requirement is
   most likely to occur in protocols for real time reporting of security
   incidents where the IP address of the source of attack is known with
   some degree of certainty, but not a domain name.

   In such situations the service discovery process MAY specify the use
   of the Reverse DNS.  The reverse DNS is an area of the DNS space (in-
   addr.arpa, ipv6.arpa).  A PTR record in the reverse DNS maps an IPv4

   or IPv6 address to a DNS name.

   Depending on the requirements of the service it MAY be desirable for
   discovery to process XPTR records in the reverse DNS directly or to
   first attempt to follow a PTR record to obtain a DNS node where basic
   prefix resolution is to be performed.


 Record ReversePrefixResolve(
                   IPAddress address, String prefix, RecordType  record)
     1.  Record R1 =  Lookup (prefix + "." +
                              ReverseToNode (address), record)
         If  (F1 <> NIL) Return F1
     2.  Record R2 = Lookup (node, ReverseToNode (address)
         If (R2 = NIL) Return NIL
         Else Return BasicPrefixResolve (R2.domain, prefix, record)





4.  Using XPTR

   XPTR may be used to simplfy administration of prefixed DNS records
   and to permit the resolution of wildcard DNS records.

4.1.  Wildcards

   In order to illustrate the use of XPTR we consider the resolution of
   a hypothetical Internet protocol 'NOOP'.

   The discovery protocol for NOOP is specified as using SRV with the
   basic prefix resolution protocol.  There is no default port
   assignment.

   All service requests for the 'NOOP' service with SRV Prefix _noop in
   the domain example.com are to be directed to the main noop server,
   except for the mathematics department math.example.com which has its
   own server.

   The zone file is:


   _noop._tcp.example.com        SRV 1 1 80 noop.example.com
   _noop._tcp.math.example.com   SRV 1 1 80 math.example.com

   h1.example.com                A    10.1.1.1
   h1.example.com                XPTR example.com

Internet-Draft          XPTR: DNS Prefix Pointer               June 2007


   *.example.com                 XPTR example.com


   Although XPTR addresses the lack of a DNS midpoint wildcard it does
   not address the fact that the semantics of DNS wildcards are
   considerably more restrictive than is generally convenient and a DNS
   wildcard only binds to a DNS zone if there are no other records of
   any type defined for that node.  It is therefore necessary to specify
   an XPTR record for the node h1.example.com which is outside the scope
   of the wildcard.

4.2.  Policy Administration

   We hypothecate the existence of a protocol policy prefixes
   _a._policy, _b._policy etc. to be used to specify protocol
   configuration options.

   The administrator of example.com has three basic types of machine;
   desktops, laptops and servers.  The range of services a particular
   machine is allowed to offer is determined by its class.  Instead of
   defining the protocol configuration policy for each machine
   individually the administrator specifies an XPTR record to direct
   resolution to a node where the characteristics for the whole class
   are defined:


   _a._policy.laptop.example.com   TXT  "SSL=always"
   _b._policy.laptop.example.com   TXT  "MinVersion=2.3 MaxVersion=3.4"

   _a._policy.desktop.example.com  TXT  ""
   _b._policy.desktop.example.com  TXT  "MinVersion=2.1 MaxVersion=3.4"

   _a._policy.server.example.com   TXT  ""
   _b._policy.server.example.com   TXT  "MinVersion=1.0 MaxVersion=3.4"


    alice.example.com              XPTR laptop.example.com
      bob.example.com              XPTR laptop.example.com
    carol.example.com              XPTR desktop.example.com
     doug.example.com              XPTR laptop.example.com
   _b._policy.doug.example.com     TXT  "MinVersion=2.3 MaxVersion=3.4"
   edward.example.com              XPTR server.example.com
     mail.example.com              XPTR server.example.com



   The default policy may be overriden as necessary by a policy declared
   at the specific node.  In this case the administrator has overriden

   policy B for doug.example.com.


5.  Acknowledgements

   The ideas in this document arose from extensive discussions with the
   DKIM and DNSEXT working groups.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests allocation of a DNS Resource Record for the
   XPTR record.


7.  Security Considerations

   The XPTR record does not change the security model or field of
   application of DNS.  It does however make it more likely that DNS
   will be used in situations where the need for robust integrity and
   authenticity controls such as those provided by DNSSEC will become
   more apparent.

   In particular it is highly desirable for a prefixed record used to
   distribute a security policy to be signed.

   In cases where an XPTR directs resolution of prefixed records to a
   DNS zone that is under a different administrative control regime,
   administrative control and the ability to enforce security controls
   is transfered to another party.
