Internet-Draft      DSR Usage for the VANET Routing        November 2017


Abstract

   This document describes how DSR [1] can be applied in the vehicular
   ad hoc network (VANET) environment. Since DSR uses the source routing
   mechanism, it can be appropriate for the VANET routing mechanisms
   operating based on the source routing. Therefore, in this draft,
   we describe how we can modify DSR for the VANET source routing.

Internet-Draft      DSR Usage for the VANET Routing        November 2017


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a special form of the MANET
   in which vehicles (mobile nodes) move along the given road layout
   [2]. When a route from a source node to a destination node is
   discovered, the obtained route has to be represented with a
   sequence of roads instead of nodes (vehicles) since vehicles move too
   fast. If a route is represented as a sequence of nodes, the route can
   be easily broken, which incurs too frequent route maintenance
   procedure. This problem can be resolved by representing a route as a
   sequence of roads. In this case, the source routing is appropriate.
   That is, once the route information is obtained, data are sent along
   the roads in the route information and, in the header of each data
   packet, the route information is included.

   The route discovery capability of DSR [1] is desirable to fiure out
   a route composed of roads with a proper number of vehicles. Therefore,
   in this draft, we define how DSR messages can be used for VANET.


3.  DSR for the VANET Routing

   In DSR, the route discovery is initiated by the source node's
   broadcasting of an RREQ message. Each intermediate node forwards
   the received RREQ message via broadcast and the route information
   is recorded in the RREQ message. Once the destination node receives
   an RREQ message, it sends out an RREP message with the collected
   route information back to the source. Or, if an intermediate node
   has the route information to the destination, it stops forwarding
   the RREQ message and sends an RREP message back to the source.

   In a VANET, a 'node' is a fast moving vehicle and, as a result,
   the network topology changes drastically. Thus, rather than
   recording the passing-by nodes in the RREQ message, it is better to
   record the passing-by roads in the RREQ message. This may reduce
   the possibility of route maintenance.
    
   In this case, since 'road' is the unit element of the route
   information and there is no representative entity to keep the route
   state of a road, the RREP message has to be generated by only the
   destination node.

   There can be more than one node on a road, so RREQ messages with
   the same route information can be generated by multiple nodes.
   Therefore, the destination has to ignore RREQ messages with the same
   route information as that of the already chosen RREQ message.

   Also, since a sequence of 'road's represents a route, the automatic
   route shortening, the gratuitous RREP message and the optional flow
   state extension capabilities of DSR may not be necessary. Hence,
   a simplified version of DSR is adequate for the VANET routing.
 
  
4.  Redefined DSR Options Header

   The Route Request option in the DSR Options header is redefined as
   follows:
