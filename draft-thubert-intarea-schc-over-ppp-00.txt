Abstract

   This document extends RFC 5172 to signal the use of SCHC as the
   compression method between a pair of nodes over PPP.  Combined with
   RFC 2516, this enables the use of SCHC over Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

1.  Introduction

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC5172] provides a standard
   method of encapsulating network-layer protocol information over
   point-to-point links.  "A Method for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet
   (PPPoE)" [RFC2516] transports PPP over Ethernet between a pair of
   nodes.  It is compatible with a translating bridge to Wi-Fi, and
   therefore enables PPP over Wi-Fi as well.

   PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a
   family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
   configuring different network-layer protocols.  "IP Version 6 over
   PPP" [RFC5072] defines the IPv6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP) , which is
   an NCP for a PPP link, and allows for the negotiation of desirable
   parameters for an IPv6 interface over PPP.

   "Negotiation for IPv6 Datagram Compression Using IPv6 Control
   Protocol" [RFC5172] defines the IPv6 datagram compression option that
   can be negotiated by a node on the link through the IPV6CP.  The
   "Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and fragmentation for
   LPWAN, application to UDP/IPv6" [SCHC] is a compression and
   fragmentation technique that was defined after the publication of
   [RFC5172].  In order to enable SCHC over PPP and therefore Ethernet
   and Wi-Fi, [RFC5172] must be extended to signal SCHC as an additional
   compression method for use over PPP.

2.  BCP 14

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extending RFC 5172

   With this specification, a PPP session defines a vitual link where a
   SCHC context is established with a particular set of Rules, which is
   indicated at the set up of the PPP session as follows:

   [RFC5172] defines an IPV6CP option called the IPv6-Compression-
   Protocol Configuration option with a type of 2.  The option contains
   an IPv6-Compression-Protocol field value that indicates a compression
   protocol and an optional data field as shown in Figure 1:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |   IPv6-Compression-Protocol   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Data ...
      +-+-+-+-+

        Figure 1: The IPv6-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option

   This specification indicates a new IPv6-Compression-Protocol field
   value for [SCHC] (see Section 5), and enables to transport a Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] of the set of rules in the
   optional data.  The default format for the set of rules is YANG using
   the "Data Model for SCHC" [SCHC_DATA_MODEL] encoded in JSON as
   specified in [RFC7951].  The size of the URL is computed based on the
   Length of the option as Length-4.  If the encoding is asymetrical,
   the initiator of the session is considered downstream, playing the
   role of the device in an LPWAN network.

4.  Profiling SCHC for high speed links

   Appendix D of [SCHC] specifies the profile information that
   technology specifications such as this must provide.  The following
   section address this requirement.

4.1.  Mapping the SCHC Architecture

   This specification leverages SCHC between an end point that is an IP
   Host and possibly a serial DTE (Data Terminal Equipment), and another
   that is an IP Node (either another IP Host or a Router) and possibly
   a serial DCE (Data Control Equipment), or a more modern physical or
   emulated endpoint, e.g., Ethernet devices that echange IP packets
   over PPPoE.

   Both endpoints MUST support the function of SCHC Compressor/
   Decompressor (C/D) as shown in Figure 2.


        +----------+  Wi-Fi /   +----------+                ....
        |    IP    |  Ethernet  |    IP    |            ..          )
        |   Host   +-----/------+  Router  +----------(   Internet   )
        | SCHC C/D |  Serial    | SCHC C/D |            (         )
        +----------+            +----------+               ...
                    <-- SCHC -->
                      over PPP

                        Figure 2: Typical Deployment

   The assumption for this document is that the SCHC Fragmenter/
   Reassembler (F/R) is generally not needed, because the maximum
   transmission unit (MTU) is expected to be large enough and SCHC only
   reduces the frame size vs.  native IP.

   An example use case for SCHC over PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) would be
   to apply SCHC to streamline traffic by reducing the size of the
   frames and maintain them to a constant size and constant rate, e.g.,
   to simplify the scheduling of [DetNet] packets over TSN or one of the
   [RAW Technologies].  Scheduling on DetNet links introduces a form of
   duty cycle, but that does not affect the SCHC operation, since
   fragmentation is not provided.

   A context may be generated for a particular upper layer application,
   such as a control loop using an industrial automation protocol, to
   protect the particular flow with a DetNet service.  The context can
   be asymetric, e.g., when connecting a master and a slave, a client
   and a server, or a programmable logic controller with a sensor or an
   actuator.

4.2.  SCHC Parameters

   Compared to typical LPWANs, most serial links and emulations such as
   PPPoE are very fast and most of the constraints can be alleviated.
   For this reason, the SCHC profile for PPP is defined as follows:

   RuleID numbering scheme: Rules are of a fixed size of two bytes,
   which allows for more than 65000 different Rules within one
   session.  Since this specification does not leverage the SCHC
      fragmentation, a SCHC packet is always in the form:


            |------- Compressed Header -------|
            +---------------------------------+--------------------+
            |  RuleID  |  Compression Residue |      Payload       |
            +---------------------------------+--------------------+
             < 2bytes >

                            Figure 3: SCHC Packet

   Maximum packet size:  MAX_PACKET_SIZE is aligned to the PPP Link MTU.

   Padding:  The L2 word is one byte, so padding is up to the next byte
      boundary.  The padding bit is a 0.

4.2.1.  Resulting Packet Format

   In the case of PPPoE, the sequence of compression and encapsulation
   is as follows:

   A packet (e.g., an IPv6 packet)
             |                                           ^ (padding bits
             v                                           |    dropped)

4.3.  Security Considerations

   This draft enables to use the SCHC compression and fragmentation over
   PPP and therefore Ethernet and Wi-Fi with PPPoE.  It inherits the
   possible threats against SCHC listed in the "Security considerations"
   section of [SCHC].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the allocation of a new value in the registry
   "IPv6-Compression-Protocol Types" for "SCHC".  A suggested value is
   proposed in Table 1:
