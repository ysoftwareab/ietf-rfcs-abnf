<p>The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a user agent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code. The security model used for this is the Origin-based security model commonly used by Web browsers. The protocol consists of an initial handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g. using XMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Background</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">Historically, creating an instant messenger chat client as a Web application has required an abuse of HTTP to poll the server for updates while sending upstream notifications as distinct HTTP calls.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">This results in a variety of problems: </p>

<ul>
<li>The server is forced to use a number of different underlying TCP connections for each client: one for sending information to the client, and a new one for each incoming message.</li>
<li>The wire protocol has a high overhead, with each client-to-server message having an HTTP header.</li>
<li>The client-side script is forced to maintain a mapping from the outgoing connections to the incoming connection to track replies.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">A simpler solution would be to use a single TCP connection for traffic in both directions. This is what the WebSocket protocol provides. Combined with the WebSocket API, it provides an alternative to HTTP polling for two-way communication from a Web page to a remote server. <a href="#WSAPI">[WSAPI]</a> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">The same technique can be used for a variety of Web applications: games, stock tickers, multiuser applications with simultaneous editing, user interfaces exposing server-side services in real time, etc.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> Protocol overview</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">The protocol has two parts: a handshake, and then the data transfer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">The handshake from the client looks as follows:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.1"></div>
<pre>
     GET /chat HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
     Sec-WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
     Sec-WebSocket-Version: 5
          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.4">The handshake from the server looks as follows:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.2"></div>
<pre>
     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
     Sec-WebSocket-Nonce: AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEC==
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.5">The leading line from the client follows the Request-Line format. The leading line from the server follows the Status-Line format. The Request-Line and Status-Line productions are defined in <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.6">After the leading line in both cases come an unordered set of headers. The meaning of these headers is specified in <a href="#handshake">Section 5</a> of this document. Additional headers may also be present, such as cookies required to identify the user. The format and parsing of headers is as defined in <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>.  </p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.8">Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes, and if the handshake was successful, then the data transfer part starts. This is a two-way communication channel where each side can, independently from the other, send data at will.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.9">Clients and servers, after a successful handshake, transfer data back and forth in conceptual units referred to in this specification as "messages". A message is a complete unit of data at an application level, with the expectation that many or most applications implementing this protocol (such as web user agents) provide APIs in terms of sending and receiving messages. The websocket message does not necessarily correspond to a particular network layer framing, as a fragmented message may be coalesced, or vice versa, e.g. by an intermediary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.10">Data is sent on the wire in the form of frames that have an associated type. Broadly speaking, there are types for textual data, which is interpreted as UTF-8 text, binary data (whose interpretation is left up to the application), and control frames, which are not intended to carry data for the application, but instead for protocol-level signaling, such as to signal that the connection should be closed. This version of the protocol defines six frame types and leaves ten reserved for future use.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.11">The WebSocket protocol uses this framing so that specifications that use the WebSocket protocol can expose such connections using an event-based mechanism instead of requiring users of those specifications to implement buffering and piecing together of messages manually.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a> Opening handshake</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.2">The opening handshake is intended to be compatible with HTTP-based server-side software and intermediaries, so that a single port can be used by both HTTP clients talking to that server and WebSocket clients talking to that server. To this end, the WebSocket client's handshake is an HTTP Upgrade request:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.3"></div>
<pre>
     GET /chat HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
     Sec-WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
     Sec-WebSocket-Version: 5
          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.3">Headers in the handshake are sent by the client in a random order; the order is not meaningful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.4">Additional headers are used to select options in the WebSocket protocol. Options available in this version are the subprotocol selector, |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol|, and |Cookie|, which can used for sending cookies to the server (e.g. as an authentication mechanism). The |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol| request-header field can be used to indicate what subprotocols (application-level protocols layered over the WebSocket protocol) are acceptable to the client. The server selects one of the acceptable protocols and echoes that value in its handshake to indicate that it has selected that protocol.</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.4"></div>
<pre>     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.5">The "Request-URI" of the GET method <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a> is used to identify the endpoint of the WebSocket connection, both to allow multiple domains to be served from one IP address and to allow multiple WebSocket endpoints to be served by a single server.<br><br></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.6">The client includes the hostname in the Host header of its handshake as per <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>, so that both the client and the server can verify that they agree on which host is in use.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.7">The |Sec-WebSocket-Origin| header is used to protect against unauthorized cross-origin use of a WebSocket server by scripts using the |WebSocket| API in a Web browser. The server is informed of the script origin generating the WebSocket connection request. If the server does not wish to accept connections from this origin, it can choose to abort the connection. This header is sent by browser clients, for non-browser clients this header may be sent if it makes sense in the context of those clients.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.8">Finally, the server has to prove to the client that it received the client's WebSocket handshake, so that the server doesn't accept connections that are not WebSocket connections. This prevents an attacker from tricking a WebSocket server by sending it carefully-crafted packets using |XMLHttpRequest| or a |form| submission.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.9">To prove that the handshake was received, the server has to take two pieces of information and combine them to form a response. The first piece of information comes from the |Sec-WebSocket-Key| header in the client handshake:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.5"></div>
<pre>
     Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.10">For this header, the server has to take the value (as present in the header, e.g. the base64-encoded version), and concatenate this with the GUID "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11" in string form, which is unlikely to be used by network endpoints that do not understand the WebSocket protocol. A SHA-1 hash, base64-encoded, of this concatenation is then returned in the server's handshake <a href="#FIPS.180-2.2002">[FIPS.180-2.2002]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.11">Concretely, if as in the example above, header |Sec-WebSocket-Key| had the value "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==", the server would concatenate the string "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11" to form the string "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11". The server would then take the SHA-1 hash of this, giving the value 0xb3 0x7a 0x4f 0x2c 0xc0 0x62 0x4f 0x16 0x90 0xf6 0x46 0x06 0xcf 0x38 0x59 0x45 0xb2 0xbe 0xc4 0xea. This value is then base64-encoded, to give the value "s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=". This value would then be echoed in the header |Sec-WebSocket-Accept|.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.13">The handshake from the server is much simpler than the client handshake. The first line is an HTTP Status-Line, with the status code 101:<br><br></p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.6"></div>
<pre>     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.14">Any status code other than 101 must be treated as a failure and the websocket connection aborted. The headers follow the status code.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.15">The |Connection| and |Upgrade| headers complete the HTTP Upgrade. The |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header indicates whether the server is willing to accept the connection. If present, this header must include a hash of the client's nonce sent in |Sec-WebSocket-Key| along with a predefined GUID. Any other value must not be interpreted as an acceptance of the connection by the server.<br><br></p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.7"></div>
<pre>
     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.16">These fields are checked by the Web browser when it is acting as a |WebSocket| client for scripted pages. If the |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| value does not match the expected value, or if the header is missing, or if the HTTP status code is not 101, the connection will not be established and WebSockets frames will not be sent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.17">Option fields can also be included. In this version of the protocol, the main option field is |Sec-WebSocket-Protocol|, which indicates the subprotocol that the server has selected. Web browsers verify that the server included one of the values as was specified in the |WebSocket| constructor. A server that speaks multiple subprotocols has to make sure it selects one based on the client's handshake and specifies it in its handshake.<br><br></p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.8"></div>
<pre>     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.18">The server can also set cookie-related option fields to <em>set</em> cookies, as in HTTP.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.4">1.4.</a> Closing handshake</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.2">The closing handshake is far simpler than the opening handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.3">Either peer can send a control frame with data containing a specified control sequence to begin the closing handshake. Upon receiving such a frame, the other peer sends an identical frame in acknowledgement, if it hasn't already sent one. Upon receiving <em>that</em> control frame, the first peer then closes the connection, safe in the knowledge that no further data is forthcoming.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.4">After sending a control frame indicating the connection should be closed, a peer does not send any further data; after receiving a control frame indicating the connection should be closed, a peer discards any further data received.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.5">It is safe for both peers to initiate this handshake simultaneously.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.6">The closing handshake is intended to replace the TCP closing handshake (FIN/ACK), on the basis that the TCP closing handshake is not always reliable end-to-end, especially in the presence of man-in-the-middle proxies and other intermediaries.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.5">1.5.</a> Design philosophy</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.2">The WebSocket protocol is designed on the principle that there should be minimal framing (the only framing that exists is to make the protocol frame-based instead of stream-based, and to support a distinction between Unicode text and binary frames). It is expected that metadata would be layered on top of WebSocket by the application layer, in the same way that metadata is layered on top of TCP by the application layer (HTTP).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.3">Conceptually, WebSocket is really just a layer on top of TCP that adds a Web "origin"-based security model for browsers; adds an addressing and protocol naming mechanism to support multiple services on one port and multiple host names on one IP address; layers a framing mechanism on top of TCP to get back to the IP packet mechanism that TCP is built on, but without length limits; and re-implements the closing handshake in-band. Other than that, it adds nothing. Basically it is intended to be as close to just exposing raw TCP to script as possible given the constraints of the Web. It's also designed in such a way that its servers can share a port with HTTP servers, by having its handshake be a valid HTTP Upgrade handshake also.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.5.p.4">The protocol is intended to be extensible; future versions will likely introduce additional concepts such as multiplexing and compression.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.6">1.6.</a> Security model</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.2">The WebSocket protocol uses the origin model used by Web browsers to restrict which Web pages can contact a WebSocket server when the WebSocket protocol is used from a Web page. Naturally, when the WebSocket protocol is used by a dedicated client directly (i.e. not from a Web page through a Web browser), the origin model is not useful, as the client can provide any arbitrary origin string.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.3">This protocol is intended to fail to establish a connection with servers of pre-existing protocols like SMTP or HTTP, while allowing HTTP servers to opt-in to supporting this protocol if desired. This is achieved by having a strict and elaborate handshake, and by limiting the data that can be inserted into the connection before the handshake is finished (thus limiting how much the server can be influenced).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.6.p.4">It is similarly intended to fail to establish a connection when data from other protocols, especially HTTP, is sent to a WebSocket server, for example as might happen if an HTML |form| were submitted to a WebSocket server. This is primarily achieved by requiring that the server prove that it read the handshake, which it can only do if the handshake contains the appropriate parts which themselves can only be sent by a WebSocket handshake; in particular, fields starting with |Sec-| cannot be set by an attacker from a Web browser, even when using |XMLHttpRequest|.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.7">1.7.</a> Relationship to TCP and HTTP</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.7.p.2">The WebSocket protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.7.p.3">Based on the expert recommendation of the IANA, the WebSocket protocol by default uses port 80 for regular WebSocket connections and port 443 for WebSocket connections tunneled over TLS.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.8">1.8.</a> Establishing a connection</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.8.p.2">There are several options for establishing a WebSocket connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.8.p.3">On the face of it, the simplest method would seem to be to use port 80 to get a direct connection to a WebSocket server. Port 80 traffic, however, will often be intercepted by HTTP proxies, which can lead to the connection failing to be established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.8.p.4">The most reliable method, therefore, is to use TLS encryption and port 443 to connect directly to a WebSocket server. This has the advantage of being more secure; however, TLS encryption can be computationally expensive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.8.p.5">When a connection is to be made to a port that is shared by an HTTP server (a situation that is quite likely to occur with traffic to ports 80 and 443), the connection will appear to the HTTP server to be a regular GET request with an Upgrade offer.  In relatively simple setups with just one IP address and a single server for all traffic to a single hostname, this might allow a practical way for systems based on the WebSocket protocol to be deployed.  In more elaborate setups (e.g. with load balancers and multiple servers), a dedicated set of hosts for WebSocket connections separate from the HTTP servers is probably easier to manage.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.9">1.9.</a> Subprotocols using the WebSocket protocol</h1>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.9.p.2">The client can request that the server use a specific subprotocol by including the |Sec-Websocket-Protocol| field in its handshake. If it is specified, the server needs to include the same field and one of the selected subprotocol values in its response for the connection to be established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.9.p.3">These subprotocol names do not need to be registered, but if a subprotocol is intended to be implemented by multiple independent WebSocket servers, potential clashes with the names of subprotocols defined independently can be avoided by using names that contain the domain name of the subprotocol's originator. For example, if Example Corporation were to create a Chat subprotocol to be implemented by many servers around the Web, they could name it "chat.example.com". If the Example Organization called their competing subprotocol "example.org's&#160;chat&#160;protocol", then the two subprotocols could be implemented by servers simultaneously, with the server dynamically selecting which subprotocol to use based on the value sent by the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.9.p.4">Subprotocols can be versioned in backwards-incompatible ways by changing the subprotocol name, e.g. going from "bookings.example.net" to "v2.bookings.example.net". These subprotocols would be considered completely separate by WebSocket clients. Backwards-compatible versioning can be implemented by reusing the same subprotocol string but carefully designing the actual subprotocol to support this kind of extensibility.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Conformance requirements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Implementations may impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">The conformance classes defined by this specification are user agents and servers.</p>

<p><strong>Converting a string to ASCII lowercase</strong> means replacing all characters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (i.e. LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) with the corresponding characters in the range U+0061 to U+007A (i.e. LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALL LETTER Z).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">Comparing two strings in an <strong>ASCII case-insensitive</strong> manner means comparing them exactly, code point for code point, except that the characters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (i.e. LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) and the corresponding characters in the range U+0061 to U+007A (i.e. LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALL LETTER Z) are considered to also match.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> Overview</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">In the WebSocket protocol, data is transmitted using a sequence of frames. Frames sent from the client to the server are masked to avoid confusing network intermediaries, such as intercepting proxies. Frames sent from the server to the client are not masked.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">The base framing protocol defines a frame type with an opcode, a payload length, and designated locations for extension and application data, which together define the <em>payload</em> data. Certain bits and opcodes are reserved for future expansion of the protocol. As such, In the absence of extensions negotiated during the opening handshake (<a href="#handshake">Section 5</a>), all reserved bits MUST be 0 and reserved opcode values MUST NOT be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">A data frame MAY be transmitted by either the client or the server at any time after handshake completion and before that host has generated a close message (<a href="#closeframe">Section 4.5.1</a>).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> Client-to-Server Masking</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">The client MUST mask all frames sent to the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">The masking-key is contained completely within the frame.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">The masking-key is a 32-bit value chosen at random by the client.  The masking-key MUST be derived from a strong source of entropy, and the masking-key for a given frame MUST NOT make it simple for a server to predict the masking-key for a subsequent frame.</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.9"></div>
<pre>
  masked-frame  = masking-key masked-data
  masking-key = 4full-octet
  masked-data   = *full-octet
  full-octet    = %x00-FF
            
          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">Each masked frame consists of a 32-bit masking-key followed by masked-data: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">The masked-data is the clear-text frame "encrypted" using a simple XOR cipher as follows.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.6">Octet i of the masked-data is the XOR of octet i of the clear text frame with octet i modulo 4 of the masking-key:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.10"></div>
<pre>
  j              = i MOD 4

          </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.7">When preparing a masked-frame, the client MUST pick a fresh masking-key uniformly at random from the set of allowed 32-bit values.

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">When the user agent is to <strong>establish a WebSocket connection</strong> to a WebSocket URL /url/, it must meet the following requirements. In the following text, we will use terms from <a href="#ws_urls">Section 3</a> such as "/host/" and "/secure/ flag" as defined in that section.  </p>

<ol>
<li>The WebSocket URL and its components MUST be valid according to <a href="#valid_ws_urls">Section 3.3</a>. If any of the requirements are not met, the client MUST fail the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.</li>
<li>If the user agent already has a WebSocket connection to the remote host (IP address) identified by /host/, even if known by another name, the user agent MUST wait until that connection has been established or for that connection to have failed. If multiple connections to the same IP address are attempted simultaneously, the user agent MUST serialize them so that there is no more than one connection at a time running through the following steps.  <br><br> If the user agent cannot determine the IP address of the remote host (for example because all communication is being done through a proxy server that performs DNS queries itself), then the user agent MUST assume for the purposes of this step that each host name refers to a distinct remote host, but should instead limit the total number of simultaneous connections that are not established to a reasonably low number (e.g., in a Web browser, to the number of tabs the user has open).  <br><br> NOTE: This makes it harder for a script to perform a denial of service attack by just opening a large number of WebSocket connections to a remote host. A server can further reduce the load on itself when attacked by making use of this by pausing before closing the connection, as that will reduce the rate at which the client reconnects.  <br><br> NOTE: There is no limit to the number of established WebSocket connections a user agent can have with a single remote host.  Servers can refuse to connect users with an excessive number of connections, or disconnect resource-hogging users when suffering high load.</li>
<li>
<em>Proxy Usage</em>: If the user agent is configured to use a proxy when using the WebSocket protocol to connect to host /host/ and/or port /port/, then the user agent SHOULD connect to that proxy and ask it to open a TCP connection to the host given by /host/ and the port given by /port/.  <ul class="empty">
<li>EXAMPLE: For example, if the user agent uses an HTTP proxy for all traffic, then if it was to try to connect to port 80 on server example.com, it might send the following lines to the proxy server: <br><br> </li>
<li>If there was a password, the connection might look like: <br><br> </li>
</ul>
<p> If the user agent is not configured to use a proxy, then a direct TCP connection SHOULD be opened to the host given by /host/ and the port given by /port/.  </p>
<br><br> NOTE: Implementations that do not expose explicit UI for selecting a proxy for WebSocket connections separate from other proxies are encouraged to use a SOCKS proxy for WebSocket connections, if available, or failing that, to prefer the proxy configured for HTTPS connections over the proxy configured for HTTP connections.  <br><br> For the purpose of proxy autoconfiguration scripts, the URL to pass the function must be constructed from /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and the /secure/ flag using the steps to construct a WebSocket URL.  <br><br> NOTE: The WebSocket protocol can be identified in proxy autoconfiguration scripts from the scheme ("ws:" for unencrypted connections and "wss:" for encrypted connections).</li>
<li>If the connection could not be opened, either because a direct connection failed or because any proxy used returned an error, then the user agent MUST fail the WebSocket connection and abort the connection attempt.</li>
<li>If /secure/ is true, the user agent MUST perform a TLS handshake over the connection. If this fails (e.g. the server's certificate could not be verified), then the user agent MUST fail the WebSocket connection and abort the connection. Otherwise, all further communication on this channel MUST run through the encrypted tunnel. <a href="#RFC2246">[RFC2246]</a> <br><br> User agents MUST use the Server Name Indication extension in the TLS handshake. <a href="#RFC4366">[RFC4366]</a>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">Once a connection to the server has been established (including a connection via a proxy or over a TLS-encrypted tunnel), the client MUST send a handshake to the server. The handshake consists of an HTTP upgrade request, along with a list of required and optional headers.  The requirements for this handshake are as follows.  </p>

<ol>
<li>The handshake must be a valid HTTP request as specified by <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a>.</li>
<li>The Method of the request MUST be GET and the HTTP version MUST be at least 1.1.  <br><br> For example, if the WebSocket URL is "ws://example.com/chat", The first line sent SHOULD be "GET /chat HTTP/1.1"</li>
<li>The request must contain a "Request-URI" as part of the GET method. This MUST match the /resource name/ <a href="#ws_urls">Section 3</a>.</li>
<li>The request MUST contain a "Host" header whose value is equal to the authority component of the WebSocket URL.</li>
<li>The request MUST contain an "Upgrade" header whose value is equal to "websocket".</li>
<li>The request MUST contain a "Connection" header whose value is equal to "Upgrade".</li>
<li>The request MUST include a header with the name "Sec-WebSocket-Key". The value of this header MUST be a nonce consisting of a randomly selected 16-byte value that has been base64-encoded <a href="#RFC3548">[RFC3548]</a>. The nonce MUST be randomly selected randomly for each connection. <br><br> NOTE: As an example, if the randomly selected value was the sequence of bytes 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0a 0x0b 0x0c 0x0d 0x0e 0x0f 0x10, the value of the header would be "AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEC=="</li>
<li>The request MUST include a header with the name "Sec-WebSocket-Origin" if the request is coming from a browser client. If the connection is from a non-browser client, the request MAY include this header if the semantics of that client match the use-case described here for browser clients.  The value of this header MUST be the ASCII serialization of origin of the context in which the code establishing the connection is running, and MUST be lower-case.  The value MUST NOT contain letters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (i.e. LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) <a href="#I-D.ietf-websec-origin">[I-D.ietf-websec-origin]</a>.  <br><br> As an example, if code is running on www.example.com attempting to establish a connection to ww2.example.com, the value of the header would be "http://www.example.com".</li>
<li>The request MUST include a header with the name "Sec-WebSocket-Version". The value of this header must be 5.  </li>
<li>The request MAY include a header with the name "Sec-WebSocket-Protocol". If present, this value indicates the subprotocol(s) the client wishes to speak.

<div id="#rfc.figure.15"></div>
<pre>
      extension-list = 1#extension
      extension = extension-token *( ";" extension-param )
      extension-token = registered-token | private-use-token

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">Note that like other HTTP headers, this header may be split or combined across multiple lines. Ergo, the following are equivalent:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.16"></div>
<pre>
      Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: foo
      Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: bar; baz=2

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.4">Any extension-token used must either be a registered token (registration TBD), or have a prefix of "x-" to indicate a private-use token. The parameters supplied with any given extension MUST be defined for that extension. Note that the client is only offering to use any advertised extensions, and MUST NOT use them unless the server accepts the extension.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.5">Note that the order of extensions is significant. Any interactions between multiple extensions MAY be defined in the documents defining the extensions. In the absence of such definition, the interpretation is that the headers listed by the client in its request represent a preference of the headers it wishes to use, with the first options listed being most preferable. The extensions listed by the server in response represent the extensions actually in use. Should the extensions modify the data and/or framing, the order of operations on the data should be assumed to be the same as the order in which the extensions are listed in the server's response in the opening handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.6">For example, if there are two extensions "foo" and "bar", if the header |Sec-WebSocket-Extensions| sent by the server has the value "foo, bar" then operations on the data will be made as bar(foo(data)), be those changes to the data itself (such as compression) or changes to the framing thay may "stack".</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> Security considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">While this protocol is intended to be used by scripts in Web pages, it can also be used directly by hosts. Such hosts are acting on their own behalf, and can therefore send fake "Origin" fields, misleading the server. Servers should therefore be careful about assuming that they are talking directly to scripts from known origins, and must consider that they might be accessed in unexpected ways. In particular, a server should not trust that any input is valid.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">EXAMPLE: For example, if the server uses input as part of SQL queries, all input text should be escaped before being passed to the SQL server, lest the server be susceptible to SQL injection.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">Servers that are not intended to process input from any Web page but only for certain sites should verify the "Origin" field is an origin they expect, and should only respond with the corresponding "Sec-WebSocket-Origin" if it is an accepted origin. Servers that only accept input from one origin can just send back that value in the "Sec-WebSocket-Origin" field, without bothering to check the client's value.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.6">If at any time a server is faced with data that it does not understand, or that violates some criteria by which the server determines safety of input, or when the server sees a handshake that does not correspond to the values the server is expecting (e.g. incorrect path or origin), the server should just disconnect. It is always safe to disconnect.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.8">The biggest security risk when sending text data using this protocol is sending data using the wrong encoding. If an attacker can trick the server into sending data encoded as ISO-8859-1 verbatim (for instance), rather than encoded as UTF-8, then the attacker could inject arbitrary frames into the data stream.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.9.p.3">The |Sec-WebSocket-Version| header is used in the WebSocket handshake. It is sent from the client to the server to indicate the protocol version of the connection. This enables servers to correctly interpret the handshake and subsequent data being sent from the data, and close the connection if the server cannot interpret that data in a safe manner.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11">
<a href="#rfc.section.11">11.</a> Using the WebSocket protocol from other specifications</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">The WebSocket protocol is intended to be used by another specification to provide a generic mechanism for dynamic author-defined content, e.g. in a specification defining a scripted API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">Such a specification first needs to "establish a WebSocket connection", providing that algorithm with: </p>

<ul>
<li>The destination, consisting of a /host/ and a /port/.</li>
<li>A /resource name/, which allows for multiple services to be identified at one host and port.</li>
<li>A /secure/ flag, which is true if the connection is to be encrypted, and false otherwise.</li>
<li>An ASCII serialization of an origin that is being made responsible for the connection. <a href="#I-D.ietf-websec-origin">[I-D.ietf-websec-origin]</a> </li>
<li>Optionally a string identifying a protocol that is to be layered over the WebSocket connection.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">The /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure/ flag are usually obtained from a URL using the steps to parse a WebSocket URL's components. These steps fail if the URL does not specify a WebSocket.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.4">If a connection can be established, then it is said that the "WebSocket connection is established".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.5">If at any time the connection is to be closed, then the specification needs to use the "close the WebSocket connection" algorithm.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.6">When the connection is closed, for any reason including failure to establish the connection in the first place, it is said that the "WebSocket connection is closed".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.7">While a connection is open, the specification will need to handle the cases when "a WebSocket message has been received" with text /data/.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.8">To send some text /data/ to an open connection, the specification needs to "send /data/ using the WebSocket".</p>
