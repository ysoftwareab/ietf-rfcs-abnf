Abstract

This document describes the format of the data returned by a Time 
Stamp Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it.  
The time stamping service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) as 
one component in building reliable non-repudiation services (see 
[ISONR]).  In order to reduce the amount of trust required of a TSA we
introduce (in Appendix C) the optional Temporal Data Authority (TDA) 
whose function is to provide further corroborating evidence of the time 
contained in the token.  We also give an example of how to place a 
signature at a particular point in time, from which the appropriate 
certificate status information (e.g. CRLs) may be checked.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

In order to associate a datum with a particular point in time, a
Time Stamp Authority (TSA) may need to be used.  This Trusted Third 
Party provides a "proof-of-existence" for this particular datum at an 
 
Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 1

instant in time.  A TSA may also be used when a trusted time reference 
is required and when the local clock available cannot be trusted by all 
parties.  The TSA's role is to time stamp a datum to establish evidence 
indicating the time at which the datum existed.  This can then be used, 
for example, to verify that a digital signature was applied to a message 
before the corresponding certificate was revoked thus allowing a revoked 
public key certificate to be used for verifying signatures created prior 
to the time of revocation.  This is an important public key 
infrastructure operation.  The TSA can also be used to indicate the time 
of submission when a deadline is critical, or to indicate the time of 
transaction for entries in a log.  An exhaustive list of possible uses 
of a TSA is beyond the scope of this document. 

The Temporal Data Authority (TDA) is a TTP that creates a temporal data
token.  (See Appendix C.)  This temporal data token associates a datum 
with a particular event and provides supplementary evidence for the time 
included in the time stamp token.

2. The TSA

The TSA is a TTP that creates time stamp tokens in order to indicate 
that a datum existed at a particular point in time.  

For the remainder of this document a `valid request' shall mean one that
can be decoded correctly, is of the form specified in Section 2.4,
and is from a supported TSA subscriber.

2.1. Requirements of the TSA

The TSA is REQUIRED:
     1. to provide a trusted source of time.
     2. not to include any identification of the requesting entity in 
        the time stamp token.
     3. to include a monotonically incrementing value of the time of day 
        into its time stamp token.
     4. to produce a time stamp token upon receiving a valid request 
        from the requester.
     5. to include within each time stamp token an identifier to 
        uniquely indicate the trust and validation policy under which
        the token was created.
     6. to only time stamp a hash representation of the datum, i.e. a
        data imprint associated with a one-way collision resistant hash-
        function OID.
     7. to examine the OID of the one-way collision resistant hash-
        function and to verify that this function is "sufficient" (see
        Section 2.4). 
     8. not to examine the imprint being time stamped in any way.      
     9. to sign each time stamp token using a key generated exclusively 
        for this purpose and have this property of the key indicated on 
        the corresponding certificate.
    10. to include supplementary temporal information in the time stamp 
        token (from TDA's) if asked by the requester.  If this is not 
        possible, the TSA shall respond with an error message.
    11. to provide a signed receipt (i.e. in the form of an 
        appropriately defined time stamp token) to the requester, where 
        appropriate, as defined by policy.

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 2

2.2. TSA Transactions

As the first message of this mechanism, the requesting entity requests a 
time stamp token by sending a request (which is or includes a 
TimeStampReq, as defined below) to the Time Stamping Authority.  As the 
second message, the Time Stamping Authority responds by sending a 
response (which is or includes a TimeStampToken, as defined below) to 
the requesting entity. 

Upon receiving the token, the requesting entity verifies its validity
by verifying the digital signature in the TimeStampToken and by 
verifying that what was time stamped corresponds to what was requested 
to be time stamped.  The requester SHOULD verify that the TimeStampToken
contains the correct TSA name, the correct data imprint and the correct 
hash algorithm OID.  It SHOULD then verify the timeliness of the 
response by verifying either the time included in the response against a 
local trusted time reference, if one is available, and/or the value of 
the nonce included in the response against the value included in the 
request.  Since the TSA's certificate may have been revoked, the status 
of the certificate SHOULD be checked (e.g. by checking the appropriate 
CRL) to verify that the certificate is still valid.  If 
TemporalDataToken's are included in the TimeStampToken, then these 
SHOULD also be verified as was the TimeStampToken (see Appendix C).  

2.3. Identification of the TSA

The TSA MUST sign all time stamp messages with a key reserved 
specifically for that purpose.  The corresponding certificate MUST 
contain the extended key usage field extension as defined in [RFC2459] 
Section 4.2.1.14 with KeyPurposeID having value id-kp-timeStamping.  
This extension MUST be critical.

2.4. Request and Token Formats

A time stamping request is as follows.

TimeStampReq ::= SEQUENCE  {
     version                      Integer  { v1(0) },
     reqPolicy                    [0] PolicyInformation OPTIONAL,
     tdas                         [1] SEQUENCE OF GeneralName OPTIONAL,
     nonce                        [2] Integer OPTIONAL,
       --MUST be present if messageImprint is not present
     messageImprint               [3] MessageImprint OPTIONAL
       --a hash algorithm OID and the hash value of the data to be
       --time stamped
}


The reqPolicy field, if included, indicates the policy under which the 
TimeStampToken should be provided.  PolicyInformation is defined in 
Section 4.2.1.5 of [RFC2459].

The tdas field identifies those TDAs which are requested to provide 
supplementary temporal evidence in the time stamp token.  (See Appendix 
C.)


Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 3

The messageImprint field MAY be absent in situations where the requester
requires a verifiable source of time that is independent of any 
particular datum.  

MessageImprint ::= SEQUENCE  {
     hashAlgorithm                AlgorithmIdentifier,
     hashedMessage                OCTET STRING  }

The hash algorithm indicated in the hashAlgorithm field MUST be a strong
hash algorithm.  That means that it MUST be one-way and collision 
resistant.  It is up to the Time Stamp Authority to decide whether or 
not the given hash algorithm is "sufficient" (based on the current state 
of knowledge in cryptanalysis and the current state of the art in 
computational resources, for example).  

The hashedMessage field SHOULD contain the hash of the datum to be 
time stamped.  The hash is represented as an OCTET STRING.

The time stamp request does not identify the requester, as this 
information is not validated by the TSA (See Section 2.1).  In 
situations where the TSA requires the identity of the requesting entity, 
it is suggested that alternate identification means be used (e.g. CMS 
encapsulation [CMS] or TLS authentication [RFC2246]).

A TimeStampToken is as follows.  It is encapsulated as a SignedData 
construct [CMS] in the EncapsulatedContentInfo field. 

The signed-data content type from [CMS] shall have ASN.1 type 
SignedData.

SignedData ::= SEQUENCE {
     version                      CMSVersion,
     digestAlgorithms             DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers,
     encapContentInfo             EncapsulatedContentInfo,
     certificates                 [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL,
     crls                         [1] IMPLICIT 
                                    CertificateRevocationLists OPTIONAL,
     signerInfos                  SignerInfos }

SignerInfos ::= SET OF SignerInfo

EncapsulatedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
     eContentType                 ContentType,
     eContent                     [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

The fields of type EncapsulatedContentInfo have the following meanings:

eContentType is an object identifier that uniquely specifies the content 
type. For a time stamping token it is defined as: 
id-ct-TSTInfo  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ct 4}
with:
id-ct          OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 1 }
id-smime       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
                           us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) 16 }

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 4

eContent is the content itself, carried as an octet string.  The 
eContent content type shall have ASN.1 type TSTInfo.

The time stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than the 
signature of the TSA.  In some environments, the CA might not perform a 
proof-of-possession of the private key when issuing certificates.  In 
these instances, either the certificate of the TSA, or the certificate 
issuer and serial number shall be included as a signed attribute.

id-ct    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 1 }
id-smime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
            us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) 16 }

TSTInfo ::= SEQUENCE  {
     version                      Integer  { v1(0) },
     policy                       PolicyInformation,
     status                       PKIStatusInfo,
       --PKIStatus field MUST have value 0 for a valid token
     tsa                          [0] GeneralName OPTIONAL,
     tstTime                      TSTTime,
     tdaTokens                    [1] SEQUENCE OF TemporalDataToken 
                                    OPTIONAL,
     nonce                        [2] Integer OPTIONAL,
       --MUST be present if the token was produced in response to a 
       --TimeStampReq and the nonce was present in the TimeStampReq
       --this field MUST have the same value as the similar field
       --in TimeStampReq
     messageImprint               [3] MessageImprint OPTIONAL,
       --MUST be present if the similar field in TimeStampReq is
       --present
       --MUST have the same value as the similar field in
       --TimeStampReq                             
     serialNumber                 [4] Integer OPTIONAL,
     tsaFreeData                  [5] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
       --contains supplementary information from the TSA
}

TSA services MAY produce "signed times" which are timestamp tokens that 
do not contain a nonce or message imprint and are thus not linked to any 
request.  These tokens could be made available, for example, on a web 
site to anyone wishing to obtain them.

PKIStatusInfo is defined in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC2510]. A valid time 
stamp token will always have value 0 (granted) in the PKIStatus field of 
PKIStatusInfo.  If the PKIStatus field has value `waiting' (3), then 
this token is a receipt, as defined in Section 2.1.  Otherwise, the 
status field is present to indicate whether or not the time stamping 
request was fulfilled and, if not, the reason it was rejected. Since not 
all environments will require the use of receipts, support for the value 
`waiting' is OPTIONAL.

PKIFailureInfo ::= BITSTRING  {
    badAlg           (0), 
      -- unrecognized or unsupported Algorithm Identifier
    badRequest       (2),
      -- transaction not permitted or supported

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 5

    badDataFormat    (5),
      -- the data submitted has the wrong format
    timeNotAvailable (14),
      -- the TSAs time source is not available
    tdaNotAvailable  (15),
      -- at least one of the TDAs that were requested isn't available
}

These are the only values of PKIFailureInfo that are supported.  
Compliant servers MUST NOT produce any other values.  Compliant clients 
MAY ignore any other values.

The statusString field of PKIStatusInfo MAY be used to include reason
text such as "messageImprint field is not correctly formatted".

When issuing an error response with PKIFailureInfo having value 
timeNotAvailable (14) then the TSA MAY place any value (e.g. a random 
value, the closest approximation available, or a fixed value) in the 
tstTime field of TSTInfo.  Upon receiving such an error response a 
client MUST not trust the time contained in the tstTime field.

The purpose of the tsa field is to identify the name of the TSA.  If 
present, it MUST correspond to one of the subject names included in the 
certificate that is to be used to verify the token.  This field MAY be 
omitted if the Signing Certificate Attribute has been included as a 
signed attribute.  (See Section 5 of [ESS].)  It MUST be present if the 
ESSCertID Attribute is not used to identify the TSA.

TemporalDataToken is defined in Appendix C of this document.  The
tdaTokens field contains the supplementary evidence requested in the 
TimeStampReq. 

TSTTime ::= SEQUENCE  {
    genTime                       GeneralizedTime,
    fractionOfSecond              INTEGER  -- 32 bits
    precision                     INTEGER  -- 8 bits 
}

GeneralizedTime shall be used as described in [RFC2459] Section 
4.1.2.5.2.  GeneralizedTime only represents time with one second 
granularity.  The integer used for the fractionOfSecond field MUST be
monotonically increasing within the second regardless of the value the 
precision field indicates.  The precision field is an 8 bit signed 
integer indicating, in seconds to the nearest power of two, the 
precision of the time used at the instant of signing.  The value MUST 
be rounded to the next larger power of two. A value of zero indicates 
a precision of a second.  A positive value indicates a precision less 
than a second, while a negative value indicates a precision greater than 
a second.  For instance, a 50-Hz (20 ms) or 60-Hz (16.67 ms) power-
frequency clock would be assigned the value -5 (31.25 ms), while a 1000-
Hz (1 ms) crystal-controlled clock would be assigned the value -9 (1.95 
ms).  The fractionOfSecond field is a 32 bit unsigned integer indicating 
the fraction of second; i.e. with the most significant bit indicating 
500 ms, the second 250 ms, and so on.

The serialNumber field, if present, shall include a strictly 

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 6

monotonically increasing Integer from one TimeStampToken to the next.
This will guarantee that each token is unique and provides for 
additional auditing capabilities.

There may be situations where the TSA MAY wish to include supplementary
non-time stamp related information in the time stamp token (e.g. billing
information, usage statistics, etc.).  The format of this information is 
TSA dependant and the value MAY be placed in the tsafreedata field as an 
OCTET STRING.  Conformant clients MAY ignore this field, if present.

3. Transports

There is no mandatory transport mechanism for TSA messages in this 
document.  All mechanisms described below are optional.

3.1. File Based Protocol

A file containing a time stamp message MUST contain only the DER 
encoding of one TSA message, i.e. there MUST be no extraneous header or 
trailer information in the file.

Such files can be used to transport time stamp messages using for 
example, FTP.

3.2. Socket Based Protocol

The following simple TCP-based protocol is to be used for transport
of TSA messages. This protocol is suitable for cases where an 
entity initiates a transaction and can poll to pick up the results.

The protocol basically assumes a listener process on a TSA
which can accept TSA messages on a well-defined port (port number
XXX). Typically an initiator binds to this port and submits the
initial TSA message. The responder replies with a TSA message and/or 
with a reference number to be used later when polling for the actual TSA 
message response.

If a number of TSA response messages are to be produced for a given
request (say if a receipt must be sent before the actual token can be 
produced) then a new polling reference is also returned.

When the final TSA response message has been picked up by the
initiator then no new polling reference is supplied.

The initiator of a transaction sends a "direct TCP-based TSA message"
to the recipient. The recipient responds with a similar message.

A "direct TCP-based TSA message" consists of:

         length (32-bits), flag (8-bits), value (defined below)

The length field contains the number of octets of the remainder of
the message (i.e., number of octets of "value" plus one).  All 32-bit
values in this protocol are specified to be in network byte order.



Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 7

    Message name   flag     value
    tsaMsg         '00'H    DER-encoded TSA message
      -- TSA message
    pollRep        '01'H    polling reference (32 bits),
                            time-to-check-back (32 bits)
      -- poll response where no TSA message response ready; use polling
      -- reference value (and estimated time value) for later polling
    pollReq        '02'H    polling reference (32 bits)
      -- request for a TSA message response to initial message
    negPollRep     '03'H    '00'H
      -- no further polling responses (i.e., transaction complete)
    partialMsgRep  '04'H    next polling reference (32 bits),
                            time-to-check-back (32 bits),
                            DER-encoded TSA message
      -- partial response (receipt) to initial message plus new polling 
      -- reference (and estimated time value) to use to get next part of 
      -- response
    finalMsgRep    '05'H    DER-encoded TSA message
      -- final (and possibly sole) response to initial message
    errorMsgRep    '06'H    human readable error message
      -- produced when an error is detected (e.g., a polling reference 
      -- is received which doesn't exist or is finished with)

The sequence of messages which can occur is:
a) entity sends tsaMsg and receives one of pollRep, negPollRep,
partialMsgRep or finalMsgRep in response. 
b) end entity sends pollReq message and receives one of negPollRep, 
partialMsgRep,finalMsgRep or errorMsgRep in response.

The "time-to-check-back" parameter is a 32-bit integer, defined to be
the number of seconds which have elapsed since midnight, January 1,
1970, co-ordinated universal time.  It provides an estimate of the
time that the end entity should send its next pollReq.

3.3. Time Stamp Protocol Using E-mail

This section specifies a means for conveying ASN.1-encoded messages 
for the protocol exchanges described in Section 2 and Appendix C via 
Internet mail. 

A simple MIME object is specified as follows.

   Content-Type: application/timestamp
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

   <<the ASN.1 DER-encoded Time Stamp message, base64-encoded>>

This MIME object can be sent and received using common MIME processing 
engines and provides a simple Internet mail transport for Time Stamp 
messages.

3.4. Time Stamp Protocol via HTTP

This subsection specifies a means for conveying ASN.1-encoded messages
for the protocol exchanges described in Section 2 and Appendix C via the 
HyperText Transfer Protocol.

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                   Page 8


A simple MIME object is specified as follows.

Content-Type: application/timestamp

   <<the ASN.1 DER-encoded Time Stamp message>>


This MIME object can be sent and received using common HTTP processing
engines over WWW links and provides a simple browser-server transport
for Time Stamp messages.

4. Security Considerations

This entire document concerns security considerations.

When designing a TSA/TDA service, the following considerations have been 
identified that have an impact upon the validity or "trust" in the time 
stamp token.

     1. When there is a reason to believe that the TSA/TDA can no longer
        be trusted, the authority's certificate MUST be revoked and 
        placed on the appropriate CRL.  Thus, at any future time the 
        tokens signed with the corresponding key will not be valid.
     2. The TSA/TDA private key is compromised and the corresponding 
        certificate is revoked.  In this case, any token signed by the 
        TSA/TDA using that private key cannot be trusted.  For this 
        reason, it is imperative that the TSA/TDA's private key be 
        guarded with proper security and controls in order to minimize 
        the possibility of compromise.  In case the private key does 
        become compromised, an audit trail of all tokens generated by
        the TSA/TDA MAY provide a means to discriminate between genuine 
        and false backdated tokens.
     3. The TSA/TDA signing key MUST be of a sufficient length to allow 
        for a sufficiently long lifetime.  Even if this is done, the key 
        will have a finite lifetime.  Thus, any token signed by the 
        TSA/TDA SHOULD be time stamped again (if authentic copies of old
        CRLs are available) or notarized (if they aren't) at a later 
        date to renew the trust that exists in the TSA/TDA's signature. 
        Time stamp tokens could also be kept with an Evidence Recording
        Authority to maintain this trust
     4. An application using the TSA/TDA service SHOULD be concerned     
        about the amount of time it is willing to wait for a response.  
        A `man-in-the-middle' attack can introduce delays.  Thus, any 
        TimeStampToken that takes more than an acceptable period of time
        SHOULD be considered suspect.
     5. In certain circumstances, a TSA/TDA may not be able to 
        produce a valid response to a request (for example, if it is 
        unable to compute signatures for a period of time).  In these 
        situations the TSA/TDA MUST wait until it is again able to 
        produce a valid response before responding, if this is possible.  
        If this is not possible, it MUST ignore the requests and not 
        respond.  Under no circumstances shall a TSA/TDA produce an 
        unsigned response to a request.  Doing so would make denial-of-
        service attacks easier since the attacker could repeatedly 
        respond with unsigned error messages.

     6. A CA shall normally conduct a test for proof of possession for 
        each user's signing private key (including the TSA/TDA signing 
        private key). However, in some environments, the CA might not 
        perform a proof-of-possession of the private key when issuing 
        certificates. In these instances, in order to prevent certain
        attacks and to properly check the validity of the binding 
        between an end entity and a key pair, a certificate identifier 
        of the TSA/TDA shall be included as a signed attribute.

APPENDIX A - Storage of Data and Token

A time stamp token is meaningless without its associated data.  Thus, a 
method is required to allow users to store the data and token together 
securely.  They MAY be stored as a PKCS #7 SignedData object as 
described in [CMS].  That is, the contentType is signedData and 
contentInfo is Data, which contains the datum associated with the time 
stamp token.  The SignedData object is signed by the person storing the 
data and token.  This signature is to be used only for storage and for
verifying the integrity of the token and data. Anyone using the token 
and data at some future time must verify the data and token at that 
time.  This is just a method for keeping the two pieces of information 
together, with some integrity.  

For this purpose, we define a PKCS #9 [PKCS9] time stamp token attribute 
type.  This attribute type specifies the time stamp token, which MUST be 
included as a signed attribute of the SignedData object.  The time stamp 
token attribute type has ASN.1 type TimeStampToken (as defined in 
Section 2.4 of this document).  A time stamp token attribute MUST have a 
single attribute value.

The object identifier id-aa-timeStampToken identifies the time stamp 
token attribute type.

id-aa-timeStampToken     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa 13 }
id-aa   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 2 }

APPENDIX B - Placing a Signature At a Particular Point in Time

We present an example of a possible use of this general time stamping
service. It places a signature at a particular point in time, from 
which the appropriate certificate status information (e.g. CRLs) MUST be 
checked.  This application is intended to be used in conjunction with 
evidence generated using a digital signature mechanism. 

Signatures can only be verified according to a non-repudiation policy. 
This policy MAY be implicit or explicit (i.e., indicated in the 
evidence provided by the signer). The non-repudiation policy can 
specify, among other things, the time period allowed by a signer to 
declare the compromise of a signature key used for the generation of 
digital signatures. Thus a signature may not be guaranteed to be valid 
until the termination of this time period.  

To verify a signature that incorporates an untrusted time, the following 
basic technique may be used: 

A) Time stamping information needs to be obtained by the signer or 
a verifier.
     1) The signature is presented to the Time Stamping Authority (TSA).  
        The TSA then returns a TimeStampToken (TST) upon that signature.
     2) The invoker of the service must then verify that the 
        TimeStampToken is correct.

B) The validity of the evidence must be verified :
     1) The date/time indicated by the signer in the signature shall be 
        compared with the date/time in the TST. If they are not close 

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                  Page 13

        enough (e.g., less than a few hours) the evidence is considered 
        to be invalid.  
     2) The certificate included in the signed message should be 
        verified to be valid at the time of the signature. It must 
        first be verified and then the appropriate CRL must be 
        checked.

The signature has now been placed at a particular point in time.  The
appropriate CRLs or other certificate status information mechanism MAY 
be examined to determine the validity of the signature at that time.

Appendix C - The TDA

The Temporal Data Authority is a TTP that creates a temporal data
token.  This temporal data token associates a datum with a particular
event and provides supplementary evidence for the time included in the
time stamp token.  For example, a TDA could associate the datum with
the most recent closing value of the Dow Jones Average.  The temporal 
data with which the datum is associated SHOULD be unpredictable in 
order to prevent forward dating of tokens.  Authentic values of this 
data SHOULD also be available from a large number of trustworthy sources
in order to make collusion or corruption of data more difficult.  For a 
list of possible types of temporal data, see Appendix D.

C.1. Requirements of the TDA

The TDA is REQUIRED:
     1. to only provide a trusted source of temporal data.
     2. not to examine the imprint being time stamped. 
     3. to include the current data associated with a specific 
        unpredictable event in each temporal data token.
     4. to produce a temporal data token upon receiving a valid request
        from the TSA.
     5. to only produce a temporal data token on a hash representation 
        of the datum. 
     6. to sign each temporal data token using a key generated 
        exclusively for this purpose and have this property of the key 
        indicated on the corresponding certificate.

C.2. TDA Transactions

As the first message of this mechanism, the TSA requests a temporal data 
token by sending a request (which is or includes a TemporalDataReq, as 
defined below) to the TDA.  As the second message, the TDA responds by 
sending a response (which is or includes a TemporalDataToken, as defined 
below) to the TSA. 

C.3. Verifying a TemporalDataToken

The TSA is REQUIRED to verify the structure of the TemporalDataToken.  
It MUST verify the digital signature in the TemporalDataToken and also 
verify that what was signed corresponds to what was requested to be 
signed.  The requester SHOULD verify that the TemporalDataToken contains 
the correct TDA name, the correct data imprint and the correct hash 
algorithm OID.  It SHOULD also verify the timeliness of the response by 
verifying the value of the nonce included in the response against the

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                  Page 14

value included in the request (exact match needed). Since the TDA's 
certificate MAY have been revoked, the status of the certificate SHOULD 
be checked (e.g. by checking the appropriate CRL) to verify that the 
certificate is still valid.

In order to verify the TemporalData inside a TemporalDataToken, it is 
necessary to know the form of the temporal data that the TDA has 
included in the token.

The TSA is not required to verify the TemporalData. However, either the 
entity requesting a Time Stamping Token or an entity verifying a Time 
Stamping Token containing temporal information MAY be interested in such 
a verification.

In the first case, it is unlikely that the temporal information will be 
available ahead of time and thus the entity requesting a Time Stamping 
Token MAY need to enter into an online protocol with the TDA, or some 
other entity, to obtain it. A secure link with that trusted source MAY 
be necessary, i.e. the communication channel or the information itself 
must be authenticated and integrity protected.  Such a protocol is TDA 
dependent and is outside the scope of this document.

In the second case, if the verification occurs some time after the Time 
Stamping Token has been produced, then it is possible to rely on an 
authentic source (e.g. a newspaper or a CD-ROM) to verify it against. 
The exact method of verification is TDA dependent and is thus outside 
the scope of this document.

C.4. Identification of the TDA

The TDA MUST sign all temporal data tokens with a key reserved 
specifically for that purpose.  The corresponding certificate MUST 
contain the extended key usage field extension as defined in [RFC2459] 
Section 4.2.1.14 with KeyPurposeID having value 
id-kp-temporalDataAuthority.  This extension MUST be critical.

id-kp-temporalDataAuthority    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-kp  9}
  -- Providing temporal data in support of time stamping services.  Key 
  -- usage bits that may be consistent:  digitalSignature, 
  -- nonRepudiation

C.5. Request and Token Formats

A temporal data request from a TSA is as follows.

TemporalDataReq ::= SEQUENCE  {
     version                      Integer  { v1(0) },
     nonce                        [0] Integer OPTIONAL,
       --MUST be present if the TimeStampToken being produced
       --is in response to a TimeStampReq which contains a nonce
       --MUST be the same value as the corresponding field in
       --TimeStampReq





Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                  Page 15

     messageImprint               [1] MessageImprint OPTIONAL
       --MUST be present if the similar field in TimeStampReq is
       --present
       --a hash of the data to be time stamped, MUST be the same
       --value as the corresponding field in TimeStampReq             
}

A TemporalDataToken is as follows.  It is encapsulated as a SignedData 
construct [CMS].  The content is of type TDTInfo.

TemporalDataToken ContentInfo  ::= SEQUENCE  {
     contentType                  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
       --{pkcs-7 2}, SignedData
     content                  [0] SEQUENCE  {
       version                      INTEGER,
       digestAlgorithms             AlgorithmIdentifier,
       contentInfo                  SEQUENCE  {
         contentType                  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           --{id-ct 5}, id-ct-TDTInfo
         content                      TDTInfo  }
       certificate               [0] Certificate,
       signerInfos                   SignerInfos  }  }

The temporal data token must not contain any signatures other than the 
signature of the TDA. In some environments, the CA might not perform a 
proof-of-possession of the private key when issuing certificates.  In 
these instances, either the certificate of the TDA, or the certificate 
issuer and serial number shall be included as a signed attribute.

TDTInfo ::= SEQUENCE  {
     version                      Integer  { v1(0) },
     tda                          [0] GeneralName OPTIONAL,
     nonce                        [1] Integer OPTIONAL,
       --MUST be present if the similar field in TemporalDataReq is 
       --present
       --MUST have the same value as the corresponding field in 
       --TemporalDataReq
     temporalData                 TemporalData,
     messageImprint               [2] MessageImprint OPTIONAL,
       --MUST be present if the similar field in TemporalDataReq is 
       --present
       --MUST have the same value as the corresponding field in
       --TemporalDataReq                             
     serialNumber                 [3] Integer OPTIONAL
}

The temporalData field contains the actual temporal data that will
be used as substantiating evidence in the time stamp token.

TemporalData ::= SEQUENCE {
     format                        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
     rawdata                       ANY DEFINED BY format }

The serialNumber field, if present, shall include a strictly 
monotonically increasing Integer from one TemporalDataToken to the next.
This will guarantee that each token is unique.

Adams, Cain, Pinkas, Zuccherato                                  Page 16

The purpose of the tda field is to identify the name of the TDA.  If 
present, it MUST correspond to one of the subject names included in the 
certificate that is to be used to verify the token.  This field MAY be 
omitted if the Signing Certificate Attribute has been included as an 
authenticated attribute.  (See Section 5 of [ESS].)  It MUST be present 
if the Signing Certificate Attribute is not used to identify the TDA.
