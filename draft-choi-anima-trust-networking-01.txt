       Abstract 

       This document describes trust networking as an application of 
       autonomic networking. The objective of trustworthy autonomic 
       networking is providing trust networking environment where all 
       autonomic nodes can communicate without any security concern. It 
       defines a trust networking domain and describes how to configure and 
       maintain the trust networking domain. While communication within the 
       trust networking domain is done with trust, the communication with 
       external nodes should be done via a specific autonomic service agent 
       (ASA) called "trust gateway". The trust gateway ASA performs trust 
       evaluation of the external nodes and enforces domain specific 
       policies to keep the domain trustworthy.

    1. Introduction 

       The document describes the concept of trust networking as an 
       application of Autonomic Networking Architecture. It defines a trust 
       networking domain in compliance with reference model of autonomic 
       networking. By definition of autonomic domain [rfc7575 Autonomic 
       Networking Definitions and Design Goals] the trust networking domain 
       is defined as a collection of autonomic nodes which trust other 
       nodes in the same trust networking domain. That means, 
       communications within the trust networking domain with sufficient 
       trust level can be done without any further security concerns. For 
       example, assume that a subnet properly protected from external 
       threats and all nodes in the subnet are verified through trust 
       evaluation procedures, then the communications within the subnet can 
       be done with confidence that nodes do no harm to each other. 

       This document first defines a trust networking domain and then 
       describes how to configure the trust networking domain and keep the 
       domain trustworthy. This document also describes a trust networking 
       framework that consists of interconnected trust networking domains. 
       The framework guides how to define the trust networking domain, how 
       to manage members of the domain, how to protect the domain from 
       hostile external world, how to expand the domain, and how to handle 
       communications with external entities. Finally this documents shows 
       how to apply the trust networking framework to the existing IP based 
       network with minor modifications 

        

    2. Background 

       One of the biggest problems in the current Internet is protecting 
       information assets against divergent attacks. In the beginning of

       the Internet, security was not considered to be an essential 
       component of the network architecture but optional solutions such as 
       IPSec were used instead. This section compares the security model of 
       the traditional Internet and our proposed trust model. 

        

    2.1. Security Model and its Limitations 

         The security model of the current Internet is based on the 
       assumption that all traffic coming from the Internet is suspicious. 
       The lack of inherent security in IP protocol has led various attacks, 
       such as attack on confidentiality by intercepting packets, integrity 
       attack by modifying of the contents of packets, authentication 
       attack by identity fabrication, and availability attack by 
       interfering normal communications. In the context of untrusty 
       Internet, each host should protect itself from potential risks of 
       the hostile Internet. This protection usually take place at the 
       final destination as seen in Figure 1. This model operates basically 
       in reactive manner. That means, after receiving all arriving packets, 
       threatening packets can be detected and removed. Detection of 
       threatening packets are based on pre-defined rules extracted from 
       previous attacks.

         The reactive operations of security model result in endless 
       malicious cycle of attacks and defenses. Rules has to be upgraded 
       for every newly discovered attacks and more complicate rules are 
       required as more sophisticate attacks emerge. This model is fatal in 
       the case of devices with limited or no processing power. Also 
       stronger security makes the system weaker in defending DoS (Denial 
       of Service) attacks. 
          
    2.2. Trust Model and Trust Relations 

         In contrast to the security model based on doubt, the trust model 
       is based on the confidence that any entity in the domain is not 
       harmful to other entities and the communication environment within 
       the domain is safe enough. Instead of unlimited connectivity, the 
       trust model restrict connectivity to the limited group of trusted 
       entities. Of course, the limited connectivity can be extended by the 
       domain expansion principle described in Section 3.3. Figure 2 
       illustrates the trust model, which needs 3 requirements: 
       Identification, Trust Relation, and Safe Environment.  
         For identification purpose, the trust model uses self-certifying ID 
       (SCID), which provides secure binding between ID and key of an 
       entity. Many future Internet researches already use SCID for 
       accountability or trusted path selection. The trust model assume 
       that every entity has a public key and hash of the public key is 
       defined as the ID of the entity. This ID can be used in validity 
       check of claimed key against actual public key of the entity. The 
       valid public key is basis of further identity verification. After 
       identification the entity check trust relation with the peer entity 
       so that only trusted entity is allowed to communicate.

                               Figure 2. Trust Model 
     
         The trust relation used in the trust model is assumed to be 
       reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Reflexive means that entity A 
       trust itself, denoting as AA. Symmetric relation assumes that two 
       entities A and B satisfy AB and BA at the same time, denoting as 
       AB. Transitive means that for three entities A, B, and C, if AB 
       and BC then A C. If all entities in a given group satisfy all 
       three characteristics, the group is declared as a trust equivalent 
       class. We can easily guess the role of the trust model as formation 
       of a trust equivalent class for the set of entities trusting each 
       other. 
         The trust model should provide safe and reliable communication 
       environment to entities without requiring additional security 
       features on the entities. Thanks to the transitive trust relation, 
       if an external entity is trusted by one member of the domain as a 
       trust equivalence class, other members in that domain also can trust 
       the external entity. By restricting the domain to trusted entities, 
       the environment can be kept safe and reliable. 
          
    2.3. Comparisons of Security and Trust Model  

         The trust model is opposite in almost every aspect as shown in 
       Table 1. First of all, the trust model is based on confidence that 
       entities in a trust networking domain never do harm, while the 
       security model is based on suspicion that adversaries attacks 
       anytime. The relationship in trust model is binary in the sense that 
       an entity trust another specific entity, but relationship in the 
       security model is unary because the entity itself must protect 
       regardless of other entities. With respect of rules, trust model 
       keeps trusted IDs as a white list but security model keeps 
       threatening entities as a black list. Thus, behavior of entities in 
       the trust model is proactive while the security model acts in 
       reactive manner. That leads the policy of the trust model is to 
       prevent risk by communicating only with trusted entities, but policy 
       of the security model monitors all communications to detect and 
       remove threatening actions. The trust model provides mechanisms for

       accepting entities or domains after verifying their trust, while the 
       security model provides mechanisms for watching the traffic and 
       blocking the threatening traffics. As the result, the network space 
       of the trust model starts with a restricted space and incrementally 
       glows as new entities or domains are accepted, while the network 
       space of security model starts as an unrestricted and open space, 
       but the space may be diminished by excluding misbehaving entities.

    3. Trust Networking Framework 

       The purpose of the trustworthy communication framework is to provide 
       safe and reliable environment to entities without requiring 
       additional security features. For keeping the environment 
       trustworthy, the domain accepts only eligible entities. However, 
       this restriction seems contradict to global scalability that 
       requires the domain being open to everyone. Our solution is the 
       incremental strategy, where a domain starts from a small and 
       restricted network space and gradually expands to a global scale

       network space by accepting external entities or collaborating with 
       other domains. This section discusses technical issues on the 
       trustworthy communication framework. 

        

    3.1. Defining Trust Networking Domain 

         A primitive domain can be defined as the network space that is 
       autonomous, isolated, and well protected from external attacks. For 
       example, isolated home or enterprise network can be defined as a 
       domain. If all hosts in the domain are disinfected and communication 
       links are not exposed, the domain can be declared as a trust 
       networking domain. The trust networking domain is not always a 
       physical network space but sometime it can be formed by a logical 
       group of users with mutual trust. In any case, the entities in the 
       domain forms a trust equivalence class and communication with other 
       entities in the domain is allowed without any protection.  
         To keep to domain trustworthy only qualified entities can be 
       accepted as a member of the domain, and misbehaving entities have to 
       be removed from the domain. For maintenance of a domain, the 
       behavior of entities in the domain may be monitored, and if 
       suspicious activities are discovered, the corresponding entity must 
       be removed. 
          
    3.2. Protecting Trust Networking Domain  

         The domain representing an autonomous network space can take role 
       of security unit as well as packet processing unit. The isolated 
       domain from external world does not allow communication with 
       external entities. For opening the domain to untrusty external world, 
       well-defined interfaces are required to protect the domain. Let's 
       call this protected domain an "insulated trust networking domain". 
       As an example of insulated trust networking domain, we can imagine 
       the local area network with firewalls on all links to the external 
       Internet. The local area network is not isolated but is insulated 
       from attacks injected through the external links.  
         The proposed framework assumes that each domain has at least one 
       gateway that performs security functions for the domain. The gateway 
       identifies external entities, evaluate trust level, accepts or 
       rejects the packets according to the trust levels of external 
       entities. And also the gateway will forward only authorized and 
       sterilized packets to peer domain for keeping its reputation or 
       trust level. In the sense that gateways performs security functions 
       on the behalf of the entities inside of the domain, the security of

       entities is said to be delegated to gateways. This delegated 
       security has great benefit in applying complex security functions to 
       devices with a limited or no processing power. 
          
    3.3. Expanding Trust Networking Domain  

         If all communications are limited within a trust networking domain, 
       the serious scalability arises with respect to global communication. 
       Now, we have to consider expansion of trust networking domain, 
       starting from a small trust networking domain to a global scale 
       network. First, consider the situation that an entity outside of 
       domain tries to communicate with an entity inside of the domain. For 
       trustworthy communication across border of domain, the entity must 
       be a member of the domain. The domain gateway performs well-defined 
       procedure for checking identity and evaluating the trust level of 
       the external entity, and then only qualified entities are allowed to 
       communicate with entities in the domain. Also the link connecting 
       the domain with external entities should be secure enough for the 
       trust level. This is one way to expand a domain.

         Expanding a domain by accepting new entities has limitation when 
       reaching the maximum number of entities being managed by a single 
       domain. The other solution is collaboration of domains. Suppose two 
       domains trust each other and those are connected by reliable links, 
       then entities within one domain can trust entities within another 
       domain.  
         Figure 3 shows a trust networking domain with trusted entities and 
       3 ways how to expand the domain. First, new entities can join to the 
       domain after passing trust verification. Second, a remote entity can 
       join to the domain via reliable channel. And third, when two domains 
       may have trust agreement and connected by reliable channel, all 
       entities in one domain can exchange packets in the pre-agreed trust 
       level. 
          
    3.4. Communicating with External Entities  

         As already seen, the communication inside of a domain requires no 
       further security. However, communication with entities outside of 
       the domain needs special care. Assume that all communication with 
       external entities must take place at the special entity called a 
       gateway, which enforce well-defined procedure communication for 
       external entities. As explained in Section 3.3.2, an insulated trust 
       networking domain has one or more gateways to perform trust 
       verification for every packet injected to the domain. 
       When a packet arrives at the gateway of a domain, the gateway first 
       check whether the source ID of the packet is in the trusted ID list. 
       If exists, the packet is accepted. Otherwise, the gateway lookups 
       the trusted domain list to find sending domain of the packet. If the 
       sending domain is in the list, the packet can also be accepted and 
       ID of the packet is saved in the trust ID list. This mean that the 
       gateway believes the trusted sending domain not to send harmful 
       packets. If ID of the packet is not in the trusted ID list nor the 
       sending domain is in the trust networking domain list, then 
       verification procedure for individual ID has to be performed. The 
       procedure is somewhat similar to accepting new entities in the 
       domain. The overall procedure of a gateway is shown in Figure 4.

    4. Differences between trust networking and ANIMA security framework 

       This section describes major differences between the proposed trust 
       autonomic domain (TAD) and ANIMA security framework.  The 
       differences are explained based on a following set of criteria 
       defined in the draft-carpenter-limited-domains-03: domain as a whole, 
       domain members, domain boundary, topology, technology, connection to 
       the Internet, security/trust/privacy model, and operation since our 
       proposed domain and that of ANIMA are kinds of limited domains. 

        

    4.1. Domain as a Whole 

       Networking is a very complex task and traditional way of handling 
       the complexity is layering, where each layer takes a specific role 
       and provides its services to the next higher later. This layering 
       architecture decomposes the whole networking task functions 
       vertically. However, the network in general spans physical or 
       logical regions. Each region may have distinct features, such as 
       different physical media, separate administration, and diverse 
       networking requirement. The concept of domain in this document is 
       defined as the networking region that shares common characteristics 
       and also is distinguished from the rest of the network. Traditional 
       layers cover its own regions implicitly; the physical layer spans 
       the range covering electric signals. The data link covers the range 
       connected by layer 2 bridges, and the network layer covers the whole 
       devices connected by routers, and so on. Instead of implicit regions 
       of the layers, a domain can be defined as any region of the network 
       which is distinguishable from the rest of the network. It can be 
       defined as a region covered by electric signal, a home network owned 
       by a single user, a virtual private network overlaid on the Internet, 
       a social network composed of members. Thus, it can be defined by any 
       layer. 

       In the context of TAD, the domain can be defined by trust. That 
       means all members within a TAD trust each other so that the members 
       can communicate with others without any concern of security. For 
       this, TAD needs to add an additional ASA which performs a role of 
       domain administrator.  Its main functionality is to manage trust 
       policies including allocating trust level to domains and their 
       members.  Domain administrator can extend the functionality of ANIMA 
       MASA or define a new ASA for the purpose of the domain 
       administration.  The details of domain administrator is specified in 
       Section 5 below.

    Internet-Draft  Trust Networking & Procedures for AN      October 2018 
        

    4.2. Individual Nodes (Domain members) 

       As defined in the previous section, the domain covers a specific 
       region of the network, to where a set of nodes belongs. Since a 
       domain shares common characteristics, any node within the domain 
       must be able to communicate with other nodes in the domain. The node 
       as a member of a domain can be host, networking devices, 
       applications depending on the characteristics of the domain. For 
       keeping the same characteristics, a node trying to be a new member 
       of the domain must prove its functionalities to all or a designated 
       member of the domain. Joining to a domain may be accomplished by 
       simply plugging interfaces to the networking device or well-defined 
       interactions enforced by domain administrator. The joining procedure 
       may be implicit when a domain has fixed and permanent members, or 
       explicit in case that a node can join or leave the domain.  

       In the sense of TAD, a node is assumed as a host that has 
       communication functions required by the domain. Since a TAD is 
       defined under the intent of trust, a node should have identifiable 
       and authenticatable ID. TAD utilizes a concept of self-certifying ID. 
       The self-certifying ID can be newly defined.  However, in the 
       context of TDA as an application use case of ANIMA, we can utilize 
       IdevID as a self-certifiable ID and preferably extend IdevID with 
       public key information as an option to ensure the global uniqueness.  

        

    4.3. Domain Boundary 

       Since a domain is a set of nodes that shares common characteristics, 
       only nodes within a domain can communicate. In other words, a node 
       within a domain cannot communicate with nodes outside of the domain. 
       However, we can assume special nodes that belongs multiple domains 
       simultaneously. Let's call a node joining more than two domains a 
       "gateway". A gateway node must be equipped with multiple 
       functionalities, each for the joined domain. The role of gateway is 
       conveying interactions of one domain to other domains. Of course, 
       conveying interaction may include necessary functions such as 
       interpretation, filtering, transformation etc. From outside of a 
       domain, the internals of the domain is hidden and the boundary of 
       the domain composed of gateways are only exposed. All interactions 
       passing the boundary of a domain must performed by at least one of 
       the gateways whose role is to enforce necessary gatewaying 
       procedures.

    Internet-Draft  Trust Networking & Procedures for AN      October 2018 
        

        
       In the context of TAD, all members of a TAD trust each other, but 
       cannot trust nodes outside of the domain. The only way for an 
       internal node to communicate with external nodes is passing through 
       a gateway of the domain. Once the gateway receives communication 
       request from a node outside of the domain, it authenticates the node 
       and evaluates the trustworthiness of the node. If the external node 
       is trustworthy and communication channel between gateway and the 
       node is safe and reliable enough for the domain trust level, the 
       gateway accepts communication and injects the communication possibly 
       with transformation.  Unlike ANIMA which assumes IP based 
       communications by every domains, TAD may allow any networking 
       technology besides IP.  Therefore, a gateway is a mandatory 
       component where the need for it is implicit in ANIMA due to the 
       homogenous nature networking technology used in a domain.  The 
       details of domain gateway functionality is specified in Section 5 
       below. 
        
        
    4.4. Topology 

       As defined in Section 4.1, a domain is a range of network where all 
       members can communicate. The communication can be done in either 
       specific layer protocols or any common functionalities. For example, 
       if domain is defined by local area network, the domain may use local 
       IP addresses, link-local or site-local. For domains defined by 
       virtual network overlaid on global Internet may use global IP 
       addresses with filtering functions. 
        
       As already explained in section 4.3, some special nodes may belong 
       to multiple domains. In this case the range of the domains that 
       involve the same nodes can be viewed as overlapped domains. The node 
       belonging multiple domains should have multiple functionalities, one 
       of each domain. Those functionalities should be separated. We can 
       find similar situation in multi-homed IP host in the Internet, where 
       the host has separate IP addresses, one for each IP address domain.  
        
       In the context of TAD, domains also have self-certifying ID as an 
       ordinary node to become a member of another domain. The domain 
       administrator must take a role of the required procedures of the 
       parent domain such as trust evaluation, join and leave. Also the

    Internet-Draft  Trust Networking & Procedures for AN      October 2018 
        

       gateways must take necessary translation of the interactions when 
       passing the domain boundary. 
        
        
    4.5. Technology 

       In the context of TAD, any technology is allowed for the domain 
       since a domain has its own mechanisms hidden from outside. Apart 
       from the existing Internet using global IP addresses, each domain 
       may use its own routing or forwarding mechanisms, such as Ethernet, 
       MPLS, or Upper-Layer IDs. Only requirement for inter-domain 
       communication is that the gateway must aware of mechanisms for both 
       domain and takes a role of translation. Note that each domain has a 
       domain specific addressing scheme and identification of 
       nodes/domains must be done by globally unique identifier. With 
       global ID a node can join a domain or move from one domain to 
       another. In this case a node acquires a domain specific address when 
       joining the domain. 
        
        
    4.6. Connection to the Internet 

       In the context of TAD, the existing Internet can be viewed as a huge 
       domain with global coverage. Nodes or domains with IP capability can 
       join the global Internet domain as members. Since the existing 
       Internet has no notion of ID, let us assume the global Internet 
       domain top-level domain where every domain can join. Each domain 
       with its specific mechanism can join the global Internet domain 
       permanently or intermittently. The communication from one domain to 
       another domain through the global Internet domain is done by the 
       normal IP communication. However, the gateway of each domain must 
       translate its internal communication mechanism to that of the 
       corresponding IP address communications. More specifically, Inter-
       domain communication is done by global ID and the ID is translated 
       into domain-specific address when passing the domain boundary. This 
       ID based communication may be encapsulated in IP packet when 
       traversing the global Internet domain. To allow this translation, 
       the ID to IP address mapping system must be provided, where IP 
       address is the gateway address of the domain that involves the node

    4.7. Security, Trust and Privacy Model 

       One of implication of a domain is secure protection of the domain 
       internals from the rest of the network. That is members of a domain 
       should be identified, authenticated, and authorized. According to 
       domain's policies, well-defined procedures must be enforced to a 
       node to become a member of the domain. 
        
       In TAD all members of the domain must have the same or higher trust 
       level than the domain requires. That means, whenever a new node 
       tries to be a member of the domain or an external node tries to 
       communicate with an internal node, the domain administrator must 
       authenticate and evaluate the node. Only the node passing the 
       evaluation procedure is allowed to communicate. In this case 
       communication must be done via channels safe and reliable enough for 
       the trust level. In some cases where the channel is not safe nor 
       reliable, the communicating nodes must authenticate or encrypt the 
       traffic. Note that whether the traffic is protected or not depends 
       on the risk level of the channel and trust level of the domain. 
       Unlike the VPN that protects all channels in the same security 
       protocols, channels for a domain are additionally protected only 
       when the risk level of a specific channel is higher than required. 
        
        
    4.8. Operations 

       In addition to trust relation between nodes within a domain, the 
       environment of the domain must be considered. Environment of a 
       domain includes factors affecting domain operation such as 
       communication channels among nodes, operation skills of domain 
       administrator, reliability of devices, etc. To be protected from the 
       rest of networks, a domain should be securely protected from 
       external attacks. 
        
       Since communications within a TAD are carried out on the mutual-
       trust basis, the domain administrator should keep the domain 
       trustworthy by accepting only trusted members, monitoring traffic to 
       detect suspicious behavior, and periodic auditing the logs of domain 
       members, and so on.

    5. Trust networking domain as an application of autonomic networking 

       This section defines what a trust networking domain is and describes 
       how to configure the trust networking domain as an application of 
       autonomic networking solutions. The autonomic nodes with trust 
       networking domain will run with autonomic functions at Reference 
       Model for Autonomic Networking. Autonomic networking infrastructure 
       with trust management functions is capable to configure the trust 
       networking domain. A set of autonomic nodes consists of a trust 
       networking domain, which is configured, and managed by management 
       plane. Within a trust networking domain, the full connectivity among 
       autonomic nodes is securely and stably guaranteed. An autonomic node 
       can easily communicate with other nodes at same trust networking 
       domain. The trust level of autonomic nodes is calculated or assigned 
       by trust evaluation function of management plane.  
       On the other hand, it is possible for autonomic nodes to communicate 
       with different trust networking domains or non-autonomic networks 
       via the trust gateway system, in which the traditional security or 
       certificate mechanisms can be running.

    5.1. Definition of a Trust networking domain 

       A trust networking domain is defined as a collection of autonomic 
       nodes trusting each other. Since all nodes within a trust networking 
       domain maintains certain trust level set by the domain, 
       communications within the domain can be done without any further 
       security concern. However, communications with external node require 
       additional verification phase before the communications actually 
       begin. The verification is performed at the border of the domain, 
       where external nodes are checked if their trust level are 
       sufficiently high for the domain. In the sense that the domain as a 
       collection of node are protected from external world, it seems "zone 
       defense" rather than "individual defense" of the traditional 
       security scheme.  
        
       Figure 5 shows the high-level architectural view of trust networking 
       domain. Autonomic nodes has the interface with management function. 
       Trust management functions define the trusted autonomic nodes 
       according to their trust level. They also define the trust 
       networking domain by grouping or classifying autonomic nodes. At the 
       same trust networking domain, an autonomic node directly 
       communicates with each other. The control and management functions 
       at the trust networking domain are defined at the interfaces between 
       autonomic nodes and management plane. 
       There are trust gateway for an autonomic node to communicate with 
       different trust networking domains or non-autonomic nodes since 
       there is no direct communication path. Trust gateway is used to 
       communicate autonomic nodes with different trust networking domains

       or the non-autonomic nodes. An autonomic node can communicate remote 
       autonomic nodes or non-autonomic nodes through trust gateway. In 
       these cases, the traditional trust evaluation and/or certificate 
       procedures can be applied at trust gateway. Trust evaluation 
       procedure is running by management plane of autonomic networking.

    5.2. Configuration of Trust networking domain 

       A trust networking domain is consisted of a group of autonomic nodes. 
       The network management plane communicates with a list of autonomic 
       nodes to build the trust networking domain. The trust management 
       information database which contains a list of autonomic nodes 
       according to the trust level of each domain is built at the 
       bootstrapping time or at the instance of request.  
        
     
     
    Choi, et,al.          Expires January 13, 2019               [Page 19] 
        
    Internet-Draft  Trust Networking & Procedures for AN      October 2018 
        

       At the bootstrapping time, the management plane securely distributes 
       the trust information of each domain to the corresponding autonomic 
       nodes. The membership management is done by management plane when 
       the autonomic nodes can be joined to or leaved from each trust 
       networking domain.  
       At the instance that an autonomic node request to build a trust 
       networking domain to the management plane, trust management function 
       confirm to build a trust networking domain after completing the 
       proper trust evaluation procedures. 
       If an autonomic node could not continue to be a member of the 
       certain trust networking domain, it notify to management plane for 
       leave. Similarly, if the trust management functions decide that an 
       autonomic node is not relevant to stay in a certain trust networking 
       domain, they notify the corresponding autonomic node for leave and 
       update the trust management information database.  
        
       Within a trust networking domain, an autonomic node can communicate 
       each other without any additional security and certificate procedure. 
       In a case, an autonomic node may register multiple trust networking 
       domains simultaneously. 
        
        
    5.3. Communication between Trusted Autonomic Nodes within a trust 
       networking domain  

       At the same trust networking domain, autonomic nodes directly 
       communicate with each other.  Autonomic nodes can discover other 
       nodes at the same trust networking domain. It requires control or 
       management information between autonomic nodes and 
       control/management plane. It can be pre-configured during 
       bootstrapping. The control information between autonomic nodes can 
       be used to identify the trust networking domain. The autonomic nodes 
       can easily communicate with each other at the same trust networking 
       domain by enabling self-managing capability of autonomic networking. 
       The autonomic service agents can be implemented for trusted 
       communication.

       Autonomic nodes must communicate with autonomic nodes of the 
       different trust networking domain. They also communicate with the 
       non-autonomic nodes. 
       Trust gateway can help that an autonomic node communicate with the 
       autonomic nodes with different trust networking domain or the non-
       autonomic nodes. Some autonomic service agents (ASA) may include the 
       trust gateway functions for communicating autonomic nodes with 
       different trust networking domain, which is in the reference model 
       for Autonomic Networking [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]. 
     

     

    6. Trust Networking in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure 

       This section describes trust networking of autonomic network. Within 
       a trust networking domain, an autonomic node is credited by their 
       trust level from management plane.  
       The trust management plane maintains the trust information tables up 
       to date. The trust management plane is tracking of trust status of 
       each autonomic node as an application of autonomic networking. The 
       trust information table contains the trust information of autonomic 
       nodes based on the trust networking domain. All the interactions 
       between autonomic nodes should be verified according to trust 
       evaluation procedures of management plane.  
        
       The autonomic nodes within the same trust networking domain create 
       and maintain network connectivity without additional complexity. 
       Trust provisioning among autonomic nodes is to exempt any additional 
       processing (like identification, addressing, routing, forwarding, 
       and security, etc.) to maintain autonomic networking within the same 
       trust networking domain. 
        
       The interactions between autonomic nodes are based on the trust 
       evaluation of the trust networking domain. The trust information is 
       used to leverage the direct interactions between autonomic nodes. 
       Trust gateway can help to the interaction of autonomic nodes with 
       different trust networking domains or with non-autonomic nodes. 
        
       The trust management plane is used to handle the trust level of each 
       autonomic node with proper trust evaluation procedure.

    6.1. Identification of Trust networking domain and Trusted Autonomic 
       Node 

       This section describes trust level. An autonomic node can initiate 
       to create their own trust networking domain. The management plane 
       provides that an autonomic node can build the relevant trust 
       networking domain by identifying the corresponding autonomic nodes. 
       Specific policies can be applied to build trust networking domain. 
        
       In a trust networking domain, each autonomic node should be 
       identified by the relevant naming and addressing schemes, which are 
       also compliant with the Reference Model for Autonomic Networking [I-
       D.ietf-anima-reference-model]. Before data exchange, the autonomic 
       nodes obtains the identities (e.g., IP address and port number,

       etc.) of destination nodes and the corresponding trust networking 
       domain. In a case, the MAC address can be also used for 
       identification.  
       The trust management information database is used for the discovery 
       of autonomic nodes at the same trust networking domain. The 
       autonomic nodes with the same trust networking domain may use the 
       relevant identification schemes. In the trust management information 
       database, a list of autonomic nodes are classified into the relevant 
       identification code which indicates the same trust networking domain. 
       The identification code for a trust networking domain may contain 
       name/nickname and number as well as IP address and port number, etc. 
        
    6.2. Discovery of Trust networking domain  

       The trust management information database is used for the discovery 
       of autonomic nodes at the same trust networking domain. Before data 
       exchange, an autonomic node looks up the trust management 
       information database to find the destination autonomic nodes. If the 
       destination node belongs to the same trust networking domain with 
       original autonomic node, it is possible to initiate data exchange. 
        
        
    6.3. Signaling Between Trusted Autonomic Nodes  

       At the same trust networking domain, an autonomic nodes communicate 
       with each other. For data exchange, the autonomic node should 
       discover each other by accessing the trust management information 
       database of management plane.  
       After discovery of destination autonomic node, the signaling 
       protocol like "A Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP)" [I-
       D.ietf-anima-grasp] are needed to initiate data exchange. Within the 
       same trust networking domain, an autonomic node directly 
       communicates with each other after completing signaling procedure, 
       in which the connectivity among autonomic nodes are securely and 
       automatically maintained. The pre-configuration between autonomic 
       nodes can be done during bootstrapping. The autonomic control plane 
       at the Reference Model for Autonomic Networking [I-D.ietf-anima-
       reference-model] can be either implemented to carry signaling 
       protocol. 
       For data exchange with different trust networking domains or non-
       autonomic nodes, the trust gateway provides proper interworking

       functions for data exchange and signaling since there is no direct 
       communication paths between them. The trust gateway provides the 
       relevant control and management information to extend data exchange 
       with different trust networking domains or non-autonomic nodes. The 
       authentication and certificate procedures equivalent with the trust 
       networking domain can be applicable to provide external connectivity.  
        
        
    6.4. Trust Evaluation 

       Trust evaluation of network is the way of calculating trust for 
       networking services. It requires data collection from various 
       sources. Physical data sources are collected from the capability of 
       data processing, storage, and communication through network. In 
       cyber world, logical data sources are software that work on 
       computing algorithm, storage, and networking. In the social world, 
       human produces various data through user interfaces.  
        
       In the physical network, trust can be measured by counting on their 
       trustworthiness of network elements. In the cyber world, software 
       can be accidentally or maliciously altered or destroyed during 
       control, computing, and communicating instances. The unexpected 
       behaviors of software is detected or monitored to evaluate and 
       update their trust level. In the social world, human behaviors can 
       be measured by considering its trustworthiness in terms of ability, 
       honesty and benevolence. Social trust reflects individual human 
       activity. Human interacts with others honestly and kindly so that 
       their trust level is affected by some risks. 
       For trust evaluation, the collected data are categorized into two 
       types of attributes and indicators namely, qualitative and 
       quantitative. Trust index is used to calculate the certain trust 
       level of each network entity. As the results of trust evaluation, 
       trustor finally make a decision. The network management plane 
       provides to calculate the trust level of the network elements from 
       various data sources and store their values to trust management 
       information database.  
        
       The trust management information contains the trust level of 
       autonomic nodes. The interactions inside a trust networking domain 
       are analyzed and accumulated to evaluate the trust level of each 
       node. The trust level of autonomic node is contained at the trust 

     
     
    Choi, et,al.          Expires January 13, 2019               [Page 24] 
        
    Internet-Draft  Trust Networking & Procedures for AN      October 2018 
        

       management information database. All the interactions between 
       autonomic nodes in a same trust networking domain is validated by 
       the trust evaluation procedure.  
        
       The trust evaluation procedure is fed by the following inputs. 
        
         o Pre-provisioned or manually configured by policy or management 
       information 
          
         o Analysis from interactions between autonomic nodes 
          
         o The accumulated history information of trust verifications such 
       as authentication of non-autonomic nodes and validity of application 
       specific transactions. 
         o other unaccepted or unexpected behaviors  
        
       While autonomic nodes communicate with each other, they choose the 
       relevant trust management protocol whether they meet trust 
       requirements in the same trust networking domain or not. Trust 
       management protocol between autonomic nodes and trust management 
       database is needed to check trust evaluation. Trust evaluation 
       procedure between autonomic nodes at same trust networking domain 
       are taken for trust identification.  
       If the prerequisite and pre-configuration procedures are already 
       taken for trust management, simple and light-weight solution can be 
       applicable for communication between autonomic nodes. 
        
        
    7. Procedures for trust networking 

    7.1. Building a trust networking domain 

    7.1.1. Domain initialization 

       To build a new trust networking domain, the domain administrator 
       needs to initiate the functionalities of trust networking domain as 
       follows: 
        
       - Domain administration 
       To initialize a domain with respect to the trust, the domain 
       administrator needs to configure policies of trust and membership. 
       To manage the trust level, the domain administrator sets the

       required trust level of membership with domain policy management 
       (DPM) ASA. The domain administrator can explicitly dedicate a node 
       for trust management functions and trust provisioning. 
        
       - Access & delivery control 
         The nodes that connected outside of the domain should equip trust 
       gateway functions. For IP network case, every node of the domain 
       should assign their gateway to the nodes with trust gateway ASA.

    7.2. Evicting existing node from trust networking domain 

       (Editors' note) This section describes how to evict existing node in 
       trust networking domain including trust management procedures. 
       Further details are for further study. 
        

    7.3. Terminating trust networking domain 

       (Editors' note) This section describes how to terminate trust 
       networking domain including signalling procedures with child nodes 
       (or domains) and parent domains.  Further details are for further 
       study. 
        

    7.4. Communication among trust networking domains  

       This section describes trustworthy communication between nodes 
       within a single trust networking domain and between nodes separated 
       into multiple trust networking domains. 
        

    7.4.1. Trustworthy networking within a single trust networking domain 

       In order for the two hosts to send and receive messages to each 
       other, a networking path must first be established. If two hosts are 
       located in the same domain, they already have trust relationship 
       with each other which means no additional security procedures are 
       needed. 
     
    7.4.2. Trustworthy networking between trust networking domains 

       Two hosts are in different domains. It means that they do not know 
       each other's IP address directly. The domain administrator provides 
       IP address of each hosts for trustworthy networking between two 
       hosts in different domains. If a Host 2 wants to perform trustworthy 
       networking with a Host 1 in other domain, it is possible to 
       establish a networking path between two nodes through interactions 
       between domain administration functions and access and delivery 
       control functions. Figure 10 shows an overview of trustworthy 
       networking between trust networking domains.

           Figure 11. Procedures of trustworthy networking between trust 
                                networking domains 

        

       (1) Host 2 requests IP address of Host 1 to the domain administration 
       ASA 2 through the ID of the host 1; 
       (2) The domain administration ASA 2 requests IP address of the Host 1 
       to the domain administration ASA 1; 
       (3) The domain administration ASA 1 obtains IP address of the Host 1 
       and reply ID and IP address of the Host 1 to domain administration 
       ASA 2, and it replies to Host 2; 
       (4) Host 2 requests a trust level of Host 1 through the domain 
       administration ASA 2; 
       (5) The domain administration ASA 2 checks a trust level of Host 2 
       through the trust information management ASA and requests a trust 
       level of Host 1 to domain administration ASA 1; 
       (6) The domain administration function 1 obtains the trust level of 
       Host 1 through the trust information management ASA and replies it to 
       the domain administration ASA 2, and the result replies to Host 2; 
       (7) The access and delivery control ASA 2 forms a routing path with 
       the access and delivery control function 1 through the ID-based 
       routing ASA; 
       (8) The Host 2 and the Host 1 establish a reliable link through the 
       domain gateway ASA of each trust networking domain; 
       (9) Networking path established between Host 1 and Host 2. 
     

    8. Security Considerations 

      Data exchange between autonomic nodes at the trust networking domain 
      must be secured. The signaling or management protocols for trust 
      identification and discovery of trust networking domain are secure.  
      The control/management plane for trust management is self-protecting. 
      The autonomic node in a trust networking domain should be certified by 
      its identity. The pre-configuration information of autonomic nodes 
      from trust management information database should be certified during 
      bootstrapping time. 
      For data exchange with different trust networking domain or non-
      autonomic network, the trust gateway should be securely implemented. 
      Trust gateway maintains the same trust level for cross-domain 
      applications or interaction with non-autonomic network.
