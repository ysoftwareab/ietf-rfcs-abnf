Abstract

   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC
   8610, is defined to provide data models for data shaped like JSON or
   CBOR.

   Another representation format that is quote popular is the CSV file
   as defined by RFC 4180.

   The present document shows how to use CDDL to provide a data model
   for CSV files.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in
   [RFC4180], is defined to provide data models for data shaped like
   JSON or CBOR.

   Another representation format that is quote popular is the CSV file
   as defined by [RFC4180].

   The present document shows how to use CDDL to provide a data model
   for CSV files.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses terminology from [RFC8610].

2.  CSV generic data model

   The CSV format is defined in [RFC4180].  The generic data model for
   the data in a CSV file can be described in CDDL as:

Internet-Draft                CDDL for CSVs                February 2022


   csv = [?header, *record]
   header = [+header-field]
   record = [+field]
   header-field = text
   field = text

   Note that the elements of this data model describe the interpretation
   of the data after removal of lexical structure such as newlines,
   commas, escape characters, and quotation marks.

   For the purposes of a specific application, the data model level
   structure of each field may be described in a more elaborate way,
   e.g., as a number.  CDDL currently does not have a way to express the
   transformation from the text string in the CSV field to the number
   that this text string represents at the application data model level;
   the usage of anything but "text" for a field therefore MUST be
   accompanied by an instruction how to perform the translation.  As a
   preferred choice, the JSON representation of the data model item, if
   it exists, MAY be chosen by that instruction.

   Since the CSV media type text/csv defaults to us-ascii (see Section 3
   of [RFC4180]), many uses of CSV will need to specify the media type
   parameter charset.  The media type parameter header MAY be used to
   indicate the presence or absence of a header line; if it is not
   given, the grammar MUST NOT be ambiguous about the presence of a
   header (i.e., it MUST be either mandatory or absent).

   Note that the ABNF [STD68] in [RFC4180] does not quite handle the
   case that charset is not us-ascii.  For the purposes of the present
   specification, the ABNF is understood to allow all characters from
   the charset except %x22 and %x2C in TEXTDATA.  For the purposes of
   the present specification, the ABNF rule CRLF is read as:

   CRLF = [CR] LF

   as is hinted in Section 3 of [RFC4180].

3.  Examples

   A simplified CSV form definition of a SID file [I-D.ietf-core-sid]
   might look like this:

   ; header = absent

   SID-File = [meta-record,
               *dependency-record,
               *range-record,
               *item-record]

   meta-record = ["meta",
                  module-name: text,
                  module-revision: empty / text,
                  sid-file-revision: empty / text,
                  description: empty / text]

   dependency-record = ["dep",
                        module-name: text,
                        module-revision: text]

   range-record = ["range",
                   entry-point: uint,
                   size: uint]

   item-record = ["item",
                  namespace: "module" / "identity" / "feature" / "data",
                  identifier: yang-identifier / schema-node-path
                  ; the above probably should say which namespace
                  ; goes with which identifier
                  sid: uint]

   yang-identifier = text .abnf ("yang-identifier" .det id-abnf)
   schema-node-path = text .abnf ("schema-node-path" .det id-abnf)
   id-abnf = '
     schema-node-path = QID *( "/" OQID)
     yang-identifier = ID
     QID = ID ":" ID
     OQID = ID [":" ID]
     ID = I *C
     I = "_" / %x41-5a / %x61-7a
     C = I / %x30-39 / "-" / "."
   '

   empty = ""

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

5.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8610] and [RFC4180] apply.
