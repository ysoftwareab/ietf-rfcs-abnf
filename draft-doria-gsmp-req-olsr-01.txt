Internet Draft     Req. for Optical Support in GSMP        2001-03-02 


1. Overview 

   This draft is intended to describe the required changes to GSMP 
   for support of optical, SONET/SDH, and spatial switching of IP 
   packets and flows. It is uncertain at this point what the mix of 
   implementations will be, but the possibilities include: IP based 
   optical routers, optical label switches, wavelength routers, and 
   optical cross connects.  There are also several different generic 
   models that might be applied to running IP over WDM [1][2]. One 
   item which seems probable, however, is that it will be 
   advantageous to separate the control functions from the data 
   functions in order to provide a more flexible network 
   architecture.[3] 

   In this draft, no position will be taken about the eventual 
   architectural model that will be most appropriate.  The only 
   assumption is that the ability to separate the control mechanisms 
   from the data switching is as useful in GMPLS as it is in current 
   MPLS technology. 

   GSMPv3[6] is well suited for providing the control mechanisms 
   necessary for allowing an IP based controller to direct the 
   activities of an optical switch. In order for GSMP to operate 
   between IP controllers and optical switches and cross connects, 
   support for optical labels and service and resource abstractions 
   must be added to GSMP. 

2. Label Types 

   New labels are needed to identify the entities that are to be 
   switched in the optical fabric.  These are longer than GSMPv3 
   labels as they have physical and structural context.  As 
   GMPLS[1][2] has had very similar requirements for label formats 
   alignment with GMPLS is proposed.  This includes support for: 

      -  Digital Carrier Hierarchy (e.g., DS-1, J-1, E1) 

      -  SONET and SDH Hierarchy (e.g., OC-3, STM-1, VT1.5, VC-12) 

      -  Lambdas 

      -  Fibers 

   GSMP MUST include support for all label types as well as for label 
   hierarchies and label lists as defined by GMPLS[1][2]. 

   Bundles of the above labels SHOULD also be supported (e.g., 5 OC-
   3s)

3. Port and Label Management Issues 

   No changes are currently seen as needed in the port management 
   message. 

   An updated label range message MUST be provided.  There MUST also 
   be support of multiplexing (e.g. no multiplexing, SONET 
   multiplexing, Gigabit Ethernet multiplexing etc). 

4. Statistics messages 

   No changes are currently proposed for the statistics messages to 
   support optical switching. 

5. Configuration Issues 

5.1 Switch Configuration 

   No changes are currently proposed for the switch configuration 
   messages to support optical switching. 

5.2 Port Configuration 

   The port configuration message supplies the controller with the 
   configuration information related to a single port.  In order to 
   handle the specific port types in a WDM switch, extensive 
   additions will need to be made to this command. 

   Port types MUST be added to support the mix of SONET signals that 
   can operate over a single fiber.  Information that MAY need to be 
   conveyed includes[8]: 

          -  wavelengths available on the fiber 

          -  serial bit rate per wavelength 

          -  type of fiber 

5.3 Service Configuration 

   While new capability sets MUST be added to support quality 
   parameters in optical switches, no changes are foreseen to the 
   service configuration message as its role to carry the service 
   information as defined in the applicable service model. The 
   changes related to the service model will be discussed in section 
   6.

6. Service Model Issues 

   While one assumption of using optical media is that bandwidth is 
   plentiful, it should be expected that traffic engineering will be 
   necessary in any case[3].  GSMP provides the means for each 
   connection, or in this each light trail, to be created with 
   specific quality attributes. Capability to control re-timing and 
   re-shaping MUST be added. 

   Currently, the default set of service models in GSMP are all based 
   on the services models defined elsewhere, e.g. the Intserv 
   model[5][7],  the Diffserv[4] model, ATM QoS models and the Frame 
   relay forum QoS models. A determination needs to be made of the 
   applicable quality models for optical channel trails. These models 
   MUST then be mapped to the GSMP capability set mechanism. 

7. Encapsulation issues 

   The working group needs to decide whether a new encapsulation is 
   required.  In other words, will all optical switches used in 
   either the MPLS over Optics and the IP over optics applications 
   require that IP be implemented on the control channel connecting 
   the GSMP controller and Optical switch (the GSMP target).  If a 
   raw wavelength control connection is to be allowed, a new 
   encapsulation SHOULD be defined. 

8. MIB issues 

   If a new encapsulation is defined, then the encapsulation group 
   SHOULD be updated.  No other changes should be required. 

9. OXC Transaction Model 

9.1 Serial Transactions 

   Many existing OXCs use a command interface which assumes a serial 
   transaction model.  That is, a new command cannot be issued or 
   processed until the existing command is completed.  Under 
   provisioning control via a network management application, and 
   with non-dynamic path setup, this model has been adequate. 

   Moving to a dynamic path setup capability with a distributed 
   control plane, a parallel transaction model is likely required for 
   performance.  This is particularly helpful when the performance of 
   setting up a TDM style connection is much slower than setting up 
   an L2 connection table.  If the OXC is not able to support a 
   parallel transaction model, a GSMP controller MUST be informed of 
   this and adopt serial transaction behaviour.

9.2 Bulk Transactions 

   Again due to the time it may take some OXCs to setup TDM 
   connections relative to L2 fabrics, support for sending multiple 
   transactions in the same message is a useful optimization.  When 
   an OXC receives a bulk message, the individual transactions are 
   acted upon and a single reply is sent.  If parallel transactions 
   are not supported, bulk messages can improve performance by 
   reducing transaction overhead.  Bulk transactions SHOULD be 
   supported. 

10. OXC Restoration Capabilities 

   To achieve fast link protection performance (e.g., 50 ms after 
   failure detection), SONET/SDH and some WDM systems use hardware 
   based protection schemes (e.g., ring protection).  Achieving this 
   level of performance solely using a data control plane such as 
   GMPLS is a serious challenge.  An alternate approach is to utilize 
   fast restoration capabilities of an OXC with a dynamic control 
   plane. 

   An implication of this hybrid approach is that extensions are 
   needed to GSMP to provision the behaviour of an OXC in 
   anticipation of a link failure. 

10.1 Non-Reserved Protection Links 

   An example of protection OXC behaviour is that when a link fails, 
   a backup link may be used to protect traffic on.  This backup link 
   could be selected from a set of links, none of which are pre-
   reserved.  A backup link could be shared with one or more 
   "working" links which is a form of 1:n protection.  Specifying the 
   set of possible backup links SHOULD be done as an option to the 
   Add-Branch message. 

   When a backup link is used, the control plane (i.e., signalling) 
   may need to know about the new path state in order to notify the 
   operator, or take some other OAM action (e.g., billing, SLA 
   monitoring).  An additional GSMP message to inform the controller 
   SHOULD be added to do this. 

10.2 Reserved Protection Links 

   A more specialized form of restoration called "1+1" reserves a 
   backup link for a given working link.  This backup link is not 
   shared with any other working link and traffic is sent over both 
   working and protection links.  Specifying the backup link should 
   be done when the Add-Branch message is sent.  This SHOULD be an 
   option to that message.  When any link in the working path fails,

   traffic on the working path ceases to be received at end of the 
   path. 

   If an alternate input port is not specified with an original Add-
   Branch message, it MAY be specified in a subsequent Add-Branch 
   message.  In this case, it is useful to include information about 
   existing users of the output port in that Add-Branch message.  
   This helps the OXC immediately learn of the association between 
   the new input port and an existing one.  The association is used 
   to enable OXC protection procedures. This capability MUST be added 
   to the add-branch message. 

   Similar contextual information is needed for a Delete-Branch 
   message so that the OXC can determine if a path becomes 
   unprotected. This capability MUST be added to the Delete-branch 
   message. 

11. Security Considerations 

   The security of GSMP's TCP/IP control channel has been addressed 
   in [10]. Any potential remaining security considerations are not 
   addressed in the current revision of this draft.
