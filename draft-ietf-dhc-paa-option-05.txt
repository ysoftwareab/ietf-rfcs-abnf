Internet-Draft              PAA DHCP options               December 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] defines a new Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) [RFC3748] lower layer that uses IP between the protocol end-
   points.

   The PANA protocol is run between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA
   Authentication Agent (PAA) in order to perform authentication and
   authorization for the network access service.

   This document specifies DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options
   that allow PANA client (PaC) to discover PANA Authentication Agents
   (PAA).  This is one of the methods for locating PAAs.

   The DHCP options defined in this document are used only as a PAA
   discovery mechanism.  These DHCP options MUST NOT be used to perform
   any negotiation on the use of PANA between the PaC and a PAA.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the DHCP terminology defined in [RFC2131],
   [RFC2132] and [RFC3315].

   This document uses the PANA terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].  In particular, the following terms are
   defined:

      PANA Client (PaC):

         The client side of the protocol that resides in the access
         device (e.g., laptop, PDA, etc.).  It is responsible for
         providing the credentials in order to prove its identity
         (authentication) for network access authorization.

Internet-Draft              PAA DHCP options               December 2006




      PANA Authentication Agent (PAA):

         The protocol entity in the access network whose responsibility
         is to verify the credentials provided by a PANA client (PaC)
         and authorize network access to the device associated with the
         client and identified by a Device Identifier (DI).


4.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv4 Option

   This section defines a DHCPv4 option that carries a list of 32-bit
   (binary) IPv4 addresses indicating one or more PANA Authentication
   Agents (PAA) available to the PANA client.

   The DHCPv4 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown
   in Fig. 1.

      option-length:      Length of the 'options' field in octets;
                          MUST be a multiple of four (4)

      PAA IPv4 Address:   IPv4 address of a PAA for the client to use.
                          The PAAs are listed in the order of preference
                          for use by the client.


   A PaC (DHCPv4 client) SHOULD request the PAA DHCPv4 Option in a
   Parameter Request List as described in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].

   If configured with a (list of) PAA address(es), a DHCPv4 server
   SHOULD send a client with the PAA DHCPv4 option, even if this option
   is not explicitly requested by the client.

   A PaC (DHCPv4 client) receiving the PAA DHCPv4 option SHOULD use the
   (list of) IP address(es) to locate PAA.

   The PaC (DHCPv4 client) MUST try the records in the order listed in
   the PAA DHCPv4 option received from the DHCPv4 server.


5.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv6 Option

   This section defines a DHCPv6 option that carries a list of 128-bit
   (binary) IPv6 addresses indicating one or more PANA Authentication
   Agents (PAA) available to the PANA client.

   The DHCPv6 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown
   in Fig. 2.

      0                   1                   2                   3

      +                                                               +
      |                                                               |

      option-length:      Length of the 'options' field in octets;
                          MUST be a multiple of sixteen (16)

      PAA IPv6 Address:   IPv6 address of a PAA for the client to use.
                          The PAAs are listed in the order of preference
                          for use by the client.


   A PaC DHCPv6 client SHOULD request the PAA DHCPv6 option in an
   Options Request Option (ORO) as described in the DHCPv6 specification
   [RFC3315].

   If configured with a (list of) PAA address(es), a DHCPv6 server

Internet-Draft              PAA DHCP options               December 2006


   SHOULD send a client with the PAA DHCPv6 option, even if this option
   is not explicitly requested by the client.

   A PaC (DHCPv6 client) receiving the PAA DHCPv6 option SHOULD use the
   (list of) IP address(es) to locate PAA.

   The PaC (DHCPv6 client) MUST try the records in the order listed in
   the PAA DHCPv6 option received from the DHCPv6 server.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The following DHCPv4 option code for PANA Authentication Agent option
   MUST be assigned by IANA:

   Option  Name           Value       Described in
   -----------------------------------------------
   OPTION_PANA_AGENT       TBD         Section 4

   The following DHCPv6 option code for PANA Authentication Agent
   options MUST be assigned by IANA:

   Option  Name            Value       Described in
   ------------------------------------------------
   OPTION_PAA_AGENT        TBD         Section 5


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132] and [RFC3315]
   apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP
   server or insert its own response, a PANA Client could be led to
   contact a rogue PANA Authentication Agent, possibly one that then
   intercepts call requests or denies service.

   In most of the networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options
   prior to network access authentication is neither integrity protected
   nor origin authenticated.  Therefore, the options defined in this
   document MUST NOT be used to perform any negotiation on the use of
   PANA between the PANA Client and a PANA Authentication Agent.  Using
   the presence (or absence) of these DHCP options as an indication of
   network mandating PANA authentication (or not) is an example such a
   negotiation mechanism.  This negotiation would allow bidding down
   attacks by making the clients choose to use a lower-grade security
   mechanism (or even no security at all).
