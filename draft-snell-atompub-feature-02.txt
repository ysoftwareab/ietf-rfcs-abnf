1.  Introduction

   This document introduces extensions for the Atom Publishing Protocol
   introspection format for expressing metadata about the behaviors,
   functions and capabilities supported by an Atom Publishing Protocol
   server implementation.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

     "f": "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset
   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand; the phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming
   Element Information Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses
   the terms "element" and "attribute" it is referring, respectively, to
   the Element and Attribute Information Items in Infoset terms.


3.  Feature Introspection and the 'f:feature' element

   A feature is an abstract behavior, function and capability supported
   by an Atom Publishing Protocol server.  Examples of features that
   might be supported by an APP server include support for draft
   entries, scheduled publication of entries, use of a particular set of
   Atom format extensions, use of a particular authentication scheme,
   and so on.  The presence of a f:feature element in an app:collection
   element is an indication that the collection supports the feature
   specified and may require that a client wishing to use the endpoint
   use that feature.  Features are identified using permanent,
   universally unique IRI's.

     feature = element f:feature {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute ref { atomUri },
       attribute required { 'yes' | 'no' }?,
       attribute href { atomURI }?,
       attribute label { text }?,
       (extensionElement*)

     }

   The "ref" attribute specifies an globally unique IRI identifying a
   feature supported by a collection.  The value of the ref attribute
   MUST be compared on a case-sensitive, character-by-character basis.
   Relative references MUST NOT be used.

   A 'required' attribute value of "yes" indicates that clients MUST
   utilize the identified feature when interacting with the collection.
   A server MAY reject requests from clients that do not support or use
   the feature.  If not specified, the value is assumed to be "no".

   An optional 'href' attribute MAY be used to specify the URI of a
   human-readable description of the feature.  Relative references MAY
   be used.

   The optional 'label' attribute MAY be used to specify a human-
   readable label for the feature.  The value of the 'label' attribute
   is Language-Sensitive as defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287].

   The f:feature element MAY contain child elements and attributes other
   than those defined in this specification.  Such "foreign markup" are
   considered to be metadata applicable to the feature identified by the
   f:feature element.  Software agents MUST NOT stop processing or
   signal an error or change their behavior as a result of encountering
   such foreign markup.

   An app:collection element MAY contain zero or more f:feature elements
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same ref attribute value.
   The order in which f:feature elements appears is insignificant.

3.1.  Example

   The following is an example of a collection supporting one required
   and one optional feature.

     <service xmlns="...">
       <workspace title="My Atom Service">
         <collection title="My Atom Collection" href="...">
           ...
           <f:feature ref="http://example.org/features/drafts" />
           <f:feature ref="http://example.org/features/changetracking"
             href="http://example.org/features/changetracking.html"
             label="Change Tracking">
             <rh:history xmlns:rh="..." href="revisionhistory.xml" />
           </f:feature>
           <f:feature ref="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/"
             href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/"
             label="Google Data API"
             required="yes" />
         </collection>
       </workspace>
     </app:server>


4.  Publishing Controls and the 'f:control' element

   Publishing Controls are a mechanism provided by the Atom Publishing
   Protocol to embed metadata within atom:entry elements designed to
   influence the way a server processes the entry.  The app:control
   element is provided as a convenient container for this metadata
   within an atom:entry.  The Atom Publishing Protocol does not define a
   mechanism by which clients can discover which publishing controls a
   server supports.

   The presence of a f:control element in an app:collection element is
   an indication that the collection supports the control and may
   require that a client wishing to use the endpoint use that control.
   Controls are identified using permanent, universally unique IRI's.

     control = element f:control {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute ref { atomUri },
       attribute required { 'yes' | 'no' }?,
       attribute href { atomURI }?,
       attribute label { text }?,
       (extensionElement*)
     }

   The "ref" attribute specifies an globally unique IRI identifying a
   control supported by a collection.  The value of the ref attribute
   MUST be compared on a case-sensitive, character-by-character basis.
   Relative references MUST NOT be used.

   A 'required' attribute value of "yes" indicates that clients MUST
   utilize the identified control when interacting with the collection.
   A server MAY reject requests from clients that do not support or use
   the control.  If not specified, the value is assumed to be "no".

   An optional 'href' attribute MAY be used to specify the URI of a
   human-readable description of the control.  Relative references MAY
   be used.

   The optional 'label' attribute MAY be used to specify a human-
   readable label for the control.  The value of the 'label' attribute
   is Language-Sensitive as defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287].

   The f:control element MAY contain child elements and attributes other
   than those defined in this specification.  Such "foreign markup" are
   considered to be metadata applicable to the control identified by the
   f:control element.  Software agents MUST NOT stop processing or
   signal an error or change their behavior as a result of encountering
   such foreign markup.

   An app:collection element MAY contain zero or more f:control elements
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same ref attribute value.
   The order in which f:control elements appear is insignificant.

4.1.  Example

   The following is an example of a collection supporting one required
   and one optional control.

     <service xmlns="...">
       <workspace title="My Weblog">
         <collection title="My Entries" href="...">
           ...
           <f:control ref="http://purl.org/atom/app#draft"
                      required="yes" />
           <f:control ref="http://example.org/transforms"
                      required="no">
             <x:transforms xmlns:x="http://example.org/transforms">
               <x:transform>markdown</x:transform>
               <x:transform>wiki</x:transform>
               <x:transform>line-breaks</x:transform>
               <x:none>
             </x:states>
           </f:feature>
         </collection>
       </workspace>
     </app:server>

   An example atom:entry using the listed controls could appear as:

     <entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       ...
       <control xmlns="...">
         <draft>yes</draft>
         <f:transform>markdown</f:transform>
         <f:transform>line-breaks</f:transform>
       </control>
       ...
     </entry>


5.  Security Considerations

   Specific features and controls supported by a collection may
   introduce security considerations and concerns beyond those discussed
   by the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format
   specifications.  Implementors must refer to the specifications and
   description of each feature and control to determine the security
   considerations relevant to each.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Registry of Features and Controls

   The Registry of Features and Controls is maintained by IANA and
   contains information about known features and controls that can be
   supported by Atom Publishing Protocol implementations.  New
   assignments are subject to IESG approval, as outlined in [RFC2434].
   Requests should be made by email to IANA, which will then forward the
   request to the IESG, requesting approval.  The request should use the
   following template:

   o  Type: ("Control" or "Feature")
   o  Ref: (A globally unique IRI identifying the control or feature)
   o  Label: (A human-readable label for the feature)
   o  Description:
   o  Href: (A URI referencing a document containing a detailed
      definition of the control or feature)
   o  Security Considerations:
