Abstract

This memo defines a mechanism and formats for the Internet FAX Full 
Mode using a MIME content-type and an extended Message Disposition 
Notifications (MDN).  Both of the MIME content-type and the extended 
MDN should be used by a mail user agent (UA) which is capable of 
Internet Fax Full Mode with capabilities exchange and confirmation of 
receipt. 

The MIME content-type that is used by Internet Fax Full Mode capable
agent (UA) or electronic mail gateway to request, to response, and to 
receive the capabilities of recipient.  This content-type is intended 
to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined 
to permit capabilities exchange in the Internet Fax Full Mode.

The extended Message Disposition Notifications (MDN) that is used by a 
mail user agent (UA) which is capable of Internet Fax Full Mode for 
processing confirmation. This content-type is intended to be 
machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined to 
permit that the sender (of the message) requires Message Disposition 
Notifications (MDNs). MDN is "An Extensible Message Format for Message 
Disposition Notification" in RFC2298.

1. Introduction

This memo defines a mechanism and format for Internet FAX Full Mode 
with capabilities exchange and confirmation using a MIME content-type fax 
and an extended message disposition notifications (MDNs).  Internet FAX 
Full Mode which has capabilities exchange and confirmation is defined in 
ITU-T F.185 [7] and T.37 [8]. The MIME content-type fax can be used to 
exchange Internet FAX recipient capabilities.  An extended MDN will be 
used for terminal to terminal processing confirmation in Internet FAX 
Full Mode. 

The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality of 
Internet Fax Full Mode.  The protocol described
in this memo provides for the capabilities exchange, in addition to 
those normally used in Internet Mail.  

The MIME content-type fax will be used for terminal to terminal 
capabilities exchange in Internet FAX Full Mode. 
Capability exchange more than Internet FAX such as MS Word 
application or PDF file are out of scope. 

The extended message disposition notifications (MDNs) for Internet FAX 
Full Mode. MDN is defined in "An Extensible Message Format for Message 
Disposition Notification" in RFC2298 [3].  An extended MDN can be used 
to notify the sender of a message of any of several conditions that may 
occur after successful delivery, such as reception of the Internet FAX 
Full Mode or the recipient error in process of the Internet FAX Full Mode. 
The "message/disposition-notification" content-type defined herein is 
intended for use within the framework of the "multipart/report" 
content type defined in RFC 1892 [6].

Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of 
Internet Fax Full Mode through Internet Mail.

Internet FAX Full Mode is defined in F.185 as follows;

(a)	Capabilities of the terminals are exchanged.

(b)	An acknowledgment of receipt is exchanged between gateways
	and may be transferred from the receiving terminal to sending 
	terminal

(c)	The contents of standard messages used by the transmitting 
	terminal are preserved



The key words "MUST","MUST NOT","REQUIRED","SHALL","SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD","SHOULD NOT","RECOMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1.1 	Purposes

The MIME content-type fax and the additional MIME content-type for 
extended message disposition notifications (MDNs)defined in this memo 
are expected to serve several purposes:

(a) 	Allow a sender of Internet FAX Full Mode to request 
	capabilities of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode in terminal 
	to terminal communication;

(b) 	Notify capabilities of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode to 
	the sender of Internet FAX Full Mode.

(c) 	Allow a sender of Internet FAX Full Mode to send image using 
	full function of TIFF-FX based on notified capabilities of 
	recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode and to send command and to 
	request report of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode;

(d) 	Notify report of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode to the 
	sender of Internet FAX Full Mode with part of received message, 
	and may notify capabilities

(e) 	Inform human beings of the disposition of messages after 
	Successful delivery of Internet FAX Full Mode message, in a 
	manner which is largely independent of human language;

(f) 	Allow Language-independed, yet reasonably precise, indications 
	of the disposition of a message to be delivered in Internet 
	FAX Full Mode.

(g)	Allow G3FAX applications such as Polling, Selective Polling,
	Subaddress, Relay, Password, BFT and NSF based on ITU-T T.30 
	protocol.

1.2  Requirements

These purposes place the following constraints on the capability 
exchange and confirmation protocol:

(a)     It must be readable by humans as well as being machine 
        parsable for Internet FAX Full mode.

(b)     It must be provide enough information to allow Internet FAX 
        Full Mode message senders to unambiguously associate 
        the MIME content-type fax with the message that was sent and 
        the original recipient 
        address for which the MIME content-type fax is issued.

(c)     It must also be able to describe the disposition of a Internet 
        FAX Full Mode message independent of any particular human 
        language or of the terminology of any particular mail system.

(d)     The specification must be extensible in order to accommodate 
        future requirements of Internet FAX Full Mode.


1.3  The MIME content-type fax

For the purposes, the MIME content-type fax is defines as 
follows for Internet FAX Full Mode.

(a)     The MIME content-type fax is send automatically. 
        The operator should recognize that 
        Internet FAX full Mode sends the MIME content-type fax 
        by default setting.

(b)     An empty message may be used for capability request.
 



1.4 Extension from MDN

For the purposes, MDS in RFC2298 [3] is extended and modified as 
follows for Internet FAX Full Mode.

(a)MDN is send automatically. The operator should recognize that 
   Internet FAX full Mode sends MDN by default setting.

2.  Method of capability exchange and confirmation

A communication between Internet FAX Full Mode machines consists of 
two phases that are the capability exchange phase and the message 
transmission and confirmation phase. 

In the capability exchange phase, a sender of Internet FAX Full Mode 
sends a capability request using the MIME content-type fax.
A recipient of Internet FAX Full Mode must immediately return message 
with its capabilities using the MIME content-type fax.

In the message transmission and confirmation phase, based on this 
reply messages, the sender sends message and command data using the 
MIME content-type fax and sends confirmation request using a request 
for extended MDN.  The recipient must immediately returns confirmation 
message after the processing of image using the extended MDN.
The confirmation message of the extended MDN includes human 
readable message, completion code, total received page, error page 
numbers, partial or full received message.  The confirmation message 
may include capabilities of recipient using the MIME content-type fax. 

Capability exchange phase and message transmission and confirmation 
phase are independent, and not required to succeeded. A sender may 
perform capability exchange phase only when capabilities of the 
destination is registered in machine, and perform the message 
transmission and confirmation phase for every transmission.

A sender may not perform capability exchange phase when the 
transmitting message is LCD.

2.1 The message/fax content-type

The message/fax content-type is defined as follows:

     MIME type name:                message
     MIME subtype name:             fax
     Optional parameters:           none
     Encoding considerations:       "7bit" encoding is sufficient and
                                    MUST be used to maintain readability
                                    when viewed by non-MIME mail
                                    readers.
     Security considerations:       discussed in section 5 of this memo.

The message/fax report type for use in the multipart/report is "fax".

The body of a message/fax consists of one or more "fields" formatted 
according to the ABNF of RFC 822 header "fields" (see [2]).  
Using the ABNF of RFC 822, the syntax of the message/fax content is as 
follows:

     fax-content = [ reporting-ua-field CRLF ]
          [ fax-gateway-field CRLF ]
          [ original-recipient-field CRLF ]
          final-recipient-field CRLF
          [ original-message-id-field CRLF ]
