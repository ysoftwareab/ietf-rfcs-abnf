1.  Introduction

   [RFC7432] describes MPLS based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) technology.  An
   EVPN comprises CE(s) connected to PE(s).  The PEs provide layer 2
   EVPN among the CE(s) over the MPLS core infrastructure.  In EVPN
   networks, PEs advertise the MAC addresses learned from the locally
   connected CE(s), along with MPLS Label, to remote PE(s) in the
   control plane using multi-protocol BGP.  EVPN enables multi-homing of
   CE(s) connected to multiple PEs and load balancing of traffic to and
   from multi-homed CE(s).

   [RFC7623] describes the use of Provider Backbone Bridging [802.1ah]
   with EVPN.  PBB-EVPN maintains the C-MAC learning in data plane and
   only advertises Provider Backbone MAC (B-MAC) addresses in control
   plane using BGP.

   Procedures for simple and efficient mechanisms to detect data-plane
   failures using LSP Ping in MPLS network are well defined in
   [RFC4379][RFC6425].  This document defines procedures to detect data-
   plane failures using LSP Ping in MPLS networks deploying EVPN and

             Figure 2: EVPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV format


   Broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic can be sent using
   ingress replication or P2MP P-tree in EVPN and PBB-EVPN network.  In
   case of ingress replication, the Echo Request is sent using a label
   stack of [Transport label, Inclusive Multicast label] to each remote
   PE participating in EVPN or PBB-EVPN.  The inclusive multicast label
   is the downstream assigned label announced by the remote PE to which
   the Echo Request is being sent.  The Inclusive Multicast label is the
   inner label in the MPLS label stack.

   When using P2MP P-tree in EVPN or PBB-EVPN, the Echo Request is sent
   using P2MP P-tree transport label for inclusive P-tree arrangement or
   using a label stack of [P2MP P-tree transport label, upstream
   assigned EVPN Inclusive Multicast label] for aggregate inclusive P2MP
   P-tree arrangement as described in Section 6.

   In case of EVPN, an additional, EVPN Auto-Discovery sub-TLV and ESI
   MPLS label as the bottom label, may also be included in the Echo
   Request as is described in Section 6.

   PE1 and PE2.  Assume, PE1 announced a MAC route with RD 1.1.1.1:00
   and B-MAC 00aa.00bb.00cc and with MPLS label 16001 for EVI 10.
   Similarly PE2 announced a MAC route with RD 2.2.2.2:00 and B-MAC
   00aa.00bb.00cc and with MPLS label 16002.

   On PE3, when a operator performs a connectivity check for the B-MAC
   address 00aa.00bb.00cc on PE1, the operator initiates an LSP Ping
   request with the target FEC stack TLV containing EVPN MAC sub-TLV in
   the Echo Request packet.  The Echo Request packet is sent with the
   {Transport Label(s) to reach PE1 + EVPN Label = 16001 + GAL} MPLS
   label stack and IP ACH Channel header.  Once the echo request packet
   reaches PE1, PE1 will use the GAL label and the IP ACH Channel header
   to determine that the packet is IPv4 OAM Packet.  The PE1 will
   process the packet and perform checks for the EVPN MAC sub-TLV
   present in the Target FEC Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in
   [RFC4379] and respond according to [RFC4379] processing rules.

   Similarly, on PE3, when an operator performs a connectivity check for
   the B-MAC address 00aa.00bb.00cc on PE2, the operator initiates an
   LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV containing EVPN MAC
   sub-TLV in the echo request packet.  The echo request packet is sent
   with the {MPLS transport Label(s) to reach PE2 + EVPN Label = 16002 +
   GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH Channel header.

   LSP Ping operation for unicast data-plane connectivity checks in E-
   VPN, are similar to those described above for PBB-EVPN except that
   the checks are for C-MAC addresses instead of B-MAC addresses.

6.2.  Inclusive Multicast Data-plane Connectivity Checks

6.2.1.  Ingress Replication

   Assume PE1 announced an Inclusive Multicast route for EVI 10, with RD
   1.1.1.1:00, Ethernet Tag (ISID 10), PMSI tunnel attribute Tunnel type
   set to ingress replication and downstream assigned inclusive
   multicast MPLS label 17001.  Similarly PE2 announced an Inclusive
   Multicast route for EVI 10, with RD 2.2.2.2:00, Ethernet Tag (ISID
   10), PMSI tunnel attribute Tunnel type set to ingress replication and
   downstream assigned inclusive multicast MPLS label 17002.

   Given CE1 is dual homed to PE1 and PE2, assume that PE1 is the DF for
   ISID 10 for the port corresponding to the ESI 11aa.22bb.33cc.
   44dd.5500.

   When an operator at PE3 initiates a connectivity check for the
   inclusive multicast on PE1, the operator initiates an LSP Ping
   request with the target FEC stack TLV containing EVPN Inclusive
   Multicast sub-TLV in the Echo Request packet.  The Echo Request
   packet is sent with the {Transport Label(s) to reach PE1 + EVPN Incl.
   Multicast Label = 17001 + GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH Channel
   header.  Once the echo request packet reaches PE1, PE1 will use the
   GAL label and the IP ACH Channel header to determine that the packet
   is IPv4 OAM Packet.  The packet will have EVPN Inclusive multicast
   label.  PE1 will process the packet and perform checks for the EVPN
   Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV present in the Target FEC Stack TLV as
   described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond according to
   [RFC4379] processing rules.

   Operator at PE3, may similarly also initiate an LSP Ping to PE2 with
   the target FEC stack TLV containing EVPN Inclusive Multicast sub- TLV
   in the echo request packet.  The echo request packet is sent with the
   {transport Label(s) to reach PE2 + EVPN Incl.  Multicast Label =
   17002 + GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH Channel header.  Once the
   echo request packet reaches PE2, PE2 will use the GAL label and the
   IP ACH Channel header to determine that the packet is IPv4 OAM
   Packet.  Since PE2 is not the DF for ISID 10 for the port
   corresponding to the ESI value in the Inclusive Multicast sub- TLV in
   the Echo Request, PE2 will reply with special code indicating that
   FEC exists on the router and the behavior is to drop the packet
   because of not DF as described in Section 8.

   In case of EVPN, in the Echo Request packet, an Ethernet AD sub-TLV
   and the associated MPLS Split Horizon Label above the GAL label in
   the MPLS label stack, may be added to emulate traffic coming from a
   MH site, this label is used by leaf PE(s) attached to the same MH
   site not to forward packets back to the MH site.  If the behavior on

Internet-Draft              MPLS OAM for EVPN               October 2015


   a leaf PE is to drop the packet because of Split Horizon filtering,
   the PE2 will reply with special code indicating that FEC exists on
   the router and the behavior is to drop the packet because of Split
   Horizon Filtering as described in Section 8.

6.2.2.  Using P2MP P-tree

   Both inclusive P-Tree and aggregate inclusive P-tree can be used in
   EVPN or PBB-EVPN networks.

   When using an inclusive P-tree arrangement, p2mp p-tree transport
   label itself is used to identify the L2 service associated with the
   Inclusive Multicast Route, this L2 service could be a customer
   Bridge, or a Provider Backbone Bridge.

   For an Inclusive P-tree arrangement, when an operator performs a
   connectivity check for the multicast L2 service, the operator
   initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV
   containing EVPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV in the echo request
   packet.  The echo request packet is sent over P2MP LSP with the {P2MP
   P-tree label, GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH Channel header.

   When using Aggregate Inclusive P-tree, a PE announces an upstream
   assigned MPLS label along with the P-tree ID, in that case both the
   p2mp p-tree MPLS transport label and the upstream MPLS label can be
   used to identify the L2 service.

   For an Aggregate Inclusive P-tree arrangement, when an operator
   performs a connectivity check for the multicast L2 service, the
   operator initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV
   containing EVPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV in the echo request
   packet.  The echo request packet is sent over P2MP LSP using the IP-
   ACH Control channel with the {P2MP P-tree label, EVPN Upstream
   assigned Multicast Label, GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH Channel
   header.

   The Leaf PE(s) of the p2mp tree will process the packet and perform
   checks for the EVPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV present in the Target
   FEC Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond
   according to [RFC4379] processing rules.  A PE that is not the DF for
   the EVI on the ESI in the Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV, will reply
   with a special code indicating that FEC exists on the router and the
   behavior is to drop the packet because of not DF as described in
   Section 8.

   In case of EVPN, in the Echo Request packet, an Ethernet AD sub-TLV
   and the associated MPLS Split Horizon Label above the GAL Label in
   MPLS label stack, may be added to emulate traffic coming from a MH

   site, this label is used by leaf PE(s) attached to the same MH site
   not to forward packets back to the MH site.  If the behavior on a
   leaf PE is to drop the packet because of Split Horizon filtering, the
   PE2 will reply with special code indicating that FEC exists on the
   router and the behavior is to drop the packet because of Split
   Horizon Filtering as described in Section 8.

6.2.3.  Controlling Echo Responses when using P2MP P-tree

   The procedures described in [RFC6425] for preventing congestion of
   Echo Responses (Echo Jitter TLV) and limiting the echo reply to a
   single egress node (Node Address P2MP Responder Identifier TLV) can
   be applied to LSP Ping in PBB EVPN and EVPN when using P2MP P-trees
   for broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic.

6.3.  EVPN Aliasing Data-plane connectivity check

   Assume PE1 announced an Ethernet Auto discovery Route with the ESI
   set to CE1 system ID and MPLS label 19001, and PE2 an Ethernet Auto
   discovery Route with the ESI set to CE1 system ID and MPLS label
   19002.

   When an operator performs at PE3 a connectivity check for the
   aliasing aspect of the Ethernet AD route to PE1, the operator
   initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV
   containing EVPN Ethernet AD sub-TLV in the echo request packet.  The
   echo request packet is sent with the {Transport label(s) to reach PE1
   + EVPN Ethernet AD Label 19001 + GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH
   Channel header.

   When PE1 receives the packet it will process the packet and perform
   checks for the EVPN Ethernet AD sub-TLV present in the Target FEC
   Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond
   according to [RFC4379] processing rules.

6.4.  EVPN IP Prefix (RT-5) Data-plane connectivity check

   Assume PE1 announced an IP Prefix Route (RT-5) with an IP prefix
   reachable behind CE1 and MPLS label 19001.  When an operator on PE3
   performs a connectivity check for the IP prefix on PE1, the operator
   initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV
   containing EVPN IP Prefix sub-TLV in the echo request packet.  The
   echo request packet is sent with the {Transport label(s) to reach PE1
   + EVPN IP Prefix Label 19001 + GAL} MPLS label stack and IP ACH
   Channel header.

   When PE1 receives the packet it will process the packet and perform
   checks for the EVPN IP Prefix sub-TLV present in the Target FEC Stack

   TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond according to
   [RFC4379] processing rules.

7.  Security Considerations

   The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new
   security considerations beyond that already apply to [RFC7432],
   [RFC7623] and [RFC6425].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines 3 new sub-TLV type to be included in Target FEC
   Stack TLV (TLV Type 1) [RFC4379] in LSP Ping.

   IANA is requested to assign a sub-TLV type value to the following
   sub-TLV from the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) Parameters - TLVs" registry, "TLVs and sub- TLVs" sub-
   registry:

   o  EVPN MAC route sub-TLV

   o  EVPN Inclusive Multicast route sub-TLV

   o  EVPN Auto-Discovery Route sub-TLV

   o  EVPN IP Prefix Route sub-TLV

   Proposed new Return Codes

   [RFC4379] defines values for the Return Code field of Echo Reply.
   This document proposes two new Return Codes, which SHOULD be included
   in the Echo Reply message by a PE in response to LSP Ping Echo
   Request message:

   1.  The FEC exists on the PE and the behavior is to drop the packet
   because of not DF.

   2.  The FEC exists on the PE and the behavior is to drop the packet
   because of Split Horizon Filtering.
