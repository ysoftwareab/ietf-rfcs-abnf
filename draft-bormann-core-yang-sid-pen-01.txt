            YANG-CBOR: Allocating SID ranges for PEN holders
                   draft-bormann-core-yang-sid-pen-01

Abstract

   YANG-CBOR, RFC XXXX (draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor) defines YANG Schema
   Item iDentifiers (YANG SID), globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers
   used to identify YANG items.  RFC YYYY (draft-ietf-core-sid) defines
   ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA registries.

   The present specification uses these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate 100 000 SIDs for each of the first 1 000 000 holders of
   IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs).

1.  Introduction

   YANG-CBOR, RFC XXXX (draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor) defines YANG Schema
   Item iDentifiers (YANG SID), globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers
   used to identify YANG items.  RFC YYYY (draft-ietf-core-sid) defines
   ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA registries.

   The present specification uses these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate 100 000 SIDs for each of the first 1 000 000 holders of
   IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs).

   We allocate 100 000 mega-ranges, for the SID numbers 300 000 000 000
   to 399 999 999 999.

   The holder of a PEN ppp ppp then can use the SID numbers
   3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999 for allocation in a scheme defined
   by the holder.

2.  Example

   The Department for Mathematics and Computer Science of Universität
   Bremen holds PEN 30810.

Internet-Draft         SID ranges for PEN holders          November 2021


   This confers control over the SID range 303 081 000 000 up to
   303 081 099 999 to this PEN holder.

3.  Discussion

   This allocation provides an extremely-low-threshold way for PEN
   holders to get number space for the YANG SIDs used in their YANG
   modules.  It is, however, not always the approach to recommend to a
   module author:

   *  The space uses 64-bit numbers.  While this is of relatively little
      consequence due to the delta-encoding used for SIDs in YANG-CBOR,
      a few further bytes can be saved by allocating the SIDs in one of
      the mega-ranges that are specifically allocated by an organization
      (which, for the first 2000 or so, will lead to 32-bit outer
      deltas).

   *  This space has no infrastructure to discover the YANG module
      behind a SID.  Of course, each PEN holder can provide such
      infrastructure, but even then the problem remains how to find that
      infrastructure for a SID.  (Search engines may mitigate this
      somewhat.)  On the other hand, relative obscurity may be exactly
      what a PEN holder wants to achieve by using this mechanism.

   Relying on the PEN registry might theoretically trigger a land-grab
   by prospective writers of YANG modules.  However, PENs have been
   around for decades [RFC1065] and such a land-grab hasn't occurred for
   the other allocations implicitly provided by obtaining a PEN.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document allocates 100 000 SID mega-ranges as per Section 7.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-sid].

   The contact for the allocation is: IETF CORE Working Group
   (core@ietf.org) or IETF Applications and Real-Time Area
   (art@ietf.org)

   The allocation policy inside the mega-range is "private".  The URL is
   that of the present specification.

   The management of the SID blocks of 100 000 SIDs each, 10 such blocks
   for each mega-range 3nn nnn 000 000, is delegated to the PEN holder
   for nnn nnx, where x is the sequence number of the SID block in the
   mega-range (i.e., the PEN holder for nnn nnx controls SID
   3nn nnn x00 000 to 3nn nnn x99 999).

   The technical capacity to ensure the sustained operation of the
   registry for a period of at least 10 years (as required for
   registries of class "private") is derived from the capacity of IANA
   to maintain the PEN number registry.
