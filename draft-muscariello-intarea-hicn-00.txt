                 Hybrid Information-Centric Networking
                   draft-muscariello-intarea-hicn-00

Abstract

   This documents describes the hybrid information-centric networking
   (hICN) architecture for IPv6.  The specifications describe a way to
   implement information-networking functionalities into IPv6.  The
   objective is to use IPv6 without creating overlays with a new packet
   format as an additional encapsulation.  The intent of the present
   design is to introduce some IPv6 routers in the network with
   additional packet processing operations to implement ICN functions.
   Moreover, the current design is tightly integrated into IPv6 to allow
   easy interconnection to IPv6 networks with the additional design
   objective to exploit existing IPv6 protocols as much as possible as
   they are, or extend them where needed.

1.  Introduction

   The objective of this document is to describe hybrid ICN, a network
   protocol that integrates ICN in IPv6, at a minimum cost in terms of
   required modifications in end-points and routers and in a way to
   guarantee transparent interconnection with IP without using overlays.

   The ICN reference design used in this document is CCNx as described
   in [I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics] and [I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxmessages].
   IPv6 is used as described in [RFC8200].

   There are some basic design principles behind the hICN architecture
   that are implemented by the design reported below that can be
   summarized as follows:

   o  (i) the network can transport many different kinds of applications
      as IPv6, i.e. hICN can serve content-distribution or real-time
      applications, to cite examples with very different requirements.
      hICN is not a content-distribution network;

   o  (ii) it provides connection-less and location independent
      communications by identifying data with unique global names,
      instead of naming network interfaces (locator) or end-hosts (end-
      host identifiers) as in LISP [RFC6830].

   o  (iii) data is retrieved by an end-point by issuing requests and a
      node accepts a data packet from an ingress interface if and only
      if at least one matching request packet is stored in the local
      cache of the node, otherwise the data packet is dropped;

   o  (iv) basic security services are provided by the architecture:
      authenticity of the data producer and data integrity.  A
      cryptographic signature over a security envelop is computed by the
      producer (using its own private key) and must be verified by the
      consumer (using the producer's public key).  The security envelop
      can be as small as a single data packet or cover groups of packets
      using the technique of the transport manifest [MAN].

      Figure 1: General overview of an hICN end-to-end communication.

   The communication model described in this document covers the
   transport and the network layer.

   The network layer includes the forwarding plane only and does not
   consider the routing plane. hICN network layer is about using the
   IPv6 FIB to determine a next hop router to forward requests or using
   a local packet cache to determine if an incoming request can be
   satisfied locally.  The hICN forwarding plane takes care of
   forwarding replies by using information stored in cached requests.
   The packet pipeline of an hICN node always includes a lookup in a
   packet cache for both requests and replies.  The packet cache is a
   mandatory component that is added to the usual IPv6 packet processing
   pipeline.  Requests and replies carry an immutable data name end-to-



Muscariello, et al.     Expires December 9, 2018                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    hICN                         June 2018


   end, in packet header fields as described in the following sections.
   Moreover, requests and replies carry locators as mutable packet
   header fields.  A locator, i.e. an interface identifier, is changed
   every time a packet is sent to another hICN node.  A detailed
   description of how locators are modified along the path between end-
   points is reported in the following sections.

   It is assumed that existing routing protocols, working for IPv6,
   should be reused as much as possible as they are.  Improvements to
   existing routing protocols are out of scope and might be developed in
   other documents to better exploit features made available by the hICN
   forwarding plane.  For instance, hICN forwarding plane can take
   advantage of the ability of a routing protocol to provide multiple
   routes for a given destination or more generally compute routes for
   destinations that are multi-instantiated [MIR].  This topic is
   important but out of scope for this document.

   The hICN network architecture can run on top of any link-layer that
   supports IPv6.  hICN data names are globally routable names which are
   visible to the transport layer end-points.  Conversely, the transport
   layer has no visibility of addresses of network interfaces.  The
   network layer forwards two kind of protocol data units: the request
   and the reply, called interest and data packets.

   The hICN network layer offers a communication service to the
   transport layer in the end-points by means of a local unidirectional
   channel that we call local or application face.  This channel is used
   by the transport layer to send requests and receive replies or to
   send replies upon receptions of requests.

   A transport end-point is always bound to a unidirectional channel
   that is used to either send data or receive data.  The former end-
   point is called data producer while the latter data consumer.  The
   producer end-point produces data under a location independent name,
   which is an IPv6 prefix.  A consumer end-point fetches data by using
   the non ambiguous name as provided by the producer.  The producer
   end-point is responsible for managing the usage of the prefix in
   terms of provisioning, association to applications and its
   revocation.

   The transport end-point offers two kinds of services to applications:
   a producer and a consumer service.  The service is instantiated in
   the application by opening communication sockets with an API to
   perform basic transport service operations: allocation,
   initialization, configuration, data transmission and reception.

   The producer and consumer sockets can implement different types of
   services such as stream or datagram, reliable or unreliable.  In all



Muscariello, et al.     Expires December 9, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    hICN                         June 2018


   cases all transport services are connection-less, meaning that a
   producer transport service produces named data in a socket memory
   that is accessible by any valid request coming from one or multiple
   consumers.  The consumer, on the other hand, retrieve named data
   using location independent names which are not tied to any interface
   identifier (also called locator).  This transport model allows to
   implement reliable consumer mobility without any special mobility
   management protocol. hICN supports communication of multi-homed end-
   hosts without any special treatment in the transport layer.  The hICN
   network layer can also implement robust usage of multi-path
   forwarding in IPv6 networks as balanced request/reply flows self-
   stabilize network congestion see [CCN],[NDN], [RAQ] .

   A data packet is an IPv6 packet with a transport layer header
   carrying data from an application that produces data.  An interest
   packet is an IPv6 packet with a transport layer header and is used to
   unambiguously fetch a data packet from a producer end point.

2.1.  End-points

   In hICN we introduce two new kinds of endpoints: the producer and the
   consumer.  We identify two kind of communication sockets each with a
   specific API: the producer and consumer sockets.  These socket types
   are designed to exchange data in a multi-point to multi-point manner.
   In (h)ICN we have the same concept that is applied to a network where
   memories are distributed across the communication path.  The first
   memory in the path is the production buffer of the producer end-point
   that forges Data Packets and copies them into a shared memory
   isolated into a namespace.  Consumer sockets can retrieve data from
   such memory by using the (h)ICN network layer.  The model just
   described is an inter-process communication example (IPC) that
   requires data to cross a communication network by using a transport
   protocol.

   The way consumers and producers synchronize depends on application
   requirements and the transport layer exposes a variety of services:
   stream/datagram, reliable/unreliable, with or without latency budgets
   etc.  Independently of the specif requirements of the applications,
   producer sockets always perform data segmentation from the upper
   layer into Data Packets, as well as compute digital signatures on the
   packet security envelop.  This envelop can also be computed across a
   group of packets, by including a cryptographic hash of each packet
   into the transport manifest, and eventually signing only such
   manifest.

   The consumer socket, on the other end, always performs reassembly of
   Data Packets, hash integrity verification and signature verification.
   This is common to all architectures in (h)ICN.  The usual assumption



Muscariello, et al.     Expires December 9, 2018                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    hICN                         June 2018


   is that the producer socket uses an authentic-able identity while
   using namespaces that it has been assigned.  The end-point must be
   able to manage the mapping of her identity and the allocated
   namespace by issuing digital certificates about the mapping.  The
   consumer end-point must retrieve the associated certificate to
   perform the basic operations.  It is out of scope for this document
   how to design and implement a scalable system to perform such
   certificate operations.

   A detailed description of transport end-points is out of scope for
   this document.

2.2.  Naming

   In hICN, two name components are defined: the name prefix and the
   name suffix.  The name prefix is used to identify an application
   object, a service or in general an application level source of data
   in the network.  This is incarnated by a listening socket that binds
   to the name prefix.  The name suffix is used to index segmented data
   within the scope of the name prefix used by the application.

   For instance an RTP [RFC3550] source with a given SSRC can be mapped
   into a name prefix.  Single RTP sequence numbers can be mapped into
   name suffixes.  For example an HTTP server can listen to a name
   prefix to serve HTTP requests.  An HTTP reply with large payload with
   require the transport layer to segment the application data unit
   according to an MTU.  Name suffixes are used to index each segment in
   the socket stream.

   More details about how to use hICN to transport HTTP or RTP will be
   given in a different document.

2.2.1.  Name prefix

   The format of an hICN name prefix is the following:

   |            64 bits             |        64 bits                |
   +--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |           routable prefix      |       data identifier         |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+


                     Figure 2: hICN IPv6 name prefix.

   It is composed of a routable IPv6 /64 prefix as per [RFC3587] which
   SHOULD be globally routable.  The data identifier is encoded in 64
   bits.  An application can use several identifiers if needed.

Internet-Draft                    hICN                         June 2018


   From the description given above, the name prefix is a location
   independent name encoded in an IPv6 address.

2.2.2.  Name Suffix

   The name suffix is used by the transport layer protocol to index
   segments.  The segment MUST be indexed in the end-points and in the
   network with the same suffix.  This implies that there is one
   transport segment per IP packet and that IP fragmentation is not
   allowed.  It is up to the producer end-point to determine how to
   perform segmentation depending on the use case.  An MTU path
   discovery protocol for hICN is out of scope of this document and
   additional work is required to extend existing protocols or design
   new ones.

               +-----------------------------
               |           name suffix      |
               +-----------------------------


                        Figure 3: hICN name suffix.

2.3.  Packet Format

   Two protocol data units are defined below: the interest (request) and
   the data (reply).

   They are composed of a network and transport header.  The transport
   header is the same for both packet types while the network header is
   slightly different.

2.4.  Packet cache

   The packet cache is a router local memory used to temporarily store
   requests and reply.  The simplest incarnation of the packet cache
   MUST index packets by full name, i.e.  the concatenation of the name
   prefix and suffix.  Insertion and deletion of packets in the cache is
   described below.

2.5.  Forwarding

   The forwarding path in hICN is composed of two components: the
   interest and data path.  Requests and replies are processed at the
   hICN node in a different way.  Both forwarding paths require a packet
   cache to be incorporated into the router.  The cache is used to
   temporarily store requests and replies for a relatively short amount
   of time.

   By caching a request in an hICN node, the reply can be transmitted
   back to the right nodes as the source address field in the interest
   contains the interface identifier of the hICN node having transmitted
   the request.  Replies are optionally cached if needed.

   This means that the interest forwarding path is based on lookups in
   the IP FIB just like any other IP packet, with the additional
   processing due to a cache lookup to check if the actual reply is
   already present in the local cache for expedited reply.

   On the other hand, data packet forwarding is similar to label
   swapping [RFC3031], being the packet name identifier (prefix plus
   suffix) the forwarding label.  The next hop for the reply in transit
   is indeed selected by using information in a cached matching request.

   The name prefix in the packet header is never modified along the path
   for both requests and replies, while the locator, i.e. the interface
   identifier written in the source or destination address field, for
   interest or data packets respectively, is modified at the egress of
   the router as reported below.

2.5.1.  Interest Path

   At the router ingress the incoming interest packet I is parsed to
   obtain the name prefix and the name suffix.  An exact match look up
   is made in the packet cache using the full packet name as key.  Based
   on the outcome of the lookup the following options are possible:

   1.  at least one match is found.

       1.1.  If one match is a data packet D, other matches are ignored,
       and D is prepared for transmission by setting D's
       destination address with I's source address.  D is passed to the
       egress to further processing before transmission.  For instance
       the next-hop MAY be selected by using the router IPv6 FIB
       (longest prefix match).  The IPv6 FIB lookup MIGHT be saved in
       case the next-hop can be derived directly from information
       previously derived by processing the incoming interest packet I.
       I is eventually dropped.

       1.2.  There is one or multiple matches and all are interest
       packets.

       *  One matching interest has the same source address and I is
          classified as duplicate and further processed as duplicate.

       *  Matching interest packets have different source addresses and
          I is classified as filtered and stored in the cache.

   2.  a match is not found and I passed to the egress for further
       processing to determine the next-hop by using the router IP FIB.

   Notice that the destination address field in the interest packet is
   polymorphic as it has two different types based on the data
   structured it is looked-up against.  It has the type of a location
   independent name while used to find a match in the packet cache and
   it has an address prefix type to find the next-hop in the IPv6 FIB.
   Polymorphism is transparent for the forwarding plane while it has
   several implications in the control plane.

2.5.2.  Data Path

   At the router ingress the incoming data packet D is parsed to obtain
   the name prefix and the name suffix.  An exact match look up is made
   in the packet cache using the full packet name as key.  Based on the
   outcome of the lookup the following options are possible:

   1.  one or multiple matching interest packets are found 1.1.  The
       data packet D is cloned to have as many copies as the number of
       matching interests including D.  The destination address field of
       each copy of D is set with the source address field of each
       interest packet.  All copies are passed to the egress to further
       processing before transmission in order to find each data
       packet's next-hop.

   2.  No matching is an interest packet and the D is dropped.

3.  Security

   hICN inherits ICN data-centric security model: integrity, data-origin
   authenticity and confidentiality are tied to the content rather than
   to the channel.
   Integrity and data-origin authenticity are provided through a digital
   signature computed by the producer and included in each data packet.
   Integrity and data-origin authenticity qre provided in two ways using
   two approaches: the first one based on IP Authenticated Header
   [RFC4302] and the second one based on transport manifests.  Notice
   that the IP AH is not used as an IPv6 extension header as it is
   appended after the transport header.  However the choice of the IP AH

   has been made in order to exploit existing protocol implementations
   in the end-points.

   When using IP AH, the signature is computed over

   o  (i)IP or extension header fields either immutable in transit or
      that are predictable in value upon arrival at the consumer,

   o  (ii) the AH header with the signature field set to zero.  We
      recall that in hICN the destination header field is not immutable
      nor predictable and must be set to zero for the signature
      computation.  We also point out the AH in placed after the TCP
      header in order to prevent any kind of filtering from network
      devices such as middleboxes.

Internet-Draft                    hICN                         June 2018


   The transport manifest is a L4 entity computed at the producer which
   contains the list of names of a group of data packets to convey to
   the consumer. hICN cryptographic hashes of data packets are then
   computed instead of signatures.  The hashes are computed on immutable
   fields as explained above when using the IP AH.  Moreover, the
   manifest must be signed to guarantee a level of security equivalent
   to packet-wise signatures.

   hICN is oblivious of the trust model adopted by consumers and works
   with any of the existing proposals.
