               DNS Resolver Information Self-publication
                          draft-pp-add-resinfo-00

Abstract

   This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish
   information about themselves.  The information is returned as a JSON
   object.  The names in this object are defined in an IANA registry
   that allows for light-weight registration.  Applications and
   operating systems can use the methods defined here to get the
   information from resolvers in order to make choices about how to send
   future queries to those resolvers.

1.  Introduction

   Historically, DNS stub resolvers typically communicated with the
   recursive resolvers in their configuration without needing to know
   anything about the features of the recursive resolvers.  More
   recently, recursive resolvers have different features that may cause
   stub resolvers to make choices about which configured resolver from
   its configuration to use, and also how to communicate with the
   recursive resolver (such as over different transports).  Thus stub
   resolvers need a way to get information from recursive resolvers
   about features that might affect the communication.

   This document specifies methods for stub resolvers to ask recursive
   resolvers for such information.  In short, a new RRtype is defined
   for stub resolvers to query using the DNS, and a new well-known URI
   is defined for stub resolvers to query using HTTP over TLS.

   The response from either method is the same: a JSON object.  The JSON
   object MUST use the I-JSON message format defined in [RFC7493].  Note
   that [RFC7493] was based on RFC 7159, but RFC 7159 was replaced by
   [RFC8259].  Requiring the use of I-JSON instead of more general JSON
   format greatly increases the likelihood of interoperability.

Internet-Draft            Resolver Information                April 2020


   The information that a resolver might want to give to a recursive
   resolver is not defined in this document; instead other documents
   will follow that will specify that information and the format that it
   comes in.

1.1.  Definitions

   In the rest of this document, the term "resolver" without
   qualification means "recursive resolver" as defined in [RFC8499].
   Also, the term "stub" is used to mean "stub resolver".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Retrieving Resolver Information by DNS

   A stub that wants to use the DNS to get information about a resolver
   can use the DNS query defined here.  The query a stub resolver uses
   is resolver-info.arpa/IN/RESINFO.  The RRtype "RESINFO" is defined in
   this document, and the IANA assignment is given in Section 5.1.  The
   contents of the Rdata in the response to this query is defined in
   Section 4.  If the resolver understands the RESINFO RRtype, the RRset
   in the Answer section MUST have exactly one record.

   The name resolver-info.arpa is defined in this document, and the IANA
   assignment is given in Section 5.4.  As described in Section 5.4, the
   zone resolver-info.arpa is not actually delegated and never will be.
   The resolver that receives this query acts as if it is delegated, and
   responds with its own RESINFO data in the Answer section.

   A resolver that receives a query with the RRtype of RESINFO with a
   QNAME of resolver-info.arpa acts as if it is delegated, and responds
   with its own RESINFO data in the Answer section.  The resolver can
   generate this reply with special code to capture queries for these
   types of addresses; if the resolver can be configured to also be
   authoritative for some zones, it can use that configuration to
   actually be authoritative for the addresses on which it responds.

   Any query for the RESINFO RRtype that is not to resolver-info.arpa/IN
   is meaningless and MUST result in a NODATA or NXDOMAIN response.
   Resolvers would not need any special code to meet this requirement;
   they only need code to handle the RESINFO RRtype that is in resolver-
   info.arpa/IN.

3.  Retrieving Resolver Information by Well-Known URI

   A stub that wants to use HTTPS to get information about a resolver
   can use the well-known URI defined here.  Because this uses HTTPS,
   the stub has the possibility of authenticating the TLS connection.
   If the connection cannot be authenticated (such as if the stub only
   knows the IP address of the resolver and the resolver's certificate
   does not have the IP address, or the correct IP address), the stub
   MAY still use the results with the same lack of assuredness as it
   would have with using a DNS request described in Section 2.

   The stub MUST use the HTTP GET method.  The URI used to get the
   resolver information is :

   https://IPADDRESSOFRESOLVER/.well-known/resinfo/

   https://DOMAINNAMEOFRESOLVER/.well-known/resinfo/

   This uses the ".well-known" URI mechanism defined in [RFC8615].  The
   contents of the response to this query is defined in Section 4.

   A resolver that uses this method to publish its information SHOULD,
   if possible, have a TLS certificate whose subject identifiers contain
   any of the IP addresses that stubs might be using for the resolver.
   At the time that this document is published, getting IP addresses in
   TLS certificates is possible, but there are only a few widely-trusted
   CAs that issue such certificates.  [RFC8738] describes a protocol
   that may cause IP address certificates to become more common.

   In the future, DHCP and/or DCHPv6 and/or RA may have options that
   allow the configuration to contain the domain name of a resolver.  If
   so, this can be used for matching the domain name in the TLS
   certificate.  Until that time, the second form of the URI is probably
   not useful.

4.  Contents of the Returned I-JSON Object

   The JSON object returned by a DNS query or an HTTPS query MAY contain
   any name/value pairs.

   All names in the returned object MUST either be defined in the IANA
   registry or, if for local use only, begin with the substring "temp-".
   The IANA registry (Section 5.2) will never register names that begin
   with "temp-".

   All names MUST consist only of lower-case ASCII characters, digits,
   and hyphens (that is, Unicode characters U+0061 through 007A, U+0030
   through U+0039, and U+002D), and MUST be 63 characters or shorter.

Internet-Draft            Resolver Information                April 2020


   As defined in Section 5.2, the IANA registry will not register names
   that begin with "temp-", so these names can be used freely by any
   implementer.

   Note that the message returned by the resolver MUST be in I-JSON
   format.  I-JSON requires that the message MUST be encoded in UTF8.

4.1.  Example

   The I-JSON object that a resolver returns might look like the
   following:

   {
      "temp-field2": 42
   }

   As specified in [RFC7493], the I-JSON object is encoded as UTF8.
   [RFC7493] explicitly allows the returned objects to be in any order.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  RESINFO RRtype

   This document defines a new DNS RR type, RESINFO, whose value TBD
   will be allocated by IANA from the "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" sub-
   registry of the "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" registry:

   Type: RESINFO

   Value: TBD

   Meaning: Information self-published by a resolver as an I-JSON (RFC
   7493) object

   Reference: This document

5.2.  Registry for DNS Resolver Information

   IANA will create a new registry titled "DNS Resolver Information"
   that will contain definitions of the names that can be used with the
   protocols defined in this document.  The registration procedure is by
   Expert Review and Specification Required, as defined in [RFC8126].

   The specification that is required for registration can be either an
   Internet-Draft or an RFC.  The reviewer for this registry is
   instructed to generally be liberal in what they accept into the
   registry: as long as the specification that comes with the

Internet-Draft            Resolver Information                April 2020


   registration request is reasonably understandable, the registration
   should be accepted.

   The registry has the following fields for each element:

   Name: The name to be used in the JSON object.  This name MUST NOT
   begin with "temp-".  This name MUST conform to the definition of
   "string" in I-JSON [RFC7493] message format.

   Value type: The type of data to be used in the JSON object.

   Specification: The name of the specification for the registered
   element.

5.3.  resinfo Well-known URI

   Before this draft is complete, mail will be sent to wellknown-uri-
   review@ietf.org in order to be registered in the "Well-Known URIs"
   registry at IANA.  The mail will contain the following:

   URI suffix: resinfo

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): This document

   Status: permanent

5.4.  resolver-info.arpa Special-Use Domain Name

   IANA will record the domain name "resolver-info.arpa" in the
   "Special-Use Domain Names" registry [SUDN].  IANA MUST NOT delegate
   resolver-info.arpa in the .arpa zone.

6.  Security Considerations

   Unless a DNS request for resolver-info.arpa/IN/RESINFO as described
   in Section 2 is sent over DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS-over-
   HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], the response is susceptible to forgery.  Given
   that one of the first expected uses for the protocol in this document
   is expected to be to find out whether DoT or DoH is available for the
   resolver, it is thus expected that most if not all such DNS requests
   will be sent without any chance of authentication.  Stubs and
   resolvers SHOULD use normal DNS methods for avoiding forgery such as
   query ID randomization and source port randomization.

   An application that is using an operating system API to send queries
   for resolver-info.arpa/IN/RESINFO or a subdomain will only know if

Internet-Draft            Resolver Information                April 2020


   query went over authenticated DoT or DoH if the API supports
   returning that authentication information.  Currently, no common APIs
   support that type of response.

   A stub resolver will know if it is using DoT or DoH, but it would
   only know if the communication is authenticated if there is an API or
   system call for the stub resolver to know that.

Appendix A.  Ideas From Earlier Work that was Abandoned

   This document is based on work done earlier in the DNSOP working
   group, and personal drafts before that.

   In that earlier work, "<reverse-ip>.{in-addr,ip6}.arpa" was proposed
   as the domain name to allow for the possibility of DNSSEC-signed
   responses.  However, it was pointed out that people often do not
   control their reverse IP names and thus their ISP (or their ISP's
   ISP) could spoof responses and make them look legitimate by signing
   with DNSSEC.

Acknowledgments

   The idea of various types of servers publishing information about
   themselves has been around for decades.  However this idea has not
   been used in the DNS.  This document aims to fix this omission.

   Roy Arends contributed many ideas to an earlier version of this draft
   before it was moved to the ADD working group.
