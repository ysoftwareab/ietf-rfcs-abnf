Abstract

   This draft discusses the problem of simultaneous optimized routing
   and correspondent node-targeted location privacy for Mobile IPv6 and
   proposes a solution.  The solution utilizes the MIPv6 bootstrapping
   mechanisms and requires no new network entities and no changes to
   home agent or correspondent node.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   The terminology of [2] and [3] is used.  Additionally, the following
   terms are introduced:

   IP Reachability Home Agent (IRHA):  A home agent as specified in [2]
      that provides IP reachability and global session continuity for
      the mobile node.

   Home Address for IP Reachability (HoA_IR):  A home address used for
      IP reachability and session continuity and that is registered at
      the IRHA.  This home addresses is disclosed to potential
      correspondent nodes (e.g., by publishing the address in DNS).

   Optimized path:  A path between mobile node and correspondent node
      that is shorter than the IP reachability path, but may be longer
      than the optimal path.  The IP Reachability path is the path
      between mobile node and correspondent node if the mobile node uses
      bi-directional tunneling mode with the IRHA.  The optimal path is
      the end-to-end path between mobile node and correspondent node,
      e.g., the path in MIPv6 Route Optimization mode.

   Optimized routing:  Routing data packets over the optimized path

   Optimized Routing Home Agent (ORHA):  A home agent as specified in
      [2] that is used for providing optimized routing.  It must support
      the bootstrapping mechanisms specified in [3].

   Home Address for Optimized Routing (HoA_OR):  A home address used for
      optimized routing and session continuity and that is registered at
      the ORHA.  This home address is usually not public (i.e., not
      published in DNS).

   Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy:  Hiding the mobile node's
      location from nodes eavesdropping on the path between mobile node
      and correspondent node (and home agent)

   Correspondent node-targeted location privacy:  Hiding the mobile
      node's location from the correspondent node

2.  Introduction

   Location privacy is the ability to hide a user's location from other
   users.  This is considered to be an important feature, since
   disclosure of the location can have serious impacts on the user's
   life.  In general, location privacy can be achieved by hiding the
   relation between identity and location of a user.  In Mobile IPv6
   [2], the care-of address and the home address represent the
   topological location and identity of a mobile node, respectively.
   Consequently, at least either the care-of address or the home address
   must be hidden from anyone that is not authorized to obtain the
   location of the mobile node.  Two rather orthogonal sub-problems of
   location privacy for Mobile IPv6 can be distinguished: hiding the
   location from eavesdroppers on the path and hiding the location from
   the correspondent node, which we henceforth call eavesdropper-
   targeted and correspondent node-targeted location privacy,
   respectively (see [4] for details about the Mobile IPv6 location
   privacy problem).  This document is concerned with correspondent
   node-targeted location privacy only, especially with the problem of
   providing optimized routing at the same time.  Eavesdropper-targeted
   location privacy and any location privacy issue not directly related
   to Mobile IPv6 are out of the scope of this document.

   An example scenario illustrating the problem of simultaneous
   optimized routing and correspondent node-targeted location privacy is
   the following: A mobile node wants to hide its location and uses
   Mobile IPv6 with a public home address to be reachable.  The mobile
   node requires strong location privacy, i.e., hiding only the mobility
   within an access network and revealing the access network prefix to
   the correspondent node is not acceptable.  An application on the
   correspondent node initiates a delay-sensitive session such as VoIP
   by sending packets to the mobile node's public home address.  The
   mobile node receives the packets in bi-directional tunneling mode
   from its home agent.  The mobile node and the correspondent node are
   located in the United States, whereas the mobile node's home agent is
   located in Europe.  Since the mobile node is far away from home, the
   packet delay and hence the user experience is far from what could be
   achieved.  However, if the mobile node uses route optimization mode,
   it reveals its location to the correspondent node (note that the
   correspondent node can also be an attacker that just initiates a
   session to find out the mobile node's location).  Consequently, the
   mobile node has the choice: it can have good user experience without
   location privacy or location privacy with bad user experience.
   Currently, there is no way to achieve both simultaneously with Mobile
   IPv6.  We believe that this is not acceptable and that Mobile IPv6
   should support strong correspondent node-targeted location privacy
   and optimized routing simultaneously for both mobile node-initiated
   and correspondent node-initiated sessions.

   Qui et. al. [9] propose a solution to this problem.  The basic idea
   is to hide the home address from the correspondent node in route
   optimization mode by using a pseudo home address instead of the real
   home address.  Although the care-of address is revealed to the
   correspondent node, location privacy is protected by hiding the
   identity (i.e., real home address) of the mobile node from the
   correspondent node.  This approach has also been proposed in [8].
   However, if the correspondent node initiates the communication,
   location privacy is usually compromised, since the real home address
   is already known by the correspondent node.  And even if the real
   home address is hidden from the correspondent node, location privacy
   is compromised if the correspondent node is able to figure out the
   mobile node's identity by any other means on higher layers (e.g., by
   the voice during a call).

   [3] and [6] specify the mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in
   the split and the integrated scenario, respectively.  The former
   allows a mobile node to bootstrap with any home agent, for which the
   necessary trust relationships are in place.  When bootstrapping with
   a local home agent, optimized routing can be achieved in bi-
   directional tunneling mode.  However, since the home address obtained
   from a local home agent belongs to the network the mobile node is
   currently visiting, it contains location information.  Consequently,
   location privacy is compromised, if the correspondent node knows that
   the home agent is local to the mobile node.

   This document proposes a solution to provide strong correspondent
   node-targeted location privacy and optimized routing simultaneously,
   which requires only changes to the mobile node operation.  Home agent
   and correspondent node are unchanged and no new entities or messages
   are introduced.  The basic idea is that the mobile node uses a
   mobility service provided close to the correspondent node's domain.
   More specifically, the mobile node bootstraps with a home agent (the
   ORHA), which is located topologically close to the correspondent node
   and which is used for optimized communication with this correspondent
   node.  A location close to the correspondent node ensures that no
   location information is contained in the home address HoA_OR anchored
   at the ORHA.  For mobile node-initiated sessions, the mobile node
   uses the ORHA in bi-directional tunneling mode and HoA_OR on higher
   layers.  For correspondent node-initiated sessions, the public home
   address HoA_IR is used on higher layers and the mobile node registers
   at the correspondent node HoA_OR as care-of address.

3.  Assumptions and Applicability Statement

   The mechanisms defined in this document require that the mobile node
   is able to utilize a mobility service, which is offered close to the
   correspondent node's domain.  To allow optimized communication with
   any correspondent node, it is required that home agent services are
   offered to the mobile node from various topological locations.  This
   typically requires that a mobility service provider (MSP) offers
   mobility service from many different locations or that multiple MSPs
   have some kind of roaming relationships with the mobile node's
   mobility service authorizer (MSA), so that a group of MSPs offers
   mobility service from many different locations.  Such roaming
   relationships can be based on an AAA infrastructure and are not
   particular to this document: the MIPv6 bootstrapping solutions for
   the split scenario [3] and the integrated scenario [6] also require
   that a roaming relationship between MSP and MSA exist (see also [5]).
   For instance, in the integrated scenario, the access service
   authorizer (ASA) is also the mobility service authorizer (MSA).  An
   important point of the integrated scenario is that the access service
   provider (ASP) the mobile node is currently visiting is typically
   also an MSP (i.e., provides local home agent service).  This means
   that roaming relationships between many MSPs and the mobile node's
   MSA are required and that home agent services are offered to the
   mobile node from various topological locations, which represent the
   requirements mentioned in the beginning of this section.  In
   conclusion, it is expected that the home agents, roaming
   relationships, and the credentials needed for [6] can be re-used by
   the mechanisms defined in this document.

   It is further assumed that a mechanism for discovery of home agents
   located close to correspondent nodes is available (see Section 5).
   However, it is not required that the home agent (ORHA) is located in
   the correspondent node's domain.  A domain nearby to the
   correspondent node's domain is sufficient to achieve location privacy
   and improved routing efficiency.

   Since the ORHA learns the location of the mobile node, the mobile
   node must be sure that the ORHA doesn't reveal the mobile node's
   location to nodes not authorized to get the location, i.e., the ORHA
   must be trusted by the mobile node.  It is assumed that the ORHA
   discovery mechanism only returns trusted home agents or that the
   mobile node is able to verify whether the ORHA is trusted.  Note that
   even if the ORHA and the correspondent node are in the same domain,
   this doesn't imply that the ORHA reveals the mobile node's location
   to the correspondent node.  This is also true in today's networks,
   where it is ensured that users of a service provided by a particular
   operator don't know the location of other users using a service
   provided by the same operator.

4.  Changes to Mobile Node Operation

   The mobile node has to decide for every correspondent node, whether
   it wants to use bi-directional tunneling mode, route optimization
   mode or the solution described in this document.  How this decision
   is made and how and when the route optimization is triggered is out
   of scope of this document.  Generally, for non-delay-sensitive
   services such as simple web browsing, bi-directional tunneling to the
   home agent should be sufficient and achieves strong correspondent
   node-targeted location privacy.  If no location privacy is required,
   Mobile IPv6 route optimization mode can be used.

   The solution is split in two cases: optimization of the route for a
   communication session that has not yet started and optimization of
   the route for an ongoing session.  A session is defined in this
   context by the IP addresses of the endpoints used by upper layers
   (with one of the addresses being a mobile node's home address).  The
   first case applies, e.g., if the mobile nodes wants to initiate a
   session with a correspondent node and knows before sending the first
   data packets that optimized routing is needed.  The second case
   applies, e.g., if the correspondent node initiates a session with the
   mobile node or if the mobile node decides to optimize the route of an
   ongoing session.

4.1.  Optimization of the route for a session that has not yet started

   The mobile node first tries to discover an ORHA, which is located
   preferably topologically close to the correspondent node and close to
   the optimal path.  The reasoning behind the ORHA location is that it
   can be argued that the closer the ORHA is located to the
   correspondent node, the less location information is included in the
   HoA_OR, and that the closer the ORHA is located to the optimal path,
   the better the route optimization property.  The ORHA must be trusted
   and must be operated by an MSP that has a roaming relationship to the
   MN's MSA.  For details about the discovery process refer to section
   Section 5.  If the discovery is successful, the mobile node
   bootstraps with the ORHA and uses it in bi-directional tunneling mode
   for communication with the correspondent node.  Existing
   registrations with other home agents are kept for communication with
   other correspondent nodes.  The HoA_OR is not made public, i.e., no
   DNS update should be triggered for this home address.  Since no
   correspondent node registration is initiated, the care-of address is
   hidden and correspondent node-targeted location privacy is ensured.
   The signaling is shown in Figure 1.

   Location privacy is provided, since the correspondent node only
   learns HoA_OR, which has no relation to the mobile node's location.

4.2.  Optimization of the route for an ongoing session

   After the mobile node has decided to optimize the route of a session
   (e.g., after receiving the first data packets tunneled by the IRHA
   and originated from the correspondent node), it discovers and
   bootstraps with an ORHA.  Since the communication session is based on
   HoA_IR, packets are routed through the IRHA.  To achieve optimized
   routing, the mobile node uses route optimization mode over the
   reverse tunnel to the ORHA, i.e., care-of test messages, binding
   update messages, and later data packets destined for the
   correspondent node are sent over the reverse tunnel to the ORHA.
   While establishing the optimized path over the ORHA, the mobile node
   can send and receive data packets over the IRHA.

   To achieve location privacy, the mobile node uses HoA_IR as home
   address and HoA_OR as care-of address in the context of the route
   optimization mode.  This results in the following headers for packets
   sent by the mobile node for the session with the correspondent node
   (IPsec for signaling protection to ORHA assumed):


   Data packets and binding updates:

         IPv6 header (source = care-of address,
                      destination = ORHA)
         ESP header in tunnel mode
         IPv6 header (source = HoA_OR,
                      destination = correspondent node)
         Destination Options header

            Home Address option (HoA_IR)
         Any protocol




   Care-of Test Init:

         IPv6 header (source = care-of address,
                      destination = ORHA)

         IPv6 header (source = HoA_OR,
                      destination = correspondent node)
         Any protocol


   Since from the correspondent node's point of view, HoA_OR is the
   care-of address and the HoA_IR is the home address of the mobile
   node, data packets sent by the correspondent node contain the HoA_IR
   in the routing header and the HoA_OR in the destination address field
   of the IP header.  Consequently, the data packets are intercepted by
   the ORHA and tunneled to the mobile node.  The signaling is shown in
   Figure 2.

   Location privacy is provided, since the correspondent node only
   learns HoA_OR and HoA_IR, which both have no relation to the mobile
   node's location.

   Note that upon changing the care-of address, the mobile node does not
   send binding updates to the correspondent node over the reverse
   tunnel to the ORHA, because the care-of address in this context is
   the HoA_OR.

5.  Location-dependent Home Agent Discovery

   This solution requires the discovery of the ORHA address, i.e., of a
   home agent located close to the correspondent node.  A specification
   of such location-dependent home agent discovery is currently out of
   scope of this document.

   One option could be to that the mobile node uses anycast-based or
   DNS-based home agent discovery [3] based on the correspondent node's
   address, prefix or host name (e.g., similar to locating SIP servers
   [10]).  The drawback of this method is that only ORHAs located in
   correspondent node's domain can be discovered, i.e., it is not
   possible to discover an ORHA in nearby domains.  This limits the
   applicability, since it cannot be assumed that a home agent is
   deployed in every correspondent node's domain.

   Another option could be to query a dedicated server (can be a server
   in the public Internet or a server provided by the mobility service
   provider or authorizer) that has a list of home agents and that is
   able to map an FQDN or address of a correspondent node to an FQDN or
   address of a home agent that is located topologically close to the
   correspondent node.  The mobile node would query this server to
   discover the ORHA address.

   One option to realize this is to re-use DHCP-based HA assignment with
   the options and mechanisms defined in [6] and [7].  The mobile node
   would put the correspondent node's domain as target domain in the
   Home Network Identifier DHCP Option.  A new id-type may be needed to
   indicate that a domain nearby to the target domain is requested, if
   the correspondent node's domain cannot be used as MSP.  The mobile
   node's MSA would then determine and assign a home network or home
   agent to the mobile node, which is in or close to the correspondent
   node's domain.

   Note that the mobile node must verify that the discovered ORHA is
   trusted by the mobile node, if the HA assignment/discovery mechanism
   does also return untrusted ORHAs.  This verification should be done
   before the mobile node reveals its location to the ORHA.  The details
   of this verification is currently out of scope.

6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker could initiate many fake communication sessions by
   spoofing the source address, which could trigger the mobile node to
   discover and bootstrap with many home agents.  This could consume
   significant resources on the mobile node and in the network and may
   cause a DoS.  As a countermeasure, the mobile node should not start
   bootstrapping automatically when the correspondent node initiates a
   session or it should limit the number of ORHAs it is registered with.
   Fake sessions should be identified as such as fast as possible and
   the mobile node should de-register immediately from the corresponding
   ORHA.

   The ORHA knows the location of the mobile node and could distribute
   it to third parties without authorization from the mobile node.
   Hence, the mobile node must verify that the ORHA is trusted before
   the mobile node reveals its location to the ORHA.

   The return routability procedure over the reverse tunnel to the ORHA
   is not considered less secure than the standard return routability
   procedure as long as the ORHA is trusted and the ORHA link is not
   vulnerable to eavesdropping.

   This document is concerned with correspondent node-targeted location
   privacy only.  Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy and any
   location privacy issue not directly related to Mobile IPv6 are out of
   the scope of this document.
