                   IANA Registry Updates for OpenPGP
                 draft-openpgp-iana-registry-updates-00

Abstract

   This document describes a number of changes to the OpenPGP (RFC 4880)
   IANA registries that range from adding notes to the registry to
   changing registration policies.  These changes were motivated by
   recently proposed extensions to OpenPGP.  Existing IANA OpenPGP
   registry policies are defined by RFC 4880.

1.  Introduction

   This document instructs IANA to make changes to a number of OpenPGP-
   related IANA registries [RFC4880].  These changes were motivated by
   recently proposed extensions to OpenPGP.

   Modelled after [I-D.ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates], the document
   performs a similar function in modifying existing IANA registry
   policies for OpenPGP [RFC4880].

   The changes introduced by this document are intended to be
   comprehensive, proposed after a thorough review of existing registry
   policy and values.  Changes include updating of registry policy,
   filling in missing values, providing recommendation of registered
   items and general housekeeping.

   The document lists out each OpenPGP registry individually and
   provides the rationale for changes and the required changes
   themselves.

   Specifically, the following changes are pursued:

   o  Alignment of registry policies with [RFC8126];

   o  Consistency of existing OpenPGP registries, for example, some
      registries have the prefix "PGP" while some others don't;

   o  Missing values in registries while having been defined in
      <<RFC4880>;

   o  Creating a missed registry defined in [RFC4880], namely the
      "OpenPGP Signature Notation Data Subpacket Flags" registry;

   o  A number of references in the registries point to documents that
      detail a certain algorithm, but should refer to a document (and
      the relevant section if appropriate) that details the
      implementation requirements of that algorithm within the context
      of OpenPGP.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*",
   and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in [RFC2119].

   The key words "*Private Use*", "*Experimental Use*", "*Hierarchical
   Allocation*", "*First Come First Served*", "*Expert Review*",
   "*Specification Required*", "*RFC Required*", "*IETF Review*",
   "*Standards Action*" and "*IESG Approval*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in Section 4 of [RFC8126].

3.  Alignment Amongst OpenPGP Registries

3.1.  Policy Conventions Given In RFC 8126

   The OpenPGP IANA registries and their policies defined in [RFC4880]
   pre-date [RFC8126] which defined the term "IETF Review" instead of
   the now-outdated term "IETF Consensus" [RFC2434].

   This draft updates policies of the OpenPGP IANA registries to align
   with the terms specified in [RFC8126].

3.2.  Registry Naming

   Registry names of IANA OpenPGP registries *SHOULD* be consistent.

   The following registries originally have the "PGP" prefix, and the
   prefix *SHOULD* be changed to "OpenPGP":

   o  PGP String-to-Key (S2K) Registry (Section 5.1)

   o  PGP Packet Types/Tags Registry (Section 5.2)

   o  PGP User Attribute Types Registry (Section 5.3)

   The prefix "OpenPGP" *SHOULD* be added to the following registries:

   o  Image Format Subpacket Types Registry (Section 5.4)

   o  Signature Subpacket Types Registry (Section 5.5)

   o  Signature Notation Data Subpacket Notation Types Registry
      (Section 5.5)

   o  Key Server Preference Extensions Registry (Section 5.7)

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


   o  Reason for Revocation Extensions Registry (Section 5.8)

   o  Implementation Features Registry (Section 5.9)

   o  New Packet Versions Registry (Section 5.10)

   o  Public Key Algorithms Registry (Section 5.12)

   o  Symmetric Key Algorithms Registry (Section 5.13)

   o  Hash Algorithms Registry (Section 5.14)

   o  Compression Algorithms Registry (Section 5.15)

   This renaming is not necessary for the "OpenPGP Signature Notation
   Data Subpacket Notation Flags Registry" (Section 5.16) since it is
   newly created according to this convention.

   For specific recommendations, please see the corresponding sections
   in Section 5.

4.  Providing Recommendations Via The "Recommended" Column

   The feature set of OpenPGP is an evolving one.  In some cases, it has
   been unclear whether implementation of a certain feature would
   actually be beneficial for interoperability or create fragmentation
   of implementations.

   Moreover, the fast-moving nature of cryptography directly impacts the
   security of OpenPGP implementations, and an algorithm once considered
   secure may be subject to cryptanalytic results that advise otherwise.
   For example, this has been demonstrated by the widespread
   obsolescence of SHA-1 [SHA1-Coll] [RFC6194].

   It is therefore beneficial for all OpenPGP interested parties that
   implementers can follow a stable reference on what is considered best
   practice in OpenPGP implementations.

   There are two types of recommendations considered here:

   o  Recommended for security (abbreviated as "REC-S" in this document)

   o  Recommended for interoperability (abbreviated as "REC-I" in this
      document)

4.1.  Security Recommendations

   Recommendations for security are usually critical and urgent.

   The following registries shall have the "Security Recommendation"
   column added:

   o  PGP String-to-Key (S2K) Registry

   o  Public Key Algorithms Registry

   o  Symmetric Key Algorithms Registry

   o  Hash Algorithms Registry

   The allowed values for this column are:

   o  Yes: Recommended, this algorithm is considered secure;

   o  No: Not recommended, this algorithm is considered insecure;

   o  Empty: No comment, there is no recommendation on this algorithm.

   A "Security Recommendation" *MUST* only be accepted through an Expert
   Review described in Section 7.4.

4.1.1.  Weakening Of Cryptographic Algorithms And Parameters

   Cryptographic algorithms and parameters will be broken or weakened
   over time.  Blindly implementing cipher suites listed in the
   registries is not advised.

   Implementers and users *SHOULD* check that the cryptographic
   algorithms listed continue to provide the expected level of security.

4.2.  Interoperability Recommendations

   Recommendations for interoperability are generally less urgent but
   greatly beneficial for the OpenPGP user experience.

   The following registries shall have the "Interoperability
   Recommendation" column added:

   o  PGP String-to-Key (S2K) Registry

   o  PGP Packet Types/Tags Registry

   o  PGP User Attribute Types Registry

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


   o  Image Format Subpacket Types Registry

   o  Signature Subpacket Types Registry

   o  Key Server Preference Extensions Registry

   o  Reason for Revocation Extensions Registry

   o  Implementation Features Registry

   o  New Packet Versions Registry

   o  Key Flags Extensions Registry

   o  Public Key Algorithms Registry

   o  Symmetric Key Algorithms Registry

   o  Hash Algorithms Registry

   o  Compression Algorithms Registry

   The allowed values for this column are:

   o  Yes: Recommended, implementation of this feature enhances
      interoperability for OpenPGP;

   o  No: Not recommended, implementation of this feature reduces
      interoperability for OpenPGP;

   o  Empty: No comment, there is no recommendation on this feature on
      interoperability.

   An "Interoperability Recommendation" *MUST* only be accepted through
   an Expert Review described in Section 7.4.

4.3.  No Recommendation

   An item not marked as "Recommended" does not mean it is "Not
   Recommended".  This could simply be a reflection that this item has
   not been through Expert Review, has limited applicability, is
   intended only for specific use cases, or for other reasons.

   Not all newly defined parameters in a Standards Track document need
   to be marked as "Recommended".

   o  Rename the registry to "OpenPGP String-to-Key (S2K) Algorithms"

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   o  A Standards Track document is required to register an S2K
      algorithm with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

   Add the following note:

   Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
   provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented
   in an interoperable way, with notable benefits for the wider
   OpenPGP community.

   Update the following registrations:

   o  Change registry policy to *RFC Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   o  A Standards Track document is required to register a Packet Type
      with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

   Add the following note:

   Note: Due to the scarcity of codepoints in this registry,
   experts are to verify that the proposed registration
   **MUST** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
   and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
   an interoperable way.

   o  Rename the column "Attribute" to "User Attribute Type"

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   o  A Standards Track document is required to register an Attribute

5.6.  Signature Notation Data Subpacket Notation Types Registry

   This registry is currently empty.

   However, the existing IANA registry contains an erroneous note that
   the registry is about "User Notations".  According to [RFC4880] which
   defined this registry, "[n]otations contain a user space that is
   completely unmanaged".  This registry should be for the [RFC4880]
   "IETF (name)space".

   Proposed changes to the registry:

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


   o  Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Notation Data Subpacket Notation
      Types".

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   Update its erroneous "Note" that says:

  Notation names are arbitrary strings encoded in UTF-8. They reside two
  name spaces: The IETF name space and the user name space.

  The IETF name space is registered with IANA. These names MUST NOT
  contain the "@" character (0x40).  This is a tag for the user name
  space.

   To:

   Notation names are arbitrary strings encoded in UTF-8, and there are
   two namespaces:

   * IETF namespace: keys are of any string but **MUST NOT** contain the
   "@" character (0x40). Allowed keys **MUST** by registered in this
   registry.

   * User namespace: keys are of form "[name]@[domain]", these are
   unmanaged keys and NOT maintained by this registry.

   Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
   is necessary and **SHOULD** provide general benefits for the wider
   OpenPGP community.

5.7.  Key Server Preference Extensions Registry

   Proposed changes to the registry:

   o  Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Key Server Preferences"

   o  Rename the column "First octet" to "Flag"

   o  Add a column "Octet Ordinal" to indicate the ordinal of the octet
      of which the "Flag" field is read from.

   o  Rename the column "Extension" to "Description"

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   Add the following note:

   This is a variable-length bit field.

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


5.11.  Key Flags Extensions Registry

   Proposed changes to the registry:

   o  Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Key Flags"

   o  Rename the column "Value" to "Flag"

   o  Add a column "Octet Ordinal" to indicate the ordinal of the octet
      of which the "Flag" field is read from.

   o  Rename the column "Extension" to "Description"

   o  Mark value "First Octet, 0x40" as "Unassigned" in the registry.

   o  Remove ending periods for all values in "Description" for
      consistency with other registries.

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   o  A Standards Track document is required to register an item with
      the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

   Add the following note:

   This is a variable-length bit field.

   Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
   **SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
   and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
   an interoperable way.

   Update existing registrations:

5.13.  Symmetric Key Algorithms Registry

   Proposed changes to the registry:

   o  Rename registry to "OpenPGP Symmetric Key Algorithms".

   o  Algorithm descriptions have been simplified and applicable
      references moved to the "Reference" column.

   o  All algorithm descriptions with "[n+] bit" is updated to
      "[n+]-bit" for consistency, for example, the phrase "128 bit key"
      becomes "128-bit key".

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   o  A Standards Track document is required to register an item with
      the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

   o  Existing registrations with a "Reference" value pointing to a non-
      IETF published document should be checked to see if an IETF-
      published document is available, and if so, update the reference
      to point to the IETF-published document instead for consistency.

   Add the following note:

   Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
   **SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
   and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
   an interoperable way. References to IETF-published documents are
   preferred. The "Reference" value should point to a document that
   details the implementation of this algorithm in OpenPGP, not of
   the algorithm itself.

5.15.  Compression Algorithms Registry

   Proposed changes to the registry:

   o  Rename registry to "OpenPGP Compression Key Algorithms".

   o  Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

   o  Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

   o  A Standards Track document is required to register an item with
      the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

   o  Existing registrations with a "Reference" value pointing to a non-
      IETF published document should be checked to see if an IETF-
      published document is available, and if so, update the reference
      to point to the IETF-published document instead for consistency.

   Add the following note:

   Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
   **SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
   and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
   an interoperable way. References to IETF-published documents are
   preferred.

6.  Registries With The "Specification Required" Policy

   Registration requests for a *Specification Required* and *Expert
   Review* registry must be submitted to the Expert Pool (Section 7)
   through the openpgp-reg-review@ietf.org mailing list.

   The registration request will be deemed successful after three
   approved Expert Reviews (Section 7.4), and the Designated Experts
   will request IANA to register the proposed registration.

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


6.1.  Registration Request Procedure

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review *SHOULD*
   use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Registration request: new
   algorithm in Symmetric Encryption registry").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.

6.2.  Registration Request Outcome

   An outcome of a registration request is determined by results of
   Expert Reviews (Section 7.4).

   A registration request is approved once it receives a minimum of
   three Expert Reviews that result in approval.

   The outcomes of a request review are:

   o  Approval: once there are three approved Designated Expert reviews
      within the review period;

   o  Denial: there have been more than three Designated Expert reviews
      within the review period but have not met the approval threshold
      of three approvals.

6.3.  Temporary Registrations

   To allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   Designated Experts *MAY* approve a temporary registration once they
   are satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   This temporary registration has a 1 year validity, of which when
   expired will be automatically revoked.

   Once the specification that the proposal relies is published within
   this period, the Designated Experts *SHOULD* request IANA to convert
   this registration to an official one.

7.  Designated Experts

   Designated Experts are responsible for performing registration
   request reviews for *Expert Review* and *Specification Required* IANA
   OpenPGP registries.

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


7.1.  IANA Registration

   IANA *MUST* only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and *SHOULD* direct all requests for registration to the review
   mailing list.

7.2.  Eligibility Criteria

   A Designated Expert *SHOULD* have a thorough understanding,
   demonstrated knowledge and experience of OpenPGP [RFC4880] and its
   Standards Track extensions.

7.3.  Selection Criteria And Pool

   Designated Experts are judged and selected by the IETF Area Director
   of which the "openpgp" workgroup belongs.

   The selected pool of Designated Experts *SHOULD* be able to represent
   the perspectives of different applications using this specification,
   in order to enable broadly informed review of registration decisions.

7.4.  Designated Expert Review

7.4.1.  Review Procedure

   On submission of a review request, five Designated Experts are sought
   out for the review of the request.  These Designated Experts must
   provide a review decision response within 21 days of submission.

   If less than three Designated Experts have performed a review by the
   end of that period, an extension of 21 days will be granted and extra
   Designated Experts selected to complete the review.

   In cases where a review assignment could be perceived as creating a
   conflict of interest for a particular Designated Expert, that
   Designated Expert *SHOULD* defer review responsibility to another
   Designated Expert, as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC8126].

7.4.2.  Review Criteria

   A Designated Expert *MUST* take the following criteria into account
   when reviewing registration requests.

   For *Specification Required* registries:

   o  whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
      functionality;




Tse                       Expires July 10, 2018                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


   o  the clarity of the proposed registration description;

   o  whether the specification of the proposed registration item is
      publicly available;

   o  whether the proposed registration would affect the security of
      users of OpenPGP; and

   o  whether the proposed registration is likely to be of general
      applicability.

7.5.  Review Outcomes

   Approvals *MUST* include an explanation.

   Denials *MUST* include an explanation and, if applicable,
   constructive suggestions as to how to make the request successful.

   A Designated Expert *MAY* elect to provide more in depth reviews than
   required.  Their review should not be taken as an endorsement of the
   feature or underlying primitives, such as cryptographic algorithms
   used by a registration.

7.6.  Review Appeals

   The review appeals process is in accordance with 10 [RFC8126], which
   specifies that the normal IETF appeals process as described in
   Section 6.5 of [RFC2026] should be followed.

   Review appeals *SHOULD* be directly brought to the IESG for
   resolution through the iesg@ietf.org mailing list.

   The following issues are eligible for the appeals process:

   o  Registration requests that have not received any Designated Expert
      reviews for a period longer than 21 days.

   o  A review was performed by an inappropriate Designated Expert, for
      example, who is strongly suspected of a conflict of interest or
      has demonstrated unprofessional behavior or impartiality.

8.  Security Considerations

   The change to *Specification Required* from *IETF Review* lowers the
   barrier to add functionality and cryptographic algorithms for
   OpenPGP.





Tse                       Expires July 10, 2018                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft        OpenPGP IANA Registry Updates         January 2018


   For registries that involve cryptographic algorithms, this change
   reflects the practical reality in that the "openpgp" mailing list is
   not responsible for cryptographic reviews, which is especially
   difficult for national cipher suites.

   Security Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general
   use at the time of registration.  However, since cryptographic
   algorithms and parameters will be broken or weakened over time, it
   *MAY* be possible that the recommended status in the registry lags
   behind the most recent advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and
   users *SHOULD* check that the cryptographic algorithms listed
   continue to provide the expected level of security desired.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a number of changes to the IANA OpenPGP
   registries.
