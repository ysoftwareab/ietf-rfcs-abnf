  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">As defined in RFC 3261 <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a>, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) early dialog is created when a non-100 provisional response is sent to the initial dialog initiation request (e.g. INVITE, outside an existing dialog). The dialog is considered to be in early state until a final response is sent.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">When a proxy receives an initial dialog initiation request, it can forward the request towards multiple remote destinations. When the proxy does that, it performs forking <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">When a forking proxy receives a non-100 provisional response, or a 2xx final response, it forwards the response upstream towards the sender of the associated request. After a forking proxy has forwarded a 2xx final response, it normally generates and sends CANCEL requests downstream towards all remote destinations where it previously forked the request associated with the 2xx final response and from which it has yet not received a final response. The CANCEL requests are sent in order to terminate any outstanding early dialogs associated with the request.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Upstream SIP entities might receive multiple 2xx final responses. When a SIP entity receives the first 2xx final response, and it does not intend to accept any subsequent 2xx final response, it will automatically terminate any other outstanding early dialog associated with the request. If the SIP entity receives a subsequent 2xx final response, it will normally generate and send an ACK request, followed with a BYE request, using the dialog identifier retrieved from the 2xx final response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">NOTE: A User Agent Client (UAC) can use the Request-Disposition header field <a href="#RFC3841">[RFC3841]</a> to request that proxies do not generate and send CANCEL requests downstream once they have received the first 2xx final response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response, it does not always immediately forward the response upstream towards the sender of the associated request. Instead, the proxy "stores" the response and waits for subsequent final responses from other remote destinations where the associated request was forked. At some point the proxy uses a specified mechanism to determine the "best" final response code, and forwards a final response using that response code upstream towards the sender of the associated request. When an upstream SIP entity receives the non-2xx final response it will release resources associated with the session. The UAC will terminate, or retry, the session setup.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">Since the forking proxy does not always immediately forward non-2xx final responses, upstream SIP entities (including the UAC that initiated the request) are not immediately informed that an early dialog has been terminated, and will therefore maintain resources associated with the early dialog reserved until a final response is sent by the proxy, even if the early dialog has already been terminated. A SIP entity could use the resources for other things, e.g. to accept subsequent early dialogs that it otherwise would reject.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog Terminated. A forking proxy can send a 199 provisional response to inform upstream SIP entities that an early dialog has been terminated. A UAS can send a 199 response code, prior to sending a non-2xx final response, for the same purpose. SIP entities that receive the 199 response can use it to trigger the release of resources associated with the terminated early dialog. In addition, SIP entities might also use the 199 response to make policy related decisions related to early dialogs. For example, a media gate controlling SIP entity might use the 199 response when deciding for which early dialogs media will be passed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.9">Section 9 contains signalling examples that show when and how a forking proxy generates 199 responses in different situations.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#sec-app" id="sec-app">Applicability and Limitation</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The 199 response code is an optimization, and it only optimizes how quickly recipients might be informed about terminated early dialogs. The achieved optimization is limited. Since the response is normally not sent reliably by an UAS, and can not be sent reliably when generated and sent by a proxy, it is possible that some or all of the 199 responses get lost before they reach the recipients. In such cases, recipients will behave the same as if the 199 response code were not used at all.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">One example for which a UAC could use the 199 response, is that when it receives a 199 response it releases resources associated with the terminated early dialog. The UAC could also use the 199 response to make policy related decisions related to early dialogs. For example, if a UAC is playing media associated with an early dialog, and it then receives a 199 response indicating the early dialog has been terminated, it could start playing media associated with a different early dialog.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Applications designers utilizing the 199 response code MUST ensure that the application's user experience is acceptable if all 199 responses are lost, and not delivered to the recipients.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#sec-client" id="sec-client">User Agent Client behavior</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">When a UAC sends an initial dialog initiation request, and if it is willing to receive 199 responses, it MUST insert a "199" option-tag in the Supported header field <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> of the request.  The option-tag indicates that the UAC supports, and is willing to receive, 199 responses. A UAC SHOULD NOT insert a "199" option-tag in the Require or the Proxy-Require header field <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> of the request, since in many cases it would result in unnecessary session establishment failures.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">NOTE: The UAC always needs to insert a "199" option-tag in the Supported header field, in order to indicate that it supports, and is willing to receive, 199 responses, even if it also inserts the option-tag in the Require or Proxy-Require header field.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">It is RECOMMENDED that a UAC does not insert a "100rel" option-tag <a href="#RFC3262">[RFC3262]</a> in the Require header field when it also indicates support of 199 responses, unless the UAC also uses some other SIP extension or procedure that mandates it to do so. The reason is that proxies are not allowed to generate and send 199 responses when the UAC has required provisional responses to be sent reliably.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">When a UAC receives a 199 response, it might release resources associated with the terminated early dialog. A UAC might also use the 199 response to make policy related decisions related to early dialogs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">NOTE: The 199 response indicates that the early dialog has been terminated, so there is no need for the UAC to send a BYE request in order to terminate the early dialog when it receives the 199 response.  </p>

The proxy will forward the response upstream towards the sender of the associated request. The proxy MAY release resources it has reserved associated with the early dialog that is terminated. If a proxy receives a 199 response out of dialog, it MUST process it as other non-100 provisional responses received out of dialog.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">When a forking proxy receives a non-2xx final response to an initial dialog initiation request, that it recognizes as terminating one or more early dialogs associated with the request, it MUST generate and send a 199 response upstream for each of the terminated early dialogs that satisfy each of the following conditions: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">- the forking proxy does not intend to forward the final response immediately (in accordance with rules for a forking proxy) </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.8">As a consequence, once a final response to an initial dialog initiation request has been issued by the proxy, no further 199 responses associated with the request will be generated or forwarded by the proxy.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.9">When a forking proxy forks an initial dialog initiation request, it generates a unique Via header branch parameter value for each forked leg. A proxy can determine whether additional forking has occurred downstream of the proxy by storing the top Via branch value from each response which creates an early dialog. If the same top Via branch value is received for multiple early dialogs, the proxy knows that additional forking has occurred downstream of the proxy. A non-2xx final response received for a specific early dialog also terminates all other early dialog for which the same top Via branch value was received in the responses which created those early dialogs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.10">Based on implementation policy, a forking proxy MAY wait before sending the 199 response, e.g. if it expects to receive a 2xx final response on another dialog shortly after it received the non-2xx final response which triggered the 199 response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.11">When a forking proxy generates a 199 response, the response MUST contain a To header field tag parameter, that identifies the terminated early dialog. A proxy MUST also insert a Reason header field that contains the SIP response code of the response that triggered the 199 response. The SIP response code in the Reason header field informs the receiver of the 199 response about the SIP response code that was used by the UAS to terminate the early dialog, and the receiver might use that information for triggering different types of actions and procedures. The proxy MUST NOT insert a "199" option-tag in the Supported, Require or Proxy-Require header field of the 199 response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.12">A forking proxy that supports generating of 199 responses MUST keep track of early dialogs, in order to determine whether to generate a 199 response when the proxy receives a non-2xx final response. In addition, a proxy MUST keep track on which early dialogs it has received and forwarded 199 responses, in order to not generate additional 199 responses for those early dialogs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.13">If a forking proxy receives a reliably sent 199 response for a dialog, for which it has previously generated and sent a 199 response, it MUST forward the 199 response.

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.15">If the Require header field of an initial dialog initiation request contains a "100rel" option-tag, a proxy MUST NOT generate and send 199 responses associated with that request. The reason is that a proxy is not allowed to generate and send 199 responses reliably.  </p>

If such request is received by a UA, it MUST act in the same way as if it had received the request after sending the final non-2xx response to the INVITE request, as specified in RFC 3261. A UAC that receives a 199 response for an early dialog MUST NOT send any further requests on that dialog, except for requests which acknowledge reliable responses.

<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">General security issues related to SIP responses are described in RFC 3261. Due to the nature of the 199 response, it may be attractive to use it for launching attacks in order to terminate specific early dialogs (other early dialogs will not be affected).  In addition, if a man-in-the-middle generates and sends a 199 response, which terminates a specific dialog, towards the UAC, it can take a while until the UAS finds out that the UAC, and possible stateful intermediates, have terminated the dialog. SIP security mechanisms (e.g. hop-to-hop TLS) can be used to minimize, or eliminate, the risk for such attacks.  </p>
