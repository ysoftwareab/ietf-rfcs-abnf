Abstract


RPS Security [2] requires certain RPSL [1] objects in the IRR to be
hierarchically delegated.  The set of objects that are at the root of this
hierarchy needs to be created and digitally signed by IANA. This paper
Internet Draft               RPS IANA Issues               September 1, 1999

presents these seed objects and lists operations required from IANA.


1 Initial Seed


A public key of IANA needs to be distributed with the software
implementations of Distributed Routing Policy System [3].  An initial set of
seed objects are needed to be signed with this key.  They are:

Here, we assume that IANA runs its own repository.  However this is not a
requirement.  Instead, it may publish its objects with one of the existing
routing registries.

This set of seed objects needs to be signed with the hard coded IANA key.
Later, IANA objects can be signed with the key in the IANA key-cert object.


2 IANA Assignments


Each time IANA makes an assignment, it needs to create inetnum and as-block
objects as appropriate and digitally sign them using the key in its key-cert
object.  For example:



as-block:     AS0 - AS500
descr:        arin's space
country:      us
status:       ALLOCATED
source:       iana
delegated:    arin
mnt-by:       mnt-iana

inetnum:      128.0.0.0 - 128.255.255.255
netname:      Internet portion

3 Creating Routing Repositories


To enable a new routing repository, a repository object, a maintainer object
and a key-cert object need to be created and digitally signed by IANA. For
example:



  mntner:        mnt-ripe
  descr:         RIPE's maintainer
  auth:          <ripe's choice>
  mnt-by:        mnt-ripe
  referral-by:   mnt-iana
  admin-c:       . . .
  tech-c:        . . .
  upd-to:        . . .
  mnt-nfy:       . . .
  source:        RIPE

  key-cert: pgpkey-979979
  method: pgp
  owner:  . . .
  fingerpr: . . .
  certif: # this key is for illustration only

  +       . . .
  +       -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
  mnt-by: mnt-ripe
  source: RIPE

  repository:         RIPE
  query-address:      whois://whois.ripe.net
  response-auth-type: PGPKEY-23F5CE35 # pointer to key-cert object
  response-auth-type: none
  remarks:            you can request rsa signature on queries
  remarks:            PGP required on submissions
  submit-address:     mailto://auto-dbm@ripe.net
  submit-address:     rps-query://whois.ripe.net:43
  submit-auth-type:   pgp-key, crypt-pw, mail-from
  remarks:            these are the authentication types supported

  remarks:            admin and technical contact, etc
  source:             RIPE


This very first transaction of a new repository is placed in the new
repository, not in the IANA repository.


4 Security Considerations


This document describes IANA procedures and initial RPSL seed objects.  It
does not define protocols or standards that need to be secured.



5 IANA Considerations


This whole document is for detailed consideration by IANA.
