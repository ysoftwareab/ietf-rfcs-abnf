1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules: the first
   defines identities and groupings common to both SSH clients and SSH
   servers, the second defines a grouping for a generic SSH client, and
   the third defines a grouping for a generic SSH server.  It is
   intended that these groupings will be used by applications using the
   SSH protocol [RFC4252], [RFC4253], and [RFC4254].  For instance,

Internet-Draft    Groupings for SSH Clients and Servers         May 2021


   these groupings could be used to help define the data model for an
   OpenSSH [OPENSSH] server or a NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242] based
   server.

   The client and server YANG modules in this document each define one
   grouping, which is focused on just SSH-specific configuration, and
   specifically avoids any transport-level configuration, such as what
   ports to listen on or connect to.  This affords applications the
   opportunity to define their own strategy for how the underlying TCP
   connection is established.  For instance, applications supporting
   NETCONF Call Home [RFC8071] could use the "ssh-server-grouping"
   grouping for the SSH parts it provides, while adding data nodes for
   the TCP-level call-home configuration.

   The modules defined in this document use groupings defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore] enabling keys to be either locally
   defined or a reference to globally configured values.

   The modules defined in this document optionally support [RFC6187]
   enabling X.509v3 certificate based host keys and public keys.

1.1.  Relation to other RFCs

   This document presents one or more YANG modules [RFC7950] that are
   part of a collection of RFCs that work together to, ultimately,
   enable the configuration of the clients and servers of both the
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocols.

   The modules have been defined in a modular fashion to enable their
   use by other efforts, some of which are known to be in progress at
   the time of this writing, with many more expected to be defined in
   time.

   The normative dependency relationship between the various RFCs in the
   collection is presented in the below diagram.  The labels in the
   diagram represent the primary purpose provided by each RFC.
   Hyperlinks to each RFC are provided below the diagram.

1.2.  Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Adherence to the NMDA

   This document is compliant with the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  For instance, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore],
   trust anchors and keys installed during manufacturing are expected to
   appear in <operational>.

2.  The "ietf-ssh-common" Module

   The SSH common model presented in this section contains identities
   and groupings common to both SSH clients and SSH servers.  The
   "transport-params-grouping" grouping can be used to configure the
   list of SSH transport algorithms permitted by the SSH client or SSH
   server.  The lists of algorithms are ordered such that, if multiple
   algorithms are permitted by the client, the algorithm that appears
   first in its list that is also permitted by the server is used for
   the SSH transport layer connection.  The ability to restrict the
   algorithms allowed is provided in this grouping for SSH clients and
   SSH servers that are capable of doing so and may serve to make SSH
   clients and SSH servers compliant with security policies.

   Features are defined for algorithms that are OPTIONAL or are not
   widely supported by popular implementations.  Note that the list of
   algorithms is not exhaustive.  As well, some algorithms that are
   REQUIRED by [RFC4253] are missing, notably "ssh-dss" and "diffie-
   hellman-group1-sha1" due to their weak security and there being
   alternatives that are widely supported.

2.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-ssh-common" module in
   terms of its features, identities, and groupings.

2.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-ssh-common" module:

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

   Comments:

   *  The diagram shows that there are four base identities.
   *  These identities are used by this module to define algorithms for
      public-key, key-exchange, encryption, and MACs.
   *  These base identities are "abstract", in the object oriented
      programming sense, in that they only define a "class" of
      algorithms, rather than a specific algorithm.

2.1.3.  Groupings

   The "ietf-ssh-common" module defines the following "grouping"
   statement:

   *  transport-params-grouping

   This grouping is presented in the following subsection.

2.1.3.1.  The "transport-params-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "transport-
   params-grouping" grouping:

     grouping transport-params-grouping
       +-- host-key
       |  +-- host-key-alg*   identityref
       +-- key-exchange
       |  +-- key-exchange-alg*   identityref
       +-- encryption
       |  +-- encryption-alg*   identityref
       +-- mac
          +-- mac-alg*   identityref

   Comments:

   *  This grouping is used by both the "ssh-client-grouping" and the
      "ssh-server-grouping" groupings defined in Section 3.1.2.1 and
      Section 4.1.2.1, respectively.

   *  This grouping enables client and server configurations to specify
      the algorithms that are to be used when establishing SSH sessions.

   *  Each list is "ordered-by user".

2.1.4.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-ssh-common" module defines only "grouping" statements that
   are used by other modules to instantiate protocol-accessible nodes.

2.2.  Example Usage

   This following example illustrates how the "transport-params-
   grouping' grouping appears when populated with some data.

   <!-- The outermost element below doesn't exist in the data model. -->
   <!--  It simulates if the "grouping" were a "container" instead.  -->

3.  The "ietf-ssh-client" Module

   This section defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module called "ietf-ssh-
   client".  A high-level overview of the module is provided in
   Section 3.1.  Examples illustrating the module's use are provided in
   Examples (Section 3.2).  The YANG module itself is defined in
   Section 3.3.

3.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-ssh-client" module in
   terms of its features and groupings.

3.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-ssh-client" module:

   Features:
     +-- ssh-client-transport-params-config
     +-- ssh-client-keepalives
     +-- userauth-password
     +-- userauth-publickey
     +-- userauth-hostbased
     +-- userauth-none

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

3.1.2.  Groupings

   The "ietf-ssh-client" module defines the following "grouping"
   statement:

   *  ssh-client-grouping

   This grouping is presented in the following subsection.

3.1.2.1.  The "ssh-client-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "ssh-client-
   grouping" grouping:

   Comments:

   *  The "client-identity" node configures a "username" and
      authentication methods, each enabled by a "feature" statement
      defined in Section 3.1.1.

   *  The "server-authentication" node configures trust anchors for
      authenticating the SSH server, with each option enabled by a
      "feature" statement.

   *  The "transport-params" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures parameters for the SSH sessions established by this
      configuration.

   *  The "keepalives" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures a "presence" container for testing the aliveness of the
      SSH server.  The aliveness-test occurs at the SSH protocol layer.

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "local-or-keystore-asymmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-end-entity-cert-with-key-grouping"
         grouping is discussed in Section 2.1.3.6 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-public-keys-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.2 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-certs-grouping" grouping is discussed
         in Section 2.1.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "transport-params-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.3.1 in this document.

3.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-ssh-client" module defines only "grouping" statements that
   are used by other modules to instantiate protocol-accessible nodes.

3.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples showing the "ssh-client-grouping"
   grouping populated with some data.  These examples are effectively
   the same except the first configures the client identity using a
   local key while the second uses a key configured in a keystore.  Both
   examples are consistent with the examples presented in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   The following configuration example uses local-definitions for the
   client identity and server authentication:

4.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-ssh-server" module in
   terms of its features and groupings.

4.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-ssh-server" module:

   Features:
     +-- ssh-server-transport-params-config
     +-- ssh-server-keepalives
     +-- local-users-supported
     +-- userauth-publickey
     +-- userauth-password
     +-- userauth-hostbased
     +-- userauth-none

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

4.1.2.  Groupings

   The "ietf-ssh-server" module defines the following "grouping"
   statement:

   *  ssh-server-grouping

   This grouping is presented in the following subsection.

4.1.2.1.  The "ssh-server-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "ssh-server-
   grouping" grouping:

   Comments:

   *  The "server-identity" node configures the authentication methods
      the server can use to identify itself to clients.  The ability to
      use a certificate is enabled by a "feature".

   *  The "client-authentication" node configures trust anchors for
      authenticating the SSH client, with each option enabled by a
      "feature" statement.

   *  The "transport-params" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures parameters for the SSH sessions established by this
      configuration.

   *  The "keepalives" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures a "presence" container for testing the aliveness of the
      SSH client.  The aliveness-test occurs at the SSH protocol layer.

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "local-or-keystore-asymmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-end-entity-cert-with-key-grouping"
         grouping is discussed in Section 2.1.3.6 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-public-keys-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.2 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-certs-grouping" grouping is discussed
         in Section 2.1.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "transport-params-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.3.1 in this document.

4.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-ssh-server" module defines only "grouping" statements that
   are used by other modules to instantiate protocol-accessible nodes.

4.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples showing the "ssh-server-grouping"
   grouping populated with some data.  These examples are effectively
   the same except the first configures the server identity using a
   local key while the second uses a key configured in a keystore.  Both
   examples are consistent with the examples presented in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   The following configuration example uses local-definitions for the
   server identity and client authentication:

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  The "ietf-ssh-common" YANG Module

   The "ietf-ssh-common" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-all" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   None of the writable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-write" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

5.2.  The "ietf-ssh-client" YANG Module

   The "ietf-ssh-client" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)

   One readable data node defined in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  This node is
   as follows:

   *  The "client-identity/password" node:

         The cleartext "password" node defined in the "ssh-client-
         grouping" grouping is additionally sensitive to read operations
         such that, in normal use cases, it should never be returned to
         a client.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
         all" has been applied to it.

      |  Please be aware that this module uses the "key" and "private-
      |  key" nodes from the "ietf-crypto-types" module
      |  [I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types], where said nodes have the NACM
      |  extension "default-deny-all" set, thus preventing unrestricted
      |  read-access to the cleartext key values.

   All of the writable data nodes defined by this module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  For
   instance, any modification to a key or reference to a key may
   dramatically alter the implemented security policy.  For this reason,
   the NACM extension "default-deny-write" has been set for all data
   nodes defined in this module.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

5.3.  The "ietf-ssh-server" YANG Module

   The "ietf-ssh-server" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-all" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for SSH Clients and Servers         May 2021


   *  Removed the groupings 'listening-ssh-client-grouping' and
      'listening-ssh-server-grouping'.  Now modules only contain the
      transport-independent groupings.

   *  Simplified the "client-auth" part in the ietf-ssh-client module.
      It now inlines what it used to point to keystore for.

   *  Added cipher suites for various algorithms into new 'ietf-ssh-
      common' module.

A.3.  02 to 03

   *  Removed 'RESTRICTED' enum from 'password' leaf type.

   *  Added a 'must' statement to container 'server-auth' asserting that
      at least one of the various auth mechanisms must be specified.

   *  Fixed description statement for leaf 'trusted-ca-certs'.

A.4.  03 to 04

   *  Change title to "YANG Groupings for SSH Clients and SSH Servers"

   *  Added reference to RFC 6668

   *  Added RFC 8174 to Requirements Language Section.

   *  Enhanced description statement for ietf-ssh-server's "trusted-ca-
      certs" leaf.

   *  Added mandatory true to ietf-ssh-client's "client-auth" 'choice'
      statement.

   *  Changed the YANG prefix for module ietf-ssh-common from 'sshcom'
      to 'sshcmn'.

   *  Removed the compression algorithms as they are not commonly
      configurable in vendors' implementations.

   *  Updating descriptions in transport-params-grouping and the
      servers's usage of it.

   *  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   *  Updated YANG to use typedefs around leafrefs to common keystore
      paths

   *  Now inlines key and certificates (no longer a leafref to keystore)

      containers.

   *  Fixed a couple references (section 2 --> section 3)

   *  In the server model, replaced <client-cert-auth> with <client-
      authentication> and introduced 'local-or-external' choice.

A.14.  13 to 14

   *  Updated examples to reflect ietf-crypto-types change (e.g.,
      identities --> enumerations)

   *  Updated "server-authentication" and "client-authentication" nodes
      from being a leaf of type "ts:host-keys-ref" or "ts:certificates-
      ref" to a container that uses "ts:local-or-truststore-host-keys-
      grouping" or "ts:local-or-truststore-certs-grouping".

   *  Augmented-in "must" expressions ensuring that locally-defined
      public-key-format are "ct:ssh-public-key-format" (must expr for
      ref'ed keys are TBD).
