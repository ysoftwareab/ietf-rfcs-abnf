         DNS Extension to provide Default (Preferred) Protocol
                     draft-pkupisie-dnsop-dprot-00


Abstract

   This document defines extension to the Domain Name System to support
   Default Protocol. Default Protocol extension allows owners of the
   resources to determine which are preferred protocols to be used with
   their Services (i.e. https protocol to be preferred instead of http
   for specific servers).

1  Introduction

   Currently applications are not able to determine what are default
   protocols which are used for specific Internet hosts. 

   Taking Web Browser as an example: It is relying on user to choose
   http [RFC2616] or https [RFC2818] during initial connection. If user
   specifies http://rfc-editor.org initial connection will be done using
   http on port 80, if user enters https://rfc-editor.org Browser will
   use https as protocol on port 443.

   However, If user does not specify protocol at all (i.e. puts in the
   address bar of Web Browser rfc-editor.org instead of http://rfc-
   editor.org or https://rfc-editor.org), application needs to decide
   which protocol should be used. This is done based on local settings
   (i.e. default configuration of Web Browser) and usually is not host-
   specific. Most of current Web Browsers will use http:// as default
   protocol (with some exceptios, see chapter 1.1 "State of Art")

   If specific service i.e. Online Banking wants to recommend specific
   protocol, it might use application layer protocol to redirect the
   application to different protocol. For example if initial connection
   is done to http://rfc-editor.org, there might be Redirect message
   (HTTP 302) used to redirect Browser to https://rfc-editor.org
   (alternatively html redirect might be used).

   In that scenario redirect is done using non-secure connection (http),
   which allows potential man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect user to
   different webpage, or perform redirect using the same non-secure
   protocol (http://rfc.org redirecting to http://rfc.org/index.html
   instead of https://rfc.org/index.html).

   Essentially applications are relying on user to choose proper
   protocol. If user does not specify protocol applications need to
   choose specific protocol (for user's convenience). 

   Aim of Default Protocol extension is to allow Service Owner i.e.
   Online Banking Service to specific that for that specific host given
   default protocol will be used. I.e. for rfc-editor.org default
   protocol could say that default protocol is https, allowing browser
   to directly attempt https as initial connection. VPN Terminator owner
   could say that IPSEC protocol is preferred over SSL etc.

1.1  State of Art

   One of similar solutions (limited to Web only though) is HTTP Strict
   Transport Security (HSTS) [HSTS]. Disadvantage of HSTS is that
   initial connection is still done using HTTP unless address is

   statically defined, in browser, as HTTPS only (HSTS Pre-Loaded List).
   Since this does not scale and it is Web specific, DPROT is being
   proposed (not as alternative to HSTS, but more as supplement to
   replace HSTS Pre-Loaded List).

1.2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2   Publishing

   Domain owners who would like to specify default protocols for
   specific ports MUST use TXT extensions in following format:

   rfc-editor.org	TXT  "DPROT=https"

   rfc-editor.org	TXT  "DPROT=ssh"

   rfc-editor.org	TXT  "DPROT=ipsec"

   192.168.10.15	TXT  "DPROT=https"

   Protocol names should be used as defined by IANA in [RFC6335]


4   Application side implementation

   Implementation on the Application side queries it's DNS Server for
   TXT record type entries for the host that Application is about to
   connect to (unless protocol is specifically given by user, i.e. by
   using http:// specifically in the Web Browser).

   For example Web Browser after user puts rfc-editor.org (without
   protocol) in the address bar, queries DNS Server for TXT query type
   with host rfc-editor.org. DNS returns entry:

   rfc-editor.org	TXT  "DPROT=https"

   Based on that Web Browser MUST use https://rfc.org as initial
   connection attempt. 

   If the https connection fails Web Browser SHOULD alert the user and
   by default not attempt to fallback to http protocol. Fallback to
   different protocol SHOULD happen only after explicit customer's
   permission.

   In case there is no DPROT entry for specific host, it's up to
   application's implementation on which protocol should be used. 

4.1 Application implementation: Various Service Types It might happen
   that for specific host there will be multiple different default
   protocols specified for multiple different type of services
   (Web/VPN/Remote Connection etc.). In example: rfc-editor.org	TXT 
   "DPROT=https"

   rfc-editor.org	TXT  "DPROT=ssh"

   rfc-editor.org	TXT  "DPROT=ipsec"

   It's up to application to understand which protocols are relevant to
   the specific use cases. Web Browser SHOULD be aware that https is
   relevant, ignoring ssh and ipsec.


5  DNS Security Considerations

   Hence original DNS design does not provide any mechanism to prevent
   man-in-middle attacks, DNS Security solutions like DNSSEC SHOULD be
   used [DNSSEC]
