Abstract

   This document creates a new top level service URN for 
   transformations to be used by location-to-service translation 
   protocol (LoST) to convert similar values into a different format of
   choice.  Within this 'transformations' URN, there are two 
   sub-elements specifically created for geocoding and reverse 
   geocoding location formats by this document.

1.  Introduction  

   This document creates a URN for transformations to be used by LoST 
   (Location-to-Service Translation Protocol) [RFC5222].  Today, the 
   most obvious transformation using LoST is from one location format 
   to another.  Within each LoST request, there is a location provided,
   along with a service URN the LoST server uses to determine which URI
   to give in the LoST response, based on the location of the 
   requester.  Fundamentally, LoST handles most locations - most likely
   in both the geodetic and civic formats [RFC4119].  It seems only 
   logical to ask the LoST server, who likely has both location formats
   loaded, to transform one location format to the other format.  

   Transforming a geodetic coordinate pair to a civic location address 
   is called geocoding. The reverse, transforming a civic address into 
   a geodetic coordinate pair is called reverse-geocoding.  If a LoST 
   server does not have both formats present for this transformation, 
   but knows of a remote server to contact for such an operation, the 
   LoST server returns the URI of that remote server in the LoST 
   response, leaving it to the host to request this conversion of 
   formats.  This latter operation will likely not be done using LoST, 
   but rather a protocol such as HTTP(S).  This document does not 
   specify how this latter transaction occurs.


2.  One Transaction Verses Two

   Strictly speaking, LoST is about including a URN of a service, and 
   the location of the requester in a request message, and getting a 
   response message that includes the URI of who the original requester
   needs to contact for that service.  In some cases, for

Internet-Draft          LoST Transformations                   Mar 2010

   transformations, a LoST server can possess multiple formats of the 
   same information. This is most true for location information in two 
   different formats.  If a user wants to convert, or transform one 
   location format to another, it can ask a LoST server for who to 
   contact to make this conversion or transformation.  On the other 
   hand, and within the same LoST request (implicit or explicit), if 
   the LoST server has both formats of the same location - it should be
   able to respond with the transformation.  This increases the 
   user/device experience and makes everything more efficient by 
   reducing the number of transactions to get the information to the 
   asking party.

   If the LoST server cannot perform this transformation, or is 
   unwilling to, the LoST response should include only the URI of the 
   server to be connected for this transformation.

   With this as a background, here are two possibilities for a LoST 
   query for location transformation:  

   Option #1 - For LoST servers that have the transformation 
               information local to it, or otherwise chooses to have a 
               single LoST transaction fulfill the transformation 
               request, the response can have the transformation in the
               response.  

   Option #2 - For time in which a LoST server does not have the 
               transformation information local (or decides it does not
               want to go fetch the information requested for a single 
               LoST transaction with the requester), or otherwise does 
               not want to provide this transformation information in a
               single transaction - the LoST server can merely provide 
               a URI of the server that can answer this transformation 
               query in the LoST response.

   This document leaves it up to the implementation to decide which way
   it wants to go - of the 2 choices above.  

   If a transformation cannot be performed by the LoST server, the 
   response SHOULD contain the URI of where to contact that can do this
   service, or provide an error indicating it cannot.


3. Transformations URN

   This document creates the service URN for transformations to be used
   by the LoST protocol, as shown here:

      urn:service:transformations

   This URN is for converting a dissimilar values meaning the same 
   thing into another format, perhaps to a specified format, based on 
   the LoST request.  For example, transforming civic location format

Internet-Draft          LoST Transformations                   Mar 2010

   value into a coordinate pair location format value.

3.1 Sub-Services for the 'transformation' Service

   This section defines the transformation service using the top-level 
   service label 'transformation'.

           urn:service:transformation   
           urn:service:transformation.geocoding   
           urn:service:transformation.reverse-geocoding   

   Other transformations can be added to this document as it 
   progresses.


4.  An Example Transformation

   [section under construction]

   [Editor's Note: this will show a LoST request, along with 2 LoST 
                   responses - one showing the transformation in the 
                   LoST response, the other showing the URI to be 
                   contacted for the transformation.]


5.  Security considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations from 
   that in RFC 5222, the LoST specification, or in RFC 5031, the URN 
   Services specification.


6.  IANA considerations

6.1.  Sub-Services for the 'transformation' Service

   This section defines the service registration within the IANA
   registry, using the top-level service label 'transformation'.

    urn:service:transformation 'transformation' service denotes a 
        top-level service, and it encompasses all of the services 
        listed below.

    urn:service:transformation.geocoding This service identifier is 
        used to indicate a conversion from a geodetic coordinate-pair 
        location format to a civic location format is desired.

    urn:service:transformation.reverse-geocoding This service 
        identifier is used to indicate a conversion from a civic 
        location format to a geodetic coordinate-pair location format 
        is desired.

   transformation services.
