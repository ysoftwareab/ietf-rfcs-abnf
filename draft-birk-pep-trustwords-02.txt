     IANA Registration of Trustword Lists: Guide, Template and IANA
                             Considerations
                      draft-birk-pep-trustwords-02

Abstract

   This document specifies the IANA Registration Guidelines for
   Trustwords, describes corresponding registration procedures, and
   provides a guideline for creating Trustword list specifications.

   Trustwords are common words in a natural language (e.g., English) to
   which the hexadecimal strings are mapped to.  This makes verification
   processes (e.g., comparison of fingerprints), more practical and less
   prone to misunderstandings.

1.  Introduction

   In public-key cryptography comparing the public keys' fingerprints of
   the communication partners involved is vital to ensure that there is
   no man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the communication channel.
   Fingerprints normally consist of a chain of hexadecimal chars.
   However, comparing hexadecimal strings is often impractical for
   regular human users and prone to misunderstandings.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration of Trustword Lists         June 2018


   To mitigate these challenges, several systems offer the comparison of
   Trustwords as an alternative to hexadecimal strings.  Trustwords are
   common words in a natural language (e.g., English) to which the
   hexadecimal strings are mapped to.  This makes the verification
   process more natural for human users.

   For example, in pEp's proposition of Privacy by Default
   [I-D.birk-pep] Trustwords are used to achieve easy contact
   verification for end-to-end encryption.  Trustword comparison is
   offered after the peers have exchanged public keys opportunistically.
   Examples for Trustword lists used by current pEp implementations can
   be found in CSV format, here:
   https://pep.foundation/dev/repos/pEpEngine/file/tip/db.

   In addition to contact verification, Trustwords are also used for
   other purposes, such as Human-Readable 128-bit Keys [RFC1751], One
   Time Passwords (OTP) [RFC1760] [RFC2289], SSH host-key verification,
   VPN Server certificate verification, and to import or synchronize
   secret key across different devices of the same user
   [E-D.birk-pep-keysync].  Further ideas include to use Trustwords for
   contact verification in Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   (XMPP) [RFC6120], for X.509 [RFC3647] certificate verification in
   browsers or in block chain applications for crypto currencies.

2.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   o  Handshake: The process when Alice - e.g. in-person or via phone -
      contacts Bob to verify Trustwords (or by fallback: fingerprints)
      is called handshake.  [E-D.birk-pep-handshake]

   o  Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM): cf. [RFC4949]

3.  The Concept of Trustword Mapping

3.1.  Example

   A fingerprint typically looks like:

      F482 E952 2F48 618B 01BC 31DC 5428 D7FA ACDC 3F13

   Its mapping to English Trustwords could look like:

      dog house brother town fat bath school banana kite task

   Or its mapping to German Trustwords could like like:

      klima gelb lappen weg trinken alles kaputt rasen rucksack durch

   Instead of the former hexadecimal string, users can compare ten
   common words of their language.

   Note: This examples are for illustration purposes only and do not
   make use any any published Trustword list.

3.2.  Previous work

   The basic concept of Trustwords mapping has been already documented
   in the past, e.g. for use in One-Time Passwords (OTP) [RFC1751]
   [RFC1760] [RFC2289] or the PGP Word List ("Pretty Good Privacy word
   list" [PGP.wl], also called a biometric word list, to compare
   fingerprints.

   Regarding today's needs, previous proposals have the following
   shortcomings:

   o  Limited number of Trustwords (small Trustword dictionaries), which
      generally results in more Trustwords to be compared

   o  Usually only available in English language, which does not
      normally allow its usage by non-English speakers in a secure
      manner

   Furthermore, there are differences in the basic concept:

   o  This work allows for better tailoring the target audience to
      ordinary human users, i.e. not technical stuff (or IT geeks) only.

   o  As in many usage scenarios the Trustwords are only read (and
      compared), but not written down nor typed in by humans, there is a
      less strong need to keep the Trustwords themselves short.  One
      such scenario is to use a side channel (e.g. phone) to compare the
      Trustwords.  In fact longer Trustwords increases increase the
      entropy, as the dictionary is larger and the likelihood for
      phonetic collision can be decreased.

3.3.  Number of Trustwords for a language

   If the number of Trustwords is low, a lot of Trustwords need to be
   compared, which make a comparison somewhat cumbersome for users.
   This may lead to degraded usability.





Birk, et al.            Expires December 28, 2018               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration of Trustword Lists         June 2018


   To reduce the number of Trustwords to compare, in pEp's proposition
   of Privacy by Default [I-D.birk-pep] 16-bit scalars are mapped to
   natural language words.  Therefore, the size (by number of key -
   value pairs) of any key - value pair structure is 65536.  However,
   the number of unique values to be used in a language may be less than
   65536.  This can be addressed e.g. by using the same value
   (Trustword) for more than one key.  In these cases, the entropy of
   the representation is slightly reduced.  (Example: A Trustwords list
   of just 42000 words still allows for an entropy of log_2(42000) ~=
   15.36 bits in 16-bit mappings.)

   On the other hand, small sized Trustword lists allow for Trustwords
   with shorter strings, which are easier to use in scenarios where
   Trustwords have to be typed in e.g.  OTP applications.

   The specification allows for different dictionary sizes.

3.4.  Language

   Although English is rather widespread around the world, the vast
   majority of the worlds' population does not speak English.  For an
   application to be useful for ordinary people, localization is a must.
   Thus, Trustword lists in different languages can be registered.

   For applications where two human establish communication it is very
   likely that they share a common language.  So far no real use case
   for translations between Trustword lists in different languages has
   been identified.  As translations also drastically increases the
   complexity for IANA registrations, translations of Trustwords beyond
   the scope of this document.

3.5.  The nature of the words

   Every Trustwords list SHOULD be cleared from swearwords in order to
   not offense users.  This is a task to be carried out by speakers of
   the respective natural language (i.e., by native language speakers).

4.  IANA Considerations

   Each natural language requires a different set of Trustwords.  To
   allow implementers for identical Trustword lists, a IANA registry is
   to be established.  The IANA registration policy according to
   [RFC8126] is "Expert Review" and "Specification Required".

   [[ Note: Further details of the IANA registry and requirements for
   the expert to assess the specification are for further study.  A
   similar approach as used in [RFC6117] is likely followed. ]]

   Authors of a Wordlist are encouraged to use these XML chunks as a
   template to create the IANA Registration Template.

4.2.  IANA Registration

   An IANA registration will contain the fallowing elements:

4.2.1.  Language Code (<languagecode>)

   The language code follows the ISO 639-3 specification [ISO693], e.g.,
   eng, deu.

   [[ Note: It is for further study, which of the ISO 639 Specifications
   is most suitable to address the Trustwords' challenge. ]]

   Example usage for German:

   e.g.  <languagecode>deu</languagecode>

4.2.2.  Bit Size (<bitsize>)

   The bit size is the number of bits that can be mapped with the
   Wordlist.  The number of registered words in a word list MUST be 2 ^
   "(<bitsize>)".

   Example usage for 16-bit Wordlist:

   e.g.  <bitsize>16</bitsize>

4.2.3.  Number Of Unique Words (<numberofuniquewords>)

   The number of unique words that are registered.

   e.g.  <numberofuniquewords>65536</numberofuniquewords>

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration of Trustword Lists         June 2018


4.2.4.  Bijectivity (<bijective>)

   Whether the registered Wordlist has a one-to-one mapping, meaning the
   number of unique words registered equals 2 ^ "(<bitsize>)".

   Valid content: ( yes | no )

   e.g.  <bijective>yes</bijective>

4.2.5.  Version (<version>)

   The version of the Wordlist MUST be unique within a language code.

   [[ Note: Requirements to a "smart" composition of the version number
   are for further study ]]

   e.g.  <version>b.1.2</version>

4.2.6.  Registration Document(s) (<registrationdocs>)

   Reference(s) to the Document(s) containing the Wordlist

   e.g.  <registrationdocs>
           <xref type="rfc" data="rfc4979"/>
         </registrationdocs>

   e.g.  <registrationdocs>
           <xref type="rfc" data="rfc8888"/> (obsoleted by RFC 9999)
           <xref type="rfc" data="rfc9999"/>
         </registrationdocs>

   e.g.  <registrationdocs>

           ITU-F Recommendation B.193, Release 73, Mar 2009.]
         </registrationdocs>

4.2.7.  Requesters (<requesters>)

   The persons requesting the registration of the Wordlist.  Usually
   these are the authors of the Wordlist.

         </people>

   Note: If there is more than one requester, there must be one <xref>
   element per requester in the <requesters> element, and one <person>
   chunk per requester in the <people> element.

4.2.8.  Further Information (<additionalinfo>)

   Any other information the authors deem interesting.

   e.g.  <additionalinfo>
           <paragraph>more info goes here</paragraph>

   Note: If there is no such additional information, then the
   <additionalinfo> element is omitted.

4.2.9.  Wordlist (<wordlist>)

   The full Wordlist to be registered.  The number of words MUST be a
   power of 2 as specified above.  The element names serve as key used
   for enumeration of the Trustwords (starting at 0) and the elements
   contains the values being individual natural language words in the
   respective language.

   e.g.  <wordlist>
           <w0>first</w0>
           <w1>second</w1>
           [...]
           <w65535>last<w65535>

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration of Trustword Lists         June 2018


      *  e.g.  XML, CSV, ...

      *  Syntax for non-ASCII letters or language symbols (UTF-8) in
         Wordlists

   o  Need for optional entropy value assigned to words, to account for
      similar phonetics among words in the same wordlist?

   o  Need for an additional field, to define what a wordlist is
      optimized for, e.g., "entropy", "minimize word lengths", ...?

   o  Work out (requirements for) "smart" composition of the version
      number

   o  Decide whether in non-bijective Wordlists the redundant words need
      to be repeated in the IANA Registration

   o  Register only a hash over the wordlist with IANA?

   o  Does it make sense to open registrations for other patterns than
      just words, e.g., images?
