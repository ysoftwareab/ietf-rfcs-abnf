Internet-Draft       Defines Media subtype 'Disclaimer'     April 2009

Abstract

This memo defines a new media subtype of Disclaimer to the media type 'Message'. 
Disclaimers are being used as a legal and commercial message that is 
intended to protect the interest of the sender and the recipient.
At present form the disclaimers are messy to handle with multiple appends
to an Email messageconversation, making the Email bulky and difficult comprehend.

Internet-Draft      Defines Media subtype 'Disclaimer'      April 2009

1.	Email exchange logic assumed

There are various mail exchange phases in which the Disclaimers can be added
and they are briefed below:

1.1 Initiation phase:

In this phase a sender initiates an email message conversation to a inter-org
or intra-org recipient and the sender's mail server append/prepend the
disclaimer, initiating the cycle.

1.2 Reply/Acknowledgement phase:

In this phase, the recipient in the Initiation phase swaps roles and replies
to the message. The mail server of the sender again append/prepend the
disclaimer to the mail, which already has a disclaimer in it. Most of the
conversations end in this phase, but the exchange continues to the next phase as well.

1.3 Conversation phase:

In this phase the roles are swapped again and Sender sends a reply, converting
the mail exchange to a complete conversation, which can be terminated at
any point at will by either the sending or the receiving party.
In this phase to avoid re-addition of the disclaimer, the 'Disclaiming domain'
parameter will be used to check if the message already has the disclaimer
from the domain, if so, will skip the mail from the disclaimer attachment process.

2.Scenarios covered
This media sub-type can cover the following scenarios, which are not exhaustive.

2.1 Intra-domain exchange:

Email message conversation that happens between users in same SMTP domain space,
but in different entities, that disclaim only for themselves.

2.2 Inter-domain conversation:

Email conversations that happen between two different SMTP namespace, 
this is the usual scenario in which the mails are exchanges between
two separate organizations, which disclaim.

3.	Parameters

Content-type: message/disclaimer Parameters
This sub-type is intended to handle disclaimers as integral but isolated
part of Email message body. The parameters for this subtype are:

3.1 Disclaiming domain (DD).
3.2 Disclaimer Action (DA). - Optional
3.3 Department Identification (DID). - Optional
3.4 Boundary

3.1 Disclaiming domain (DD):

This parameter required to indicate the domain that owns the disclaimer and
the value of the parameter would contain the SMTP name of the domain that is
sending the message which is after '@' separator in the email address of the sender.

Example: Sender - user@corp.domain.com then DD would be 'corp.domain.com'

3.2 Disclaimer Action (DA):

This optional parameter defines whether a disclaimer should be 'appended' or
'pre-pended'. The default value for this parameter would be 'append'.
If left unspecified or if the parameter is omitted, the default action
would be to append the disclaimer.

3.3 Department Identification (DID):

This recommended parameter is intended to be used in the scenarios where
different disclaiming entities share the same SMTP namespace. The value
of this parameter needs to be unique in a SMTP domain and should only be
minimum 1 character to a maximum of 8 characters long.

3.4 Boundary:

This parameter is required to specify the boundary of the Disclaimer message
data and follows the same norms as defined in the RFC 2045 and RFC 2046.
The content of the Disclaimer will be handled like a normal message body
inside the disclaimer boundary. So the disclaimers can contain text, jpeg
files and other media types as necessary.

Internet-Draft       Defines Media subtype 'Disclaimer'         April 2009

4. Example
Below is an example that shows the usage.
Content-Type: Message/Disclaimer;
Disclaiming-Domain= Microsoft.com; Disclaimer-Action: Prepend; Department-Identification= Finance; boundary="--sample boundary"

----sample boundary
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;             boundary="--first boundary"

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

----first boundary
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;      boundary="--second boundary"

----second boundary
Content-Type: text/plain;
              charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

<the plain text disclaimer goes here>

----second boundary
Content-Type: text/html;
	charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

<HTML version of Disclaimer goes here along with CID for usage of Images as defined in RFC 2392>

--second boundary--
--first boundary--
--sample boundary--



In simple terms, the disclaimer media subtype is intended to sanitize the
handling of message disclaimer and avoid duplicates and organize them in a
better way as advancements in Email clients and server demand in clear as
well as rich messages that catches the attention of the reader.

Disclaimer content apart from its purpose/usage it is simply an extension
of message body and has all the properties and norms of a message body.

5.	Encoding consideration

All the encoding defined in RFC 2045 for the message body can be used for
Disclaimer content as well, as disclaimer is just treated as an isolated
part of the message body.

6.	Security consideration

Disclaimers can contain all the media types that are defined for a message
body and hence the security consideration outlined in the RFC of the media
list given in http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/ will apply.

7.	IANA Considerations

This document defines the 'Disclaimer' media subtype for the 'message'
media type. Registration in the standards tree

8.	Normative references
