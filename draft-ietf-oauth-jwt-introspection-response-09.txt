1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection [RFC7662] specifies a method for a
   protected resource to query an OAuth 2.0 authorization server to
   determine the state of an access token and obtain data associated
   with the access token.  This enables deployments to implement opaque
   access tokens in an interoperable way.

   The introspection response, as specified in OAuth 2.0 Token
   Introspection [RFC7662], is a plain JSON object.  However, there are
   use cases where the resource server requires stronger assurance that
   the authorization server issued the token introspection response for
   an access token, including cases where the authorization server
   assumes liability for the content of the token introspection
   response.  An example is a resource server using verified person data
   to create certificates, which in turn are used to create qualified
   electronic signatures.

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                    April 2020


   In such use cases it may be useful or even required to return a
   signed JWT [RFC7519] as the introspection response.  This
   specification extends the token introspection endpoint with the
   capability to return responses as JWTs.

2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Resource Server Management

   The authorization server (AS) and the resource server (RS) maintain a
   strong two-way trust relationship.  The resource server relies on the
   authorization server to obtain authorization, user and other data as
   input to its access control decisions and service delivery.  The
   authorization server relies on the resource server to handle the
   provided data appropriately.

   In the context of this specification, the Token Introspection
   Endpoint is used to convey such security data and potentially also
   privacy sensitive data related to an access token.

   In order to process the introspection requests in a secure and
   privacy-preserving manner, the authorization server MUST be able to
   identify, authenticate and authorize resource servers.

   To support encrypted token introspection response JWTs, the
   authorization server MUST also be provided with the respective
   resource server encryption keys and algorithms.

   The authorization server MUST be able to determine whether an RS is
   the audience for a particular access token and what data it is
   entitled to receive, otherwise the RS is not authorized to obtain
   data for the access token.  The AS has the discretion how to fulfil
   this requirement.  The AS could, for example, maintain a mapping
   between scopes values and resource servers.

   The requirements given above imply that the authorization server
   maintains credentials and other configuration data for each RS.

   One way is by utilizing dynamic client registration [RFC7591] and
   treating every RS as an OAuth client.  In this case, the
   authorization server is assumed to at least maintain "client_id" and
   "token_endpoint_auth_method" with complementary authentication method

   metadata, such as "jwks" or "client_secret".  In cases where the AS
   needs to acquire consent to transmit data to a RS, the following
   client metadata fields are recommended: "client_name", "client_uri",
   "contacts", "tos_uri", "policy_uri".

   The AS MUST restrict the use of client credentials by a RS to the
   calls it requires, e.g. the AS MAY restrict such a client to call the
   token introspection endpoint only.  How the AS implements this
   restriction is beyond the scope of this specification.

   This specification further introduces client metadata to manage the
   configuration options required to sign and encrypt token
   introspection response JWTs.

4.  Requesting a JWT Response

   A resource server requests a JWT introspection response by including
   an "Accept" HTTP header "application/token-introspection+jwt" in the
   introspection request.

   The AS SHOULD authenticate the caller at the token introspection
   endpoint.  Authentication can utilize client authentication methods
   or a separate access token issued to the resource server.  Whether a
   resource server is required to authenticate is determined by the
   respective RS-specific policy at the AS.

   The following is a non-normative example request with client
   authentication:

   POST /introspect HTTP/1.1
   Host: as.example.com
   Accept: application/token-introspection+jwt
   Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA

5.  JWT Response

   The introspection endpoint responds with a JWT, setting the "Content-
   Type" HTTP header to "application/token-introspection+jwt" and the
   JWT "typ" ("type") header to "token-introspection+jwt".

   The JWT MUST include the following top-level claims:

   iss     MUST be set to the issuer URL of the authorization server.

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                    April 2020


   aud     MUST identify the resource server receiving the token
           introspection response.

   iat     MUST be set to the time when the introspection response was
           created by the authorization server.

   token_introspection  A JSON object containing the members of the
           token introspection response, as specified in the "OAuth
           Token Introspection Response" registry established by
           [RFC7662] as well as other members.  The separation of the
           introspection members into a dedicated containing JWT claim
           is intended to prevent conflict and confusion with top-level
           JWT claims that may bear the same name.

           If the access token is invalid, expired, revoked, or is not
           intended for the calling resource server (audience), the
           authorization server MUST set the value of the "active"
           member in the "token_introspection" claim to "false" and
           other members MUST NOT be included.  Otherwise, the "active"
           member is set to "true".

           If possible, the AS MUST narrow down the "scope" value to the
           scopes relevant to the particular RS.

           Claims from the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry that are
           commonly used in [OpenID.Core] and can be applied to the
           resource owner MAY be included as members in the
           "token_introspection" claim.  They can serve to convey the
           privileges delegated to the client, to identify the resource
           owner as a natural person or to provide a required contact
           detail, such as an e-Mail address or phone number.  When
           transmitting such claims the AS acts as an identity provider
           in regard to the RS.  The AS determines based on its RS-
           specific policy what claims about the resource owner to
           return in the token introspection response.

           The AS MUST ensure the release of any privacy-sensitive data
           is legally based.

           Further content of the introspection response is determined
           by the RS-specific policy at the AS.

   The JWT MAY include other claims, including those from the "JSON Web
   Token Claims" registry established by [RFC7519].  The JWT SHOULD NOT
   include the "sub" and "exp" claims as an additional prevention
   against misuse of the JWT as an access token (see Section 8.1).

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                    April 2020


   Note: Although the JWT format is widely used as an access token
   format, the JWT returned in the introspection response is not an
   alternative representation of the introspected access token and is
   not intended to be used as an access token.

   This specification registers the "application/token-
   introspection+jwt" media type, which is used as value of the "typ"
   ("type") header parameter of the JWT to indicate that the payload is
   a token introspection response.

   The JWT is cryptographically secured as specified in [RFC7662].

   Depending on the specific resource server policy the JWT is either
   signed, or signed and encrypted.  If the JWT is signed and encrypted
   it MUST be a Nested JWT, as defined in JWT [RFC7519].

   Note: If the resource server policy requires a signed and encrypted
   response and the authorization server receives an unauthenticated
   request containing an "Accept" header with content type other than
   "application/token-introspection+jwt", it MUST refuse to serve the
   request and return an HTTP status code 400.  This is done to prevent
   downgrading attacks to obtain token data intended for release to
   legitimate recipients only (see Section 8.2).

   The following is a non-normative example response (with line breaks
   for display purposes only):

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

     "alg": "RS256"

   }

   The example response JWT payload contains the following JSON
   document:

     "iat":1514797892,

           "jti":"t1FoCCaZd4Xv4ORJUWVUeTZfsKhW30CQCrWDDjwXy6w"
        }
   }

6.  Client Metadata

   The authorization server determines the algorithm to secure the JWT
   for a particular introspection response.  This decision can be based
   on registered metadata parameters for the resource server, supplied
   via dynamic client registration [RFC7591] with the resource server
   acting as a client, as specified below.

   The parameter names follow the pattern established by OpenID Connect
   Dynamic Client Registration [OpenID.Registration] for configuring
   signing and encryption algorithms for JWT responses at the UserInfo
   endpoint.

   The following client metadata parameters are introduced by this
   specification:

   introspection_signed_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS [RFC7515] algorithm
           ("alg" value) as defined in JWA [RFC7518] for signing

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                    April 2020


           introspection responses.  If this is specified, the response
           will be signed using JWS and the configured algorithm.  The
           default, if omitted, is "RS256".

   introspection_encrypted_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWE [RFC7516]
           algorithm ("alg" value) as defined in JWA [RFC7518] for
           content key encryption.  If this is specified, the response
           will be encrypted using JWE and the configured content
           encryption algorithm
           ("introspection_encrypted_response_enc").  The default, if
           omitted, is that no encryption is performed.  If both signing
           and encryption are requested, the response will be signed
           then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as
           defined in JWT [RFC7519].

   introspection_encrypted_response_enc  OPTIONAL.  JWE [RFC7516]
           algorithm ("enc" value) as defined in JWA [RFC7518] for
           content encryption of introspection responses.  The default,
           if omitted, is "A128CBC-HS256".  Note: This parameter MUST
           NOT be specified without setting
           "introspection_encrypted_response_alg".

   Resource servers may register their public encryption keys using the
   "jwks_uri" or "jwks" metadata parameters.

7.  Authorization Server Metadata

   Authorization servers SHOULD publish the supported algorithms for
   signing and encrypting the JWT of an introspection response by
   utilizing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414]
   parameters.  Resource servers use this data to parametrize their
   client registration requests.

   The following parameters are introduced by this specification:

   introspection_signing_alg_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  JSON array
           containing a list of the JWS [RFC7515] signing algorithms
           ("alg" values) as defined in JWA [RFC7518] supported by the
           introspection endpoint to sign the response.

   introspection_encryption_alg_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  JSON array
           containing a list of the JWE [RFC7516] encryption algorithms
           ("alg" values) as defined in JWA [RFC7518] supported by the
           introspection endpoint to encrypt the content encryption key
           for introspection responses (content key encryption).

   introspection_encryption_enc_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  JSON array
           containing a list of the JWE [RFC7516] encryption algorithms

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                    April 2020


           ("enc" values) as defined in JWA [RFC7518] supported by the
           introspection endpoint to encrypt the response (content
           encryption).

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Cross-JWT Confusion

   The "iss" and potentially the "aud" claim of a token introspection
   JWT can resemble those of a JWT-encoded access token.  An attacker
   could try to exploit this and pass a JWT token introspection response
   as an access token to the resource server.  The "typ" ("type") JWT
   header "token-introspection+jwt" and the encapsulation of the token
   introspection members such as "sub" and "scope" in the
   "token_introspection" claim is intended to prevent such substitution
   attacks.  Resource servers MUST therefore check the "typ" JWT header
   value of received JWT-encoded access tokens and ensure all minimally
   required claims for a valid access token are present.

   Resource servers MUST additionally apply the countermeasures against
   replay as described in [I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics], section 3.2.

   JWT Confusion and other attacks involving JWTs are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp].

8.2.  Token Data Leakage

   The authorization server MUST use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2
   (or higher) per BCP 195 [RFC7525] in order to prevent token data
   leakage.

   To prevent introspection of leaked tokens and to present an
   additional security layer against token guessing attacks the
   authorization server MAY require all requests to the token
   introspection endpoint to be authenticated.  As an alternative or as
   an addition to the authentication, the intended recipients MAY be set
   up for encrypted responses.

   In the latter case, confidentiality is ensured by the fact that only
   the legitimate recipient is able to decrypt the response.  An
   attacker could try to circumvent this measure by requesting a plain
   JSON response, using an "Accept" header with the content type set to,
   for example, "application/json" instead of "application/token-
   introspection+jwt".  To prevent this attack the authorization server
   MUST NOT serve requests with a content type other than "application/
   token-introspection+jwt" if the resource server is set up to receive
   encrypted responses (see also Section 5).

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                    April 2020


8.3.  Keeping Token Data Confidential from OAuth Clients

   Authorization servers with a policy that requires token data to be
   kept confidential from OAuth clients must require all requests to the
   token introspection endpoint to be authenticated.  As an alternative
   or as an addition to the authentication, the intended recipients may
   be set up for encrypted responses.

8.4.  Logging and Audit of Introspection Activity

   Authorization servers with a policy that requires token introspection
   activity to be logged and audited must require all requests to the
   token introspection endpoint to be authenticated.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   The token introspection response can be used to transfer personal
   identifiable information from the AS to the RS.  The AS MUST ensure a
   legal basis exists for the data transfer before any data is released
   to a particular RS.  The way the legal basis is established might
   vary among jurisdictions and MUST consider the legal entities
   involved.

   For example, the classical way to establish the legal basis is by
   explicit user consent gathered from the resource owner by the AS
   during the authorization flow.

   It is also possible that the legal basis is established out of band,
   e.g. in an explicit contract or by the client gathering the resource
   owner's consent.

   If the AS and the RS belong to the same legal entity (1st party
   scenario), there is potentially no need for an explicit user consent
   but the terms of service and policy of the respective service
   provider MUST be enforced at all times.

   In any case, the AS MUST ensure that the scope of the legal basis is
   enforced throughout the whole process.  The AS MUST retain the scope
   of the legal basis with the access token, e.g. in the scope value,
   and the AS MUST determine the data a resource server is allowed to
   receive based on the resource server's identity and suitable token
   data, e.g. the scope value.

      they match the registered media type

   o  moves the token introspection response members into a JSON object
      claim named "token_introspection" to provide isolation from the
      top-level JWT-specific claims

   o  "iss", "aud" and "iat" MUST be present as top-level JWT claims

   o  the "sub" and "exp" claims SHOULD NOT be used as top-level JWT
      claims as additional prevention against JWT access token
      substitution attacks

   -08

   o  made difference between introspected access token and
      introspection response clearer

   o  defined semantics of JWT claims overlapping between introspected
      access token and introspection response as JWT

   o  added section about RS management
