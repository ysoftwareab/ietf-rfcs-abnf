1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to provide updated information on the
   registration of the MIME Media Type "application/pdf" for documents
   defined in the PDF [ISOPDF], "Portable Document Format", syntax.  It
   obsoletes [RFC3778].

   PDF was originally envisioned as a way to reliably communicate and
   view printed information electronically across a wide variety of
   machine configurations, operating systems, and communication
   networks.

   PDF is used to represent "final form" formatted documents.  PDF pages
   may include text, images, graphics and multimedia content such as
   video and audio.  PDF is also capable of containing auxiliary
   structures including annotations, bookmarks, file attachments,
   hyperlinks, logical structure and metadata.  These features are
   useful for navigation, building collections of related documents and
   for reviewing and commenting on documents.  A rich JavaScript model
   has been defined for interacting with PDF documents.

   PDF used the imaging model of the PostScript [PS] page description
   language to render complex text, images, and graphics in a device and
   resolution-independent manner.

   PDF supports encryption and digital signatures.  The encryption
   capability is combined with access control information to facilitate
   management of the functionality available to the recipient.  PDF
   supports the inclusion of document and object-level metadata through
   the eXtensible Metadata Platform[XMP].

2.  History

   PDF is used widely in the Internet community.  The first version of
   PDF, 1.0, was published in 1993 by Adobe Systems Incorporated.  Since
   then PDF has grown to be a widely-used format for capturing and
   exchanging formatted documents electronically across the Web, via
   e-mail and virtually every other document exchange mechanism.  In
   2008, PDF 1.7 was published as an ISO standard [ISOPDF], ISO
   32000-1:2008.  It was adopted using ISO Fast-Track process and is
   technically identical to Adobe Portable Document Format version 1.7
   [AdobePDF] referenced by [RFC3778].

   The ISO TC-171 committee is presently working on a refresh of PDF,
   known as ISO 32000-2, with a version of PDF 2.0, expected to be
   published in 2017.

   In addition to ISO 32000-1:2008 and 32000-2, several subset standards
   have been defined to address specific use cases and standardized by
   the ISO.  These standards include PDF for Archival (PDF/A) [ISOPDFA],
   PDF for Engineering (PDF/E) [ISOPDFE], PDF for Universal
   Accessibility (PDF/UA) [ISOPDFUA], PDF for Variable Data and
   Transactional Printing (PDF/VT) [ISOPDFVT], and PDF for Prepress
   Digital Data Exchange (PDF/X) [ISOPDFX].  The subset standards are
   fully compliant PDF files capable of being displayed in a general PDF
   viewer.

3.  Fragment Identifiers

   Fragment identifiers appear at the end of a URI, and provide a way to
   reference an anchor to subordinate content within the target of the
   URI, or additional parameters to the process of opening the
   identified content.  The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers
   is referenced in the media type definition.

   The specification of fragment identifiers for PDF appeared originally
   in [RFC3778], but now will be included in ISO 32000-2 [ISOPDF2].
   This section is a summary of that material.  Any disagreements
   between that document and this should be resolved in favor of the ISO
   32000-2 definition, once that has been approved.

   A fragment identifier for PDF has one or more parameters, separated
   by the ampersand (&) or pound (#) character.  Each parameter consists



Hardy, et al.            Expires August 27, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               application/pdf               February 2017


   of the parameter name, "=" (equal), and the parameter value; lists of
   values are comma-separated, and parameter value strings may be URI-
   encoded ([RFC3986]).  Parameters are processed left to right.

   Coordinate values (such as <left>, <right>, <width>) are expressed in
   the default user space coordinate system of the document: 1/72 of an
   inch measured down and to the right from the upper-left corner of the
   (current) page.  ([ISOPDF2] 8.3.2.3 "User Space")

   The following parameters identify subordinate content of a PDF file,
   but also may be used to set the document view to make the (start of)
   the identified content visible:

   page=<pageNum>
      Identifies a specified (physical) page; the first page in the
      document has a pageNum value of 1.

   nameddest=<name>
      Identifies a named destination ([ISOPDF2] 12.3.2.4 "Named
      destinations").

   structelem=<structID>
      structID is a byte string with URI encoding; identifies the
      structure element with ID key within a StructElem dictionary of
      the document.

   comment=<commentID>
      The commentID is the value of an annotation name, which is defined
      by the NM key in the corresponding annotation dictionary (of the
      selected page.  ([ISOPDF2] 12.5.2 "Annotation dictionaries")

   ef=<name>
      Identifies the embedded file where the parameter string <name>
      matches a file specification dictionary in the EmbeddedFiles name
      tree.  If the "ef" parameter is not at the end of the fragment
      identifier, then the rest of the fragment identifier (after the
      ampersand or hash delimiter) is applied to the embedded file
      according to its own media type.  This allows identification of
      content within the embedded file (which itself might be a PDF
      file).

      NOTE: When opening a PDF file that is not from a trusted source,
      processor may choose to prompt the user or even prevent opening of
      the file.

   These parameters also operate on the view of the PDF document when it
   is opened.

   zoom=<scale>,<left>,<top>
      <scale> is the percentage to which the document should be zoomed,
      where a value of 100 correspond to a zoom of 100%.  <left> and
      <top> are optional, but both must be specified if either is
      included.

   view=<keyword>,<position>
      The arguments correspond to those found in [ISOPDF2] 12.3.2.2
      "Explicit destinations".  keyword is one of the keywords defined
      in [ISOPDF2] "Table 149: Destination syntax" with appropriate
      position values.

   viewrect=<left>,<top>,<width>,<height>
      Set the view rectangle.

   highlight=<left>,<right>,<top>,<bottom>
      Highlight the specified rectangle.

   search=<wordList>
      Open the document and search for one or more words, selecting the
      first matching word in the document. wordList is a string enclosed
      in quotation marks where individual words are separated by the
      space character (or %20).

   fdf=<URI>
      Imports data into PDF form fields.  The URI is either a relative
      or absolute URI to an FDF or XFDF file.  The fdf parameter should
      be specified as the last parameter to a given URI.

4.  Subset Standards

   Several subsets of PDF have been published as distinct ISO standards:

   o  PDF/X, initially released in 2001 as PDF/X-1a [ISOPDFX], specifies
      how to use PDF for graphics exchange, with the aim to fascilitate
      correct and predictable printing by print service providers.  The
      standard has gone through multiple revisions over the years and
      has several published parts, the most recently released being part
      8, specifying different levels of conformance: PDF/X-1a:2001, PDF/
      X-3:2002, PDF/X-1a:2003, PDF/X-3:2003, PDF/X-4, PDF/X-4p, PDF/
      X-5g, PDF/X-5pg and PDF/X-5n.

   o  PDF/A, initially released in 2005, specifies how to use PDF for
      long-term preservation (archiving) of electronic documents.  It
      prohibits PDF features which are not well suited to long term
      archiving of documents, including JavaScript or executable file
      launches.  Its requirements for PDF/A viewers include color
      management guidelines and support for embedded fonts.  There are



Hardy, et al.            Expires August 27, 2017                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               application/pdf               February 2017


      three parts of this standard and a total of eight conformance
      levels: PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-2u, PDF/
      A-3a, PDF/A-3b and PDF/A-3u.

   o  PDF/E, initially released in 2008 as PDF/E-1 [ISOPDFE], specifies
      how to use PDF in engineering workflows, such as manufacturing,
      construction and geospatial analysis.  Future revisions of PDF/E
      are supposed to include support for 3D PDF workflows.

   o  PDF/VT, initially released in 2010, specifies how to use PDF in
      variable and transactional printing.  It is based on PDF/X, and
      adds adidtional restrictions on PDF content elements and
      supporting metadata.  It specifies three conformance levels: PDF/
      VT-1, PDF/VT-2 and PDF/VT-2s [ISOPDFVT].

   o  PDF/UA, initially released in 2012 as PDF/UA-1 [ISOPDFUA],
      specifies how to create accessible electonic documents.  It
      requires use of ISO 32000's Tagged PDF feature, and adds many
      requirements regarding semantic correctness in applying logical
      structures to content in PDF documents.

   All of these subset standards use "application/pdf" media type.  The
   subset standards are generally not exclusive, so it is possible to
   construct a PDF file which conforms to, for example, both PDF/A-2b
   and PDF/X-4 subset standards.

   PDF documents claiming conformance to one or more of the subset
   standards use XMP metadata to identify levels of conformance.  PDF
   processors should examine document metadata streams for such subset
   standards identifiers and, if apropriate, label documents as such
   when presenting them to the user.

5.  PDF Versions

   PDF format has gone through several revisions, primarily for the
   addition of features.  PDF features have generally been added in a
   way that older viewers "fail gracefully", because they can just
   ignore features they do not recognize.  Even so, the older the PDF
   version produced, the more legacy viewers will support that version,
   but the fewer features will be enabled.  See [ISOPDF] Annex I, "PDF
   Versions and Compatibility".

6.  PDF Implementations

   PDF files are experienced through a reader or viewer of PDF files.
   For most of the common platforms in use (iOS, OS X, Windows, Android,
   ChromeOS, Kindle) and for most browsers (Edge, Safari, Chrome,
   Firefox), PDF viewing is built-in.  In addition, there are many PDF

Internet-Draft               application/pdf               February 2017


   viewers available for download and install.  The PDF specification
   was published and freely available since the format was introduced in
   1993, so hundreds of companies and organizations make tools for PDF
   creation, viewing, and manipulation.

7.  Security Considerations

   PDF is certainly a complex media type as per Section 4.6 of
   [RFC6838], which sets requirements for security analysis of media
   type registrations.  [RFC3778] (which this document obsoletes)
   contained a detailed analysis of some of the security issues for PDF
   implementations known at the time.  While the analysis isn't
   necessarily wrong, the threat analysis is much too limited, and the
   mitigations somewhat out of date.  There is now extensive literature
   on security threats involving PDF implementations and how to avoid
   them, consistent with broad implementation over decades.  We are not
   registering a new media type but rather making a primarily
   administrative update.  With those caveats:

   The PDF file format allows several constructs which may compromise
   security if handled inadequately by PDF processors.  For example:

   o  PDF may contain scripts to customize the displaying and processing
      of PDF files.  These scripts are expressed in a version of
      JavaScript and are intended for execution by the PDF processor.

   o  PDF file may refer to other PDF files for portions of content.
      PDF processors are expected to find these external files and load
      them in order to display the document.

   o  PDF may act as a container for various files embedded in it (for
      example, as attached files).  PDF processors may offer
      functionality to open and display such files or store them on the
      system, such as with the "ef" open action.  THe PDF specification
      places no restrictions on types of files which may be embedded, so
      PDF processors should be extremely careful to prevent unwanted
      execution of attached executables or decompression of attached
      archives which may store dangerous files in the host file system.

   o  PDF files may contain links to content on the internet.  PDF
      processors may offer functionality to show such content upon
      following the link.

   o  The fragment identifier syntax (Section 3) contains directives for
      opening ("ef") or inluding ("fdf") additional material.

Internet-Draft               application/pdf               February 2017


   PDF interpreters executing any scripts or programs related to these
   constructs must be extremely careful to insure that untrusted
   software is executed in a protected environment.

   In addition, the PDF processor itself, as well as its plugins,
   scripts etc. may be a source of insecurity, by either obvious or
   subtle means.
