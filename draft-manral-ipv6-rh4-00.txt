Abstract

   The functionality provided by IPv6's Type 0 Routing Header can be
   exploited in order to achieve traffic amplification over a remote
   path for the purposes of generating denial-of-service traffic.  

   This document updates the IPv6 specification to the use of a new 
   IPv6 Type 4 Routing Header, in light of this security concern. This 
   new header provides the same functionality of the Routing Header
   Type-0, while taking care of the major security concerns defined 
   in the draft [draft-ietf-ipv6-deprecate-rh0-01].

Internet-Draft       New IPv6 Type 4 Routing Header            June 2007


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2460] defines an IPv6 extension header called "Routing Header",
   identified by a Next Header value of 43 in the immediately preceding
   header.  A particular Routing Header subtype denoted as "Type 0" is
   also defined.  Type 0 Routing Headers are referred to as "RH0" in
   this document.

   128-fold amplification of data traffic can result using the IPv6 
   amplification attack as defined in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-deprecate-rh0-01].
   This attack is particularly serious in that it affects the entire
   path between the two exploited nodes, not only the nodes themselves
   or their local networks.  

   The draft [I-D.ietf-ipv6-deprecate-rh0-01] deprecates the use of the 
   RH0 header. However operators use and require the functionality provided
   by the RH0 header.

   This draft defines the Routing Header of Type-4, and referred to as "RH4" 
   header. The RH4 header has format and functionality similar to the RH0 
   header without having the major vulnerabilities of the "Routing Header".

   This document updates [RFC2460] and [RFC4294].

Internet-Draft       New IPv6 Type 4 Routing Header            June 2007


2.  Definitions

   RH4 in this document denotes the IPv6 Extension Header type 43
   ("Routing Header") variant 4 ("Type 4 Routing Header"), is a type of 
   Routing header as defined in [RFC2460]. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Format of RH4

   The Type 4 Routing header has the following format (it is the same as 
   the RH0 header except for the limit on the "Hdr Ext Len" field. Some 
   additional restrictions and checks have been added):

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                        immediately following the Routing header.  Uses
                        the same values as the IPv4 Protocol field
                        [RFC-1700 et seq.].

   Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Routing
                        header in 8-octet units, not including the first
                        8 octets.  For the Type 4 Routing header, Hdr
                        Ext Len is equal to two times the number of
                        addresses in the header. The maximum value of this
                        field can be 8. That means a maximum of 4 addresses
                        can be added to the Routing Header.

   Routing Type         4.

   Segments Left        8-bit unsigned integer.  Number of route
                        segments remaining, i.e., number of explicitly
                        listed intermediate nodes still to be visited
                        before reaching the final destination.

   Reserved             32-bit reserved field.  Initialized to zero for
                        transmission; ignored on reception.

   Address[1..n]        Vector of 128-bit addresses, numbered 1 to n. The
                        maximum value of n is 4. 

   Multicast addresses or Link Local Unicast address must not appear in a 
   Routing header of Type 4, or in the IPv6 Destination Address field of 
   a packet carrying a Routing header of Type 4.    

   A Routing header is not examined or processed until it reaches the
   node identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header. 
   There can be at most one RH4 header in any packet. A packet with more
   than one RH4 header is discarded. This functionality can be implemented 
   in a firewall or any other IPv6 node.

   In that node, dispatching on the Next Header field of the immediately
   preceding header causes the Routing header module to be invoked,
   which, in the case of Routing Type 4, performs the algorithm which is 
   similar to the as specified in section 4.4 of [RFC2460]:

   if Segments Left = 0 {
      proceed to process the next header in the packet, whose type is
      identified by the Next Header field in the Routing header
   }
   else if Hdr Ext Len is odd {
         send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the Source
         Address, pointing to the Hdr Ext Len field, and discard the
         packet
   }
   else {
      compute n, the number of addresses in the Routing header, by
      dividing Hdr Ext Len by 2

      if Segments Left is greater than n or n is greater than 4 {
         send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the Source
         Address, pointing to the Segments Left field, and discard the
         packet
      }
      else {
         decrement Segments Left by 1;
         compute i, the index of the next address to be visited in
         the address vector, by subtracting Segments Left from n

         if Address [i] or the IPv6 Destination Address is multicast 
            or link local unicast address {
            discard the packet
         }
         else {
            Compare the addresses in the Routing Header to check that 
            none of the address belong to the routers self address

            if overlapping address exist {
               discard the packet
            }
  
            swap the IPv6 Destination Address and Address[i]

            if the IPv6 Hop Limit is less than or equal to 1 {
               send an ICMP Time Exceeded -- Hop Limit Exceeded in
               Transit message to the Source Address and discard the
               packet
            }
            else {
               decrement the Hop Limit by 1

               resubmit the packet to the IPv6 module for transmission
               to the new destination
            }

4.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to add a new type of Routing extension
   header of IPv6. RH0 has been shown to have undesirable security 
   implications.
    
   Many of the attacks including the amplification attack cannot occur with 
   the RH4 header. All the addresses in the RH4 header need to be checked with
   the firewall policy to make sure the firewall is able to trap packets meant 
   for addresses in the firewall policy and take relevent action.

   Whereever possible, including the administrative network edge, RPF check 
   needs to be done.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA registry "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters"
   should be updated to reflect that variant 4 of IPv6 header-type 43
   ("Routing Header") is added.


7.  Acknowlegements

   This document benefits from the contributions of many IPV6 and V6OPS
   working group participants, including Chris Morrow, Tony Hain, Jinmei
   Tatuya and Brian Carpenter.
