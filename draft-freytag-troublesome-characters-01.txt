Those Troublesome Characters: A Registry of Unicode Code Points Needing
         Special Consideration When Used in Network Identifiers
                draft-freytag-troublesome-characters-01

Abstract

   Unicode's design goal is to be the universal character set for all
   applications.  The goal entails the inclusion of very large numbers
   of characters.  It is also focused on written language; special
   provisions have always been needed for identifiers.  The sheer size
   of the repertoire increases the possibility of accidental or
   intentional use of characters that can cause confusion among users,
   particularly where linguistic context is ambiguous, unavailable, or
   impossible to determine.  A registry of code points that can be
   sometimes especially problematic may be useful to guide system
   administrators in setting parameters for allowable code points in an
   identifier system, and to aid applications in creating security aids
   for users.

1.  Unicode code points and identifiers

   Unicode [Unicode] is a coded character set that aims to support every
   writing system.  Writing systems evolve over time and are sometimes
   influenced by one another.  As a result, Unicode encodes many
   characters that, to a reader, appear to be the same thing; but that
   are encoded differently from one another.  This sort of difference is
   usually not important in written texts, because competent readers and



Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   writers of a language are able to compensate for the selection of the
   "wrong" character when reading or writing.  Finally, the goal of
   supporting every writing system also implies that Unicode is designed
   to properly represent text in written languages, so special
   provisions are needed for identifiers.

   Identifiers that are used in a network or, especially, an Internet
   context present several special problems because of the above feature
   of Unicode:

   1.  In many (perhaps most) uses of identifiers, it is either
       practically difficult or impossible to ascertain the correct
       language context in which the identifier is being or will be
       used.  In the case of an internationalized domain name, for
       instance, each label could in principle represent a new locus of
       control, because there could be a delegation there.  A new locus
       of control means that the administrator of the resulting zone
       could speak, read, or intend a different language context than
       the one from the parent.  Moreover, at least some domains (such
       as the root) have an Internet-wide context and therefore do not
       really have a language context as such.  In any case, the
       language context is simply not available as part of a DNS lookup,
       so there is no way to make the DNS sensitive to this sort of
       issue.  Even in the case of email local-parts, where a sender is
       likely to know at least one of the languages of the receiver, the
       language context that was in use at the time the identifier was
       created is often unknown.

   2.  Identifiers on the network are in general exact-match systems,
       because an ambiguous identifier is problematic.  Sometimes, but
       not always, there are facilities for aliasing such that multiple
       identifiers can be put together as a single identity; the DNS,
       for example, does not have such an aliasing capability, because
       in the DNS all aliases are one-way pointers.  Aliasing techniques
       are in any case just an extension of the exact-match approach,
       and do not work the way a competent human reader does when
       interpolating the "right" character upon seeing the "wrong" one.

   3.  Because there are many characters that may appear to be the same
       (or even, that are defined in such a way that they are all but
       guaranteed to be rendered by the same glyphs), it is fairly easy
       to create an identifier either by accident or on purpose that is
       likely to be confused with some other identifier even by
       competent readers and writers of a language.

   4.  For some scripts the repertoire of shapes is shared, so that
       there are cases of two strings in which all the code points in
       one script in the first string, and all the code points in



Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


       another script in the second string, are respectively confusable
       with one another.  In that case, the strings cannot be
       distinguished by a reader, and the whole string is confusable.

   5.  For some scripts, both users and rendering systems do not expect
       to encounter code points in arbitrary sequence.  Most code points
       normally occur only in specific locations within a syllable.  If
       random labels were permitted, some would not display as expected
       (including having some features misplaced or not displayed) while
       others would present recognition problems to users experienced
       with the script.  Some devices may also not support arbitrary
       input.

   Beyond these issues, human perception is easily tricked, so that
   entirely unrelated character sequences can become confusable -- for
   example "rn" being confused with "m".  Humans read strings, not
   characters, and they will mostly see what they expect to see.  Some
   additional discussion of the background can be found in Appendix A.

2.  Background and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   A reader needs to be familiar with Unicode [Unicode], IDNA2008
   [RFC5890] [RFC5891] [RFC5892] [RFC5893] [RFC5894], PRECIS (at least
   the framework, [RFC7564]), and conventions for discussion of
   internationalization in the IETF (see [RFC6365]).

3.  Techniques already in place

   In the IDNA mechanism for including Unicode code points [RFC5892], a
   code point is only included when it meets the needs of
   internationalizing domain names as explained in the IDNA framework
   [RFC5894].  For identifiers other than those specified by IDNA, the
   PRECIS framework [RFC7564] generalizes the same basic technique.  In
   both cases, the overall approach is to assume that all characters are
   excluded, and then to include characters according to properties
   derived from the Unicode character properties.  This general strategy
   cuts the enormous size of the Unicode database somewhat, avoiding
   including some characters that are necessarily unsuited for use as
   identifiers.

   The mechanism of inclusion by derived property, while helpful, is
   insufficient to guarantee every included character is safe for use in
   identifiers.  Some characters' properties lead them to be included
   even though they are not obviously good candidates.  In other cases,



Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   individual characters are good for inclusion, but are problematic in
   combination.  Finally, there are cases where characters (or sequences
   of characters) are not problematic by themselves, or if used in a
   mutually exclusive manner in the same identifier, but become
   problematic when their choice represents the only difference between
   otherwise identical identifiers.  For some examples, see Appendix B.

   Operators of systems that create identifiers (whether through a
   registry or through a peer-to-peer identifier negotiation system)
   need to make policies for characters they will permit.  Operators of
   registries, for instance, can help by adopting good registration
   policies: "Users will benefit if registries only permit characters
   from scripts that are well-understood by the registry or its
   advisers."[RFC5894] The difficulty for many operators, however, is
   that they do not have the writing system expertise to claim any
   character is "well-understood", and they do not really have the time
   to develop that expertise.  Such operators should in fact not use or
   register such characters.  Unfortunately, in many cases the operators
   are stewards of systems where the user population demands identifiers
   useful to them in their local languages.  In other cases, operators
   may proceed without a proper understanding owing to financial or
   market share incentives.  The risk for Internet identifiers in such
   cases is obviously that ill-understood and potentially exploitable
   gaps in registration policies will open.  To help mitigate such
   issues, a registry of Unicode code points that present special issues
   for network identifiers can help guide protocol and operating
   decisions about whether to permit a given code point or sequence of
   code points.  This will not completely protect against poor
   registration or use, but it may provide operational guidance
   necessary for people who are responsible for creating policies.

   Note that the registry defined herein does not address any of the
   issues created by whole-string confusables where each of the
   identifiers is of a different script.  A common workaround, limiting
   a registry to identifiers of only a single script, would mitigate
   this issue.

   For some of the code points (or code point sequences listed hat
   present issues for identifiers, it may be most expeditious to simply
   not include them, even though they are valid according to the
   protocol.  Sometimes, one of a pair of identical code points (or code
   point sequences) may be deemed preferable over the other for
   practical reasons.

   In the case of registries, it is not always necessary or desirable to
   exclude characters.  Sometimes, it is merely necessary to ensure that
   for two otherwise identical identifiers, only one of a set of
   mutually exclusive characters (or sequences of characters) is used,



Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   while preventing the later registration of the the label containing
   the other one in order to avoid ambiguity.  This way the operator
   does not need to make a choice.  In certain cases, where both of
   these identifiers mean the same thing, an operator may decide to
   allow both labels to be registered simultaneously, but only to the
   same entity.

   In every case, the registry here defined includes code points that
   require special attention when they are to be used in identifiers.
   An administrator who does not have the time or inclination to develop
   the requisite understanding would be well-advised simply not to
   permit these code points at all.

4.  A registry of code points

4.1.  Discussion

   The registry contains three fields.  The first field, called "Code
   Point(s)", is a code point or sequence of code points.  The second,
   "Cross Reference", contains zero or more cross references to related
   code points.  The third, called "Explanation", is a free form text
   field that briefly describes the issue.  The explanation field also
   contains one or more references to documents defining the code point
   and the reason why it presents an issue.  These reference may be to
   documents external to the registry, so long as the reference is
   stable.

   The registry is not intended as an alternative to normal operational
   policies that are used for protocols under normal administrative
   scope.  For instance, zone operators that support IDNA are expected
   to create policies governing the code points that they will permit
   (see [RFC5894] and [I-D.rfc5891bis]).  The registry herein defined is
   intended to highlight particularly troublesome code points or code
   point sequences for the benefit of administrators creating such
   policies.  It is also intended to highlight characters that may
   create identifier ambiguities and thereby create security
   vulnerabilities.

   If a character appears in the registry, that does not automatically
   mean that it is a bad candidate for use in identifiers generally.
   Absent a well-defined and verifiable policy, however, such a code
   point or sequence might well be treated with suspicion by users and
   by tools.

   The registry is updated by Expert Review.  It ought to contain only
   code points that are significant in identifiers and that need special
   policies (including policies of exclusion).  Only code points that
   are eligible for use in identifiers (i.e. that are not DISALLOWED)

   ought to be included.  Code points that are CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO
   ought to only be included if concerns are identified that are not
   mitigated by the existing IDNA context rules.

   | 0E45     |           | Restricted Context: Only occurs after two  |

   |          |           | LU. Is also potentially confused with      |
   |          |           | U+0E32 SARA I. Both issues can be          |
   |          |           | addressed by defining a context rule.      |

   |          |           | U+0E3A (PHINTHU). Excluding it avoids      |

   |          |           | diacritic U+0E4C (THANTHAKHAT). Both are   |

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA Services Operator is hereby requested to create the Registry
   of Unicode Code Points for Special Consideration in Network
   Identifiers, and to populate it with the values in section
   Section 4.2.  The registry is to be updated by Expert Review.

   This registry has no formal protocol status with respect to IDNA or
   PRECIS.  It is a registry intended to be used by those creating
   registration or lookup policies, in order to inform the development
   of such policies.

6.  Security Considerations

   The registry established by this document is intended to help
   operators of identifier systems in deciding what to permit in
   identifiers.  It may also be useful for user agents that attempt to
   provide warnings to users about suspicious or inadvisable
   identifiers.  Operators that fail to make policies addressing the
   contents of the registry may permit the creation of identifiers that
   are misleading or that may be used in attacks on the network or
   users.

   The registry is not a magic solution to all identifier ambiguity, and
   even refusing to permit registration of, or lookup of, every code
   point in the registry cannot ensure that misleading or confusing
   identifiers will never be created.

Appendix A.  Additional Background

A.1.  The Theory of Inclusion

   The mechanism that the IETF has come to prefer for
   internationalization of identifiers may be called "inclusion-based
   identifier internationalization", or "inclusion" for short.  Under
   inclusion, the characters that are permissible in identifiers for a
   protocol are selected from the set of all Unicode characters.  One
   starts with an empty set of characters, and then gradually adds
   characters to the set, usually based on Unicode properties (see
   below, and also Section 3).

   Inclusion depends in part on assumptions the IETF made when the
   strategy was adopted and developed; some of those assumptions were
   about the relationships between different characters and the
   likelihood that similar such relationships would get added to future
   versions of Unicode.  Those assumptions turn out not to have been
   true in every case.  Code points at issue are among those to be
   listed in the registry defined here.  (See Section 4.2.)

   The intent of Unicode is to encode all known writing systems into a
   single coded character set.  One consequence of that goal is that
   Unicode encodes an enormous number of characters.  Another is that
   the work of Unicode does not end until every writing system is
   encoded; even after that, it needs to continue to track any changes
   in those writing systems.

   Unicode encodes abstract characters, not glyphs.  Because of the way
   Unicode was built up over time, there are sometimes multiple ways to
   encode the same abstract character.  For example, an e with an acute
   accent may be written by combining U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E and
   U+0031 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, or it may be written U+00E9 LATIN
   SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE.  If Unicode encodes an abstract character
   in more than one way, then for most purposes the different encodings
   should all be treated as though they're the same character.  This



Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 35]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   "canonical equivalence" between encodings of the same abstract
   characters is explicitly called out by Unicode.  A lack of a defined
   canonical equivalence is tantamount to an assertion by Unicode that
   the two encodings do not represent the same abstract character, even
   if both happen to result in the same appearance.

   Every encoded character in Unicode (more precisely, every code point)
   is associated with a set of properties.  The properties define what
   script a code point is in, whether it is a letter or a number or
   punctuation and so forth, its direction when written, to what other
   code point or code point sequence it is canonically equivalent, and
   many other properties.  These properties are important to the
   inclusion mechanism.  They are defined in the Unicode Character
   Database [UCD] [UAX44].

   Inclusion depends on the assumption that such strings as will be used
   in identifiers will not have any ambiguous matching to other strings.
   In practice, this means that input strings to the protocol are
   expected to be in Normalization Form C.  This way, any alternative
   sequences of code points for the same characters will be normalized
   to a single form.  If all the characters in the string are also
   included for the protocol's candidate identifiers, then the string is
   eligible to be an identifier under the protocol.

A.2.  The Difference Between Theory and Practice

   In principle, under inclusion identifiers should be unambiguous.  It
   has always been recognized, however, that for humans some ambiguity
   is inevitable, because of the vagaries of writing systems and of
   human perception.

   Normalization Form C ("NFC") removes the ambiguities based on dual or
   multiple encoding for the same abstract character.  However,
   characters are not the same as their glyphs.  This means that it is
   possible for certain abstract characters to share a glyph.  We can
   call such abstract characters "homoglyphs".  While this looks at
   first like something that should be handled (or should have been
   handled) by normalization (NFC or something else), there are
   important differences; the situation is in some sense an extreme case
   of a spectrum of ambiguity discussed.

A.2.1.  Confusability

   While Unicode deals in abstract characters and inclusion works on
   Unicode code points, users interact with strings as actually
   rendered: sequences of glyphs.  There are characters that, depending
   on font, sometimes look quite similar to one another (such as "l" and
   "1"); any character that is like this is often called "visually



Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   similar".  More difficult are characters that, in any normal
   rendering, always look the same as one another.  The shared history
   of Cyrillic, Greek, and Latin scripts, for example, means that there
   are characters in each script that function similarly and that are
   usually indistinguishable from one another, though they are not the
   same abstract character.  These are examples of "homoglyphs."  Any
   character that can be confused for another one can be called
   confusable, and confusability can be thought of as a spectrum with
   "visually similar" at one end, and "homoglyphs" at the other.  (We
   use the term "homoglyph" strictly: code points that normally use the
   same glyph when rendered.)

   Most of the time, there is some characteristic that can help to
   mitigate confusion.  Mitigation may be as simple as using a font
   designed to distinguish among different characters.  For homoglyphs,
   a large number of cases (but not all of them) turn out to be in
   different scripts.  As a result, it is usually a good idea to adopt
   the operational convention that identifiers for a protocol should
   always be in a single script.  This strategy has limits.  First,
   identifiers are not always under the operational control of a single
   authority (such as in the case of DNS, where the system is under
   distributed control so that different parts of the hierarchy can have
   different operational rules).  Moreover, sometimes the repertoire
   used in operation allows multiple scripts that create whole string
   confusables -- strings made up entirely of homoglyphs of another
   string in a different script (such as can be found between Cyrillic
   and Latin, for example).  In such cases, mitigation must turn to
   other means of preventing the registration of mutually confusable
   string, for example by ensuring that the registration of one of them
   (whichever comes first) blocks the later registration of the other.

   Also, operators should only ever use the smallest repertoire of code
   points possible for their environment.  So, for example, if there is
   a code point that is sometimes used but is perhaps a little obscure,
   it is better to leave it out and gain some experience with other
   cases first.  In particular, code points used only in a language with
   which the administrator is not familiar should probably be excluded.
   The same applies to code points used in specialized contexts, such as
   those only found in historic or sacred documents, or only used for
   phonetic transcription or poetry.  In the case of IDNA, some client
   programs restrict display of U-labels to top-level domains known to
   have policies about single-script labels.

   None of these policies or convention, other than ensuring mutual
   exclusion, will do anything to help strict homoglyphs of each other
   in the same script (see Appendix B for some example cases.)

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   Finally, there are some writing systems where characters do not
   normally occur in arbitrary locations in the context of each
   syllable.  Neither users nor rendering systems for such scripts are
   adept at handling arbitrary sequences of such characters.  While some
   latitude beyond strict spelling rules may be accommodated, policies
   that enforce a minimal set of structural rules are required to ensure
   that users can identify the identifier and systems can render them
   predictably.

A.2.2.  Not everything can be solved

   As noted in Section 1, it is not possible to solve all the problems
   with identifier systems, particularly when human factors are taken
   into account.

Appendix B.  Examples

   There are a number of cases that illustrate the combining sequence or
   digraph issue:

   U+08A1 vs \u'0628'\u'0654'  This case is ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA
      ABOVE, which is the one that was detected during expert review
      that caused the IETF to notice the issue.  The issue existed
      before this, but we did not know it.  For detailed discussion of
      this case and some of the following ones, see
      [I-D.klensin-idna-5892upd-unicode70]

   U+0681 vs \u'062D'\u'0654'  This case is ARABIC LETTER HAH WITH HAMZA
      ABOVE, which (like U+08A1) does not have a canonical equivalent.
      In both cases, the places where hamza above are used are
      specialized enough that the combining marks can be excluded in
      some cases (for example, the root zone under IDNA).

   U+0623 vs \u'0627'\u'0654'  This case is ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH
      HAMZA ABOVE.  Unlike the previous two cases, it does have a
      canonical equivalence with the combining sequence.  In the past,
      the IETF misunderstood the reasons for the difference between this
      pair and the previous two cases.

   U+09E1 vs u\'098C'u\'09E2'  This case is BENGALI LETTER VOCALIC LL.
      This is an example in Bengali script of a case without a canonical
      equivalence to the combining sequence.  Per Unicode, the single
      code point should be used to represent vowel letters in text, and
      the sequence of code points should not be used.  But it is not a
      simple matter of disallowing the combining vowel mark in cases
      like this; where the combination does not exist and the use of the
      sequence is already established, Unicode is unlikely to encode the
      combination.

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   U+019A vs \u'006C'\u'0335'  This case is LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH
      BAR.  In at least some fonts, there is a detectable difference
      with the combining sequence, but only if one compares them side-
      by-side.  Unlike a separable diacritic, there are no fast rules
      for placement of overlays.  A bar may cross at different heights
      for different glyph shape or may cross different parts of the
      glyph.  For this reason, there is no canonical equivalence defined
      between the sequence and the composite.  Unicode has a principle
      of encoding barred letters of specific shape as single code point
      composites when needed for any writing system.

   U+00F8 vs \u'006F'\u'0337'  This is LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE.
      The effect is similar to the previous case.  Unicode has a
      principle of encoding stroked letters as composites when needed
      for any writing system.

   U+02A6 vs \u'0074'\u'0073'  This is LATIN SMALL LETTER TS DIGRAPH,
      which is not canonically equivalent to the letters t and s.  The
      intent appears to be that the digraph shows the two shapes as
      kerned, but the difference may be slight out of context.

   U+01C9 vs \u'006C'\u'006A'  Unlike the TS digraph, the LJ digraph has
      a relevant compatibility decomposition, so it fails the relevant
      stability rules under inclusion and is therefore DISALLOWED in
      IDNA2008.  This illustrates the way that consistencies that might
      be natural to some users of a script are not necessarily found in
      it, possibly because of uses by another writing system.

   U+06C8 vs u\'0648'u\'0670'  ARABIC LETTER YU is an example where the
      normally-rendered character looks just like a combining sequence,
      but are named differently.  In other words, this is an example
      where the simple fact of the Unicode name would have concealed the
      apparent relationship from the casual observer.

   U+069 vs \u'0069'\u'0307'  LATIN SMALL LETTER I followed by COMBINING
      DOT ABOVE by definition, renders exactly the same as LATIN SMALL
      LETTER I by itself and does so in practice for any good font.  The
      same would be true if "i" was replaced with any of the other
      Soft_Dotted characters defined in Unicode.  The character sequence
      \u'0069'\u'0307' (followed by no other combining mark) is
      reportedly rather common on the Internet.  Because base character
      and stand-alone code point are the same in this case, and the code
      points affected have the Soft_Dotted property already, this could
      be mitigated separately via a context rule affecting U+0307.

   Other cases that demonstrate that the the issue does not lie
   exclusively or primarily with combining sequences:




Freytag, et al.          Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 39]

Internet-Draft           Troublesome Characters                June 2017


   U+0B95 vs U+0BE7  The TAMIL LETTER KA and TAMIL DIGIT ONE are always
      indistinguishable, but needed to be encoded separately because one
      is a letter and the other is a digit.

   Arabic-Indic Digits vs. Extended Arabic-Indic Digits  Seven digits of
      these two sequences have entirely identical shapes.  This case is
      an example of something dealt with in inclusion that nevertheless
      can lead to confusions that are not fully mitigated.  IDNA, for
      example, contains context rules restricting the digits to one set
      or another; but such rules apply only to a single label, not to an
      entire name.  Moreover, it provides no way of distinguishing
      between two labels that both conform to the context rule, but
      where each contains a different member one of the seven identical
      shape pairs.

   U+53E3 vs U+56D7  These are two Han characters (roughly rectangular)
      that are different when laid side by side; but they may be
      difficult to distinguish out of context or in very small print.

   U+01DD vs U+0259  The two code points share the same (lower case)
      forms, but are encoded differently due to different uppercase
      forms.  The fact that they uppercase differently is taken as
      evidence that they are not the same abstract character, despite
      the superficial evidence of their shared shape.  The more common
      cases, where the uppercase form are identical may be of less
      concern, given that IDNA 2008 is limited to lower case.

   Cross script homoglyphs usually do not involve combining sequences,
   but can be mitigated by rules requiring strings to be in a single
   script.

      LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E is one of a handful of examples of
      characters borrowed from another script, in this case GREEK SMALL
      LETTER EPSILON.

      LATIN SMALL LETTER E and CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IE are historically
      related, both derive from uppercase forms of the GREEK CAPTIAL
      LETTER EPSILON.  There are a number of such pairs -- enough to
      make many whole strings that look the same in both scripts (but
      usually spell nonsense in one of them).  An example would be
      "pax".
