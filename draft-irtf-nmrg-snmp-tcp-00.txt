1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a transport mapping for using the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP) over TCP. The transport mapping defined in
   this memo can be used with any version of SNMP. This document extends
   the transport mappings defined in RFC 1906.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  SNMP over TCP

   This is an optional transport mapping. However, implementors are
   encouraged to support SNMP over TCP whenever possible because this
   enables applications to use more efficient MIB data transfers.


3.1.  Serialization

   Each instance of a message is serialized into a single BER encoded
   message, using the algorithm specified in Section 8 of RFC 1906.  The
   BER encoded message is then send over a TCP connection.

   Note, it is possible to exchange multiple SNMP request/response pairs
   over a single TCP connection. The length field in the BER encoded
   SNMP message is used to separate multiple requests send over a single
   TCP connection.


3.2.  Well-known Values

   It is suggested that administrators configure their SNMP entities
   acting in an agent role to listen on TCP port 161 for incoming
   connections.  Further, it is suggested that notification sinks be
   configured to listen on TCP port 162.

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it must be capable
   of accepting messages that are at least 484 octets in size.
   Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever possible.

3.3.  Connection Management

   The use of TCP connections introduces costs. Connection establishment
   and shutdown causes additional traffic on the wire. Further,
   maintaining open connections binds resources in the network layer of
   the underlying operating system.

   TCP connections should therefore only be used when the size of the
   data transferred would otherwise cause large latencies due to small
   UDP packet sizes and an increased number of interactions.

   Both, an SNMP entity in the agent role and an SNMP entity in the
   manager role, are allowed to close the connections at any point in
   time. This ensures that SNMP entities can control their resource
   usage and shutdown TCP connections that are not used. Note, SNMP
   engines are not expected to process any outstanding requests if the
   underlying TCP connection has been closed. A no response error
   condition SHOULD be signalled for outstanding requests for command
   generator applications if the TCP connection is closed.
