Abstract

   This document clarifies DNS response message interpretation to avoid
   denial of service attacks using DNS responses.

   In a recent DNS software assessment it has come to light that some
   implementations respond to DNS response messages.  A loop occurs if
   the receiver of this response responds with a response.

   It was never explicitly stated that response messages must not be
   answered.  This draft makes the statement explicit.

1.  Introduction

   In a recent DNS software assessment it has come to light that some
   implementations respond to DNS response messages.  A loop occurs if
   the receiver responds as well with a DNS response message.

   A DNS message has a header which includes a flag (QR) to denote the
   message as a request message or a response message.  If the QR flag
   is clear, the message is a request message.  If the QR flag is set,
   the message is a response message.

   A typical DNS message exchange exists of a request message from a
   resolver to a server, followed by a response message from a server to
   a resolver.  A response message is never sent unsolicited.  A
   response message is never answered with a response message.

   It is not explicitly stated in [RFC1035] that response messages must
   not be answered.  This draft makes the statement explicit.

   The author does not believe this to be a change to the DNS protocol
   set, but since some implementers believed this wasn't a requirement,
   it is hereby documented explicitly as a requirement.

1.1  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  DNS Message processing

   A DNS response message is a DNS message with the QR flag set in the
   header, independent of other content of the DNS message.

   An unsolicited response message is a DNS response message which is
   not invoked by a request message.

   A DNS implementation MUST ignore unsolicited DNS response messages.

   A DNS implementation MUST NOT send a DNS response message in response
   to a DNS response message.

3.  Security Considerations

   This draft acknowledges that a Denial of Service scenario can occur
   when a DNS implementation responds to DNS response messages.  It
   explicitly forbids this behavior.
