Abstract

   The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 (RFC3056) uses automatic IPv6-over-
   IPv4 tunneling to interconnect IPv6 networks.  The architecture
   includes Relay Routers and Routers, which accept and decapsulate IPv4
   traffic from anywhere.  There aren't many constraints on the embedded
   IPv6 packets, or where IPv4 traffic will be automatically tunneled
   to.  These could enable one to go around access controls, and more
   likely, being able to perform proxy Denial of Service attacks using
   6to4 relays or routers as reflectors.  Anyone is also capable of
   spoofing traffic from non-6to4 addresses, as if it was coming from a
   relay, to a 6to4 node.  This document discusses these issues in more
   detail and tries to suggest enhancements to alleviate the problems.

1. Introduction

   The IPv6 interim mechanism "6to4" [6TO4] specifies automatic
   IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling to interconnect isolated IPv6 clouds without
   explicit tunnels by embedding the tunnel IPv4 address in the IPv6
   6to4 prefix.

   One challenge with this mechanism is that all 6to4 routers must
   accept and decapsulate IPv4 packets from every other 6to4 router;
   there are no strict constraints on what the IPv6 packet may contain,
   which implies a trust relationship.

   Another, bigger challenge is that to interconnect native IPv6
   networks and 6to4 clouds, relay routers are used as bridges between
   these two clouds.  Relay routers can be tricked by malicious parties
   to send IPv4 or IPv6 traffic anywhere the attacker wants.  With
   source address spoofing, this could be called traffic "laundering" or
   a "proxy" denial-of-service attack.  To some extent, these reflected
   attacks can also be launched off from any node at all.

   Even worse, anyone can send tunneled traffic, spoofed to come from
   non-6to4 addresses to any 6to4 router, and the node does not have any
   means to ensure its correctness, but to assume it came from a
   legitimate Relay.

   The 6to4 specification outlined quite a few security considerations,
   but it has been shown that in practice some of these have been

   difficult to get implemented due to their abstract nature.

   This draft analyses the 6to4 security issues in more detail and
   outlines some enhancements and caveats.

   Sections 2-4 are more or less introductory in nature, rehashing how
   6to4 should be used today based on the 6to4 specification, so that it
   is easier to understand how security could be affected.  Section 5
   provides a threat analysis for implementations that already implement
   most of the security checks.  Section 6 introduces some filtering
   rules for 6to4 implementations, and section 7 discusses some
   additional problems which still need some consideration. Appendix A
   outlines a few possible trivial attack scenarios in the case that
   very little or no security has been implemented.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Different 6to4 Forwarding Scenarios

   It should be noted that when communicating between 6to4 and native
   domains, the relays that will be used in the two directions are very
   likely different; routing is highly asymmetric.  Because of this, it
   is not feasible to limit relays you accept traffic from with e.g.
   access lists.

   The first three subsections introduce the most common form of 6to4
   operation.  Other models are presented in the fourth subsection.

2.1. From 6to4 to 6to4

   6to4 domains always exchange 6to4 traffic directly via IPv4
   tunneling; the endpoint address V4ADDR is derived from 6to4 prefix
   2002:V4ADDR.

    .--------.           _----_          .--------.
    |  6to4  |         _( IPv4 )_        |  6to4  |
    | Router | <====> ( Internet ) <===> | Router |
    '--------'         (_      _)        '--------'
        ^                '----'              ^
        |      Direct tunneling over IPv4    |
        V                                    V
    .--------.                           .-------.
    |  6to4  |                           |  6to4  |
    | Client |                           | Client |
    '--------'                           '--------'

   It is required that every 6to4 router considers every other 6to4
   router it wants to talk to to be "on-link" (with IPv4 as the link-
   layer).  If this is restricted by increasing the prefix length from
   2002::/16, some traffic will be sent to the 6to4 Relay Router, which
   would forward it to other 6to4 Routers.  However, if the original
   destination does not have equally long prefix, the traffic it tries
   to send back will be tunneled directly, and will be dropped.

   Therefore, the restricted scenario with a longer prefix-length is not
   globally workable and will not be considered here.

2.2. From Native to 6to4

   When native domains send traffic to 6to4 address 2002:V4ADDR, it will
   be routed to the topologically nearest, advertising 6to4 Relay
   Router.  Relay router will tunnel the traffic over IPv4 to the
   corresponding IPv4 address V4ADDR.  (Note that IPv4 address 9.0.0.1
   here is just an example of a global IPv4 address.)

              2002::/16       Closest to 'Native Client'
    .--------.       _----_        .------------.            .--------.
    | Native |     _( IPv6 )_      | 6to4 Relay |  Tunneled  |  6to4  |
    | Client | -> ( Internet ) --> | Router     | =========> | Router |
    '--------'     (_      _)      '------------'   9.0.0.1  '--------'
                     '----'    dst=2002:0900:0000::1             |
                                                                 V
                                                             .-------.
                                                             |  6to4  |
                                                             | Client |
                                                             '--------'

2.3. From 6to4 to Native

   6to4 domains send traffic to native domains by tunneling it over IPv4
   to their configured 6to4 Relay Router, or the closest found using
   6to4 IPv4 Anycast [6TO4ANY].  The relay will decapsulate the packet
   and forward it to native IPv6 Internet, the same way as any other
   IPv6 packet.

                                                             | Client |
                                                             '--------'

2.4. Other Models

   These are more or less special cases of 6to4 operation; in later
   chapters, unless otherwise stated, only the most generally-used
   models (above) will be considered.

2.4.1. BGP Between 6to4 Routers and Relays

   [6TO4, 5.2.2.2] presents a model where, instead of static
   configuration, BGP4+ is used between 6to4 Relay Routers and 6to4
   Routers.

   If the 6to4 router established a BGP session between all the possible
   6to4 relays, the traffic from non-6to4 sites would always go through
   "home relay", and configuring "trusted relay" would not be a problem;
   an alternative would be to advertise the more specific 6to4 routes
   between 6to4 Relays, as described later in this memo.

   This model is not known to be used at the time of writing; this is
   probably caused by the fact that parties that need 6to4 are those
   that are not able to run BGP; and setting up these sessions would be
   much more work for relay operators.

2.4.2. 6to4 as an Optimization Method

   Some seem to use 6to4 as an IPv6 connectivity "optimization method";
   that is, they have also non-6to4 addresses on their nodes and border
   routers, but also employ 6to4 to reach 6to4 sites.

   This is typically done to be able to reach 6to4 destinations by
   direct tunneling and not having to use relays at all.

   Some also publish both 6to4 and non-6to4 addresses in DNS to affect
   inbound connections; if the source host's default address selection
   [ADDRSEL] works properly, 6to4 sources will use 6to4 addresses to
   reach the site and non-6to4 nodes use non-6to4 addresses.  If this

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


   behaviour of foreign nodes can be assumed, the security threats to
   such sites can be significantly simplified.

2.4.3. 6to4 as Tunnel End-Point Addressing Mechanism

   6to4 addresses can also be used only as an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel
   endpoint addressing and routing mechanism.

   An example of this is interconnecting 10 branch offices where nodes
   use non-6to4 addresses.  Only the offices' border routers need to be
   aware of 6to4, and use 6to4 addresses solely for addressing the
   tunnels between different branch offices.  This assumes that all
   outgoing traffic from the main organization (but not between branch
   offices) uses one or more non-6to4 connections.

   This is similar to the optimization model above, and can be used to
   make the addressing and routing easier.

3. Some Functionalities of 6to4

   In this section, some, relatively obvious features of different 6to4
   components are listed to better undestand what's the required
   behaviour.

3.1. Functions of Different 6to4 Network Components

     o Non-6to4 (Native) Node

            If native IPv6 nodes want to communicate with 6to4 nodes,
            they send the traffic along normally.  The traffic will
            reach the topologically closest, advertising 6to4 Relay
            Router, and will be tunneled to the destination 6to4 Router,
            which will pass it to the 6to4 node via normal forwarding
            process.

     o 6to4 Host

            A host, usually autoconfigured, that has an address from a
            6to4 prefix, but doesn't have a 6to4 pseudo-interface.  It
            doesn't need to know anything about 6to4, and it acts like a
            normal IPv6 Host in every manner.  Note that 6to4 Hosts can
            also be 6to4 Routers in some scenarios, but then 6to4 Router
            functionalities, below, apply.

     o 6to4 Router

            Acts at the border of a 6to4 domain.  It does not have a
            native, global IPv6 address.  More specifically:

              - provide "native-like" IPv6 connectivity to local clients
                and routers
              - if packets are sent to foreign 6to4 addresses, tunnel
                them to the destination 6to4 router using IPv4
              - if packets are sent to locally configured 6to4
                addresses, forward them normally
              - if packets are sent to non-6to4 addresses, tunnel them
                to the configured/closest-by-anycast 6to4 Relay Router,
                which will pass them on
              - if packets are received from 6to4 addresses, decapsulate
                the IPv4 packets received from 6to4 routers
              - if packets are received from non-6to4 addresses,
                decapsulate the IPv4 packets received from 6to4 Relay
                Router closest to the source (note: it is not easily
                distinguishable that the packet was really received from
                a Relay router, not from a spoofing third party.)

     o 6to4 Relay Router

            Acts as a relay between all 6to4 domains and native IPv6;
            more specifically:

              - advertises the reachability of the 2002::/16 prefix to
                native IPv6 routing, thus receiving traffic to all 6to4
                addresses from closest native IPv6 nodes
              - (if implements RFC3068) advertise the reachability of
                IPv4 '6to4 Relay anycast prefix' (192.88.99.0/24) to
                IPv4 routing, thus receiving some tunneled traffic to
                native IPv6 nodes from 6to4 Routers
              - if packets are received from 6to4 addresses through
                tunneling, decapsulate them and forwards them on using
                normal IPv6 routing
              - if packets are received through normal IPv6 routing from
                native addresses, and are destined for 2002::/16, tunnel
                them to the corresponding 6to4 Router

3.2. Non-functions of Different 6to4 Network Components

   What should not happen; this forms a basis for the security checks.
   The lists are not exhaustive.

     o 6to4 Router or Relay
         - use private, broadcast or reserved IPv4 addresses in tunnels,
           or the matching 6to4 prefixes
         - receive traffic from 6to4 Routers where the IPv4 tunnel
           source address does not match the 6to4 prefix

         - receive traffic where the destination IPv6 address is not a
           global address; in particular, e.g. link-local addresses,
           mapped addresses and such should not be used
     o 6to4 Router
         - send traffic to other 6to4 domains through 6to4 Relay Router
           or via some third party 6to4 Router
         - receive traffic from other 6to4 domains via a 6to4 Relay
           Router
         - receive traffic to other than to your own 6to4 prefix(es)
     o 6to4 Relay Router
         - receive traffic from 6to4 to 6to4

4. Special Processing of 6to4 Packets

   One could summarize the special processing of 6to4 as follows:

     o Relay Router
          1. incoming from native, tunneled to 6to4
          2. tunneled from 6to4, going to native

     o Router
          1. tunneled from relay, source is native
          2. tunneled to relay, destination is native
          3. tunneled directly, destination is 6to4

4.1. Encapsulating IPv6 Packets into IPv4

   IPv6 packets are encapsulated into IPv4 in three scenarios:

      1. 6to4 Router sends packets to other 6to4 Routers (2002::/16
         destination)
      2. 6to4 Router sends packets to its configured/nearest-by-anycast
         6to4 Relay Router (non-2002::/16 destination)
      3. 6to4 Relay Router sends packets from native IPv6 sources to
         6to4 Routers (2002::/16 destination)

4.2. Decapsulating IPv4 Packets into IPv6

   IPv6 packets are decapsulated from IPv4 in three scenarios:

      1. 6to4 Router receives packets from other 6to4 Routers (2002::/16
         source)
      2. 6to4 Router receives packets from a node, supposedly 6to4 Relay
         Router closest to the source (non-2002::/16 source)
      3. 6to4 Relay Router receives packets from 6to4 Routers, to be
         sent to native IPv6 destinations (2002::/16 source)

5. Threat Analysis

   The 6to4 threat analysis presented here focuses on 6to4
   implementations which have implemented most if not all security
   checks listed in [6TO4]; in particular, checks that always match
   2002:V4ADDR and V4ADDR must be implemented.  Many implementations are
   known to be problematic at least in some cases.

   The appendix lists some additional trivial threats which are
   applicable if no or only little security is implemented.

   The IPv4 address blocks 8.0.0.0/24 and 9.0.0.0/24 are only used for
   demonstrative purposes, representing global IPv4 addresses.

5.1. Threats Related to Any 6to4 Node

   Any 6to4 node can be made to participate in a DoS attack listed in
   5.2.2 below, being used as "dst".  The threat will be discussed
   there.

5.2. Threats Related to 6to4 Routers

   Note that in this memo, a loose interpretation of "6to4 router" is
   used; it is also used to refer to those 6to4 nodes which have the
   6to4 pseudo-interface.

   There are two main classes of threats; attacks against the 6to4
   pseudo-interface and attacks relying on being able to abuse the fact
   that it is difficult for 6to4 routers to tell whether packets from
   non-6to4 nodes come from legitimate relays.

5.2.1. Attacks Against the 6to4 Pseudo-Interface

   Unless the 6to4 pseudo-interface has been sufficiently protected,
   it's possible to remotely attack against the pseudo-interface with
   tunneled link-local packets, just as if it were in a local network.
   Threats to Neighbor Discovery are listed in [SEND].

   The potential effects of an attack can be mitigated if the interface
   is insulated from the other interfaces (e.g. a separate neighbor
   cache).  In practise, this is not the case.

   The attack can be eliminated by restricting the use of 6to4 pseudo-
   interface: if any packet with scope smaller than global is received,
   it must be silently discarded.  (Site-local might be allowed in some
   restricted scenarios.)  This may conflict with future uses of [6TO4,
   3.1].

5.2.1.1. Comparison to Situation without 6to4

   Even though rather simply fixable, this attack is not new as such;
   the same is possible using automatic tunneling [MECH] or configured
   tunneling (if one is able to spoof source IPv4 address to that of the
   tunnel end-point).

   However, as automatic tunneling is being deprecated, the worst
   problem comes from 6to4; any open decapsulation is bad.

5.2.2. Relay Spoofing, DoS against IPv6 Nodes

   6to4 Routers receive packets from non-6to4 source addresses through
   Relay Routers, as described in section 2.2 and 4.2 point 2.

   In the general case, the 6to4 router cannot distinguish Relay routers
   from malicious nodes sending IPv4-encapsulated IPv6 traffic directly
   to the 6to4 router.

   This makes two kinds of attacks possible:

     o unidirectional source address spoofing
     o Denial-of-Service attack reflection against native IPv6 nodes

   In both scenarios, the attacker sends IPv4-encapsulated IPv6 packets
   to the 6to4 router with contents like:

        src = 3ffe:1122:3344::1 (forged)
        dst = 2002:0900:0002::1
        src_v4 = 8.0.0.1
        dst_v4 = 9.0.0.2 (matching dst)

   Now the 6to4 router receives these packets from 8.0.0.1, decapsulates
   them, discarding the IPv4 header containing the source address
   8.0.0.1 and processes them as normal ("dst" has been guessed or
   obtained using one of a number of techniques).

   In the first scenario, it is assumed that "src" is somehow specially
   trusted (at least to some extent) more than some other packets.  This
   kind of weak trust based on IP addresses is commonplace.  This
   enables unidirectional (as the replies will be lost) source address
   spoofing, but may be enough for e.g. exploiting some remote
   vulnerabilities in connectionless protocol server applications.

   In the second scenario, if "dst" exists, the replies (e.g. TCP SYN
   ACK, TCP RST, ICMP Echo Reply, input sent to UDP echo service, etc.)
   are sent to the victim "src", above.  All the traces from the
   original attacker src_v4 have been discarded.  These return packets

   will go through a relay.

   These attacks are similar to ones shown in [RHHASEC].

5.2.2.1. Comparison to Situation without 6to4

   The unidirectional spoofing attack exists without 6to4 too, but it
   requires the attacker is able to spoof IPv6 source addresses.  With
   6to4, one is able to launch this attack without any spoofing at all.
   A restriction is that the source address cannot be spoofed to belong
   to the destination site as only non-6to4 addresses can be spoofed
   (assuming correct implementations).  Blindly trusting source address
   of packets coming from the Internet without other precautions is very
   bad practise, though -- and this attack would typically be useful
   only for spoofing destination site -- which is not possible, and can
   be protected against with egress filtering.

   The Denial-of-Service attack is also not really new; the only twists
   come from the fact that traces of an attack are more easily lost and
   that attacker does not really have to even spoof his IPv4 address to
   be able to reasonably discreetly launch the attack.

   However, it can be argued that this DoS attack is not critical
   because:

     o 6to4 as an enabling mechanism does not provide any possibility
       for packet multiplication, attacks are generally 1:1
     o victim receives packets as replies from "dst": unless echo
       service (e.g. UDP port 7) is used, the attacker has reasonably
       little control on the content of packets; for example, pure "SYN"
       TCP packets often used for flooding cannot be sent.
     o attack packets pass through choke point(s), namely (one or more)
       6to4 relays; in addition to physical limitations, these could
       implement some form 6to4-site-specific traffic limiting
     o one has to know a valid destination address (however, this is
       easily guessable or deducible with e.g. an ICMP echo request with
       a limited Hop Count).

   The attack can be launched from hosts whose connection is ingress-
   filtered, too.  So, this enables a way to launch attacks which hide
   the source address even when it was supposed to be prevented (for
   IPv4).

   However, often this is not a real factor, as usually the attackers
   are just zombies and real attackers may not even care if the
   unspoofed source address is discovered.

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


   This is one of the most serious threats.

5.3. Threats Related to 6to4 Relays

   6to4 Relays are also subject to attacks, but usually in a different
   role than 6to4 Routers; usually Relays' function is anonymization of
   the attack and losing trails, not reflection -- as properly
   implemented relays should be resistant to reflection.

   6to4 Relays have only one significant security check they must
   perform for general safety: when decapsulating IPv4 packets, check
   that 2002:V4ADDR and V4ADDR match.  If this is not done, several
   threats become more serious.

   Also, it is assumed here that the Relay checks that it will not relay
   packets between 6to4 addresses.  In particular, packets decapsulated
   from 6to4 routers cannot be encapsulated again towards 6to4 routers,
   as descibed in rules in section 6.

5.3.1. Attacks Against the 6to4 Pseudo-Interface

   The threats are the same as against 6to4 routers.

5.3.2. Spoofing, DoS against IPv6 Nodes

   If one cannot assume that IPv6 source addresses are ingress-filtered,
   the same threats as listed in 5.2.2 apply.

   The difference here is that a native IPv6 node spoofs the source IPv6
   addresses, and the relay router provides a layer of indirection and
   loses the trails.

5.3.3. Participating in DoS attacks against IPv4

   An attack specific to 6to4 Relays is similar to 6to4 Routers, but
   against IPv4; the attacker sends IPv6-native packets with an IPv4
   address he wants to bomb as the 6to4 destination address, like:

        src = 3ffe:1122:3344::1 (spoofed or real attacker)
        dst = 2002:0900:0002::1 (victim)

   Now the 6to4 relay receives these packets, and encapsulates in IPv4
   packets that are sent towards 9.0.0.2; the destination may not have a
   faintest idea of what IPv6 is, but is bombed with packets coming from
   the relay's IPv4 address, including IPv6 packets as the payload.

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


5.3.3.1. Comparison to Situation without 6to4

   Slightly different arguments apply; below are reasons why this can be
   considered not too serious an attack:

     o 6to4 as an enabling mechanism does not provide any possibility
       for packet multiplication, attacks are generally 1:1
     o victim receives packets as sent by the source; if the victim is
       an IPv4-only node, it just sees "protocol 41" packets which are
       not typically dangerous and easily filtered
     o 6to4 relay's source IPv4 address is used in packets, and tracing
       is easier
     o source IPv6 address (spoofed or real) is in the packets which may
       make manual tracing easier
     o attack packets pass through choke point(s), namely (one or more)
       6to4 relays; in addition to physical limitations, these could
       implement some form 6to4-site-specific traffic limiting

   And as counter-arguments, some more serious aspects of it are:

     o victim receives packets as sent by the source; if the victim is
       6to4 node, IPv6 packet can include almost anything; however if
       IPv6 source addess is not spoofed, this attack is nothing new.
     o the relays can be chosen by the attacker, so if there are a large
       number of relays, he can pick ones that are known best suited for
       the attack (e.g. bad security policy, ones using 192.88.99.1 as
       source for more difficult tracing, etc.)

5.3.4. Using Any IPv6 Node for Reflection

   Any IPv6 node will respond to IPv6 packets destined to the node with
   source address belonging to 2002::/16.

   This attack is applicable if:

     o the relay chosen by the attacker does not check that IPv4 source
       and 2002::/16 source address match, or
     o the attacker's IPv6 connection is not ingress-filtered (and it
       was really a non-6to4 source)

   The IPv6 source address being forged, the node will participate as an
   unwilling intermediary to an attack through a 6to4 relay against any
   IPv4 node (or 6to4 node), like:








Savola                     [Expires July 2003]                 [Page 14]

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


        src = 2002:0900:0002::1 (forged, target of the attack)
        dst = 3ffe:1122:3344::1 (intermediary node)

   This is not new: similar attack with any other spoofed source address
   is possible if ingress filtering is not enabled.  The only difference
   here is that when attacking IPv4 nodes, the relay's IPv4 source
   address is seen as the immediate source of the attack.  Closer
   inspection (after packet reflection) reveals the IPv6 datagram with
   (possibly spoofed) 2002::/16 destination address.

5.3.4.1. Comparison to Situation without 6to4

   This attack is a reflected variation of the attack above; the
   implications are similar to those in section 5.2.2.1:

     o A non-compliant 6to4 implementation or IPv6 source address
       spoofing is required
     o 6to4 as an enabling mechanism does not provide any possibility
       for packet multiplication, attacks are generally 1:1
     o victim receives packets as replies from "dst": unless echo
       service (e.g. UDP port 7) is used, the attacker has reasonably
       little control on the content of packets; for example, pure "SYN"
       TCP packets often used for flooding cannot be sent.
     o attack packets pass through choke point(s), namely (one or more)
       6to4 relays; in addition to physical limitations, these could
       implement some form 6to4-site-specific traffic limiting

5.3.5. IPv4 Local Directed Broadcast Attacks

   This threat is applicable if the relay does not check whether the
   IPv4 address it tries to send encapsulated IPv6 packets to is a local
   broadcast address.  This threat is mentioned in [6TO4].  The packet
   could be sent as follows:

        src = 3ffe:ffff:5678::aaaa (may be forged)
        dst = 2002:0900:00ff::bbbb

   9.0.0.255 is assumed the the relay's broadcast address.  After
   receiving the packet natively, if the relay doesn't check the
   destination address for subnet broadcast, it would send the
   encapsulated IP-IP packet to 9.0.0.255.  This would be received by
   all nodes in the subnet, and the responses would be directed to the
   relay.

5.3.5.1. Comparison to Situation without 6to4

   This is a special form of "directed broadcast" attack which cannot be
   protected against except by the mentioned check.  However, there is a

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


   significant difference: the reply packets are sent back to the relay.
   Therefore only the non-compliant device can suffer from this; the
   rest of the Internet cannot be affected.

5.3.6. Theft of Service

   The administrators of 6to4 Relay Routers often want to use some
   policy to limit the use of relay.

   The policy control is usually done by applying some restrictions in
   where the routing information for 2002::/16 and/or 192.88.99.0/24 (if
   [6TO4ANY] is used) will spread.

   Some users may be able to use the service regardless of these
   controls using:

     o configuring the address of the relay using its IPv4 address
       instead of 192.88.99.1
     o using Routing Header to route IPv6 packets to reach some 6to4
       Relay (some other routing tricks like neighbors setting static
       routes are also possible)

   The former can be protected against using configured access lists in
   the relay; this is only feasible if the number of IP networks the
   relay is supposed to serve is relatively low.  Another possible way
   to mitigate this is to filter out arriving tunneled packets with
   protocol 41 (IPv6) which do not have the the 192.88.99.1 as the
   destination address.

   The latter has similar issues: the IPv6 source address could be
   checked so the packets to the relay only come from the valid IPv6
   addresses which are able to reach the relay anyway.

   Of these, except in really restricted scenarios, only the first may
   be of some interest, and the mitigating the problem by access list is
   rather straightforward.

   As this threat does not have implications on other than the
   organization providing Relay, it is not further analysed.

5.4. Possible Threat Mitigation Methods

   This section gives a rough idea of mechanisms thought to mitigate the
   threats.

5.4.1. 6to4 Decapsulation Cache

   6to4 decapsulators (routers, relays) could keep a least recently used
   (LRU) header cache of possibly a few hundred entries of recently seen
   packets for tracing purposes.

   The problem here is how that kind of data could be extracted -- by
   third parties that need it -- in timely fashion.  Many
   implementations are, of course, already able to perform something
   like this by e.g. manually set logging access lists.

5.4.2. Rate-limiting at 6to4 Routers/Relays

   TBD.

5.4.3. An Application of iTrace Model

   6to4 decapsulators (or some of them) could send out some specific
   packets probabilitically as a way ensure that reflectors cannot be
   used to lose trails of an attack.  This could either be a
   simplification or an extension of e.g. [ITRACE] model, depending on
   how fast its specification goes.

   The most important place for this would be at 6to4 Routers, to
   counter the reflection attack descibed in 5.2.2.  If so, the check
   could be placed at the decapsulation phase where packets have a 6to4
   destination address but the source is non-6to4.

5.5. Summary

   It would be useful to try to characterize the different threats by
   comparing the severity of the threat to:

      1. IPv4 networks today, where in many cases (even most), source
         address spoofing is possible and there are no easy ways to
         trace attacks

      2. Hypothetical IPv4 networks -- the case if ingress filtering
         would be deployed everywhere

      3. Hypothetical IPv6 networks -- the case if ingress filtering
         would be deployed everywhere in current and future IPv6
         networks

   However, this would be very difficult as it is not easy to assign
   severity values to all the features 6to4 adds and try to decide
   whether it's more serious or not.

   was merged with 5.2.2 as the effects are the same but from a
   different perspective.

   The table is sorted by threat type.  Possibilities are spoofing,
   direct attack, attack by reflection (ie. final attack consists of
   some response packets) and other.

   Threats when realize (ab)use some IPv6 nodes: possibilities are
   either 6to4 Routers (Rtr), 6to4 Relays (Rly) or any IPv6 nodes or any
   6to4 nodes (Any).  "R*" means that both Relays and Routers are used.

   The final target of the attack is descibed in "Against"; it can be
   node(s) or network itself, the site itself which could prevent the
   attack, any IPv4 node or any non-6to4 IPv6 node (non6to4).

   If a fix for the problem is apparent, it is mentioned in the Fix
   field.

   If it can be assumed that either complete Internet-wide IPv4 or IPv6
   ingress filtering would (more or less) fix or significantly alleviate
   the problem, the fixing version of ingress filtering is noted in I-F
   column.  The notable case is 5.3.4 where both v4/v6 ingress filtering
   is needed -- but if the half of the readily-available fix is done,
   IPv6 ingress filtering is enough.  The other notable case is threat
   5.2.2, which cannot be disabled by ingress filtering.

   The last field "Comp" tries to compare the threats to their IPv4
   equivalents, using:

      1. cannot control packets significantly, ie. a weak attack
      2. can be mitigated significantly by adding some kind of tracing
      3. some new form of attack

5.5.2. Generic Notes about Threats

   Note: TBD.

     o correct and fully-implemented base security features are a pre-
       requisite for reasonably safe operation
     o being able to spoof IPv4 or IPv6 packets enables one to launch
       similar or more powerful attacks even currently
     o some 6to4 attacks provide an additional layer of indirection,
       which may or may not be useful
     o 6to4 as an enabling mechanism does not provide any possibility
       for packet multiplication which would affect global Internet,
       attacks are generally 1:1
     o typically the reflected packets have restricted content, limiting
       the usability in an attack
     o attacks typically have either 6to4 relay router's address or some
       other information which could be used in manual tracing
     o attack packets pass through choke point(s), namely (one or more)
       6to4 relays; in addition to physical limitations, these could
       implement some form 6to4-site-specific traffic limiting
     o attacks could in theory be traceable using an extension of
       [ITRACE] or [REVITRACE], but as those haven't been specified,
       much less used, the point seems rather academic yet

   When considering motives for DoS attacks and how to protect against
   them (and considering the cost, and whether the protection actually
   buys you anything), the following should not be forgotten:

     o IPv4 and IPv6 ingress filtering are not likely to be commonplace
       for a long time; until it is, you cannot really depend on it
     o the real attacker (launching a DoS or DDoS) may not really even
       care whether some zombie nodes get found out
     o techniques to trace DoS attacks are still in infancy (or not even
       there) yet; due to time anything takes to get deployed, it is not
       clear whether tracing mechanisms even for basic DoS attack
       mechanisms would get reasonably widely deployed before it was
       time to (more or less) retire 6to4
     o DoS attacks are something that, in practise, operational people
       have to be able to deal with anyway

6. Solutions

6.1. Generic Approach

6.1.1. Encapsulating IPv6 into IPv4

    src and dst MUST pass ipv6-sanity checks, else drop (defined below)

        fi
    elif dst=2002
        dst_v4 MAY have to match one of ipv4 equiv. of 6to4 prefixes masked by a
           user-specified prefix length (restricting who can use the relay)
            [ the scenario: 4.1. case 3. ]

6.1.3. IPv4 and IPv6 Sanity Checks

6.1.3.1. IPv4

   IPv4 address MUST be a global unicast address, as required by the
   6to4 specification.  The disallowed addresses include those defined
   in [RFC1812], and others widely used and known not to be global.
   These are:

     o 0.0.0.0/8      (the system has no address assigned yet)
     o 10.0.0.0/8     (private)
     o 127.0.0.0/8    (loopback)
     o 172.16.0.0/12  (private)
     o 192.168.0.0/16 (private)
     o 169.254.0.0/16 (IANA Assigned DHCP link-local)
     o 224.0.0.0/4    (multicast)
     o 255.0.0.0/8    (broadcast)

   In addition it MUST be checked that the address is not any of the
   system's broadcast addresses.  This is especially important if the
   implementation is made so that it can receive and process
   encapsulated IPv4 packets arriving at its broadcast addresses, or try
   to send encapsulated IPv4 packets to one of its broadcast addresses.

6.1.3.2. IPv6

   IPv6 address MUST NOT be:
     o 0::/16    (compatible, mapped addresses, loopback, unspecified,
       ...)
     o fe80::/10 (link-local)
     o fec0::/10 (site-local)
     o ff02::/16 (link-local multicast)

   Other multicast could also be considered for filtering.

   In addition, it MUST be checked that equivalent 2002:V4ADDR checks,
   where V4ADDR is any of the above IPv4 addresses, will not be passed.

6.1.3.3. Optional Ingress Filtering

   In addition, the implementation may perform some form of ingress
   filtering (e.g. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding checks).  For
   example, if the 6to4 Router has multiple interfaces, of which some
   are "internal", receiving either IPv4 or IPv6 packets with source
   address belonging to any of these internal networks from the Internet
   might be disallowed.

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


   If these checks are implemented, it is RECOMMENDED that they default
   to disabled.

6.1.3.4. Notes About the Checks

   The rule 'dst_v4 SHOULD be assigned to the router' is not needed if
   the implementation is made in such a way that it only accepts and
   processes encapsulated IPv4 packets arriving on unicast IPv4
   addresses, and that if destination address is known to be a local
   broadcast address, not try to encapsulate and send packets to it.

   Some checks, especially the IPv4/IPv6 Sanity Checks, could be at
   least partially implementable with system-level access lists, if one
   would like to avoid placing too many restrictions in the 6to4
   implementation itself.  This depends on how many hooks for ACL's are
   in place.  In practice it seems like this could not be done
   effectively enough unless the access list mechanism is able to parse
   the encapsulated packets within IP-IP.

6.2. Simplified Approach

   This makes some assumptions about the implementation as pointed above
   to simplify the above rules.

6.2.1. Encapsulating IPv6 into IPv4

    src and dst MUST pass ipv6-sanity checks, else drop
    if src=2002
        src MUST match src_v4
    elif dst=2002
        (accept)
    else
        drop
    fi
    accept

6.2.2. Decapsulating IPv4 into IPv6

    src_v4 and dst_v4 MUST pass ipv4-sanity checks, else drop
    src and dst MUST pass ipv6-sanity checks, else drop
    if dst=2002
        dst MUST match dst_v4
            if src=2002
                src MUST match src_v4
            fi
    elif src=2002
        src MUST match src_v4
    else

7. Problems

7.1. Implementation Considerations with Automatic Tunnels

   There is a problem with multiple transition mechanisms if strict
   security checks are implemented.  This may vary a bit from
   implementation to implementation.

   Consider three mechanisms using automatic tunneling: 6to4, ISATAP
   [ISATAP] and Automatic Tunneling using Compatible Addresses [MECH].
   All of these use IP-IP (protocol 41) [IPIP] IPv4 encapsulation with,
   more or less, a pseudo-interface.

   When a router, which has any two of these enabled, receives an IPv4
   encapsulated IPv6 packet:

        src_v4 = 10.0.0.1
        dst_v4 = 20.20.20.20
        src = 3ffe:ffff::1
        dst = 2002:1010:1010::2

   what can it do?  How should it decide which transitionary mechanism
   this belongs to; there is no "transitionary mechanism number" in IPv6
   or IPv4 header to signify this. (This can also be viewed as a
   flexibility benefit.)

   Without any kind of security checks (in any of implemented methods)
   these often just "work" as the mechanisms aren't differentiated but
   handled in "one big lump".

   Configured tunneling [MECH] does not suffer from this as it is point-
   to-point, and based on src/dst pairs of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   it can be deduced which logical tunnel interface is in the question.

   Solutions for this include not using more than one automatic
   tunneling mechanisms in the same system or binding different
   mechanisms to different IPv4 addresses.

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


7.2. Reduced Flexibility

   There is a worry about too strict rules limiting the (future)
   flexibility of 6to4.  If later, for some reason, one would want to
   introduce new revolutionary ways to use 6to4, strict checking in all
   relevant nodes might prevent it, as new updated version would have to
   be deployed everywhere before the new method could be used.

   On the other hand, one could argue that 6to4 has always been intended
   as an intermediate mechanism, and that future flexibility should not
   be critical.  However, it is difficult to predict how long the
   intermediate period will be.

7.3. Anyone Pretending to Be a Relay Router

   6to4 Routers receive traffic from non-6to4 ("native") sources via
   6to4 Relays.  6to4 Routers have no way of matching IPv4 source
   address of the relay with non-6to4 IPv6 address of the source.  In
   consequence, anyone can spoof any non-6to4 IPv6 address he wants by
   sending traffic, encapsulated, directly to 6to4 Routers.  This is
   analyzed in more detail in the Threat Analysis section, above.

   Of course, as the source IPv4 address may be logged, many may spoof
   their IPv4 source address, but the ability to do so is not be
   required: it is unlikely that source IPv4 (but rather, the spoofed
   IPv6 address) will be logged anywhere -- this would be equivalent to
   logging the MAC-address of IP packets.

   Unfortunately, this problem is very difficult to solve properly.
   There have been two rough ideas:

     o Every 6to4 Relay MUST configure and use "192.88.99.1" as the
       source address of packets that are encapsulated towards 6to4
       Routers.

     o Every 6to4 Relay MUST participate in an eBGP multi-hop peering
       mesh (which can be hierarchical): there more specific routes will
       be advertised.

   It should be noted that if IPv6 operators do not implement ingress
   filtering for IPv6, so that spoofing IPv6 is not more difficult than
   spoofing IPv4, these problems have only little impact on the overall
   security of 6to4 nodes.

   The first has since then been rejected: the difference in the
   difficulty of spoofing an address and spoofing it to be 192.88.99.1
   does not seem to justify the mechanism.  A tentative analysis for the
   second is given below.

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


7.3.1. Limited Distribution of More Specific Routes

   If 6to4 prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 could be advertised,
   the traffic model between native<->6to4 and 6to4<-> could be changed
   so that only one Relay would always be used, most often the one
   closest to the 6to4 Router.

   This model was rejected in the base specification, as IPv6 routing
   table was not to be polluted by 6to4 prefixes derived of IPv4
   prefixes.

   However, the problem can be avoided with some effort: creating a
   separate, possibly hierarchical based on IPv6 connections, peering
   mesh for 6to4 Relay routers.  This could be done by forming eBGP
   [BGP] multi-hop peerings between Relays, and advertising more
   specific routes (e.g. the same superblocks of IPv4 addresses one
   expects to service) to all the other Routers.

   In that way, the global routing table would not be impacted at all.

   This seems to have at least three potential issues:

     o Every Relay should be part of this (if one wants to have some
       extra safety that the addresses haven't been spoofed)

     o The route from a native source takes the path to the first Relay,
       and there (possibly through other Relays) to the last Relay to
       tunnel the packet to the 6to4 Router; this adds at least some
       latency

     o The mechanism of redistributing IPv4 6to4 client addresses to
       other relays as 6to4 prefixes needs work

   Of these, only the last requires more discussion.  It could be argued
   that this advertising should either be manually configured once (ie.
   relatively static prefixes, or generated from IPv4 route-objects in
   RADB etc.) or generated automatically (e.g. when a 6to4 Router first
   sends a "triggering" packet through the Relay).  Of course, this data
   could even be derived in some form from the IPv4 routing tables.
   Further analysis on this is TBD if necessary.

   This method seems to be the only one where strong cryptography-based
   mechanisms to be sure about the 6to4 Router - 6to4 Relay
   -relationship could be doable; otherwise, some sort of infrastructure
   (e.g. small-scale PKI) would have to be established which would have
   to include all the possible 6to4 Relays in the Internet.

8. Security Considerations

   This draft discusses security considerations.

   Even if proper checks are implemented, there are significant security
   threats ranging from DoS proxy attacks to spoofing and attacks
   against 6to4 pseudo-interface.  These threats are analyzed in section
   5.

   As can be seen, there are mainly three classes of potential problem
   sources:

     o 6to4 routers not being able to identify whether relays are
       legitimate
     o wrong or impartially implemented 6to4 Routers
     o relays performing packet laundering

   The first is the toughest problem, still under research.  The second
   can be fixed by ensuring the correctness of implementations; this is
   important.  Thr third is also a difficult, but a fairly restricted
   problem as relays are limited in number.

   These are analyzed in detail in Threat Analysis section, above.

9. Acknowledgements

   Some issues were first brought up in [TRANSAB] and Alain Durand
   introduced one specific problem at IETF51 in August 2001 (though
   there was some discussion on the list prior to that); these gave the
   author the push to start looking into the details of securing 6to4.

   Alexey Kuznetsov brought up the implementation problem with IPv6
   martian checks.  Christian Huitema formulated the rules that rely on
   Relays using only anycast.  Keith Moore brought up the point about
   reduced flexibility.  Brian Carpenter, Tony Hain and Vladislav
   Yasevich are acknowledged for lengthy discussions.  Alain Durand
   reminded of relay spoofing problems.  Brian Carpenter reminded of the
   BGP-based 6to4 router model. Christian Huitema gave a push to a more
   complete threat analysis.

   In the latter phase, especially discussions with Christian Huitema,
   Brian Carpenter and Alain Durand were helpful when improving the
   document.

A. Some Trivial Attack Scenarios Outlined

   Here, a few trivial attack scenarios are outlined -- ones that are
   prevented by implementing checks listed in [6TO4] or in this memo.

   When two 6to4 Routers send traffic to each others' domains, packet
   sent by RA to RB is like (note: addresses from 8.0.0.0/24 are just
   examples of global IPv4 addresses):

        src = 2002:0800:0001::aaaa
        dst = 2002:0800:0002::bbbb
        src_v4 = 8.0.0.1 (added when encapsulated to IPv4)
        dst_v4 = 8.0.0.2 (added when encapsulated to IPv4)

   When the packet is received by IPv4 stack on RB, it will be
   decapsulated so that only src and dst remain, as originally sent by
   RA:

        src = 2002:0800:0001::aaaa
        dst = 2002:0800:0002::bbbb

   As every other node is just one hop away (IPv6-wise) and the link-
   layer (IPv4) addresses are lost, this may open a lot of possibilities
   for misuse.

   As an example, unidirectional IPv6 spoofing is made trivial because
   nobody can check (without delving into IP-IP packets) whether the
   encapsulated IPv6 addresses were authentic (With native IPv6, this
   can be done by e.g. RPF-like mechanisms or access lists in upstream
   routers).






Savola                     [Expires July 2003]                 [Page 28]

Internet Draft   draft-savola-v6ops-6to4-security-02.txt    January 2003


        src = 2002:1234:5678::aaaa (forged)
        dst = 2002:0800:0002::bbbb
        src_v4 = 8.0.0.1 (added when encapsulated to IPv4)
        dst_v4 = 8.0.0.2 (added when encapsulated to IPv4)

   A similar attack with "src" being native address is possible even
   with the security checks, by having the sender node pretend to be a
   6to4 Relay router.

   More worries come in to the picture if e.g.

        src = ::ffff:[some trusted IPv4 in a private network]
        src/dst = ::ffff:127.0.0.1
        src/dst = ::1
        src/dst = ...

   Some implementations might have been careful enough to have designed
   the stack to as to avoid the incoming (or reply) packets going to
   IPv4 packet processing through special addresses (e.g. IPv4-mapped
   addresses), but who can say for all ...
