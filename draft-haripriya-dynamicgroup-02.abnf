   For the purpose of evaluating dynamic members, the directory server
   uses only the dn, scope, filter and extensions fields.  All remaining
   fields are ignored if specified.  If other fields are specified, the
   server SHALL ignore them and MAY omit them when presenting the value
   to a client.  The dn is used to specify the base dn from which to
   start the search for dynamic members.  The scope specifies the scope
   with respect to the dn in which to search for dynamic members.  The
   filter specifies the criteria with which to select objects for
   dynamic membership.
