1.  Introduction

   This document specifies IP-SFS, a method for the encapsulation and
   transmission of IPv4/IPv6 packets over the Semaphore Flag Signaling
   System (SFSS).  The SFSS is an internationally recognized alphabetic
   communication system based upon the waving of a pair of hand-held
   flags [JCroft, Wikipedia].  Under the SFSS, each alphabetic character
   or control signal is indicated by a particular flag pattern, called a
   Semaphore Flag Signal (SFS).

   IP-SFS provides reliable transmission of IP datagrams over a half-
   duplex channel between two interfaces.  At the physical layer, SFSS
   uses optical transmission, normally through the atmosphere using
   solar illumination and line-of-sight photonics.  A control protocol
   (Section 4) allows each interface to contend for transmission on the
   common channel.

   This specification defines only unicast transmission.  Broadcast is
   theoretically possible, but there are some physical restrictions on
   channel direction dispersion.  This is a topic for future study.

   The diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the place of the SFSS in the
   Internet protocol hierarchy.

3.1.  IP-SFS Frame Description

   IP datagrams are formatted into IP-SFS frames by adding IP-SFS
   headers and trailers.  Figure 2 shows the format of one IP-SFS frame.
   The frame is delimited by a control SFS called FST (Frame Start) and
   a control SFS called FEN (Frame End).  It is composed of a series of
   4-bit nibbles, one per SFS.

   An IP datagram will be fragmented into multiple successive IP-SFS
   frames if necessary.  When an IP datagram is fragmented into N
   frames, the first frame will be sent with frame number N-1, the
   second with frame number N-2, ..., and the last with frame number 0.


              0        1        2        3

            Note that each field represents one SFS or 4 bits.

   Frame No:  8 bits (2 data SFSs):
              Frame number for fragmented IP datagram.

   DATA:      0 to 510 data SFSs (Section 3.2.1) representing 0 to 255
              octets of payload.

   CRC:       16 bits as four data SFSs.
              CRC checksum.  Preset to 0xFFFF.  One&#x27;s complement of
              checksum is transmitted.

   FEN:       Frame ENd control SFS.

   The number of transmitted SFSs per minute (Spm) depends on the
   experience of participating interfaces.  Resulting link speed in bits
   per second for IP-SFS is (Spm/60)*4, not counting framing overhead.

3.2.  SFS Coding

   Data signals and control signals are based upon standard SFS
   encoding, as described by [JCroft], [Wikipedia], and other sources on
   the Internet.  The 16 data signals are interpreted as 4-bit nibbles,
   while the 9 control signals are used for data link control.

   IP-SFS defines the 16 data signals by the original SFSS encodings for
   letters A to P and the 9 control signals represented by SFSS
   encodings Q to X.

3.3.  IP-SFS Data Signals

   Figure 3 illustrates the 16 SFSs used to transmit data frames over
   the link.  The illustrations show each SFS as seen from the receiving
   side.

   Their meanings are listed in Figure 4.  The illustrations show each
   SFS as seen from the receiving side.

<b>Notes:</b><br/>
The illustrated SFS for symbol &#x27;Y&#x27;, signifying control signal &#x27;RTT&#x27;,<br/>is depicted as identical with symbol &#x27;M&#x27;, which signals nibble value<br/>0x0C.  This means that some implementations may break off receipt with<br/>an error on receiving 0x0C and interpreting it as RTT, while others<br/>may see RTT and interpret it as a spurious 0x0C, and ignore it.<br/><br/>References [JCroft, Wikipedia] gives a different way of signalling &#x27;Y&#x27;,<br/>which does not coincide with any of the other symbols.  This<br/>discrepancy between the current specification and the references may<br/>also result in both implementation and execution differences, as some<br/>interfaces may already have signal &#x27;Y&#x27; hard-coded according to [JCroft]<br/>or [Wikipedia], which will result in transmission of an SFS which will<br/>not be understood by an interface that follows the current specification<br/>strictly.<br/><br/>Author: Errors in the forms of SFS representation for SFS V/KAL and SFS Y/RTT.<br/><br/>from pending

   FUN: Frame UNdo.  As long as Frame ENd is not sent, the transmitter
        or the receiver may send a FUN to restart the transmission of
        the current frame.  This signal will be unacknowledged and may
        be ignored by the receiver.

   ACK: Frame ACK.  Acknowledges reception of one frame.

   KAL: KeepALive.  Keep a connection alive.  Is to be transmitted in
        State Idle at a frequency of at least KAL_FREQ (see
        Section 4.2).  This signal will be unacknowledged.

   NAK: Frame No AcK.  The frame received is incorrect.

   RTR: Ready To Receive.  Receiver acknowledges it is ready to receive.

   RTT: Ready To Transmit.  Sender requests permission to initiate
        transmission.

3.5.  Protocol Limitations

   Due to the physical characteristics of the transfer channel, bit
   error rates are expected to be in the range of 1e-3 (boy scout) to
   1e-4 (professional sailor), and also depend a number of physical
   factors.  Poor visibility due to weather conditions or lack of
   illumination (e.g., night time) can drastically increase the error
   rate.

   IP-SFS provides no means to handle frame reordering or dual
   (multiple) frame reception.  Thus, the protocol is not suitable in
   environments where interfaces are moving fast and/or when the path of
   light is long.

3.6.  Implementation Limitations

   Maximum payload per frame: 510 SFS (0...510) nibbles (0 to 255
   octets)

   Maximum SFS per frame: 518

   Maximum frames per session: 255 (0...254)

4.  Interface Discussion

   An interface is constructed through the participation of one or more
   humans.  A knowledge of the SFSS is recommended, but its absence can
   be compensated by a well-designed GUI.

4.1.  Data Link Control

   This section describes the control protocol used to allocate the
   half-duplex data link to either interface.

   Interfaces know three States: Idle, Transmitting (TX), and Receiving
   (RX).

4.2.  Establishing a Connection

   IP-SFS is strictly point-to-point.  Unless interface members are
   acquainted with each other, a brief introduction of both sides is
   suggested prior to setting up a link to reduce the likelihood of
   interface-spoofing attacks.

   Interfaces must agree on two different IP addresses on the same
   subnet.

   Interfaces are free to negotiate any period of time as TIMEOUT.
   Possible values for TIMEOUT are the time it takes to smoke a
   cigarette or the time it takes to drink a glass of water.  If
   negotiation fails, TIMEOUT defaults to 60 seconds.

   The same procedure may be applied for the KeepALive FReQuency
   (KAL_FRQ).  The period of KAL_FRQ (1/KAL_FRQ) should be at least
   5*TIMEOUT.

4.3.   State Idle

   Interfaces in State Idle must be ready to send an IP datagram
   provided by a local higher-level protocol or to receive a datagram
   from the link-partner.  Interfaces in State Idle must send keep-alive
   signals KAL at a frequency of at least KAL_FRQ.

   There are no further definitions for State Idle, but we recommend
   staying away from alcoholic beverages or other types of drugs that
   could lead to an increased number of FUN and/or SUN signals, a
   decrease in bandwidth, or an increase of line latency.

   If the number of IP datagrams in the transmission queue is &gt;0, the
   interface may try to initiate a session by sending an RTT to the link
   partner<span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-908'>.  If the link partner is ready to receive, it returns an RTR <button id="btn_908" target="expand_908" onclick='hideFunction("expand_908")'>Expand</button>
   signal.</span id__locate=908>

4.4.  Session Initiation

   An interface receiving a datagram from an Internet layer protocol
   level may start signaling RTT.

   If the link partner does not respond with RTR within TIMEOUT, or the
   link partner responds with RTT, the interface switches to State Idle
   for a random period of time between 2 seconds and TIMEOUT, before
   resending the RTT.

   If the link partner transmits RTR, the interface transmits the number
   of IP-SFS frames to be transmitted in this session as two SFSs
   followed by another RTT.  If the link partner does not transmit the
   same number of IP-SFS frames followed by RTR within 3*TIMEOUT, the
   interface switches to State Idle.

   If the link partner transmits the same number of IP-SFS frames
   followed by RTR, the interface switches to State Transmitting.

   Unless obstructed through environmental noise or great distance,
   hollering can be used to request line discipline from the link
   partner in State Idle.  The use of cellphones is also an option,
   whereas throwing objects or using guns is not recommended, since it
   could result in interface damage or destruction.  This would be
   counterproductive.

4.5.  State Transmitting

   Transmission of one IP-SFS frame starts with FST.  After FST and
   before FEN have been transmitted, the interface may acknowledge a
   received FUN and restart the transmission of the active frame or
   discard the signal and continue transmission of the active IP-SFS
   frame.

   If an error occurs by transmitting a wrong data SFS, the interface
   may invalidate the last data SFS by transmitting SUN followed by the
   correct signal.  A series of incorrectly transmitted data SFSs may be
   invalidated by sending a SUN for each invalid SFS, effectively back-
   spacing the sequence.

   Control SFSs cannot be invalidated.

   If an error occurs, the interface may also transmit FUN and restart
   transmission of the active IP-SFS frame.

   Whether the interfaces choose SUN or FUN for error correction is up
   to the interface, but it is suggested to use SUN for a single invalid
   SFS, and FUN whenever the interface failed to transmit several SFSs
   in a row.

   After FEN has been transmitted, the transmitting interface waits for
   the link partner to transmit ACK or NAK.

   If ACK has been received, the transmitting interface removes the
   active frame and starts transmitting the next IP-SFS frame.  If no
   frames are left, the interface switches to State Idle.

   If NAK has been received, the transmission failed, and the interface
   must start transmitting the active frame again.

   If the link partner does not transmit ACK or NAK within TIMEOUT, the
   transmission failed, and the interface must start retransmitting the
   active IP-SFS frame.

   If transmission of the same IP-SFS frame fails 5 times, the interface
   leaves the IP datagram in the transmission queue and switches to
   State Idle.

4.6.  State Receiving

   In State Receiving, the interface stores each SFS received from the
   link partner in the receiving queue in the order of appearance.

   After FST and before FEN have been received, the interface may
   transmit FUN at any time to request a retransmission of the entire
   IP-SFS frame.

   If the time between two received SFSs exceeds TIMEOUT, the receiving
   interface must discard all data from the active IP-SFS frame and may
   additionally transmit FUN.  If the link partner does not continue
   transmitting within a second TIMEOUT period, the interface must clear
   the receiving queue and switch to State Idle.

   If the interface receives SUN from the link partner, it must discard
   the last received data SFS (if any).  If N SUNs are received in a
   row, then the last N data SFS must be discarded, unless there are no
   more data SFS in the frame.  If there are no more data SFS in the
   frame to be discarded, the SUN signal must be ignored by the
   interface.

   If the receiving interface receives FUN from the link partner, it is
   free to discard the frame received thus far.  We suggest honoring FUN
   since discarding the signal will decrease bandwidth.

   After FEN has been received, the receiving interface evaluates the
   checksum.  If the checksum is good, the interface transmits ACK.  If
   the Frame Number of the active frame is 0, the interface passes the
   entire data from the receiving queue to the higher level protocol,
   clears the receiving queue, and switches to State Idle.

   If the checksum is incorrect, the interface transmits NAK.

4.7.  Terminating a Connection

   If the interface is in State Idle and the link partner did not
   transmit any kind of SFS for at least five times 1/KAL_FRQ, the
   connection is terminated and the interfaces are free to disband.

4.8.  Further Remarks

   Interfaces are connected to computer hardware by means of a suitable
   input device (RX) and a suitable output device (TX).  Possible
   devices include keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  Other means of
   connection are subject to availability and budget.

   Although it is theoretically possible to combine the TX and RX parts
   of an interface in one human being, we suggest dividing the
   operations among at least two people per interface.  For longer
   transmissions (multimedia streaming, video conferencing, etc.),
   consider rotating and providing substitutes.

   Bandwidth tends to vary.  Typically TX starts at about 2-4 bits/s and
   will decrease over time due to exhaustion and lack of concentration.
   When an interface in TX State signals at a rate higher than the RX
   interface is able to receive, signal loss occurs.

5.  Security Considerations

   By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered
   insecure.  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
   discouraged unless security is provided by higher level protocols.

   Interfaces tend to keep data in their memory.  There is no way to
   determine the lifetime of data in memory.  As a side effect, data
   might show up in unwanted locations at undesired times.

   We are currently not aware of a technique to reliably delete data
   from interfaces&#x27; memory without permanent interface destruction.

<b>Section:</b> 99

<b>Original Text:</b>

RFC 4824 completely fails to appropriatey point out the benefits and
merits of IP-SFS, and to perform a fair comparison with industry
standard strenght security for common wireless protocols.

Apparently, IP-SFS provides for industry standard Wireless Equivalent
Privacy (WEP).  It *is* a wireless protocol!  Its interfaces do not
consume electrical power (if used under daylight conditions) and do not
produce any electromagnetical interference.  The former property
results in great applicability to developing economies that lack
substantial ubiquitous electrical power distribution but have a lot of
cheap manpower available, but it also makes IP-SFS great for countries
with instable electrical power distribution systems, like the U.S.
(and, yet currently still to a lesser degree, Europe).  Both properties
together make IP-SFS strictly immune to any modern cryptanalytical
methods based on the variation of power consumption over time and to
the suspected industry espionage by the electronical &#x27;sky ears&#x27; still
deployed in Europe and otherwise mostly idle, since the end of the Cold
War.

Furthermore, IP-SFS apparently is very well suited for environments
with stringent legal requirements for the war against the Axis of
Evil, with its step-by-step increasing legal custody of privacy and
political correctness of content to be performed / enforced by
legal authorities and cooperating access and content providers.

That should make IP-SFS particularly interesting for the emerging
infrastructure of the .cn domain (and for many other countries,
as well).

To change the disadvantageous presentation of IP-SFS and to address
at least a few of its benefits, I recommend to change, via an RFC
Errata Note, the first paragraph of Section 5,

|  By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered
|  insecure.  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
|  discouraged unless security is provided by higher level protocols.

to say:

|  By its nature of line-of-sight signaling, IP-SFS is considered to
|  provide industry strength wireless equivalent security and privacy
|  (WEP).  The transmission of sensitive data over IP-SFS is strongly
|  discouraged unless security is provided by legal environments or
|  corporate guidelines of conduct, impending punishment of the
|  interfaces, or other higher level protocols.
