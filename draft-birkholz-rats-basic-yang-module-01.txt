   YANG Module for Basic Challenge-Response-based Remote Attestation
                               Procedures
                draft-birkholz-rats-basic-yang-module-01

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG RPC and a minimal datastore tree
   required to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity
   measurements from a composite device with one or more roots of trust
   for reporting.  Complementary measurement logs are also provided by
   the YANG RPC originating from one or more roots of trust of
   measurement.  The module defined requires a TPM 2.0 and corresponding
   Trusted Software Stack included in the device components of the
   composite device the YANG server is running on.

1.  Introduction

   This document is based on the terminology defined in the
   [I-D.birkholz-attestation-terminology] and uses the interaction model
   and information elements defined in the
   [I-D.birkholz-rats-reference-interaction-model] document.  The
   currently supported hardware security module (HWM) - sometimes also
   referred to as an embedded secure element(eSE) - is the Trusted
   Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specified by the Trusted Computing Group
   (TCG).  One ore more TPM 2.0 embedded in the components of a
   composite device - sometimes also referred to as an aggregate device
   - are required in order to use the YANG module defined in this
   document.  A TPM 2.0 is used as a root of trust for reporting (RTR)
   in order to retrieve attestation evidence from a composite device.
   Additionally, it is used as a root of trust for measurement (RTM) in
   order to provide event logs - sometimes also referred to as
   measurement logs.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  The YANG Module for Basic Remote Attestation Procedures

   One or more TPM 2.0 MUST be embedded in the composite device that is
   providing attestation evidence via the YANG module defined in this
   document.  The ietf-basic-remote-attestation YANG module enables a
   composite device to take on the role of Claimant and Attester in
   accordance with the Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture
   [I-D.birkholz-attestation-terminology] and the corresponding
   challenge-response interaction model defined in the
   [I-D.birkholz-rats-reference-interaction-model] document.  A fresh
   nonce with an appropriate amount of entropy MUST be supplied by the
   YANG client in order to enable a proof-of-freshness with respect to
   the attestation evidence provided by the attester running the YANG
   datastore.  The functions of this YANG module are restricted to 0-1
   TPM 2.0 per hardware component.
