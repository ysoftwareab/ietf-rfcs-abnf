Abstract

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is using SIP RFC 3261
   [1] as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia
   Core Network Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem).

   3GPP has recently started working on messaging over the IM CN
   Subsystem.  It is intended that this will utilize the IM CN Subsystem
   for delivery and may be based on IEFT protocols including the work
   being performed in the SIMPLE working group.

   In this document is provided an outline and areas of interest of the
   3GPP work on SIP based messaging for the information of the SIMPLE
   working group.

Internet-Draft      3GPP work on SIP based messaging           June 2002


1. Introduction

   3GPP has selected SIP RFC 3261 [1].  as the protocol to establish and
   tear down multimedia sessions in the IP Multimedia Core Network
   Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem).  A description of the IM CN Subsystem
   can be found in TS 23.228 [2].

   An overview of, and requirements for the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem can be
   found in 3GPP Reqs draft [3].

   3GPP is currently working towards the definition of the system
   requirements for SIP based messaging.  The plan is for SIP based
   messaging to be part of the 3GPP release 6 which is currently
   scheduled to be fully completed by June 2003.

   The intention of the author of this draft is to write a future
   detailed SIP based messaging requirements draft once the requirements
   definition phase within 3GPP has reached maturity.

2. Messaging in current GSM cellular networks

   The Global System for Mobiles (GSM) short message service (SMS) has
   been very successful with over 15 billion SMS text messages being
   sent worldwide every month.  SMS enables mobile users to exchange
   text messages with other mobile users and also with computers, and
   fax machines.  Recently SMS services have been enhanced as the
   Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) which enables graphical icons,
   animations and audio tunes to be sent along with text.  The most
   recent development is the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) which
   enables the mobile user to exchange digital images, graphics, voice,
   video and audio clips with other mobile users and also to send such
   content to email addresses.

   The SMS, EMS and MMS architectures all contain both agents in the
   user equipment (terminals) and servers in the network.  Messages may
   be initiated by terminals or by network servers.  Messages may be
   exchanged between a number of different types of external
   applications such as fax and email.Details of SMS and EMS can be
   found in TS 23.040 [4] and details of the Multimedia Messaging
   Service can be found in TS 22.140 [5] and TS 23.140 [6].

3. Messaging in the internet

   Instant messaging (IM) has been higly successful in the fixed
   Internet.  Typical characteristics of the service are instant
   delivery of the messages and interaction with presence information.
   Users are able to see who is on-line as well as their status.

   Another popular Internet service is chat.  A Chat room is a "place"
   where multiple persons can join, follow and contribute to the ongoing
   discussion and leave the "room" at any time.  The chat rooms are more
   permanent in nature compared to IM exchange and they can be further
   divided to the private and public chat rooms.  The user in the chat
   will receive all messages that are sent by the other participants to
   the chat room.  Similarly, the user is able to send her messages to
   the chat room or even privately to some participant.

4. Scope of the SIP based messaging work in 3GPP

   The goal of 3GPP is to extend messaging to the SIP based IM CN
   Subsystem which is about to be deployed whilst also interoperating
   with the existing SMS, EMS, and MMS wireless messaging solutions as
   well as SIP based internet messaging (IM, chat) services.  The SIP
   based messaging service, should support interoperability with the
   existing 3GPP messaging services SMS, EMS and MMS as well as enable
   development of new messaging services, such as Instant Messaging,
   Chat, etc.

   It should be possible in a standardized way to create message groups
   (chatrooms) and address messages to the group of recipients as a
   whole as well as individual recipients.  Additional standardized
   mechanisms are expected to be needed to create, and delete message
   groups, enable and authorize members to join and leave the group and
   also to issue mass invitations to members of the group.

   SIP based messaging should also integrate well with the Presence
   service also being currently developed by 3GPP.  The requirements for
   the 3GPP Presence services can be found in 3GPP Presence Reqs draft
   [7].

5. Acknowledgments

   The author would like to thank Juha Kalliokulju (Nokia), Markus
   Isom„ki (Nokia), Jonathan Rosenberg (dynamicsoft), Ben Campbell
   (dynamicsoft), Dean Willis (dynamicsoft), Martin Harris (Orange),
   Luisa Marchetto (AWS), Michel Grech (Lucent), Michele Zarri (T-
   Mobile)  and Kevin Holley (mmO2) for their collaborative effort in
   reviewing and supporting this draft and their contribution to the
   3GPP SIP based messaging requirements definition work.

6. Security Considerations

   This draft does not specify a protocol and so raises no security
   issues, however security and privacy issues with messaging will need
   to be addressed in later requirements.
