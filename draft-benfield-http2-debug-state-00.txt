1.  Introduction

   The HTTP/2 [RFC7540] specification provides an alternative framing
   layer for the semantics of HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].  This alternative
   framing layer includes substantially greater quantities of state to
   be stored by all implementations.  Disagreements on the state of the
   connection are the cause of the vast majority of interoperability
   errors in HTTP/2 implementations.

   In general it is not possible for implementations to query the
   internal state of their peer, and those implementations that do
   expose their internal state do it using a number of different
   interfaces, in different places, and in different formats.  This
   makes it hard to debug interoperability problems, particularly when
   those problems arise on the open web with implementations that have
   unknown configuration and that may not identify themselves clearly.

   This document defines a standard format and well-known URI for HTTP/2
   server implementations to make their internal state available for
   introspection.  This allows both new and established implementers to
   do more effective testing of their implementations, as well as to
   enable them to more effectively diagnose and report subtle bugs in
   both their own and other implementations.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Debug Output

   An implementation that wishes to support the HTTP/2 debug state
   information does so by publishing a JSON document at a well-known URI
   ([RFC5785]): specifically, at .well-known/h2interop/state.  This JSON
   document reveals aspects of the state of the specific HTTP/2
   connection as seen by the implementation in question at the time of
   response generation.

   This JSON document is represented as a single JSON object with
   multiple keys.  The object has several mandatory keys, as well as
   several optional ones.  The fields are outlined below.

2.1.  Settings

   The "settings" key in the state object is associated with a JSON
   object that contains the remote implementation's active settings.
   These are the settings that are actually in force for the connection
   at this time.  This means that if the implementation has emitted a
   SETTINGS frame but has not yet received an ACK, the changes in that
   SETTINGS frame MUST NOT be reflected in the object.

   Each setting is published along with its value.  The name of each
   setting MUST be the same as its name in [RFC7540] Section 6.5.2: for
   example, "SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH".  The values MUST be sent as JSON
   integers.

   An implementation MAY omit a setting from this object if it has never
   been emitted by the implementation.  In this situation it should be
   assumed that the default value is in force.

   A conforming implementation MUST emit this field.

   Sample output:

   "settings": {
     "SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS": 250,
     "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE": 1048576,
     "SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE": 1048896
   }

2.2.  Peer Settings

   The "peerSettings" key in the state object is associated with a JSON
   object that contains the remote implementation's view of the local
   implementation's settings.  These are the settings that are actually
   in force for the connection at this time.

   The value of this key is exactly symmetrical with the value of the
   "settings" key: see Section 2.1 for more.

   A conforming implementation MUST emit this field.

   Sample output:

   "peerSettings": {
       "SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE": 4096,
       "SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH": 1,
       "SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE": 6291456,
       "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE": 16384,
       "SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS": 1000
   }

               Figure 2: Example output for peerSettings key

2.3.  Outbound Flow Control Window

   The "connFlowOut" key in the state object is associated with a JSON
   integer that reflects the remote peer's outbound connection window
   size.  This represents the number of flow controlled bytes the remote
   implementation believes it can emit before the entire connection is
   blocked behind flow control.

   A conforming implementation MUST emit this field.

   Sample output:

   "connFlowOut": 15724175,

               Figure 3: Example output for connFlowOut key

2.4.  Inbound Flow Control Window.

   The "connFlowIn" key in the state object is associated with a JSON
   integer that reflects the remote peer's inbound connection window
   size.  This represents the number of flow controlled bytes the remote
   implementation believes it can receive before the entire connection
   is blocked behind flow control.

   A conforming implementation MUST emit this field.

   Sample output:

   "connFlowIn": 65535,

                Figure 4: Example output for connFlowIn key

2.5.  Streams

   The "streams" key in the state object is associated with a JSON
   object containing state about all the active streams on the
   connection.  A stream MUST be represnted in this JSON object if it is
   in any state other than IDLE or CLOSED.

   This JSON object has keys that are the stream IDs for the active
   streams.  Each key has an object associated with it, with the
   following keys:

   o  "state": This key maps to a string value representing the stream
      state.  The stream states are represented as all-caps ASCII text
      with all parentheses stripped and spaces replaced with
      underscores.  For example, "OPEN" or "HALF_CLOSED_LOCAL".  This
      field MUST be present.

   o  "flowIn": The remote peer's inbound stream window size as a JSON
      integer.  This represents the number of flow controlled bytes the
      remote implementation believes it can receive on this stream
      before this stream is blocked behind flow control.  This field
      MUST be present.

   o  "flowOut": The remote peer's outbound stream window size as a JSON
      integer.  This represents the number of flow controlled bytes the
      remote implementation believes it can send on this stream before
      this stream is blocked behind flow control.  This field MUST be
      present.

   o  "dataIn": The number of bytes of data the remote implementation
      has received on this stream.  This excludes padding bytes.  This
      field MAY be present, but is optional.

   o  "dataOut": The number of bytes of data the remote implementation
      has sent on this stream.  This excludes padding bytes.  This field
      MAY be present, but is optional.

   A conforming implementation MUST emit this field, but MAY omit any of
   the optional sub-fields.

       "flowOut": 6291456
     }
   },

                 Figure 5: Example output for streams key

2.6.  HPACK

   The "hpack" key contains information about the HPACK compression
   state for the connection.  It maps to a JSON object that represents
   this compression state.

   This JSON object contains the following fields:

   o  "inbound_table_size": The current size of the HPACK dynamic header
      table for the headers emitted by the local implementation, as an
      integer.  This field MUST be present.

   o  "outbound_table_size": The current size of the HPACK dynamic
      header table for the headers emitted by the remote implementation,
      as an integer.  Note that this value MUST include the headers
      added to the compression context as part of serving this response.
      This field MUST be present.

   o  "inbound_dynamic_header_table": The entries added to the HPACK
      dynamic header table by the local implementation.  This is
      formatted as a JSON array of two-element JSON arrays, the first
      element of which contains the header name and the second element
      of which contains the header value.  This field MAY be omitted.

   o  "outbound_dynamic_header_table": The entries added to the HPACK
      dynamic header table by the remote implementation.  This is
      formatted in the same manner as "inbound_dynamic_header_table".
      This field MAY be omitted.

   A conforming implementation MAY omit this field.  If it does include
   this field, it MAY omit any optional sub-fields.

   Sample output:

   "hpack": {
       "inbound_table_size": 340,
       "inbound_dynamic_header_table": [
           [

               "gzip, deflate, sdch, br"
           ],
           [
               "upgrade-insecure-requests",
               "1"
           ],

       "outbound_dynamic_header_table": [
           [
               "content-type",
               "application/json"
           ],
           [
               "server",
               "TwistedWeb/16.3.0"
           ]
       ]
   }

2.7.  Sent GoAway

   The "sentGoAway" field tracks whether or not a GOAWAY frame
   ([RFC7540] Section 6.8) has been sent on the connection by the remote
   implementation.  The value of this field is boolean.

   A conforming implementation MAY omit this field.

   Sample output:

   "sentGoAway": false,

                Figure 7: Example output for sentGoAway key

2.8.  Additional Fields

   In addition to these fields, implementations MAY add their own
   debugging information, as appropriate, to the JSON object.  These
   MUST be keyed off keys other than the ones defined in this document.
   For example, some implementations are known to expose the number of
   threads they currently have active in the "threads" field.

3.  Debug Headers

   One of the most common issues when implementing HTTP/2 is to have
   problems with flow control windows.  This is why the "connFlowOut"
   (Section 2.3) and "connFlowIn" (Section 2.4) fields are defined in
   the JSON document.

   However, it's possible that the two implementations disagree on the
   size of this window, and that the server believes that it cannot send
   the response body because it's blocked behind flow control.  For this
   reason, a small amount of debugging data MUST be inserted into the
   response headers for this JSON document.  This ensures that it is
   possible for implementations to discover that they have inadvertently
   blocked the debug response behind flow control, and to take action to
   widen the flow control window so that the response can be delivered.

   The following header fields MUST be emitted by implementations.

3.1.  Flow In

   The "conn-flow-in" header field contains the size of the remote
   implementation's inbound flow control window.  The field value
   contains only the size of that window in octets.  This MUST be
   calculated the same way that the implementation calculates
   "connFlowIn" (Section 2.4).

3.2.  Flow Out

   The "conn-flow-out" header field contains the size of the remote
   implementation's outbound flow control window.  The field value
   contains only the size of that window in octets.  This MUST be
   calculated the same way that the implementation calculates
   "connFlowOut" (Section 2.3).
