Abstract 
    
   The Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture can be used for 
   computing Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) that 
   traverse multiple Autonomous Systems (AS) in MultiProtocol Label 
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. This requires 
   communication between PCEs in each AS, based upon on the PCE 
   communication Protocol (PCEP). When ASes belong to distinct service 
   providers, a per-service negotiation and activation procedure may be 
   required before starting PCE based path computation. For the sake of 
   illustration, the IPSphere Forum (IPSF) is currently specifying an 
   architecture so as to automate the negotiation and activation of such 
   an inter-provider TE LSP service. The result of such negotiation is a 
   per-service contract identifier that needs to be carried in PCEP, so 
   that PCEs can apply inter-provider path computation policies. For 
   that purpose, this draft defines an extension to the PCEP protocol so 
   as to carry a contract ID in request messages.

2. Introduction 
 
   The PCE-based network architecture [RFC4655] defines a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) as an entity capable of computing TE LSP 
   paths based on a network graph, and applying computational 
   constraints.  A PCE serves path computation requests sent by Path 
   Computation Clients (PCC). The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) 
   [PCEP], allows for communication between a PCC and a PCE or between 
   two PCEs, in compliance with requirements and guidelines set forth in 
   [RFC4657]. Such interactions include path computation requests and 
   path computation replies.  
    
   The computation of inter-AS TE LSPs may rely on the Backward 
   Recursive PCE based path Computation (BRPC) procedure that allows

   computing shortest inter-domain paths ([BRPC]). This relies upon one 
   PCE per AS, with PCEP based inter-PCE communication. 
    
   The computation of inter-provider TE LSPs may require, at the service 
   and management plane levels, a preliminary service negotiation and 
   activation procedure, between the set of providers the LSP will 
   traverse. For the sake of illustration, the IPSphere Forum (IPSF) is 
   currently working on a framework for the automatic negotiation and 
   activation of an inter-provider TE LSP service [IPSF-IC-MPLS]. The 
   result of such a negotiation is a contract identifier in the form of 
   a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) (as per defined in [RFC4122]), 
   which is then used to identify the agreed service and apply policies 
   to control plane messages, including request acceptance/rejection as 
   well as Traffic Engineering parameters filtering and translation. 
 
   This contract identifier has to be carried in the PCEP protocol so 
   that path computation requests can be policed according to the 
   beforehand agreed service.  
    
   For that purpose, this draft defines extensions to the PCE 
   communication Protocol (PCEP) so as to transparently transport a 
   service contract identifier in request messages. A new PCEP CONTRACT-
   ID object is defined, to be carried in PCReq messages, the content of 
   which is transparent and not processed at the PCEP level. The 
   CONTRACT-ID object is communicated to a service Policy Decision Point 
   (PDP) to apply policies (request acceptance/rejection, TE parameters 
   filtering/translation, next-AS determination, etc.). There is no 
   assumption on the way the object is communicated to the PDP, as well 
   as on the actual location of the PDP; this is beyond the scope of 
   this document. 
    
 
3. PCEP CONTRACT-ID Object Definition 
 
   The PCEP CONTRACT-ID object defined in this document is compliant 
   with the PCEP object format defined in [PCEP].  
    
   The PCEP CONTRACT-ID object is optional, it MAY be carried within a 
   PCReq message. It carries the identifier of the TE LSP service 
   contract that has been negotiated and instantiated at the service 
   level, between all service providers along the LSP path. It allows 
   applying policies to the inter-provider path computation requests, 
   based upon a beforehand agreed service. 
    
   When carried in a PCEP message, this object has to be supported by 
   the PCE, and hence, according to [PCEP], the P flag in the object 
   header MUST always be set. 
       
   The Contract-ID Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (recommended 
   value=19). 
   The Contract-ID Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended 
   value=1).

   The format of the Contract-ID object body is as follows: 
    
   0                   1                   2                   3

   Contract-ID (128 bit): Identifier of the inter-provider TE LSP 
   service, instantiated at the service level. It is encoded as a

3.1. Carrying the CONTRACT-ID Object in PCReq Messages 
    
   The CONTRACT-ID object MAY be carried within a PCReq message. It is 
   carried after the RP object for which it applies. 
    
   The format of the PCReq message, defined in [PCEP], is updated as 
   follows:  
    
     <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>

                         <request-list> 
    
      where: 
         <svec-list>::=<SVEC> 
                      [<svec-list>]

4. Elements of Procedure 
    
   The CONTRACT-ID object MAY be used during PCE based inter-provider 
   path computation with inter-PCE Communication.  
    
   The P bit in the object header MUST always be set. 
    
   On receipt of a PCReq message with a CONTRACT-ID object, a PCE MUST 
   proceed as follows: 
    
        - If the object is unknown or unsupported, the PCE follows  
        procedures defined in [PCEP], that is,  as the P flag is set, it  
        sends a PCErr message with error type unknown object (type  
        3), or unsupported object (type 4) respectively. 
    
        - If the object is supported, it MUST not be processed at the  
        PCEP level and MUST be transparently passed to a Policy Decision 
        Point (PDP) so as to apply service policies based upon the 
        contract identifier (this may include request acceptance / 
        rejection, TE parameters filtering / translation, next-AS 
        determination, etc.): 
         
                - If the request is accepted and the PCReq message has  
                to be propagated to a downstream PCE, the downstream  
                PCReq message MUST contain a CONTRACT-ID object whose  
                contract id value is determined by policy decision; this  
                may be the same or a distinct value (to support cases  
                where the next provider PCE has a different contractID).   
                 
                - If the request is rejected, the PCReq message MUST not  
                be propagated downstream, and the PCE MUST send upstream  
                a PCErr message with error-type policy violation (type5)  
                and new error value "service admission control failure"  
                (defined in this document).

5. IANA Considerations 
 
5.1. CONTRACT-ID Object 
    
     The IANA has been requested to manage the PCEP Objects code point 
     registry (see [PCEP]). 
      
     This document defines a new PCEP object, the CONTRACT-ID object to 
     be carried in PCReq messages. The IANA is requested to make the 
     following allocation (suggested value): 
      
      Object    Name        Object    Name         Reference 
      Class                 Type 
    
        19    CONTRACT-ID     1       Contract    (this document) 
                                      Identifier  
         
5.2. PCEP Error Value 
 
   A new error values is defined for the error type "policy violation": 
    
   Error-type      Meaning and error values                    Reference 
    
       5         Policy violation 
         
                   Error-value=5: service admission control    (this doc)            
                                  failure (request rejected)
