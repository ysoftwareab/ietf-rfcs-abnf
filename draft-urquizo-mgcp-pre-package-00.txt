3. Introduction 
    
   Multi-level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) service provides 
   authorization and prioritized call handling service as specified in 
   ANSI T1.619 [5] and ITU I.255.3 [6]. The Precedence term refers to 
   the assignment and authorization of a priority level to a call by 
   the Call Agent/Switch for prioritized treatment of MLPP service 
   requests. There are five precedence levels (0-4) where the lowest 
   precedence level 0 is used for normal ROUTINE calls. User invocation 
   of an MLPP request is provided through dedicated dial access codes 
   and selectors in the dial string. 
   The Preemption term refers to the process of replacing a lower 
   precendece call with a higher MLPP precedence call. The resources 
   seized during this process may be used by the new call. Preemption 
   may take one of two forms. First, the called party may be busy with 
   a lower precedence call, which must be preempted in favor of 
   completing the higher precedence call from the calling party. 
   Second, the network resources may be busy with calls some of which 
   are of lower precedence than the call requested by the calling 
   party. One or more of these lower precedence calls SHALL be 
   preempted to complete the higher precedence call.  
    
   MLPP service applies to a configured domain only. A domain can 
   consists of subscribers, the network and access resources that 
   belong to the domain.  
    
   The Call Agent is responsible for handling the authorization and 
   precedence assignment and deciding whether a call will be preempted. 
   The purpose of this document is to define a package that supports 
   the signaling required to complete Multi-level Precedence and 
   Preemption transaction in a MLPP capable switching.  
    
    
4. Package Definition 
    
   Package Name:         PRE 
   Package Version:      0 
    
    
   Package Description:  
    
   The PRE package groups events and signals that are required for CAS 
   support in a MLPP network.  
    
    
4.1 Events and Signals 
 
   This section defines the PRE event package. The terms "signal" and 
   "event" are used to differentiate a command from a Call Agent to a 
   Media Gateway ("signal") from an "event" that is detected by the 
   Media Gateway and then is "Notified" to the Call Agent.

   An ôxö under ôEventö indicates that the Call Agent can request this 
   event. The Media Gateway will notify the Call Agent once the event 
   is detected.  
   Under ôSignalö the following symbols are used to indicate the type 
   of signal applied to the endpoint on command by the Call Agent: 
     - "OO" On/Off signal. The signal is turned on until commanded by 
     the Call Agent to turn it off, and vice versa. 
     - "TO" Timeout signal.  The signal lasts for a given duration 
     unless it is superseded by a new signal or terminated on detection 
     of an event.  Default time-out values are supplied. A value of 
     zero indicates that the time-out period is infinite. The 
     provisioning process may alter these default values. 
     - "BR" Brief signal.  The signal has a short, known duration 
    
   The table below lists the events and signals defined in this 
   package: 
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
   | Code |   Description              | Event| Signal| Additional Info    
   |------|----------------------------|-----_|-----------------------| 
   | par  | Preempt and reserve channel|  x   |   BR  |               | 
   |      |   for reuse                |      |       |               | 
   | pnr  | Preempt and do not reserve |  x   |   BR  |               | 
   |      |   channel for reuse        |      |       |               |  
   | prt  | Precedence ringback tone   |      |   TO  |Time-out = 30s | 
   | pt   | Preemption tone            |      |   OO  |*              |   
    ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
   (*) This tone may also be turned off upon a configurable time-out. 
   See definition of Preemption tone. 
    
   The respective MLPP capable switching system specification should be 
   reviewed for the specific definition of the measured supervisory 
   signals, pnr and par. For instance, GSCR [4] shows the preemption 
   measured supervisory signaling used to initiate preemption and 
   defines proper frequencies for the ringback and preemption tones for 
   the DNS switching system. 
    
   The preemption supervisory signal selection (par or pnr) is based on 
   the following factors: 
     1. Circuit Condition (unanswered-onhook/answered-offhook). 
     2. Intended disposition. Whether circuit will be reused (channel 
        resources are seized to be used on the preempting call) or not. 
     3. Preempting switch 
        
   The Call Agent will request the media gateway to send a PNR or PAR 
   signaling to the trunk using the SignalRequest parameter (e.g., 
   S:PRE/pnr or S:PRE/par). The media gateway, based on the trunk state 
   (unanswered/answered state, or the call is originated by this 
   gateway), will send out the correct outpulse as defined in the 
   respective MLPP switching system specifications. For an example see 
   [4], section 6.

   Preemption and Reserve Channel for reuse (par): 
     This event is notified to the Call Agent when a supervisory 
   pulsing is detected in the channel that is to be preempted 
   indicating that the circuit will be reused. GSCR [4] presents a 
   signaling definition for this event.  
   Likewise, when this event is requested by the Call Agent to be 
   signaled, the Media Gateway will outpulse the respective supervisory 
   signal. 
    
   Preemption and do not reserve channel for reuse (pnr): 
   This event is notified to the Call Agent when a supervisory signal 
   is detected in the channel that is to be preempted indicating that 
   the channel will mot be reserved for reuse. GSCR [4] presents a 
   signaling definition for this event.  
   Likewise, when this event is requested by the Call Agent to be 
   signaled, the Media Gateway will out-pulse the respective 
   supervisory signal. 
      
    
   Precedence ringback tone (prt): 
   The precedence ringback tone provides a priority ringback to a user 
   with a precedence level higher than ROUTINE. Refer to the respective 
   switching system specification for the tone characteristics. For 
   instance, [4] defines the prt tone as a dual frequency tone with 
   frequencies at 440Hz and 480Hz. The single tone power level is û
   13dBm0 with a composite power level of û16dBm0. The cadence for this 
   on is 1640ms ON and 360ms OFF.  
    
   Preemption tone (pt): 
   Following the supervisory signal causing a circuit release, the Call 
   Agent SHALL command the media gateway to signal a preemption tone to 
   the calling and called stations. This preemption tone will be played 
   until a disconnect signal is returned or upon a timer expiration. 
   The Call Agent will command to the media gateway when to stop 
   applying the tone to the endpoint. 
   Refer to the respective switching system specification for the tone 
   characteristics. For instance, [4] defines the pt tone as a 
   continuous dual frequency tone with frequencies at 440Hz and 620Hz. 
   The single tone power level is û13dBm0 with a composite power level 
   of û16dBm0. 
    
   The following example illustrates the encoding of the ôPreemption 
   and Reserve Channel for reuseö event 
      
          O: PRE/par
