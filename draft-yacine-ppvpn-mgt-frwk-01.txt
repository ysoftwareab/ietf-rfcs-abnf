1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Definition 
    
   For any type of Provider Provisioned VPN it is useful to have one 
   place where the VPN can be viewed and optionally managed as a whole. 
   The Network Management System may therefore be a place where the 
   collective instances of a VPN are brought together into a cohesive 
   picture to form a VPN. To be more precise, the instances of a VPN on 
   their own do not form the VPN; rather, the collection of disparate 
   VPN sites together forms the VPN. This is important because VPNs are 
   typically configured at the edges of the network (i.e., PEs) either 
   through manual configuration or auto-configuration. This results in 
   no state information being kept in within the "core" of the network. 
   Sometimes little or no information about other PEs is configured at 
   any particular PE.  
    
   An SP and its customers must be able to manage the capabilities and 
   characteristics of their VPN services. To the extent possible, 
   automated operations and interoperability with standard management 
   platforms should be supported. 
    
   Two main management functions are identified: 
     . A customer management function: 
     provides the means for a customer agent to query or configure 
     customer specific information, or receive alarms regarding his or 
     her VPN. Customer specific information includes data related to 
     contact, billing, site, access network, IP address, routing 
     protocol parameters, etc. It may also include confidential data, 
     such as encryption keys. It may use a combination of proprietary 
     network management system, SNMP manager, PDP function or directory 
     service. 
      
     . A provider network management function: 
     provides many of the same capabilities as a customer network 
     management system across all customers. This would not include 
     customer confidential information, such as keying material. The 
     intent of giving the provider a view comparable to that of 
     customer network management is to aid in troubleshooting and 
     problem resolution. Such a system also provides the means to 
     query, configure, or receive alarms regarding any infrastructure 
     supporting the PPVPN service. It may use a combination of 
     proprietary network management system, SNMP manager, PDP function 
     or directory service (e.g., LDAP [RFC1777] [RFC2251]).

   The ITU-T Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) model has the 
   following generic requirements structure: 
    
     . Engineer, deploy and manage the switching, routing and 
        transmission resources supporting the service, from a network 
        perspective (network element management); 
    
     . Manage the VPNs deployed over these resources (network 
        management); 
    
     . Manage the VPN service (service management);

   Figure 1 and 2 (see bellow) presents the reference model for PE/CE-
   based PPVPN management, according to this generic structure. 
    
   In both models, the customer manager administrates customer specific 
   attributes, such as customer ID, personal information (e.g., name, 
   address, phone number, credit card number, and etc), subscription 
   services and parameters, access control policy information, billing 
   and statistical information, and etc. 
    
   In the PE-based reference model, the provider network manager 
   administrates devices attributes and their relationship, covering PE 
   devices and other devices constructing the concerned PE-based VPN. 
    
   In the CE-based reference model, the provider network manager 
   administrates device attributes and their relationship, covering PE 
   and CE devices that define the VPN connectivity of the customer VPNs. 
    
   Network and customer management systems responsible for managing VPN 
   networks have several challenges depending on the type of VPN network 
   or networks they are required to manage.

   The term "Virtual Private Network" (VPN) refers to the communication 
   between a set of sites, making use of a shared network 
   infrastructure. Multiple sites of a private network may therefore 
   communicate via the public infrastructure, in order to facilitate the 
   operation of the private network. The logical structure of the VPN, 
   such as addressing, topology, connectivity, reachability, and access 
   control, is equivalent to part of or all of a conventional private 
   network using private facilities. 
    
   The Customer Management function controls the PPVPN service 
   management at the Service Management Layer (SML) (see section 1.2). 
   It mainly consists in collecting the customer PPVPN services 
   requirements and performing some reporting for the customer. This 
   function is correlated with the Network Management function at the 
   Network Management Layer (NML) for initiating the PPVPN services 
   provisioning, and getting some service reporting. 
    
    
2.1 Customer Management Definition 
    
   A customer must have a means to view the topology, operational state, 
   order status, and other parameters associated with his or her VPN. 
    
   All aspects of management information about CE devices and customer 
   attributes of a PPVPN manageable by an SP should be capable of being 
   configured and maintained by an authenticated, authorized customer 
   agent. 
    
   A customer agent should be able to make dynamic requests for changes 
   to parameters describing a service. A customer should be able to 
   receive real-time response from the SP network in response to these 
   requests. One example of such a service is a "Dynamic Bandwidth 
   management" capability, that enables real-time response to customer 
   requests for changes of allocated bandwidth allocated to their 
   VPN(s)[Y.1311.1]. 
    
   A customer who may not be able to afford the resources to manage 
   their own sites should be able to outsource the management of his or 
   her VPN to the service provider(s) supporting the network. 
    
    
2.2 Customer Management Information Model 
    
   This section presents the information model that is used for PPVPN 
   service management at the SML. The information models represent, for 
   a given purpose, the nature of the data to be managed, and way it is 
   represented. At the SML, the information model that is foreseen is 
   composed of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Service Level 
   Specifications (SLS).

Internet Draft    draft-yacine-ppvpn-mgt-frwk-01.txt         June 2003 
 
 
    
    

2.2.1 SLA/SLS content 
    
   Services are described through Service Level Agreements (SLA) which 
   are contractual documents between customers and service providers. 
   The technical par of the service is called the Service Level 
   Specification (SLS). The SLS groups different kinds of parameters. 
   Some are more related with the description of the transport of the 
   packets, and some with the specification of the service itself. 
    
   A Service Level Specification (SLS) may be defined per access network 
   connection, per VPN, per VPN site, and/or per VPN route. The service 
   provider may define objectives and the measurement interval for at 
   least the SLS using the following Service Level Objective (SLO) 
   parameters:  
    
     . QoS and traffic parameters for the Intserv flow or Diffserv 
        class  
     . Availability for the site, VPN, or access connection 
     . Duration of outage intervals per site, route or VPN 
     . Service activation interval (e.g., time to turn up a new site)  
     . Trouble report response time interval  
     . Time to repair interval  
     . Total traffic offered to the site, route or VPN  
     . Measure of non-conforming traffic for the site, route or VPN  
    
   The service provider and the customer may negotiate a contractual 
   arrangement that includes a Service Level Agreement (SLA) regarding 
   compensation if the provider does not meet an SLS performance 
   objective. 
    
   Traffic parameters and actions should be defined for packets to and 
   from the demarcation between the service provider and the site. For 
   example, policing may be defined on ingress and shaping on egress. 
    
    
2.3 Customer Management Functions 
    
   This section presents detailed customer management functions in the 
   traditional fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and 
   security (FCAPS) management categories. Much of this text was adapted 
   from [Y.1311.1].

2.3.1 Fault management 
    
   Basically the fault management function of the Customer Manager is 
   provided with network layer failure information and reports incidents 
   to the impacted customers. The reports should be based on and relates 
   to the services requested by the customer. The Customer Management 
   function support for fault management includes:  
    
     . indication of customer's services impacted by failure, 
     . incident recording or logs. 
    
    

2.3.2 Configuration Management 
    
   The configuration management function of the Customer Manager must be 
   able to configure PPVPN service parameters with the level of detail 
   that the customer is able to specify, according to service templates 
   defined by the provider. 
    
   A service template contains fields which, when instantiated, yield a 
   definite service requirement or policy. For example, a template for 
   an IPSec tunnel would contain fields such as tunnel end points, 
   authentication modes, encryption and authentication algorithms, 
   preshared keys if any, and traffic filters. A BGP/MPLS service 
   template would contain fields such as the sites that need to form a 
   VPN. A QoS agreement template would contain fields such as delay, 
   jitter, throughput and packet loss thresholds as well as end points 
   over which the QoS agreement has to be satisfied. In general, a 
   customer's service order can be regarded as a set of instantiated 
   service templates. This set can, in turn, be regarded as the logical 
   or service architecture of the customer's VPN. The set of service 
   templates should be comprehensive in that they can capture all 
   service orders in some meaningful sense. 
    
    

2.3.3 Accounting 
    
   Basically the accounting management function of the Customer Manager 
   is provided with network layer measurements information and manage 
   this information. The Customer Manager is responsible for the 
   following accounting functions:  
    
     . retrieval of accounting information from the Provider Network 
        Manager, 
     . analysis, storage and administration of measurements.

Internet Draft    draft-yacine-ppvpn-mgt-frwk-01.txt         June 2003 
 
 
    
   Some providers may require near-real time reporting of measurement 
   information, and may offer this as part of a customer network 
   management service.  
    
   If an SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" service, then the 
   dates, times, amounts and interval required to perform requested 
   bandwidth allocation change(s) must be traceable for monitoring and 
   accounting purposes.  
    
   Solutions should state compliance to accounting requirements, as 
   described in section 1.7 of [RFC2975].  
    
    

2.3.4 Performance Management   
    
   From the Customer Manager perspective, Performance management 
   includes functions involved with determination of conformance to 
   Service Level Specifications (SLS), such as QoS and availability 
   measurements. The objective is to correlate accounting information 
   with performance and fault management information to produce billing 
   that takes into account SLA provisions for periods of time where the 
   SLS is not met. 
    
   The performance information provided to the customer should be 
   correlated with the services requested by the customer, such that 
   they indicate the experience the service provides, as measurable by 
   the customer. Such service experience parameters may be part of the 
   service template defined by the provider. 
    
   Performance management should also support analysis of important 
   aspects of a PPVPN, such as bandwidth utilization, response time, 
   availability, QoS statistics, and trends based on collected data.  
    
    

2.3.5 Security Management  
    
   From the Customer Manager perspective, the security management 
   function includes management features to guarantee the security of 
   device, access connections, and protocols within the PPVPN 
   network(s).

2.3.5.1 Management Access Control 
    
   Management access control determines the privileges that a user has 
   for particular applications and parts of the network. Without such 
   control, only the security of the data and control traffic is 
   protected, leaving the devices providing the PPVPN network 
   unprotected. Access control capabilities protect these devices to 
   ensure that users have access to only the resources and applications 
   to which they are authorized to use. 
    
    

2.3.5.2 Authentication 
    
   Authentication is the process of verifying that the sender is 
   actually is who he or she says they are. The Customer Manager must   
   support standard methods for authenticating users attempting to 
   access management services. 
    
   Scalability is critical as the number of nomadic/mobile clients is 
   increasing rapidly. The authentication scheme implemented for such 
   deployments must be manageable for large numbers of users and VPN 
   access points.  
    
   Support for strong authentication schemes shall be supported to 
   ensure the security of both VPN access point-to-VPN access point (PE 
   to PE) and client-to-VPN Access point (CE-to-PE) communications. This 
   is particularly important to prevent VPN access point spoofing. VPN 
   Access Point Spoofing is the situation where an attacker tries to 
   convince a PE or CE that the attacker is the VPN Access Point. If an 
   attacker can convinces a PE or CE of that, then the device will send 
   VPN traffic to the attacker (who could forward it on to your true 
   access point after compromising confidentially or integrity).  
    
   In other words, a non-authenticated VPN AP can be spoofed with a man-
   in-the-middle attack, because the endpoints never verify each other. 
   A weakly-authenticated VPN AP may be subject to such an attack. 
   However, strongly-authenticated VPN APs are not subject to such 
   attacks, because the man-in-the-middle cannot authenticate as the 
   real AP, due to the strong authentication algorithms. 
    
    
2.4 Customer Management Architecture 
    
   This section proposes a PPVPN management framework high level 
   architecture for the SML. The goal is to map the customer management 
   functions described in section 2.3 to architecture functional blocks,

   and to describe the communication with the other PPVPN management 
   functions. 
    
    

2.4.1 Functional Architecture 
    
   Two main functional blocks can be recognized: 
    
     . A PPVPN Service Manager, for defining the PPVPN services and 
        initiating the services provisioning. This block takes as inputs 
        the Customer Agent requirements and as output the Provider 
        Network Management provisioning system. 
    
     . A PPVPN Service Assurance Manager, for managing services failure 
        and performing customer reporting. This block takes as input the 
        Provider Network Management assurance system and as output the 
        Customer Agent.

3. Provider Network Manager 
    
3.1 Provider Network Management Definition 
    
   A service provider must have a means to view the topology, 
   operational state, order status, and other parameters associated with 
   each customer's VPN. Furthermore, the service provider must have a 
   means to view the underlying logical and physical topology, 
   operational state, provisioning status, and other parameters 
   associated with the equipment providing the VPN service(s) to its

   customers, as they relates to the services requested by the 
   customers. 
    
   Currently, proprietary methods are often used to manage VPNs. The 
   additional expense associated with operators having to use multiple 
   proprietary management methods (e.g., command line interface (CLI) 
   languages) to access such systems is undesirable. Therefore, devices 
   should provide standards-based interfaces wherever feasible. 
    
    
3.2 Network Management Functions 
    
   This section presents detailed provider network management functions 
   in the traditional fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and 
   security (FCAPS) management categories. Much of this text was adapted 
   from ITU-T [Y.1311.1]. 
    
   In addition, there can be internal service provided by the provider 
   for satisfying the customer visible service requirements.  Some of 
   these may include the notion of dynamic deployment of resources for 
   supporting the customer visible services. For example high 
   availability service for the customer maybe supported by automatic 
   failure detection and automatic switchover to (provisioning of) 
   backup VPNs.  These are accomplished with inter-working of the FCAPS 
   capabilities of Provider Network Manager. 
    
    

3.2.1 Fault management 
    
   Provider Network Manager support for fault management includes:  
    
     . fault detection (incidents reports, alarms, failure 
        visualization),  
     . fault localization (analysis of alarms reports, diagnostics), 
     . corrective actions (traffic, routing, resource allocation).  
    
   Since PE-based PPVPNs rely on a common network infrastructure, the 
   Provider Network Manager provides a means to inform the CM on the VPN 
   customers impacted by a failure in the infrastructure. The Provider 
   Network Manager should provide pointers to the related customer 
   configuration information to aid in fault isolation and the 
   determination of corrective action.  
    
   It is desirable to detect faults caused by configuration errors, 
   because these may cause VPN service to fail, or not meet other 
   requirements (e.g., traffic and routing isolation). Detection of such 
   errors is inherently difficult because the problem involves more than

   one node and may reach across a global perspective. One approach 
   could be a protocol that systematically checks that all constraints 
   and consistency checks hold among tunnel configuration parameters at 
   the various end points.  
    
   A capability to verify L3 reachability within a VPN must be provided 
   for diagnostic purposes. 
    
   A capability to verify the parameter configuration of a device 
   supporting a PPVPN must be provided for diagnostic purposes. 
    
    

3.2.2 Configuration Management 
    
   Overall, the Provider Network Manager must support configuration 
   necessary to realize desired L3 reachability of a PPVPN. Toward this 
   end, a Provider Network Manager must provide configuration management 
   to provision at least the following PPVPN components: PE,CE, 
   hierarchical tunnels, access connections, routing, and QoS, as 
   detailed in this section. If shared access to the Internet is 
   provided, then this option must also be configurable.  
    
   Since VPN configuration and topology are highly dependent upon a 
   customer's organization, provisioning systems must address a broad 
   range of customer specific requirements. The Provider Network Manager 
   must ensure that these devices and protocols are provisioned 
   consistently and correctly.  
    
   Provisioning for adding or removing sites should be as localized and 
   automated as possible.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager should provide means for translating 
   instantiated service templates into device configurations so that 
   associated services can be provisioned. 
    
   Finally, the approach should provide means for checking if a service 
   order is correctly provisioned. This would represent one method of 
   diagnosing configuration errors. Configuration errors can arise due 
   to a variety of reasons: manual configuration, intruder attacks, 
   conflicting service requirements.  
    
    

3.2.2.1 Configuration Management for PE-Based VPNs

Internet Draft    draft-yacine-ppvpn-mgt-frwk-01.txt         June 2003 
 
 
   Requirements for configuration management unique to a PE-based VPN 
   are as follows.  
    
     . The Provider Network Manager must support configuration of at 
        least the following aspects of a L3 PE routers: intranet and 
        extranet membership, CE routing protocol for each access 
        connection, routing metrics, tunnels, etc. 
    
     . The Provider Network Manager should use identifiers for SPs, 
        PPVPNs, PEs, CEs, hierarchical tunnels and access connections as 
        described in [PPVPN-FRWK].  
    
     . Tunnels must be configured between PE and P devices. This 
        requires coordination of identifiers of tunnels, hierarchical 
        tunnels, VPNs, and any associated service information, for 
        example, a QoS service. 
    
     . Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must 
        be configured per VPN.  
    
     . For multicast service, multicast routing protocols must also be 
        configurable.  
    
     . Routing protocols running between PE routers and between PE and 
        P routers must also be configured. 
    
     . The configuration of a PE-based PPVPN must be coordinated with 
        the configuration of the underlying infrastructure, including 
        Layer 1 and 2 networks interconnecting components of a PPVPN.  
    
    

3.2.2.2 Configuration management for CE-based VPN 
    
   Requirements for configuration management unique to a CE-based VPN 
   are as follows.  
    
     . Tunnels must be configured between CE devices. This requires 
        coordination of identifiers of tunnels, VPNs, and any associated 
        service information, for example, a QoS service.  
    
     . Routing protocols running between PE routers and CE devices must 
        be configured. For multicast service, multicast routing 
        protocols must also be configurable.

3.2.2.3 Provisioning Routing 
    
   The Provider Network Manager must provision parameters for the IGP 
   for a PPVPN. This includes link level metrics, capacity, QoS 
   capability, and restoration parameters.  
    
    

3.2.2.4 Provisioning Network Access 
    
   The Provider Network Manager must provision network access between 
   SP-managed PE and CE, as well as the case where the customer manages 
   the CE (CE-based PPVPNs).  
    
    

3.2.2.5 Provisioning Security Services 
    
   When a security service is requested, the Provider Network Manager 
   must provision the entities and associated parameters involved with 
   the service. For example, for IPsec service, tunnels, options, keys, 
   and other parameters must be provisioned at either the CE and/or PE. 
   In the case of a intrusion detection service, the filtering and 
   detection rules must be provisioned on a VPN basis.  
    
    

3.2.2.6 Provisioning VPN Resource Parameters  
    
   A service provider must have a means to dynamically provision 
   resources associated with VPN services. For example, in a PE-based 
   service, the number and size of virtual switching and forwarding 
   table instances must be provisionable. 
    
   Dynamic VPN resource assignment is crucial to cope with the frequent 
   changes requests from customer's (e.g., sites joining or leaving a 
   VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The PEs should be able to 
   dynamically assign the VPN resources. This capability is especially 
   important for dial and wireless VPN services.  
    
   If an SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" service, then the 
   dates, times, amounts and interval required to perform requested 
   bandwidth allocation change(s) must be traceable for accounting 
   purposes.

   If an SP supports a "Dynamic Bandwidth management" service, then the 
   provisioning system must be able to make requested changes within the 
   ranges and bounds specified in the Service Level Specifications. 
   Example QoS parameters are response time and probability of being 
   able to service such a request. 
    
    

3.2.2.7 Provisioning Value-Added Service Access 
    
   A PPVPN service provides controlled access between a set of sites 
   over a common backbone. However, many service providers also offer a 
   range of value-added services, for example: Internet access, firewall 
   services, intrusion protection, IP telephony and IP Centrex, 
   application hosting, backup, etc. It is outside of the scope of this 
   document to define if and how these different services interact with 
   the VPN in order to solve issues such as addressing, integrity and 
   security. However, the VPN service must be able to provide access to 
   these various types of value-added services.  
    
   A VPN service should allow the SP to supply the customer with 
   different kinds of standard IP services like DNS, NTP and RADIUS 
   needed for ordinary network operation and management. The provider 
   should be able to provide IP services to multiple customers from one 
   or many servers.  
    
   A firewall function may be required to restrict access to the PPVPN 
   from the Internet [Y.1311]. 
    
   A managed firewall service must be carrier grade. For redundancy and 
   failure recovery, a means for firewall fail-over should be provided. 
   Managed firewall services that may be provided include dropping 
   specified protocol types, intrusion protection, traffic-rate limiting 
   against malicious attacks, etc. 
    
   Managed firewalls must be supported on a per-VPN basis, although 
   multiple VPNs may be supported by the same physical device (e.g., in 
   network or PE-based solution). Managed firewalls should be provided 
   at the major access point(s) for the PPVPN. Managed firewall services 
   may be embedded in the CE or PE devices, or implemented in standalone 
   devices.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager should allow a customer to outsource the 
   management of an IP networking service to the SP providing the VPN or 
   a third party.  
    
   The management system should support collection of information 
   necessary for optimal allocation of IP services in response to

   customer orders. With correlation between customer requested services 
   and provider provisioned resources supporting the service. 
    
   Reachability to and from the Internet to sites within a VPN must be 
   configurable by an SP. This could be controlled by configuring 
   routing policy to control distribution of VPN routes advertised to 
   the Internet.  
    
    

3.2.2.8 Provisioning Hybrid VPN Services 
    
   Configuration of interworking or interconnection between PPVPN 
   solutions should be also supported. Ensuring that security and end-
   to-end QoS issues are provided consistently should be addressed.  
    
    

3.2.3 Accounting 
    
   The Provider Network Manager is responsible for the measurements of 
   resource utilization. 
    
    

3.2.4 Performance Management 
    
   From the Provider Network Manager perspective, Performance management 
   includes functions involved with monitoring and collecting 
   performance data regarding devices, facilities, and services.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager must monitor device behavior to evaluate 
   performance metrics associated with an SLS. Different measurement 
   techniques may be necessary depending on the service for which an SLA 
   is provided. Example services are QoS, security, multicast, and 
   temporary access. These techniques may be either intrusive or non-
   intrusive depending on the parameters being monitored.  
    
   The Provider Network Manager must also monitor aspects of the VPN not 
   directly associated with an SLS, such as resource utilization, state 
   of devices and transmission facilities, as well as control of 
   monitoring resources such as probes and remote agents at network 
   access points used by customers and mobile users. 
    
   Devices supporting PPVPN SLSs should have real-time performance 
   measurements that have indicators and threshold crossing alerts. Such 
   thresholds should be configurable.

3.2.5 Security Management  
    
   From the Provider Network Manager perspective, the security 
   management function of the Provider Network Manager must include 
   management features to guarantee the security of customer data and 
   control as described in section 5.9 of [PPVPN-REQ].

4.1 Information model 
    
   Each PPVPN solution approach must specify the management or policy 
   information bases (MIBs or PIBS) for network elements involved in 
   PPVPN services. This is an essential requirement in network 
   provisioning. The approach should identify any PPVPN specific 
   information not contained in a standard MIB.

     . TBD 
    
    
4.2 Communication 
    
   Support of any one VPN may span a wide range of network equipment, 
   potentially including equipment from multiple implementors. Allowing 
   a unified network management view of the VPN therefore is simplified 
   through use of standard management interfaces and models. This will 
   also facilitate customer self-managed (monitored) network devices or 
   systems. 
    
   In cases where significant configuration is required whenever a new 
   service is provisioned, it is important for scalability reasons that 
   the NMS provide a largely automated mechanism for this operation. 
   Manual configuration of VPN services (i.e., new sites, or re-
   provisioning existing ones), could lead to scalability issues, and 
   should be avoided. It is thus important for network operators to 
   maintain visibility of the complete picture of the VPN through the 
   NMS system. This must be achieved using standard protocols such as 
   SNMP, COPS, NetConf, or other means. Use of proprietary command-line 
   interfaces is highly undesirable for this task, as they do not lend 
   themselves to standard representations of managed objects.

4.2.2 COPS-PR 
    
   The COPS-PR protocol [COPS-PR] offers significant advantages when 
   dealing with dynamic configuration and when compared to traditional 
   management solutions. Moreover, dynamic VPN resource assignment is 
   crucial to cope with the frequent changes requests from customer's 
   (e.g., sites joining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve 
   scalability. The PEs should be able to dynamically assign the VPN 
   resources. This capability is especially important for dial and 
   Wireless VPN services.  
    
    

4.2.3 LDAP 
    
   TBD 
    
    

4.2.4 XML 
    
   TBD 
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   The information contained in a PIB when transported by the COPS 
   protocol [COPS-PR] are sensitive, and its function of provisioning a 
   PEP/EP requires that only authorized communication take place. The 
   use of IPSEC between PDP and PEP, as described in [COPS], provides 
   the necessary protection against these threats.
