Abstract

   This document presents extensions to the Presence Information
   Document Format (PIDF) for representing the state of telephones. This
   state includes whether the telephone is in a call or not, whether it
   is registered to the network, whether it is ringing, and so on.

Internet-Draft           PIDF Phone Extensions                 June 2003


1. Introduction

   The Presence Information Document Format (PIDF) [6] provides a
   baseline set of presence information that allows a presentity [7] to
   inform a watcher about itself. Information about a presentity is
   broken into a set of tuples. Each tuple represents a point of contact
   for a presentity. The tuple includes a URI that can be used to reach
   the presentity, a basic status of either open or closed, and a
   textual note meant for consumption by a human.

   PIDF is meant to be extended to provide additional information about
   presentities. In this specification, we define extensions to PIDF
   that allow a tuple to represent a telephone, or any device with
   telephone-like behaviors. Specifically, a telephone is any piece of
   hardware or software that is capable of making and/or receiving real
   time media streams with another such device.

   Most telephones in the world today lack Internet connections, and
   communicate only through the Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN). The presence for telephones described in this document might
   therefore be created by a telephone switch or other agent responsible
   for managing dumb telephones when the telephones themselves lack the
   intelligence to generate or disseminate presence information. That
   much said, these presence extensions are also servicable for
   representing Internet telephones.

2. Common State Elements

   While the presence states associated with wireless phones, POTS
   phones and enterprise PBX phones do vary, there are certain pieces of
   presence state that are common to all. In particular, the notion of
   call state is common across all three types. As such, we specify a
   common XML schema for describing call state. The namespace URI for
   elements that represent common presence state across phones is a URN
   [3], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [4] and
   extended by [5]. This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:common-phone-state

   The elements defined in this schema are:

   call-state: This element indicates the state of any calls made by, or
      received by, the phone. The possible values of this element are:

      not-in-call: The phone is not in a call.

      dialing: The phone is attempting to initiate a call. This state
         includes the entry of digits by the user and the subsequent
         signaling into the network.

      ringing: The phone has initiated a call, and has received ringback
         from the called party.

      alerting: The phone has received a call, and is alerting the user.

      in-call: The phone is in an active call.

      in-error: The call could not be completed because of some kind of
         error, such as all-circuits-busy.

3. POTS Line State

   Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) is a term used to denote the
   lowest common denominator of functionality among end terminals in the
   PSTN. A POTS phone (or "black" phone in common parlance) is usually a
   device with a numeric (multifrequency or rotary) user interface which
   may or may not support a visual display.

   POTS devices are not intelligent endpoints - their primary function
   is to render and receive audio information (in the form of dialing

   information, human speech or other audible tones) over their
   connection to a telephone switch. As such, a POTS phone by definition
   cannot create a presence document and communicate it to the switching
   infrastructure. The telephone switch to which a POTS phone connects,
   however, could create a presence document representing the state of
   the line.

   Due to the nature of POTS lines, the switching infrastructure has no
   reliable way to determine whether zero, one or more terminals have
   been connected to a single telephone line - thus a presence document
   generated by the switching infrastructure cannot be know with any
   certainty to correspond to a particular telephone. As such, we term
   it "POTS line state" rather than "POTS phone state".

   To integrate the call state of a POTS line into PIDF, we specify a
   two elements that extend the status element of baseline PIDF:

   call-state: This element indicates the state of any calls made by, or
      received by, the phone.

   call-waiting: This element is used when the call state is 'in-call'
      only. It signifies whether or not the call is progress is
      interruptable by call waiting. If the call is interruptable, the
      value of this element should be "available". If the call waiting
      feature is not available on the line, or is already occupied by
      another caller, the value of this element should be "unavailable".
      If this element is not present, and the call state is 'in-call',
      the value is assumed to be "unavailable".

4. Enterprise Phone State

   Many enterprise telephone networks utilize private branch exchanges
   (PBXs) that allow phones more functionality than Plain Old Telephone
   Service. PBXs typically have a signaling interface to a telephone
   switch that runs over an ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI) line,
   rather than the audio interface supported by a blackphone. Many
   enterprise phones themselves also have digital signalling interfaces
   to the PBXs.

   As a result, many enterprise phones can support multiple lines, call
   transfer capabilities and other sophisticated features. Moreover,
   many private branch exchange switches have an integrated voicemail
   capability for all connected terminals.

      [[EDITOR's NOTE: Need more input on enterprise devices.]]

   call-state: This element indicates the state of any calls made by, or
      received by, the phone.

5. Wireless Phone State

   Wireless phones refer to mobile devices that have no wired connection
   to a network, and can change their attachment point to the network at
   any point (including while a user is in the middle of a call). This
   includes phones on the GSM, CDMA, TDMA, GPRS, CDMA2000, and WCDMA
   networks, along WiFi phones as well.

   Some of these devices do not support data interfaces to the network,
   and therefore may not be able to directly publish their own state to
   a presence agent (many do support SMS, which can be used as a vehicle
   for published presence state). However, most aspects of the phone
   state can be derived from network elements, such as the Home Location
   Register (HLR) and Visiting Location Register (VLR). We therefore
   focus on state derivable by these entities.

   Wireless phone status is represented by several XML elements. The
   namespace URI for elements that represent wireless phone state is a

Internet-Draft           PIDF Phone Extensions                 June 2003


   URN [3], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [4] and
   extended by [5]. This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:wireless-phone-state

   We have selected elements which generally represent dynamic state,
   and which include information that would generally be helpful to a
   user in deciding whether to make a call. These elements are:

   barred: This element indicates whether the phone has been barred from
      registered in the visiting network, due to a lack of roaming
      agreements or policy that explicitly disallows roaming.

   call-state: This element indicates the state of any calls made by, or
      received by, the phone. There is no attempt to support devices
      which can have multiple calls, each with its own state.

   data-state: This element indicates whether the phone is connected to
      a wireless data network, such as GPRS or CDMA1xRTT. The phone is
      considered connected if, at that time, it is capable of sending
      and receiving data packets. In some phones, this state is dynamic,
      since users need to explicitly connect and disconnect. In others,
      the phone is connected to the data network as long as its
      registered. The values of this element can be not-connected and
      connected.

   ran: This element indicates the current radio access network (RAN) to
      which the user is connected. The values of this element can be
      GSM, GPRS, CDMA, CDMA2000, UMTS-PS, UMTS-CS, AMPS, NMT, PDC, TDMA,
      CDPD, or WiFi, Mobitex, HS-CSD, and IDEN. Additional values can be
      defined in the future. The "registered" attribute of the element
      indicates whether the phone has registered on that network.

   roaming: This element indicates whether or not the phone is currently
      roaming. It is an XML boolean.

   home-network: This element is a textual string which indicates the
      home network provider for the phone. Here, "network provider"
      refers to the provider of call control and signaling services.

   visited-network: This element is a textual string which indicates the
      visited network provider for the phone. Here, "network provider"
      refers to the provider of call control and signaling services.

   signal-strength: This element is a number between 0 and 5 which
      indicates the signal strength for the phone. A 5 means excellent,
      and a 0 means no signal. This information is likely to change
      frequently, and it should be included in notifications with great

5.2 Example Presence Document

   The following presence document indicates that the user has a single
   contact which represents a phone. This is a wireless phone on the GSM
   network. The phone is roaming, and the user is in a call. The fact
   that they are in a call results in the basic status being set to
   closed.

6. Security Considerations

   Phone state, like other presence state, represents sensitive
   information. It conveys detailed information about what a user is
   doing, and potentially where they are. Users may therefore wish to
   have this information hidden from eavesdroppers. Encryption of this
   presence data is provided by the underlying protocol that carriers
   this document. It is RECOMMENDED that presence documents conveying
   phone status only be transported with protocols that can provide
   encryption. For example, SIP extensions for presence [9] can provide
   encryption.

   Users may also wish to control who can have access to phone state
   information. Users can control the type of information conveyed to
   watchers of their presence using a data manipulation protocol, as
   described in [8]. The protocol used for such a purpose is the XML
   Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [10]. An XCAP application usage
   has been specified for setting authorization policy [11]. This
   mechanism allows a user to enable or disable access to presence
   information on a namespace by namespace basis. Therefore, to prevent
   phone state information from being distributed, users would remove
   permissions for viewing the namespaces defined in this specification.

7. IANA Considerations

   There are several IANA considerations associated with this
   specification.

7.1 URN Sub-Namespace Registrations
