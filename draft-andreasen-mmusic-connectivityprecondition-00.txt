Abstract 
    
   This document defines a new connectivity precondition for the 
   Session Description Protocol precondition framework described in RFC 
   3312.  A connecitivity precondition can be used to delay session 
   establishment or modification until media stream connectivity has 
   been verified successfully.

1. Notational Conventions 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].   
    
2. Introduction 
    
   RFC 3312 defines the concept of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
   [SDP] precondition, which is a condition that has to be satisfied 
   for a given media stream in order for session establishment or 
   modification to proceed.  When the precondition is not met, session 
   progress is delayed until the precondition is satisfied, or the 
   session establishment fails.  For example, RFC 3312 defines the 
   Quality of Service precondition, which is used to ensure 
   availability of network resources prior to establishing (i.e. 
   alerting) a call.   
    
   SIP sessions are typically established in order to setup one or more 
   media streams.  Even though a media stream may be negotiated 
   successfully, the actual media stream itself may fail.  For example, 
   when there is a NAT or firewall in the media path, the media stream 
   may not be received.  The connectivity precondition defined in this 
   document ensures, that session progress is delayed until media 
   stream connectivity is established, or the session itself is 
   abandoned.   
    
3. Connectivity Precondition Definition  
    
   The connectivity precondition type is defined by the string "con" 
   and hence we modify the grammar found in RFC 3312 as follows: 
    
     precondition-type  =  "con" | "qos" | token 
    
   RFC 3312 defines support for two kinds of status types, namely 
   segmented and end-to-end.  The connectivity precondition-type

   defined here MUST be used with the end-to-end status type; use of 
   the segmented status type is undefined.  
    
   An entity that wishes to delay session establishment or modification 
   until media stream connectivity has been established uses this 
   precondition-type in an offer.  When a connectivity precondition is 
   received in an offer, session establishment or modification MUST be 
   delayed until the connectivity precondition has been met, i.e. media 
   stream connectivity has been established in the desired 
   direction(s).   
    
   The direction attributes are interpreted as follows: 
    
   * send:  The offerer/answerer is sending media stream packets to the 
     other party, and the offerer/answer knows the other party is 
     receiving those media stream packets.  
    
   * recv:  The offerer/answerer knows that the other party has 
     ascertained media stream connectivity to it.   
    
   If media stream connectivity in both directions is required, the  
   desired status should be set to "sendrecv".  
    
   Media stream connectivity can be ascertained in different ways and 
   this document does not mandate any particular mechanism for doing 
   so.  It is however RECOMMENDED that the No-Op RTP payload format 
   defined in [no-op] is supported by entities that support 
   connectivity preconditions.  This will ensure that all entities that 
   support the connectivity preconditions have at least one common way 
   of ascertaining connectivity.  
    
4. Examples 
    
   The call flow of Figure 1 shows a basic session establishment using 
   connectivity preconditions and using RTP no-op.  Note that not all 
   SDP details are provided in the following.  
    
   SDP1: A includes the end-to-end connectivity precondition with a 
   desired status of "sendrecv"; this will ensure media stream 
   connectivity in both directions before continuing with the session 
   setup.  Since media stream connectivity in either direction is 
   unknown at this point, the current status is set to "none": 
    
     m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 0 96 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=rtpmap:96 no-op/8000 
     a=curr:con e2e none 
     a=des:con mandatory e2e sendrecv 
    
   SDP2: When B receives the offer, B sees the bidirectional 
   connectivity preconditions.  B can ascertain connectivity to A by

   use of the RTP no-op, however B needs A to inform it about 
   connectivity in the other direction.  Consequently, B includes a 
   request for confirmation in the "receive" direction:  
    
     m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0 96 
     a=rtpmap:96 no-op/8000 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:con e2e none 
     a=des:con mandatory e2e sendrecv 
     a=conf:con e2e recv 
    
   Meanwhile, B performs a connectivity check to A, which succeeds.  
   Also, A performs a connectivity check to B, which also succeeds.   
    
   SDP3: A now sends an UPDATE (5) to B to confirm the connectivity 
   from A to B, as requested by B:  
    
     m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 0 96 
     a=rtpmap:96 no-op/8000 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1 
     a=curr:con e2e send 
     a=des:qos mandatory e2e sendrecv 
    
   SDP4:  Upon receiving the updated offer, B now knows that there is 
   connectivity from A to B; connectivity from B to A was verified 
   earlier.  B therefore responds with an answer (6) which contains the 
   current status of the connectivity precondition (i.e., sendrecv) 
   from B's point of view: 
    
     m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0 96 
     a=rtpmap:96 no-op/8000 
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.4 
     a=curr:con e2e sendrecv 
     a=des:con mandatory e2e sendrecv 
    
   At this point in time, session establishment resumes and B returns a 
   180 (Ringing) response (7).

5. Security Considerations 
    
   TBD 
    
6. IANA Considerations  
    
   IANA is hereby requested to register a RFC 3312 precondition type 
   called "con" with the name "Connectivity precondition".  The 
   reference for this precondition type is the current document.  
    
7. Acknowledgements 
    
   The concept of a "connectivity precondition" is the result of 
   discussions with numerous people over a long period of time; the 
   authors greatly appreciate these contributions.
