     Note that there are no restrictions on the membership of a group.
     In particular a group may include itself as a member. Elimination
     of recursive references to groups MUST be performed by the agent
     responsible for calculating group membership attributes like that
     defined in section 4.2.2, or by agents that use group information
     in rights calculations.
