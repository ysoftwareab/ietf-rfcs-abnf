Abstract

  The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to
  entries in the directory.  Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1 in
  the X.500 Directory protocols.  In the Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol, a string representation of distinguished names is

  transferred.  This specification defines the string format for
  representing names, which is designed to give a clean representation
  of commonly used distinguished names, while being able to represent
  any distinguished name.

  This document obsoletes RFC 2253.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


1.  Background

  This specification assumes familiarity with X.500 [X.500], and the
  concept of Distinguished Name (DN).  It is important to have a common
  format to be able to unambiguously represent a distinguished name.
  The primary goal of this specification is ease of encoding and
  decoding.  A secondary goal is to have names that are human readable.
  It is not expected that LDAP clients with a human user interface would
  display these strings directly to the user, but would most likely be
  performing translations (such as expressing attribute type names in
  one of the local national languages).


2.  Converting DistinguishedName from ASN.1 to a String

  In X.501 [X.501] the ASN.1 structure of distinguished name is defined
  as:

      DistinguishedName ::= RDNSequence

      RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName

      RelativeDistinguishedName ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF
          AttributeTypeAndValue

      AttributeTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {
          type  AttributeType,
          value AttributeValue }

  The following sections define the algorithm for converting from an
  ASN.1 structured representation to a UTF-8 [RFC2279] string
  representation.


2.1. Converting the RDNSequence




Zeilenga                        LDAPv3 DN                       [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-ietf-ldapbis-dn-01.txt      26 February 2001


  If the RDNSequence is an empty sequence, the result is the empty or
  zero length string.

  Otherwise, the output consists of the string encodings of each
  RelativeDistinguishedName in the RDNSequence (according to 2.2),
  starting with the last element of the sequence and moving backwards
  toward the first.

  The encodings of adjoining RelativeDistinguishedNames are separated by
  a comma character (',' ASCII 44).


2.2.  Converting RelativeDistinguishedName

  When converting from an ASN.1 RelativeDistinguishedName to a string,
  the output consists of the string encodings of each
  AttributeTypeAndValue (according to 2.3), in any order.

  Where there is a multi-valued RDN, the outputs from adjoining
  AttributeTypeAndValues are separated by a plus ('+' ASCII 43)
  character.


2.3.  Converting AttributeTypeAndValue

  The AttributeTypeAndValue is encoded as the string representation of
  the AttributeType, followed by an equals character ('=' ASCII 61),
  followed by the string representation of the AttributeValue.  The
  encoding of the AttributeValue is given in section 2.4.

  If the AttributeType is in the following table of attribute types
  associated with LDAP [RFC2252bis], then the type name string from that
  table is used, otherwise it is encoded as the dotted-decimal encoding
  of the AttributeType's OBJECT IDENTIFIER. The dotted-decimal notation
  is described in [RFC2251bis].

  The type name string is not case sensitive.

      String  X.500 AttributeType
      ------  ----------------------
      CN      commonName
      L       localityName
      ST      stateOrProvinceName
      O       organizationName
      OU      organizationalUnitName
      C       countryName
      STREET  streetAddress
      DC      domainComponent

      UID     userId


2.4.  Converting an AttributeValue from ASN.1 to a String

  If the AttributeValue is of a type which does not have a string
  representation defined for it, then it is simply encoded as an
  octothorpe character ('#' ASCII 35) followed by the hexadecimal
  representation of each of the octets of the BER encoding of the X.500
  AttributeValue.  This form SHOULD be used if the AttributeType is of
  the dotted-decimal form.

  Otherwise, if the AttributeValue is of a type which has a string
  representation, the value is converted first to a UTF-8 string
  according to its syntax specification (see for example section 6 of
  [RFC2252bis]).

  If the UTF-8 string does not have any of the following characters
  which need escaping, then that string can be used as the string
  representation of the value.

  - a space (' ' ASCII 32) or octothorpe ('#' ASCII 35) occurring at the
    beginning of the string

  - a space (' ' ASCII 32) character occurring at the end of the string

  - one of the characters ",", "+", """, "\", "<", ">" or ";" (ASCII 44,
    43, 34, 92, 60, 62, or 59, respectively)

  Implementations MAY escape other characters.

  Each octet of the character to be escaped is replaced by a backslash
  and two hex digits, which form a single octet in the code of the
  character.  Alternatively, if and only if the character to be escaped
  is one of

      ",", "+", """, "\", "<", ">", ";", "#", "=", or " "
      (ASCII 44, 43, 34, 92, 60, 62, 59, 35, or 32, respectively)

  it may be prefixed by a backslash ('\' ASCII 92).


  Examples of the escaping mechanism are shown in section 4.


3. Parsing a String back to a Distinguished Name

  The structure of the UTF-8 string is specified using the following

      keychar           = ALPHA / DIGIT / MINUS

      oid               = 1*DIGIT *(DOT 1*DIGIT)

      attributeValue    = string / hexstring

      string            = *( stringchar / pair )
                          ; the string MUST NOT start with SHARP or SP
                          ; and MUST NOT end with SP

      stringchar        = <any UTF-8 character (can be multiple octets)

      special           = escaped / SHARP / EQUALS / SP

4.  Examples

  This notation is designed to be convenient for common forms of name.
  This section gives a few examples of distinguished names written using
  this notation.  First is a name containing three relative
  distinguished names (RDNs):

      UID=jsmith,DC=example,DC=net

  Here is an example name containing three RDNs, in which the first RDN
  is multi-valued:

      OU=Sales+CN=J. Smith,DC=example,DC=net

  This example shows the method of quoting of a comma in a common name:

      CN=John Smith\, III,DC=example,DC=net

  An example name in which a value contains a carriage return character:

      CN=Before\0dAfter,DC=example,DC=net

  An example name in which an RDN was of an unrecognized type.  The
  value is the BER encoding of an OCTET STRING containing two octets
  0x48 and 0x69.

      1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.0=#04024869,DC=example,DC=com

  Finally, an example of an RDN commonName value consisting of 5
  letters:

      Unicode Letter Description      10646 code UTF-8  Quoted
      =============================== ========== ====== =======
      LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L          U0000004C  0x4C   L
      LATIN SMALL LETTER U            U00000075  0x75   u
      LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CARON U0000010D  0xC48D \C4\8D
      LATIN SMALL LETTER I            U00000069  0x69   i

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-ietf-ldapbis-dn-01.txt      26 February 2001


      LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH ACUTE U00000107  0xC487 \C4\87

  could be written in printable ASCII (useful for debugging purposes):

      CN=Lu\C4\8Di\C4\87


5.  Security Considerations

  The following security considerations are specific to the handling of
  distinguished names.  LDAP security considerations are discussed in
  [RFC2251bis] and its normative references.


5.1. Disclosure

  Distinguished Names typically consist of descriptive information about
  the entries they name, which can be people, organizations, devices or
  other real-world objects.  This frequently includes some of the
  following kinds of information:

    - the common name of the object (i.e. a person's full name)
    - an email or TCP/IP address
    - its physical location (country, locality, city, street address)
    - organizational attributes (such as department name or affiliation)

  Most countries have privacy laws regarding the publication of
  information about people.


5.2. Use of Distinguished Names in Security Applications

  The transformations of an AttributeValue value from its X.501 form to
  an LDAP string representation are not always reversible back to the
  same BER or DER form.  An example of a situation which requires the
  DER form of a distinguished name is the verification of an X.509
  certificate.

  For example, a distinguished name consisting of one RDN with one AVA,
  in which the type is commonName and the value is of the TeletexString
  choice with the letters 'Sam' would be represented in LDAP as the
  string CN=Sam.  Another distinguished name in which the value is still
  'Sam' but of the PrintableString choice would have the same
  representation CN=Sam.

  Applications which require the reconstruction of the DER form of the
  value SHOULD NOT use the string representation of attribute syntaxes
  when converting a distinguished name to the LDAP format.  Instead,

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-ietf-ldapbis-dn-01.txt      26 February 2001


  they SHOULD use the hexadecimal form prefixed by the octothorpe ('#')
  as described in the first paragraph of section 2.4.

    - Removed IESG Note
    - Removed specification of additional requirements for LDAPv2
      implementations which also support LDAPv3 (Section 4).
    - Updated 2.3 to clarify which table is the published table of names
      which may be appear in DNs.  Remove "as an example" language.  -
      Updated 2.3 to indicate attribute type name strings are not case
      sensitive.
    - Updated 2.4 to allow hex pair escaping of all characters and
