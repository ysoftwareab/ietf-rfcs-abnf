Abstract

   This document defines a URI scheme, 'go:' to be used with the Common
   Name Resolution Protocol. Specifically it lays out the syntactic
   components and how those components are used by URI Resolution to
   find the available transports for a CNRP service. Care should be
   taken with several of the URI components because, while they may
   look like components found in other URI schemes, they often do not
   act like them. The "go"scheme has more in common with the location
   independent "news" scheme than any other URI scheme.

Internet-Draft           CNRP URI Specification                June 2000


1. Goals

   The two goals of the CNRP[3]URI[1] are to identify both a specific
   common-name record at a specific server and to identify a possibly
   dynamic query or entry point into the query process. Since CNRP
   requires that the ID be a core query term, these two cases can be
   generalized down to simply specifying a query that contains only the
   ID of the item.

   On first glance it would seem a simple enough exercise to
   canonicalize the XML encoded query and then insert it into the query
   portion of the URL. The problem here is that, due to the encoding
   rules, any remotely complex query will quickly blow out the URI
   length limitations. The suggested solution is to provide a
   simplified query syntax that is a subset of what is available via
   the XML.

2. Terminology

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119[4].

3. Syntax Rules

3.1 General Syntax

   The CNRP URI comes in two forms. The first form is for talking to a
   specific server. The second form is for expressing a query that is
   meant to be sent to several different CNRP services. The following
   two examples are for pedagogical purposes only. The ABNF is the only
   authoritative syntax definition. 

   go://[<host>]?[<common-name>]*[;<attribute>=<value>] 

   and 

   go:<common-name>*[;<attribute>=<value>] 

3.2 ABNF Grammar

   The full ABNF[2] (certain values are included by reference from
   RFC2396[1]): 

   cnrp-uri = "go:" (form1 / form2)
   form1    = "//" [server] ["?" (common-name / id-req) *avpair ]

   form2         = common-name *avpair

   id-req        = "id=" value
   avpair        = ";" attribute "=" value

   server        = // as specified in RFC2396

   common-name     = *(unreserved | escaped)
   attribute       = *(unreserved | escaped)
   value           = *(unreserved | escaped)

   unreserved      = // as specified in RFC2396

   escaped       = "%" hex hex
   hex           = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
                   "8" | "9" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" |
                   "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"


3.3 Special Cases and Default Values

3.3.1 If there is only a server

   In the case where the CNRP URI contains only the server production
   then the URI identifies a given CNRP server, not any particular

   query that is to be done. A client can assume that this server will
   at least answer the 'servicequery' request. 

3.3.2 If server is empty then server=localhost

   If the 'server' element has no value then its value MUST be assumed
   to be "localhost". 

3.3.3 Default Port

   CNRP's well known port is 1096. If the port value portion of the
   server production is not specified then port 1096 MUST be used. 

3.4 Encoding Rules

   The common-name, query parameters, or its values must be encoded
   using the UTF-8 encoding scheme[5], and any octet that is not one of
   the permitted characters per the above grammar MUST instead be
   represented by a "%" followed by two characters from the <hex>
   character set above.  The two characters give the hexadecimal
   representation of that octet.

4. Transport Independence

   As stated in the CNRP protocol specification[3], CNRP is allowed to
   be expressed over multiple transport protocols with HTTP being
   mandatory to implement. In the case where a client attempts to
   resolve a CNRP URI and it knows nothing about the service being
   referenced in that URI, then it SHOULD use HTTP.

5. Examples

   go:Mercedes%20Benz 
      This example shows a general query for the common-name "Mercedes
      Benz". The intent is that the query should be packaged with any
      client provided defaults and sent to the one or more services
      that the client has configured to ask. 

   go://cnrp.foo.com?Mercedes%20Benz;geography=US-ga 
      This example shows a query for the common-name "Mercedes Benz" in
      the geographic area "US-ga" which should be sent to the server
      found at cnrp.foo.com.

   go://cnrp.w3.org?Martin%20J.%20D%C3%BCrst 
      This example includes a UTF-8 character encoded using hex
      escaping. The value encoded is a u-umlaut (a 'u' with two dots
      over it). This simple query is sent to a server found at
      cnrp.w3.org with no parameters 

   go://cnrp.foo.com?id=5432345 
      Here only an id is given which means that his example points
      directly at a particular common-name record on a particular
      server. This example would probably be found in a link on a web
      page of some type.

Internet-Draft           CNRP URI Specification                June 2000


6. Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations inherent in CNRP itself,
   the URI mechanism can also be used to redirect to some other site by
   including just the ID and not the common-name being linked to. I.e.
   the user may think he/she is being linked to where ever the BMW
   common-name currently points but in the case where only the ID is
   used the actual common-name is not part of the URI, thus making it
   possible to use a CNRP URI without knowing which common-name it is
   referring to.
