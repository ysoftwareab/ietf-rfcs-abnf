Internet-Draft           Replace Instant Message               July 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3261 [1] is extended by RFC 3428 [2] with Instant Messaging
   protocol.  However it hasn't been defined in RFC 3428 [2] for a UAC
   to support the functions for replacing or recalling a previous page-
   mode instant message sent by itself.  For example, Alice intents to
   send a meeting notice to Bob, but there is a typo in the message.
   Alice may want to either recall the message or replace the message
   with a new one.

   The requirement can be expressed as:

      REQ-1: It MUST be possible for a user to replace a previous
      instant message sent by itself with a new instant message, or
      recall the previous instant message.

   Note that, the similar requirements have been existed and considered
   in many messaging services (e.g., Email, SMS and MMS).  In this
   draft, we approach similar mechanisms for UAC in order to enhance its
   functionality to meet the requirement we described above.

   In this draft we would like to initiate discussions on this open
   issue in an early stage, next we will provide the solution(s) to this
   problem in order to meet the UAC requirements.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]

3.  Overview

   There are some basic ideas to be considered in this discussion.

      OPEN ISSUE 1: Currently two approaches are considered as the
      possible solutions to the replace / recall requirements: one is to
      create an extension to CPIM (Common Presence and Instant
      Messaging); another is to create an extension to SIP MESSAGE.
      There are some intersections in between these two approaches, and
      each of them have advantages and disadvantages.  A topic for
      discussion is which approach can be the best?  Or they are
      applicable depending on different cases?

      OPEN ISSUE 2: As of the approach on extension to SIP MESSAGE, is
      the "REPLACES" header defined in RFC 3891 can be applicable for
      this extension?

      OPEN ISSUE 3: A precise identification method to locate the
      previous page-mode instant message is one of the key issues.  We
      realized the counterpart mechanism in email is Message-ID, then
      what is the one for MESSAGE?
