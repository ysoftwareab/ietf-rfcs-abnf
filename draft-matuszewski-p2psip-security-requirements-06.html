<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document provides a security overview and analysis for the
      Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network. It
      discusses security threats for the P2PSIP architecture and its
      components. It compares security difference between client/server (C/S)
      and P2P implementations of SIP, and then partitions the P2PSIP
      architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each layer
      and the security relationship among the layers.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The scope of this document is to analyze security threats concerning
      a P2PSIP overlay architecture as described in the concepts and
      terminology for P2PSIP document <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., and S. Dawkins, &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> . It presents an introduction
      to security threats to P2PSIP environments and then compares security
      difference between client/server (C/S) and P2P implementations of SIP,
      and then partitions the P2PSIP architecture into layers and analyzes the
      security issues in each layer and the security relationship among the
      layers. This draft also classifies the application scenarios into two
      main types and then analyzes in detail the security threats with these
      two types of scenarios. Some solutions to certain attacks are given as
      an example in the analysis text. In the end, it provides user and system
      security considerations for the P2PSIP overlay network. This document is
      designed to complement the <a class='info' href='#I-D.bryan-p2psip-requirements'>P2PSIP Protocol Framework and
      Requirements document<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., &ldquo;P2PSIP Protocol Framework and Requirements,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.bryan&#8209;p2psip&#8209;requirements].

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p>We use the terminology and definitions from the Concepts and
      Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., and S. Dawkins, &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> draft extensively in this
      document. Other terms used in this document are defined inline when used
      and are also defined below for reference.
</p>
<p>O P2PSIP Network Entity: A P2PSIP network entity is a peer, client,
      or other functional node that may become a part of a P2PSIP overlay.
</p>
<p>O P2PSIP System: A P2PSIP system consists of the P2PSIP overlay as
      defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., and S. Dawkins, &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and one or
      more enrollment servers. The enrollment servers issue unique identities
      and credentials that are used to authenticate and admit P2PSIP network
      entities to the overlay and allow a user to use services provided by the
      P2PSIP overlay. The enrollment server may also provide an initial set of
      bootstrap nodes.
</p>
<p>O P2P Overlay Base: A P2P Overlay Base includes all the Peers that
      participate in the p2p overlay. The P2P Overlay Base provides
      distributed storage and routing services to both peers and clients.
</p>
<p>O Trusted P2P Overlay Base: All peers in a Trusted P2P Overlay Base
      are trusted. The Peers in the overlay are all of good behaviors and
      under control due to deployment. For example, a carrier deploys a
      Trusted P2P Overlay Base to provide service to his customers, and all
      the peers are the carrier's devices.
</p>
<p>O Untrusted P2P Overlay Base: Peers in a Untrusted P2P Overlay Base
      are not all trusted. There may exist some malicious behaving nodes in
      the P2P Overlay Base.

Security threats</h3>

<p>This section analyses security threats in the Peer-to-Peer SIP
      architecture.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Replay Attacks</h3>

<p>Replay attacks are a form of network attacks where a valid data
        transmission is repeated or delayed. A badly behaving node may take an
        older message sent by another node, resend it to the overlay, and thus
        replace any newer data with the old information present in this
        message. During those procedures, an attacker may be able to enroll
        credentials for himself, or replace existing entry in the P2PSIP
        overlay by an older entry. Thus, the architecture must consider this
        issue in the process of both enrollment and modification of P2PSIP
        resource (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.
</p>
<p>This is especially applicable to P2PSIP overlays that use the
        recursive routing mode. In the recursive routing mode, data sent in a
        PUT request traverses many peers in the overlay. If there is no
        protection against the replay attacks any peer that forwards the
        request may store a copy of the request and resend the captured
        request corrupting data stored in the overlay.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Message Insertion, Modification, Deletion</h3>

<p>The message insertion, modification, and deletion attacks are where
        an attacker is able to alter the messages being exchanged between two
        end points.
</p>
<p>P2PSIP peers connect to other peers to form the P2PSIP overlay
        network. Typically peers provide storage, routing and bootstrap
        services for other peers and clients. They allow P2PSIP entities to
        PUT information to or GET information from the P2PSIP overlay network.
        In the P2PSIP overlay that allows for a recursive routing, peers are
        responsible for forwarding messages (requests and responses) received
        from P2PSIP network entities to other peers. Depending on the size of
        the overlay a single message can be forwarded by many peers before it
        reaches a destination. In the iterative routing peers are responsible
        for redirecting the requests to other peers. They do not forward the
        requests to other peers. They respond to a request originator with an
        address of a peer that should be contacted in the next step. In such
        an environment a badly behaving peer may:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>modify incoming messages,
</li>
<li>discard incoming messages (the peer can discard requests and
            responses it is supposed to forward),
</li>
<li>generate incorrect responses to requests that are directed to
            some other nodes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first bullet point describes the attack that allows the peer to
        cause the overlay to store unauthorized or outdated information in the
        resource (user) records or return corrupted data to the originator of
        the GET request (a peer or client). The peer may change the data
        record in the overlay by changing incoming PUT messages or modify
        result of the GET operation by modifying incoming GET responses. With
        this type of attack the integrity of the P2PSIP system can become
        compromised.
</p>
<p>The middle bullet point is related not only to attacks that allow a
        malicious peer to prevent access to a P2PSIP resource (user) record,
        but also to attacks that can degrade the performance of the P2PSIP
        system making it useless from the end-user perspective. The second
        problem is of high importance in P2PSIP overlays that store user's
        reachability data which is much more time-critical than content stored
        in file sharing networks.
</p>
<p>The attack described in the last bullet above may lead to a
        requestor receiving corrupted data e.g. a connectivity information
        that points to some other node. This may happen if a malicious peer
        can respond to incoming requests that are directed to another
        peer.
</p>
<p>Besides peers may act as relays relaying traffic between two P2PSIP
        network entities or act as a SIP proxy and a SIP registrar. Providing
        those services a malicious peer may perform a similar attacks as
        described above. Let us consider the following deployment scenario
        where some peers act as SIP registrars or/and SIP proxies and allow a
        conventional SIP UA to access resources of the P2PSIP overlay network.
        An unmodified SIP UA sends an SIP Invite request towards an unknown
        peer that acts as a SIP proxy. If the SIP messages are not
        cryptographically protected, this peer may act maliciously and proxy a
        request to other than intended node or modify SDP messages in order to
        stay on the media path. Similarly a peer that acts as a SIP Registrar
        may modify registration information before it sends it to a peer that
        is responsible for storing the P2PSIP user record of a registering SIP
        UA. Those attacks do not have impact on the integrity of the overlay.
        Nevertheless those attacks must be addressed by designers of service
        specific protocols such as <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>SIP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

Man-In-The-Middle</h3>

<p>In man-in-the-middle (m-i-m) attacks a malicious node can hijack a
        connection established between two legitimate nodes, or just listen
        and/or modify messages exchanged between two nodes. In contrast to the
        attacks presented in Section 13.2 man-in-the middle attacks are
        prevalent in pairing and authentication procedures.
</p>
<p>The m-i-m threat can be mitigated by using well-established
        authentication protocols. The authentication protocols may be used to
        verify if a certain P2PSIP entity is the entity it claims to be, for
        example if it is really a peer that is identified by a certain peer
        ID. The authentication protocols can also be used to verify if a
        particular P2PSIP entity belongs to a particular overlay or not.
        However, authentication protocols cannot fully mitigate all of the
        attacks presented in Section 13.2. There can be malicious peers that
        are authorized overlay participants with a particular peer
        identifiers.
</p>
<p>If a bootstrap process is fully decentralized and a bootstrap node
        is not trusted or authentication of the bootstrap node is not
        possible, then the joining node can easily be attacked, e.g. it may be
        redirected to another overlay or a part of the legacy overlay that is
        controlled by the attacker. However if it is possible to authenticate
        a particular peer in the overlay the joining peer may use P2P specific
        mechanisms to detect if it is redirected to the right overlay or the
        right place in the overlay.
</p>
<p>Conventional SIP proxy and SIP registrars are servers maintained by
        a service provider. If a user trust a service provider he also trusts
        servers the service provider maintains. In P2PSIP SIP proxies and
        registrars can be maintained by users themselves (they can be
        collocated with peers). In a distributed environment it is very
        difficult to trust all of peers in the overlay. Without an efficient
        verification mechanism that allows to verify which peers are be
        trusted, peers that act as SIP proxies and registrars may easily
        perform m-i-m attacks. The problem must be solved by SIP designers as
        well as by the P2PSIP community.

Offline Cryptographic Attacks</h3>

<p>The incentive to break a secure system dominates the effort to do

        attacks, and if state-of-the art security methods are used, the needed
        effort to break the system by breaking cryptography is very likely to
        be higher than by finding and exploiting software errors and
        vulnerabilities.

Unauthorized Usage</h3>

<p>The basic notions of authentication and authorization, when
        implemented correctly and consistently should protect against
        unauthorized usage of the P2PSIP system. However, the trustworthiness
        of an identity may be weak i.e. the enrollment system might be fairly
        open and allow devices and persons that wish to attack the system.
        Thus, there is a significant threat of attacks from within the
        system.
</p>
<p>A malicious peer may do a multitude of attacks towards the overlay
        including:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>ignoring, changing, and deleting records in DHT that is it
            responsible for,
</li>
<li>misbehaving during data lookups (ie, giving wrong node
            addresses, discarding queries).
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first bullet point is related to attacks that may cause DHT to
        contain unauthorized, outdated information and/or miss information
        about users or resources. Each peer is responsible for a part of the
        hash space. Peers store resource (user) records that fall into their
        part of the hash space. A malicious peer may modify or delete resource
        (user) records it is supposed to store. It may also reply with
        incorrect information to the GET requests addressed to resource (user)
        records it is responsible for. In addition it may ignore any record
        updates. These attacks are not limited to peers that are responsible
        for primary copies of resource (user) records. They are also related
        to peers that store replicas of resource (user) records. Besides a
        bootstrap node may also respond with wrong bootstrapping
        information.
</p>
<p>The second bullet point addresses attacks that may impact
        correctness of routing mechanisms. If the recursive routing is used a
        malicious peer can forward messages to another malicious node rather
        than forwarding the messages according to the legitimate routing
        information. This may also impact the iterative routing being
        corrupted when the peer redirects the requester to a malicious
        node.

Inappropriate Usage</h3>

<p>The P2PSIP overlay essentially provides a distributed storage for
        P2PSIP resource (user) records. The data stored in the distributed
        database can be used in an inappropriate manner. If there is no access
        control to a resource (user) records stored in the overlay and any
        node can update or retrieve information stored in the overlay. An
        attacker may request data stored in the P2PSIP resource (user) records
        and perform inappropriate usage attacks. Besides the attacker may also
        update entries of other users or resources.
</p>
<p>The individual services provided by P2PSIP (messaging, real-time
        communication) have their respective threat models regarding
        inappropriate use (Spam, viruses, ...) but these can be considered out
        of scope for this document.

Denial of Service</h3>

<p>In the P2PSIP architecture <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., and S. Dawkins, &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the P2PSIP resource (user)
        records are not maintained in a central, trustworthy storage system,
        rather they are distributed among peers participating in the system.
        Routing, relaying, SIP proxy and registrar services are also
        distributed among P2PSIP entities. In cases where authentication in
        the P2PSIP overlay is weak or where the system is fairly open to new
        participants the "infiltration" is trivial (e.g., Sybil attack).
</p>
<p>If peers in the P2PSIP overlay can freely choose peer IDs or/and
        easily modify previously selected peer IDs the attacker may use
        join-leave attacks to place a malicious peer intentionally at any
        location in overlay. Placing the peer at any location allows an
        attacker to obtain control of the location in the overlay where the
        attacked user or resource is registered. A malicious peer may discard,
        modify the data it is supposed to store and may discard lookup
        requests or reply with incorrect entries to the incoming requests.
</p>
<p>The attacker may also try to register a large number of resources
        to the P2PSIP overlay increasing processing load on peers that are
        responsible for storing the resources and limiting the overall
        capacity of the P2PSIP overlay network. It may also try to register
        all popular names preventing the name holders from registering their
        preferred URIs.
</p>
<p>Another critical point where a D-o-S attack can be mounted is the
        enrollment system.

Communication security threats</h3>

<p>The main places where communication security becomes an issue in

        between endpoints. The last ones are subject to all typical threats in
        this domain, however they have been individually considered in the
        earlier sections of this chapter.
</p>
<p>This document assumes that the actual SIP service implementation
        provides its own communication security, and the P2PSIP adds to that
        only in providing a means for the communication endpoints to establish
        a shared key for further security needs. Otherwise, the communication
        security threats in that domain is out-of-scope for this

Security Comparison between C/S and P2P</h3>

<p>In a Client Server(C/S) architecture, a client asks for a specific
      service only from a specific server. The destination contact
      address(i.e. the address of that server) can be acquired from the
      trusted DNS system directly. Given this, the security issues exist only
      with the connection between the client and the server. Typically, making
      the connection secure between the client and the server addresses most
      of the security issues related to the client.
</p>
<p>However, in a P2P architecture the security issues are more
      complex.
</p>
<p>First, where in a C/S architecture specific servers provide certain
      services, in a P2P architecture, each peer in the P2P overlay can
      provide distributed storage and transport services for other P2P
      entities. There is also no hierarchy of servers but instead the peers
      self-organize into the P2P overlay.
</p>
<p>Second, where in a C/S architecture a client sends its request
      directly to a server, in a P2P architecture a peer sends messages
      through Key-Based-Routing and it doesn't know where the destination is.
      There are intermediate nodes between the source and destination.
</p>
<p>Third, where in a C/S architecture the client can trust the
      information from the server, in a P2P architecture, one peer does not
      know whether it should trust the information acquired from the
      overlay.
</p>
<p>So in a P2P architecture, security issues not only exist between end
      to end entities, but also between hop by hop services. They are not only
      related to the routing security, but also related to the content
      security.

<p>The major components of RELOAD are:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Usage Layer: Each application defines a RELOAD usage; a set of
          data kinds and behaviors which describe how to use the services
          provided by RELOAD. These usages all talk to RELOAD through a common
          Message Transport API.
</p>
<p>Message Transport: Handles the end-to-end reliability, manages
          request state for the usages, and forwards Store and Fetch
          operations to the Storage component. Delivers message responses to
          the component initiating the request.
</p>
<p>Storage: The Storage component is responsible for processing
          messages relating to the storage and retrieval of data. It talks
          directly to the Topology Plugin to manage data replication and
          migration, and it talks to the Message Transport to send and receive
          messages.
</p>
<p>Topology Plugin: The Topology Plugin is responsible for
          implementing the specific overlay algorithm being used. It uses the
          Message Transport component to send and receive overlay management
          messages, to the Storage component to manage data replication, and
          directly to the Forwarding Layer to control hop-by-hop message
          forwarding. This component closely parallels conventional routing
          algorithms, but is more tightly coupled to the Forwarding Layer
          because there is no single "routing table" equivalent used by all
          overlay algorithms.
</p>
<p>Forwarding and Link Management Layer: Stores and implements the
          routing table by providing packet forwarding services between nodes.
          It also handles establishing new links between nodes, including
          setting up connections across NATs using ICE.
</p>
<p>Overlay Link Layer: TLS and DTLS are the "link layer" protocols
          used by RELOAD for hop-by-hop communication. Each such protocol
          includes the appropriate provisions for per-hop framing or
          hop-by-hop ACKs required by unreliable transports.

Overlay Link Layer Security</h3>

<p>Given that a P2PSIP overlay can run on top of the Internet or other
        untrusted network, messages between associated nodes should be
        protected against attacks(such as Man-in-the-Middle). In order to
        establish the identity trust association, nodes must authenticate each
        other with e.g. TLS and DTLS. If transport service security is
        provided, we can prevent nodes without valid identities to participate
        in the overlay. This layer must provides reliable and secure
        hop-by-hop transport service for the P2P overlay. This alone, though,
        is not enough to secure the P2P system.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Forwarding and Link Management Layer Security</h3>

<p>Each Peer in the P2PSIP overlay provides key-based routing service
        to other peers and a routing maintenance mechanism is used to keep the
        routing table timely and correct for the routing service. There are
        some security threats with the routing table updating interaction and
        the key-based routing.
</p>
<p>Even if all the nodes participating in the P2PSIP overlay have
        valid identities, the overlay may still be attacked by responding with
        fake routing table to UPDATE requests. If the routing table is false,
        the routing determination based on it will be false too. So,
        verification mechanisms should be adopted to verify if the routing
        table received by the peer correct or not. A correct routing table is
        important for hop by hop forwarding security.
</p>
<p>Second, some attackers may discard the messages when forwarding, or
        on purpose forward the message to a wrong next hop. The overlay should
        include some method to detect incorrectly forwarded messages.
</p>
<p>Third, some attacks may cause high churn rate to the overlay. For
        example, some peers may frequently join and leave the overlay. Overlay
        wastes much more traffic to update the routing table, and transfer
        relative resource objects under churn. It can also make the routing
        messages fail.
</p>
<p>In this case, we need a method to control nodes joining the
        overlay. The join control entity, which may be a bootstrap server or
        enrollment server, or a bootstrap peer, makes records of peers'
        historical behaviors in the overlay and their historical join
        requests. When it receives the join request from a peer to join the
        overlay, it checks the historical records as mentioned above to
        determine whether this peer is permitted to join at this point. It
        will deny the node to join the overlay when it determines the peer is
        not permitted to join. For example, if a peer joins and leaves too
        frequently, it will be denied to join the overlay as a peer for a
        period of time and instead it will be allowed to join the overlay as a
        client.
</p>
<p>Chosen-ID attack makes the above security issues much more
        worse.
</p>
<p>In general, the main security issues in this layer are about
        routing table maintenance security, and the the KBR function
        security.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4"></a><h3>5.4.&nbsp;
Storage Security</h3>

<p>The storage component provides distributed storage service for the
        resource objects that located in one's responsible resource ID range,
        and the replication service to keep the availability of resource
        objects under churn. The security issues here are typically end to
        end, and about the content and authority security.
</p>
<p>First, We need to protect resource objects when needed against
        unauthorized data operation such as fetch, modify or remove. A
        solution for authorization is needed.
</p>
<p>Second, The P2PSIP overlay needs a method to prevent attackers from
        publishing malicious information that will cause a DDOS attack. For
        example, Peer A may publish a very popular resource record with the
        contact address of Peer B without B's permission. That causes
        unexpected connections to B which will overload Peer B. Using
        certificates can't solve this problem, a check mechanism for the
        resource object is needed.
</p>
<p>Third, overlays work well for a reasonable amount of resource
        objects, but crash more or less when inserting big number of resource
        objects per node. Spam attacks can make overlays go down. Open issue:
        Should spam attack be considered in the storage layer? Or is it only
        the responsibility of the application layer to handle this
        problem?
</p>
<p>Fourth, for the availability of the resource records in the overlay
        network, replication is needed, but attackers can replicate excessive
        amount of resources in the overlay network. So, only authorized peers
        can replicate certain resources, and the number of resources one can
        replicate is limited.

<a name="rfc.section.5.5"></a><h3>5.5.&nbsp;
Message Transport Security</h3>

<p>Some attacker who is not responsible for the destination ID may
        respond to some requests when he is in the intermediate routing
        path(May respond with a fabricated resource object or just says that
        the searched resource object doesn't exist). Should the source node
        verify whether the response peer is responsible for the request? When
        and how does the source peer do that? Whether the response peer is
        responsible for the request is important for the end to end message
        transport security.
</p>
<p>Another security issue in this layer is about the message state
        maintenance. The timeout value for the end to end message transport
        must be chosen appropriately, because too short timeout value will
        cause the overlay be flooded with messages since the initiator will
        send the request again before the response is received. And too long
        timeout value will not satisfy the requirement for communication
        efficiency when routing failures occur. An open issue here is: How to
        derive the appropriate timeout value and should the timeout value be
        changed when the overlay size changes?

Interconnection to other networks</h3>

<p>While some P2PSIP systems may exist that only allow communication
      between P2PSIP peers within the system, other P2PSIP systems may have
      connections to other networks such as the traditional Public Switched
      Telephone Network (PSTN) or newer SIP-based networks.
</p>
<p>For example, a P2PSIP system might be deployed within a branch office
      with a connection from the P2PSIP system going back to a SIP-based
      communication network in a main corporate office. Alternatively, a small
      office might deploy a P2PSIP system and then have some gateway to the
      PSTN for external communication.
</p>
<p>In examples such as these, care must be taken to ensure the security
      of communication to those external networks. Note that the level of
      concern may vary depending upon whether the P2PSIP overlay base is
      trusted or untrusted, as discussed in the previous section.

<p>A common scenario may be for a P2PSIP system to be connected to
        another SIP network. This could be to a main corporate network as
        described earlier, or it could be to a SIP-based Service Provider who
        would then provide inbound and / or outbound connectivity to the PSTN.
        It could also be to an on-premise device such as an IP-PBX or SIP
        application server that would provide connectivity to other
        networks.

        hardware cards. For instance, a small office might have a PC or other
        device with a hardware card that provided connectivity to a

Dependence of reachability of a centralized server</h3>

<p>Considering the nature of P2P in general, the dependence of
          reachability of a centralized server should be minimized. There may
          be unavoidable situations such as the enrollment process, where this
          is not possible. However, the normal functioning of the P2PSIP
          overlay such as join and leave operations, modification, retrieval
          and deletion of P2PSIP resource (user) records from the P2PSIP
          system should not depend on the reachability of a centralised
          server.

Preference of existing security mechanisms</h3>

<p>Although P2PSIP defines a new architecture, and thereby new
          interfaces and protocols, for security there are several
          standardized solutions for access control, authentication, integrity
          protection and communication security. Using established protocols
          minimizes potential security loopholes that need to be patched
          later. Besides implementation is easier if chosen security protocols
          are widely implemented and used.

Base P2P security design considerations and guideline</h3>

<p>All of the security operations should be specified in such a way
          that they do not impose new unnecessary requirements on a base P2P
          algorithm (e.g., DHT implementations) and limit its scalability. The
          security issues that are not introduced by the P2P algorithm must
          not be left to the P2P algorithm to solve.
</p>
<p>A P2PSIP system should provide methods to support various level
          of security provisioning. Security requirements in P2P systems can
          be different, depending on level of trust in the central entities
          and connectivity to the global Internet. Security operations should
          be specified in a manner that they do not overload base P2P
          algorithms (e.g. DHT implementations). Security risks, not covered
          by these, should be further investigated in research projects.

          user.
</p>
<p>Because some attackers may try to use identities of another

Enrollment</h3>

<p>The enrollment process defines the set of users and P2PSIP
          network entities that may participate in a P2PSIP system. Each
          P2PSIP system may establish its own policy for who can join the
          system. The enrollment process policy may define:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>how many and what user IDs and peer IDs a user or a P2PSIP
              network entity may register,
</li>
<li>and how often they must re-new their subscription to the
              P2PSIP system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>As it was indicated in <a class='info' href='#I-D.bryan-p2psip-requirements'>[I&#8209;D.bryan&#8209;p2psip&#8209;requirements]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., &ldquo;P2PSIP Protocol Framework and Requirements,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> the enrollment
          process may take several measures in admitting a user or a network
          node to the P2PSIP system to increase security:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>may require strong identity such as employment or identity
              provided by a trusted 3rd party or by the P2PSIP service
              operator,
</li>
<li>may apply reputation mechanisms.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the user probably is the entity that enrolls to the
          P2PSIP system, the credentials that are the result of the enrollment
          are used to grant a device the right to function as a peer, client
          or any other operative function possible in the system. Thus the
          security of enrollment also translates to the security of the device
          itself where the credentials are stored, and threats related to
          device security in general.

          (user) records as well as routing tables. Only authorized users must
          be able to modify, delete or overwrite their P2PSIP resource (user)
          records in the P2PSIP system. P2PSIP security should allow users and
          P2PSIP network entities to register the same resources (e.g.
          TURN@overlay.net), however each entity should have rights only to
          its own part of a resource record. In other words each entity should
          be able to perform the same operations on its part of a resource
          record as on its own resource (user) records.
</p>
<p>The owner of the P2PSIP resource (user) records should be able to
          authorize other users and network entities to modify, delete their
          P2PSIP resource (user) records.

          stored in or retrieved from the P2PSIP overlay is authentic, i.e.
          was not tampered by unauthorized P2PSIP network entities.
</p>
<p>The peer that stores P2PSIP resource (user) records must be able
          to validate the data received in the process of P2PSIP resource
          (user) record insertion and modification.

Denial of Service (DOS) attacks</h3>

<p>It must NOT be possible to obtain control of the location in the
          overlay where the attacked user's or resource's records are
          registered. In order to prevent so-called Sybil or join-leave
          attacks the attacker should NOT be able to easily register a
          unlimited number of IDs of his choice in the P2SIP overlay. The
          P2PSIP system should be able to control ID assignment. Once
          assigned, an ID or a set of IDs should be difficult to change.
</p>
<p>In addition the P2PSIP architecture should make sure that data
          stored in a P2PSIP overlay is persistent, meaning that even if a
          number of nodes (but not all of nodes in the overlay) fails the data
          stored by those nodes is not lost. In addition the attacker must NOT
          be able to register unlimited number of resources in the
          overlay.

Privacy Protection</h3>

<p>The security of P2PSIP systems must guarantee privacy of the
          P2PSIP network participants. The P2PSIP security should allow the
          users and P2PSIP network entities to indicate which other users or
          P2PSIP network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data stored
          in their P2PSIP resource (user) records. The owner of a P2PSIP
          resource (user) record should be able to limit the access to his own
          resource (user) records, and this feature should be enforced by the
          P2P network.
</p>
<p>It must also be difficult to monitor who is communicating with a
          particular user, or retrieve any contextual data about the user
          without the user's explicit consent. The P2PSIP network entities
          must be provided with option to encrypt data exchanged with other
          P2PSIP network entities.

Badly behaving nodes</h3>

<p>It should be possible to limit potential damage caused by
          malfunctioning and badly behaving nodes in a P2PSIP system. As the
          policy taken by the P2PSIP system operator/community may be very
          liberal, any user can obtain the right to be a user of a P2PSIP
          system. It may be that some users behave badly intentionally in
          which case it should be possible to limit the impact of the badly
          behaving nodes on the overall system security. There should be
          methods to look for badly behaving nodes and exclude or reject them
          from the P2PSIP system.
