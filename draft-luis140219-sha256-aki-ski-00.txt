1. Introduction

This document updates the "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
   Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280].

After the first SHA-1 collision in 2017-02-23 [SHATTERED], hash
collisions are expected to get more efficient and affordable. In the
near future, SHA-1 may not suffice for identification of keys as keys
with colliding hashes may be generated.

2. Updates to RFC 5280

In addition to the two methods defined in Section 4.2.1.2 of RFC 5280,
a third method is defined below that generates the value of the
keyIdentifier from the public key:

The keyIdentifier is composed of the 256-bit SHA-256 hash of the value
of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length and
number of unused bits).
