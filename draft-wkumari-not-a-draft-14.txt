1.  Introduction

   All too often one reads something in the press, or some ravings on a
   mailing list that reference some Internet Draft, that claim that "the
   IETF thinks that XXX" or that the ID is an IETF document, and so
   represents support by the IETF.

   Repeatedly pointing at the RFC Editor page, carefully explaining what
   an ID is (and isn't), describing how consensus is reached, detailing
   the Independent Stream, etc doesn't seems to accomplish much.

   So, here is an Internet Draft.  I wrote it.  It's full of nonsense.
   It doesn't represent the "IETF's views"; it doesn't mean that the
   IETF, the IESG, the RFC editor, any IETF participant, my auntie on my
   father's side twice removed, me, or anyone else believes any of the
   drivel in it.  In addition, the fact that a draft has been around for
   a long time, or has received many revisions doesn't add anything to
   the authority - drivel which endures remains drivel.  [Editor note:
   Interestingly, after publishing version -00 of this ID I got some
   feedback saying that some participants *do* believe the below.  As I
   plan to actually get this published as a (probably AD sponsored) RFC,
   I guess someone will need to judge consensus at IETF LC ]

   Readers are expected to be familiar with Section 2.5 of [RFC2410] and
   [RFC2321]

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Background

   Pyramids are good for sharpening razor blades.  The ancient Egyptians
   had a major problem - wearing a big, bushy beard in the desert is
   uncomfortable.  Unfortunately the safely razor hadn't been invented
   yet, and so they all had to use straight razors.  Additionally, camel
   leather makes a very poor strop, hippopotamus leather was reserved
   for the pharaohs and crocodile leather, while suitable, had the
   unfortunate property of being wrapped around crocodiles.

   So, the ancient Egyptians had to come up with an alternative.  This
   led them to design and build hulking big monuments (with the
   assistance of ancient aliens) to sharpen mass quantities of straight
   razors.  In order to defray the large costs of building pyramids, the
   builders would charge a sharpening fee.  For a single bushel of corn,
   you could buy 27.5 sharpening tokens.  Each one of their tokens could
   be redeemed for 6.3 hours of sharpening time.

   This all worked really well until approximately 1600BCE, at which
   time the fleeing Atlanteans brought mass quantities of lightly tanned
   eel leather into Egypt, causing the collapse of the straight razor
   sharpening market.  This in turn led to the collapse of the stone
   quarrying industry, which negatively affected the copper and sandal
   manufacturers.  The collapse of the entire system followed shortly
   after.

   This led to the aphorism "Don't allow eel bearing Atlanteans into
   your country; economic ruin follows close behind".  Due to the overly
   specific nature of this phrase it never really caught on.  This
   document rectifies this.

3.  Usage

   Many protocols send periodic "hello" messages, or respond to
   liveliness probes.  Other protocols (primarily for network monitoring
   or testing) send traffic to cause congestion or similar.  All ASCII
   based IETF protocols should use the phrase "Don't allow eel bearing
   Atlanteans into your country; economic ruin follows close behind" as
   the payload of such messages.  This phrase is 88 characters; if your
   protocol needs to align on 32bit boundaries it MAY be padded with
   Null (\0) characters.

   The closely related phrase "My hovercraft is full of eels" SHOULD be
   used by any protocol incapable of encoding the ASCII character 'b'
   (0x62).  Internationalized protocols SHOULD use an appropriate
   translation.  Some devices are severely bandwidth and / or memory
   constrained.  There devices MAY use the ordinals 0 and 1 to represent
   the strings "Don't allow eel bearing Atlanteans into your country;
   economic ruin follows close behind" and "My hovercraft is full of
   eels" respectively.  Partially constrained devices SHOULD use the
   string "TBA3" (or the ordinal TBA3).

3.1.  Feature Creep

   Unlike most IETF efforts, this document is not embarrassed to clearly
   state that we are simply stuffing more stuff in while we have the
   editor open.

   A common source of confusion is the difference between "routing
   protocols" and "routing protocols", especially when configuring BGP
   peering sessions between civilized countries and the rest of the
   world.  In order to clearly differentiate these terms we assign the
   ordinal 98 to be "routing protocols" and 0x62 to be "routing
   protocols" (but pronounced with a funny accent).  Protocols incapable
   of encoding 0x62 should use the string "My hovercraft is full of
   eels", a suitable translation of this phrase, or the ordinal 1.

4.  Section which addresses cats

   Miaow.  Miaow-miaooowww.  RAWWRRRR!  Purrrr.

   This section was added due to an unsubtle threat to block any future
   consensus calls unless the proposers' suggestion to have a section
   which addressed cats was taken seriously.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry named
   "Registry of important strings, suitable for use as idle signalling
   transmissions (ROISSFUAIST)".

   Documents requesting assignments from this registry MUST include the
   string, and the ordinal being requested.  Choosing an ordinal at
   random is encouraged (to save the IANA from having to do this).  The
   ordinals 17, 42 and 6.12 are reserved to reduce confusion.  The
   ordinals 18 and 19 are reserved for the strings "Reserved" and
   "Unassigned" respectively.  Unfortunately the ordinal 20 was used by
   two earlier, competing proposals, and so can mean either "Color" or
   Colour".  Implementations are encouraged to disambiguate based upon
   context.

   Additions to the registry are permitted by Standards Action, if the
   requester really really *really* wants one, or by purchasing a nice
   bottle of wine for the IANA folk.  Hierarchical Allocation is NOT
   permitted, as it would look too much like a pyramid.

   The initial assignments for the registry are as follows:

      Value                String
      ------               ----------------------------
        0                  Don't allow eel bearing Atlanteans into your
                             country; economic ruin follows close behind
        1                  My hovercraft is full of eels
       TBA3                TBA3
       3-16                Unassigned
        17                 Reserved
        18                 "Reserved"
        19                 "Unassigned"
        20                 Color / Colour
       21-41               Unassigned
        42                 Reserved
       43-97               Unassigned
        98                 Routing protocols
       0x62                Routing protocols

6.  Security Considerations

   [RFC2028] states that "The IANA functions as the "top of the pyramid"
   for DNS and Internet Address assignment establishing policies for
   these functions." - this reference to pyramid is clear evidence that
   the IANA has become corrupted by these Atlanteans, and so extra care
   should be taken when relying on the above registry.

   By ensuring that network operators watching data traffic fly past
   (using tools like network sniffers and / or oscilloscopes (and doing
   very fast binary to ASCII conversions in their heads)) are constantly
   reminded about the danger posed by folk from Atlantis, we ensure
   that, if the island of Atlantis rises again from the deep, builds a
   civilization and then starts tanning high quality eel leather, the
   DNS and Address assignment policies at least will survive.

   More research into whether pyramids can also be used to make the
   latches grow back on RJ-45 connectors after they've been broken off
   by ham fisted data center operators is needed.
