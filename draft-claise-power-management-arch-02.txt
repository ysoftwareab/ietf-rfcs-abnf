        TO DO 
              
             - Question for the Working Group: Should the WG consider 
               IPFIX in this architecture? 
              
             - Question for the Working Group: How to specify the notion 
               of child capabilities, i.e. the capabilities that the 
               Power Monitor Parents have with Power Monitor Children. 
               For Example: 
                  1. Monitoring (only reporting) 
                  2. Configuration power state  
                  3. Configuration: power  
              Example: on a PC, we can set power level without knowing 
              the power. A solution must be specified in this draft. 
      
             - Question for the Working Group: Should transition states 
               be tracked when setting a level. Example: The configured 
               level is set to Off from High.  The Actual level will 
               take time to update as the device powers down. Should 
               there be transitions shown or will the two variables 
               suffice to track the device state. 
                
             - Question for working group: Should implementation 
               scenarios be incorporated in the architecture draft 
           
             - We should have a similar section, for all the drafts, 
               which includes an overview of all EMAN documents. 
         
     1. Introduction 

        Network management is typically divided into the five main 
        network management areas defined in the ISO Telecommunications 
        Management Network model: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, 
        Performance, and Security Management.  Absent from this model is 
        any consideration of energy management, which is now becoming a 
        critical area of concern worldwide. 
         
        This document defines an architecture for power management for 
        devices within or connected to communication networks.  This 
        architecture includes monitoring for power state and energy 
        consumption of networked elements, covering the requirements 
        specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  It also goes a step further in 
        defining some elements of configuration.

     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        Energy management is applicable to devices in communication 
        networks.  Target devices for this specification include (but 
        are not limited to): routers, switches, Power over Ethernet 
        (PoE) endpoints, protocol gateways for building management 
        systems, intelligent meters, home energy gateway, hosts and 
        servers, sensor proxies, etc.   
         
        Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the individual 
        components of the device and to any attached dependent devices. 
        For example: A device can contain components that are 
        independent from a power-state point of view, such as line 
        cards, processor cards, hard drives. A device can also have 
        dependent attached devices, such as a switch with PoE endpoints 
        or a power distribution unit with attached endpoints.  
              
         
     2. Use Cases & Requirements 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  The requirements in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ] cover devices typically found in communications 
        networks, such as switches, routers, and various connected 
        endpoints.  For a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it  
        should also apply to facility meters, power distribution units, 
        gateway proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, this architecture, the scope is 
        broader than that specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  Several 
        scenarios that cover these broader use cases are presented later 
        in Section 11. - Implementation Scenarios. 
         
         
     3. Terminology 

        This section contains definitions of important terms used 
        throughout this specification. 
         
        IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in 
        section 2 of [RFC5101]. For example: Flow Record, Collector , 
        etc...  As in [RFC5101], these IPFIX-specific terms have the 
        first letter of a word capitalized. 
      
         
        Power Monitor 
         
        A Power Monitor is a component within a system of components 
        that provides power, draws power, or reports energy consumption 
        on behalf of another Power Monitor.  It can be independently 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011            [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        managed from a power-monitoring and power-state configuration 
        point of view.  Examples of Power Monitors are: a router line 
        card, a motherboard with a CPU, an IP phone connected with a 
        switch, etc. 
         
         
        Power Monitor Parent 
         
        A Power Monitor Parent is a Power Monitor that is the root of 
        one or more subtending Power Monitors, called Power Monitor 
        Children.  The Power Monitor Parent is able to collect data 
        about or report on the power state and energy consumption of its 
        Power Monitor Children.   
         
        For example: A Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device (such as an IP 
        phone or an access point) is attached to a switch port. The 
        switch is the source of power for the attached device, so the 
        Power Monitor Parent is the switch, and the Power Monitor Child 
        is the device attached to the switch.   
         
        The Power Monitor Parent may report data or implement actions on 
        behalf of the Power Monitor Child.  These capabilities must be 
        enumerated by the Power Monitor Parent. 
         
        The communication between the parent and child for monitoring or 
        collection of power data is left to the device manufacturer. For 
        example: A parent switch may use LLDP to communicate with a 
        connected child, and a parent lighting controller may use BACNET 
        to communicate with child lighting devices. 
         
         
        Power Monitor Child 
          
        A Power Monitor Child is a Power Monitor associated with a Power 
        Monitor Parent, and which reports its power usage and power 
        state to its Power Monitor Parent. The Power Monitor Child may 
        or may not draw power from its Power Monitor Parent. . 
         
         
        Power Monitor Meter Domain 
         
        A Power Monitor Meter Domain is a name or name space that 
        logically groups Power Monitors into a zone of manageable power 
        usage.  Typically, this zone will have as members all Power 
        Monitors that are powered from the same electrical panel or 
        panels for which there is a meter or sub meter.  For example: 
        All Power Monitors receiving power from the same distribution 
        panel of a building, or all Power Monitors in a building for 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011            [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        which there is one main meter, would comprise a Power Monitor 
        Meter Doman.  From the standpoint of power-use monitoring, it is 
        useful to report the total power usage as the sum of power 
        consumed by all the Power Monitors within a Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain and then correlate that value with the metered usage.  
         
         
        Power Level 
         
        A Power Level is a uniform way to classify power settings on a 
        Power Monitor (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, high).  Power 
        Levels can be viewed as an interface for the underlying device-
        implemented power settings.  
         
         
        Manufacturer Power Level 
         
        A Manufacturer Power Level is a device-specific way to classify 
        power settings implemented on a Power Monitor.  For cases where 
        the implemented power settings cannot be directly mapped to 
        Power Levels, we can use the Manufacturer Power Levels to 
        enumerate and show the relationship between the implemented 
        power settings and the Power Level interface.

                Figure 1: Energy Management Pull Reference Model 
         
        In this architecture a Network Management Station (NMS) will 
        poll MIB variables on a Power Monitors via SNMP.  The Power 
        Monitor returns information for itself and for any Power Monitor 
        Children if applicable.  The information returned will contain 
        business context, energy usage, power quality and other 
        information as described further.   
         
        The protocol between the Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor 
        Children is out of scope of this document.  The Power Monitor 
        Parent may speak to a Power Monitor Child using a manufacturer 
        selected protocol.  This protocol may or may not based on IP.  
        In this way, a Power Monitor Parent acts as a PROXY for protocol 
        translation between the Power Monitor Parent and Child.  The 
        Power Monitor Parent also acts as an aggregation point for other 
        subtended Power Monitor Children.

        The Power Monitor Parents may send SNMP notifications regarding 
        their own state or the state of their Power Monitor Children.  
        The Power Monitor Children do not send SNMP notifications on 
        their own. 
         
        As discussed in [POWER-MON-REQ], the Power Monitor Parents may 
        export IPFIX Flow Records [RFC5101] to a Collector.  The IPFIX 
        protocol is well suited for regular time series export of 
        similar information, such as the energy consumed by the Power 
        Monitor Children. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: at this point in time, there is no draft 
        specifying the IPFIX Flow Records. 
          
         
     5. Architecture High Level Concepts and Scope 

        The scope of this architecture is to enable networking and 
        network-attached devices to be managed with respect to their 
        energy consumption or production.  The goal is to make devices 
        energy-aware.  
         
        The architecture describes how to make a device aware of its 
        consumption or production of energy expressed as usage in watts. 
        This does not include: 
          
        - Manufacturing costs in currency or environmental units 
        - Embedded carbon or environmental equivalences of the device 
        itself 
        - Cost in currency or environmental impact to dismantle or 
        recycle the device 
        - Relationship to an electrical or smart grid 
        - Supply chain analysis

        - Conversion of the usage or production of energy to units 
        expressed from the source of that energy (such as the greenhouse 
        gas emissions associated with 1000kW from a diesel source). 
         
        The remainder of this section describes the basic concepts of 
        the architecture.  Each concept is examined in detail in 
        subsequent sections.  
         
        Examples are provided in a later section to show how these 
        concepts can be implemented.  
         
        The basic concepts are: 
         
        The Power Monitor will have basic naming and informational 
        descriptors to identify it in the network. 
         
        A Power Monitor can be part of a Power Monitor Meter Domain.  A 
        Power Monitor Meter Domain is a manageable set of devices that 
        has a meter or sub-meter attached and typically corresponds to a 
        power distribution point or panel.  
         
        A Power Monitor can be a parent (Power Monitor Parent) or child 
        (Power Monitor Child) of another Power Monitor.  This allows for 
        Power Monitor Parent to aggregate power reporting and control of 
        power information. 
         
        Each Power Monitor can have information to allow it to be 
        described in the context of the business or ultimate use.  This 
        is in addition to its networked information.  This allows for 
        tagging, grouping, and differentiation between Power Monitors 
        for NMS. 
         
        For control and universal monitoring, each Power Monitor 
        implements or declares a set of known Power Levels.  The Power 
        Levels are mapped to Manufacturer Power Levels that indicate the 
        specific power settings for the device implementing the Power 
        Monitor.  
         
        When the Power Level is set, a Power Monitor may be busy at the 
        request time.  The Power Monitor will set the desired level and 
        then update the actual Power Level when the priority task is 
        finished.  This mechanism implies two different Power Level 
        variables: actual versus desired.  
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: The transition state will have to be specified.

        Each Power Monitor will have usage information that describes 
        the power information along with how that usage was obtained or 
        derived. 
         
        Optionally, a Power Monitor can further describe the power 
        information with power quality information reflecting the 
        electrical characteristics of the measurement. 
         
        Optionally, a Power Monitor can provide power usage over time to 
        describe energy consumption 
         
        If a Power Monitor has one or more batteries, it can provide 
        optional battery information as well. 
      

     5.1. Power Monitor Information 

        Every Power Monitor should have a unique printable name, and 
        must have a unique Power Monitor index.  
         
        Possible naming conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor.  As an example, in the case of IP 
        phones, the Power Monitor name can be the device DNS name.  
      

     5.2. Power Monitor Meter Domain 

        Each Power Monitor must be a member of a Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain.  The Power Monitor Meter Domain should map 1-1 with a 
        metered or sub-metered portion of the site.  The Power Monitor 
        Meter Domain must be configured on the Power Monitor Parent.  
        The Power Monitor Children may inherit their domain values from 
        the Power Monitor Parent or the Power Monitor Meter Domain may 
        be configured directly in a Power Monitor Child. 
      

     5.3. Power Monitor Parent and Child 

         
        A Power Monitor Child reports its power usage to its Power 
        Monitor Parent.  A Power Monitor Child has one and only one 
        Power Monitor Parent.  If a Power Monitor had two parents there 
        would be a risk of double-reporting the power usage in the Power 
        Monitor Meter Domain. Therefore, a Power Monitor cannot be both 
        a Power Monitor Parent and a Power Monitor Child at the same 
        time.   
         
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        A Power Monitor Child can be fully dependent on the Power 
        Monitor Parent for its power or independent from the parent 
        (such as a PC connected to a switch).  In the dependently 
        powered case, the Power Monitor Parent provides power for the 
        Power Monitor Child (as in the case of Power Over Ethernet 
        devices).  In the independently powered case, the Power Monitor 
        Child draws power from another source (typically a wall outlet).  
        Since the Power Monitor Parent is not the source of power 
        supply, the power usage cannot be measured at the Power Monitor 
        Parent.  However, an independent Power Monitor Child reports 
        Power Monitor information to the Power Monitor Parent.  The 
        Power Monitor Child may listen to the power control settings 
        from a Power Monitor Parent and could react to the control 
        messages.  However, note that the communication between the 
        Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child is out of scope for 
        this document. 
         
        A mechanism, outside of the scope of this document, should be in 
        place to verify the connectivity between the Power Monitor 
        Parent and its Power Monitor Children.  If a Power Monitor Child 
        is unavailable, the Power Monitor Parent must follow some rules 
        to determine how long it should wait before removing the Power 
        Monitor Child entry, along with all associated statistics, from 
        its database.  In some situations, such as a connected building 
        in which the Power Monitor Children are somewhat static, this 
        removal-delay period may be long, and persistence across a Power 
        Monitor Parent reload may make sense.  However, in a networking 
        environment, where endpoints can come and go, there is not much 
        sense in configuring a long removal timer.  In all cases, the 
        removal timer or persistence must be clearly specified. 
         
        Further examples of Power Monitor Parent and Child 
        implementations are provided in the Implementation Scenarios 
        section 11.  
      

     5.4. Power Monitor Context 

        Monitored power data will ultimately be collected by and 
        reported from an NMS.  In order to aid in reporting and in 
        differentiation between Power Monitors, each Power Monitor will 
        contain information establishing its business or site context.  
        A Power Monitor can provide an importance value in the range of 
        1 to 100 to help differentiate a device's use or relative value 
        to the site.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) 
        to 100 (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 12] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        For example: A typical office environment has several types of 
        phones, which can be rated according to their business impact.  
        A public desk phone has a lower importance (for example, 10) 
        than a business-critical emergency phone (for example, 100).  As 
        another example: A company can consider that a PC and a phone 
        for a customer-service engineer is more important than a PC and 
        a phone for lobby use. 
          
        Although network managers must establish their own ranking, the 
        following is a broad recommendation: 
              
          . 90 to 100 Emergency response  
          . 80 to 90 Executive or business-critical  
          . 70 to 79 General or Average  
          . 60 to 69 Staff or support  
          . 40 to 59 Public or guest  
          . 1  to 39 Decorative or hospitality 
      
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of keywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains.  All 
        alphanumeric characters and symbols, such as #, (, $, !, and &, 
        are allowed.  Potential examples are: IT, lobby, HumanResources, 
        Accounting, StoreRoom, CustomerSpace, router, phone, floor2, or 
        SoftwareLab.  There is no default value for a keyword. 
         
        Multiple keywords can be assigned to a device.  In such cases, 
        the keywords are separated by commas and no spaces between 
        keywords are allowed.  For example, "HR,Bldg1,Private". 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a "role description" 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or for the site/business.  This could be a string 
        describing the context the device fulfills in deployment.  For 
        example, a lighting fixture in a kitchen area could have a role 
        of "Hospitality Lighting" to provide context for the use of the 
        device. 
         
         
     5.5. Power Monitor Levels 

        Power Levels represent universal states of power management of a 
        Power Monitor.  Each Power Level corresponds to a global, 
        system, and performance state in the ACPI model [ACPI].

                 12               G0, S0, P0       High 
         
                      Figure 3: ACPI / Power Level Mapping 
         
        For example, a Power Monitor with a Power Level of 9 would 
        indicate an operational state with MediumMinus Power Level. 
         
        The Power Levels can be considered as guidelines in order to 
        promote interoperability across device types.  Realistically, 
        each specific feature requiring Power Levels will require a 
        complete recommendation of its own.  For example, designing IP 
        phones with consistent Power Levels across vendors requires a 
        specification for IP phone design, along with the Power Levels 
        mapping. 
         
        Manufacturer Power Levels are required in some situations, such 
        as when no mappings with the existing Power Levels are possible, 
        or when more than the twelve specified Power Levels are 
        required.   
         
        A first example would be an imaginary device type, with only 
        five levels: "none", "short", "tall", "grande", and "venti".  
         
          Manufacturer Power Level     Respective Name 
               0                           none 
               1                           short 
               2                           tall 
               3                           grande 
               4                           venti

        In the unlikely event that there is no possible mapping between 
        these Manufacturer Power Levels and the proposed Power Monitor 
        Power Levels, the Power Level will remain 0 throughout the MIB 
        module, as displayed below.   
         
           Power Level / Name       Manufacturer Power Level / Name 
               0 / unknown              0 / none 
               0 / unknown              1 / short 
               0 / unknown              2 / tall 
               0 / unknown              3 / grande

        If a mapping between the Manufacturer Power Levels and the Power 
        Monitor Power Levels is achievable, both series of levels must 
        exist in the MIB module in the Power Monitor Parent, allowing 
        the NMS to understand the mapping between them by correlating 
        the Power Level with the Manufacturer Power Levels.

               5 / Standby              0 / none 
               6 / Ready                1 / short 
               7 / LowMinus             1 / short 
               8 / Low                  1 / short 
               9 / MediumMinus          2 / tall 
               10 / Medium              2 / tall 
               11 / HighMinus           3 / grande

                          Figure 6: Mapping Example 3 
                
      
        How the Power Monitor Levels are then mapped is an 
        implementation choice.  However, it is recommended that the 
        Manufacturer Power Levels map to the lowest applicable Power 
        Levels, so that setting all Power Monitors to a Power Level 
        would be conservative in terms of disabled functionality on the 
        Power Monitor. 
         
        A second example would be a device type, such as a dimmer or a 
        motor, with a high number of operational levels.  For the sake 
        of the example, 100 operational states are assumed.

        As specified in section 6, this architecture allows the 
        configuration of the Power Level, while configuring the 
        Manufacturer Power Level from the MIB directly is not possible. 
      
         
     5.6. Power Monitor Usage Measurement 

        The usage or production or power must be qualified as more than 
        a value alone.  A measurement should be qualified with the 
        units, magnitude, direction of power flow, and by what means the 
        measurement was made (ex: Root Mean Square versus Nameplate) . 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 16] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        In addition, the Power Monitor should describe how it intends to 
        measure usage as one of consumer, producer or meter of usage.  
        Given the intent any readings can be correctly summarized or 
        analyzed by an NMS.  For example metered usage reported by a 
        meter and consumption usage reported by a device connected to 
        that meter may naturally measure the same usage.  With the two 
        measurements identified by intent a proper summarization can be 
        made by an NMS. 
      
        The power usage measurement should conform to the IEC 61850 
        definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System International) 
        units of measure.  The power usage measurement is considered an 
        instantaneous usage value and does not include the usage over 
        time.   
         
        Measured values are represented in SI units obtained by 
        BaseValue * 10 raised to the power of the scale.  For example, 
        if current power usage of a Power Monitor is 3, it could be 3 W, 
        3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of the scaling 
        factor  
                                         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
        know how a Power Monitor usage measurement was obtained:  
          . Whether the measurements were made at the device itself or 
             from a remote source. 
          . Description of the method that was used to measure the 
             power and whether this method can distinguish actual or 
             estimated values.  
              
        An NMS can use this information to account for the accuracy and 
        nature of the reading between different implementations.   
         
        In addition to the power usage, the nameplate power rating of a 
        Power Monitor is typically specified by the vendor as the 
        capacity required to power the device.  Often this label is a 
        conservative number and is the worst-case power draw.  While the 
        actual utilization of an entity can be lower, the nameplate 
        power is important for provisioning, capacity planning and 
        billing.   
      

     5.7. Optional Power Usage Quality 

        Given a power measurement of a Power Monitor, it may in certain 
        circumstances be desirable to know the power quality associated 
        with that measurement.  The information model must adhere to the 
        IEC 61850 7-2 standard for describing AC measurements.  In some 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 17] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        Power Monitor Domains, the power quality may not be needed, 
        available, or relevant to the Power Monitor.   
      

     5.8. Optional Energy Measurement 

        In addition to reporting the Power Level, an approach to 
        characterizing the energy demand is required.  It is well known 
        in commercial electrical utility rates that demand charges can 
        be on par with actual power charges, so it is useful to 
        characterize the demand.  The demand can be described as the 
        average energy of an Power Monitor over a time window called a 
        demand interval (typically 15 minutes).  The highest peak energy 
        demand measured over a time horizon, such as 1 month or 1 year, 
        is often the basis for usage charges.  A single window of time 
        of high usage can penalize the consumer with higher energy 
        consumption charges.  However, it is relevant to measure the 
        demand only when there are actual power measurements from a 
        Power Monitor, and not when the power measurement is assumed or 
        predicted.    
         
        Several efficiency metrics can be derived and tracked with the 
        demand usage data. For example:   
         
          . Per-packet power costs for a networking device (router or 
             switch) can be calculated by an NMS.  The packet count can 
             be determined from the traffic usage in the ifTable 
             [RFC2863], from the forwarding plane figure, or from the 
             platform specifications. 
              
          . Watt-hour power can be combined with utility energy sources 
             to estimate carbon footprint and other emission statistics. 
      

     5.9. Optional Battery Information 

        Some Power Monitors may be running on batteries.  Therefore 
        information such as the battery status (charging or 
        discharging), remaining capacity, and so on, must be available. 
      

     6. Power Monitor Children Discovery 

        There are multiple ways that the Power Monitor Parent can 
        discover its Power Monitor Children, if they are not present on 
        the same physical network element: 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
          . In case of PoE, the Power Monitor Parent automatically 
             discovers a Power Monitor Child when the Child requests 
             power. 
          . The Power Monitor Parent and Children may run the Link 
             Layer Discovery Protocol [LLDP], or any other discovery 
             protocol, such as Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP).  The 
             Power Monitor Parent might even support the LLDP-MED MIB 
             [LLDP-MED-MIB], which returns extra information on the 
             Power Monitor Children.  
          . The Power Monitor Parent may reside on a network connected 
             facilities gateway.  A typical example is a converged 
             building gateway, monitoring several other devices in the 
             building, and serving as a proxy between SNMP and a 
             protocol such as BACNET.  
              
        When a Power Monitor Child supports only its own Manufacturer 
        Power Levels, the Power Monitor Parent will have to discover 
        those Manufacturer Power Levels.  Note that the communication 
        specifications between the Power Monitor Parent and Children is 
        out of the scope of this document.  This includes the 
        Manufacturer Power Levels discovery, which is protocol-specific. 
      
         
     7. Configuration 

        This power management architecture allows the configuration of 
        the following key parameters: 
         
          . Power Monitor name: A unique printable name for the Power 
             Monitor.  
          . Power Monitor Role: An administratively assigned name to 
             indicate the purpose a Power Monitor serves in the network.  
          . Power Monitor Importance: A ranking of how important the 
             Power Monitor is, on a scale of 1 to 100, compared with 
             other Power Monitors in the same Power Monitor Meter 
             Domain.  
          . Power Monitor Keywords: A list of keywords that can be used 
             to group Power Monitors for reporting or searching. 
          . Power Monitor Domain: Specifies the name of a Power Monitor 
             Meter Domain for the Power Monitor. 
          . The Power Monitor Level: Specifies the current Power Level 
             (0..12) for the Power Monitor.  
          . The energy demand parameters: For example, which interval 
             length to report the energy on, the number of intervals to 
             keep, etc. 
         
        When a Power Monitor requires a mapping with the Manufacturer 
        Power Level, the Power Monitor configuration is done via the 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 19] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
        Power Level settings, and not directly via the Manufacturer 
        Power Levels, which are read-only.  Taking into account Figure 
        8, where the LowMinus Power Level corresponds to three different 
        Manufacturer Power Levels (11 for 1%, 12 for 2%, and 13 for 3%), 
        the implication is that this architecture will not set the 
        Manufacturer Power Level to one percent granularity without 
        communicating over or configuring the proprietary protocol for 
        this Power Monitor.  
         
        This architecture uses a Power Level MIB object to set up the 
        Power Level for a specific Power Monitor.  However, the Power 
        Monitor might be busy executing an important task that requires 
        the current Power Level for some more time.  For example, a PC 
        might have to finish a backup first, or an IP phone might be 
        busy with a current phone call.  Therefore a second MIB object 
        contains the actual Power Level.  A difference in values between 
        the two objects indicates that the Power Monitor is currently in 
        Power Level transition.  
         
        Interactions with established open protocols, such as Wake-up-
        on-Lan (WoL) and DASH [DASH], may require configuration in the 
        Power Monitor as well, facilitating the communication between 
        Power Monitor Parent and remote Power Monitor Children. 
         
        Note that the communication specifications between the Power 
        Monitor Parent and Children is out of the scope of this 
        document.  This includes communication of power settings and 
        configuration information, such as the Power Monitor Domain. 
         
         
     8. Fault Management 

        [POWER-MON-REQ] specifies some requirements about power states 
        such as "the current state - the time of the last change", "the 
        total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions to 
        each state", etc.  Such requirements are fulfilled via the 
        pmPowerLevelChange NOTIFICATION-TYPE [POWER-MON-MIB].  This SNMP 
        notification is generated when the value(s) of Power Level has 
        changed for the Power Monitor.   
         
         
     9. IPFIX 

         
        A push-based mechanism, such as IPFIX [RFC5101], might be 
        required to export high-volume time series of energy consumption 
        values, as mentioned in [POWER-MON-REQ].

     10. Relationship with Other Standards Development Organizations 

     10.1. Information Modeling  

        This power management architecture should, as much as possible, 
        reuse existing standards efforts, especially with respect to 
        information modeling and data modeling [RFC3444].  
         
        The data model for power, energy related objects is based on IEC 
        61850.   
         
        Specific examples include: 
         
          . The scaling factor, which represents Power Monitor usage 
             magnitude, conforms to the IEC 61850 definition of unit 
             multiplier for the SI (System International) units of 
             measure.  
         
          . The power accuracy model is based on the ANSI and IEC 
             Standards, which require that we use an accuracy class for 
             power measurement.  ANSI and IEC define the following 
             accuracy classes for power measurement:  
           
             . IEC 62053-22  60044-1 class 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1  3.    
             
             . ANSI C12.20 class 0.2, 0.5 
           
          . The powerQualityMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 
             61850 7-2 standard for describing AC measurements.   
         
      
     10.2. Power Levels 

        There are twelve Power Monitor Levels.  They are subdivided into 
        six operational states, and six non-operational states.  The 
        lowest non-operational state is 1 and the highest is six.  Each 
        non-operational state corresponds to an ACPI level [ACPI].

     11. Implementation Scenarios 

        The scope of power and energy monitoring consists of devices 
        that consume power within and that are connected to a 
        communications network.  These devices include: 
         
        - Network devices and sub-components: Devices such as routers 
        and switches and their sub-components. 
         
        - Network attached endpoints: Devices that use the 
        communications network, such as endpoints, PCs, and facility 
        gateways that proxy energy monitor and control for commercial 
        buildings or home automation.  
         
        - Network attached meters or supplies: Devices that can monitor 
          the electrical supply, such as smart meters or Universal 
          Power Supplies (UPS) that meter and provide availability. 
        -   
        This section provides illustrative examples that model different 
        scenarios for implementation of the Power Monitor, including 
        Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child relationships. 
         
        Each of the scenarios below is explained in more detail in the 
        Power Monitor MIB document [POWER-MON-MIB], with a mapping to 
        the MIB Objects. 
         

     Scenario 1: Switch with PoE endpoints  

        Consider a PoE IP phone connected to a switch.  The IP phone 
        draws power from the PoE switch.   
      

     Scenario 2: Switch with PoE endpoints with further connected 
        device(s)  

        Consider the same example as in Scenario 1, but with a PC daisy-
        chained from the IP phone for LAN connectivity.  The phone draws 
        power from the PoE port of the switch, while the PC draws power 
        from the wall outlet.  
      

     Scenario 3: A switch with Wireless Access Points 

        Consider a WAP (Wireless Access Point) connected to the PoE port 
        of a switch.  There are several PCs connected to the Wireless 
        Access Point over Wireless protocols.  All PCs draw power from 
        the wall outlets.  
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 20, 2011           [Page 22] 
         
     Internet-Draft    <Power Management Archictecure>   Octobre 2010 
      
         
        The switch port is the Power Monitor Parent for the Wireless 
        Access Point (WAP) and all the PCs. But there is a distinction 
        among the Power Monitor Children, as the WAP draws power from 
        the PoE port of the switch and the PCs draw power from the wall 
        outlet.  
         

     Scenario 4: Network connected facilities gateway 

        At the top of the network hierarchy of a building network is a 
        gateway device that can perform protocol conversion between many 
        facility management devices, such as BACNET, MODBUS, DALI, LON,  
        etc.  There are power meters associated with power-consuming 
        entities (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning - HVAC, 
        lighting, electrical, fire control, elevators, etc).  The 
        proposed MIB can be implemented on the gateway device.  The 
        gateway can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent, while the 
        power meters associated with the energy consuming entities can 
        be considered as its Power Monitor Children.   
      

     Scenario 5: Data center network 

        A typical data center network consists of a hierarchy of 
        switches.  At the bottom of the hierarchy there are servers 
        mounted on a rack, and these are connected to the top-of-the-
        rack switches.  The top switches are connected to aggregation 
        switches that are in turn connected to core switches.  As an 
        example, Server 1 and Server 2 are connected to different switch 
        ports of the top switch.  
         
        The proposed MIB can be implemented on the switches.  The switch 
        can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent.  The servers can 
        be considered as the Power Monitor Children.  
         
     Scenario 6: Building gateway device 

        Similar scenario as the scenario 4.  
         
         
     Scenario 7: Power consumption of UPS 

        Data centers and commercial buildings can have Uninterruptible 
        Power Supplies (UPS) connected to the network. The Power Monitor 
        can be used to model a UPS as a Power Monitor Parent with the 
        connected devices as Power Monitor Children.

     12. Security Considerations 

        Regarding the data attributes specified here, some or all may be 
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. 
        Reading or writing these attributes without proper protection 
        such as encryption or access authorization may have negative 
        effects on the network capabilities. 
         
         
     12.1. Security Considerations for SNMP 

        Readable objects in a MIB modules (i.e., objects with a MAX-
        ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
        vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
        to control GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
        possibly to encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
        them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment 
        without proper protection can have a negative effect on network 
        operations.  For example: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the Power Domain or business 
             context of a Power Monitor may result in misreporting or 
             interruption of power. 
          . Unauthorized changes to a power level may disrupt the power 
             settings of the different Power Monitors, and therefore the 
             level of functionality of the respective Power Monitors. 
          . Unauthorized changes to the demand history may disrupt 
             proper accounting of energy usage.  
      
        With respect to data transport SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did 
        not include adequate security.  Even if the network itself is 
        secure (for example, by using IPsec), there is still no secure 
        control over who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
        GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB 
        modules. 
         
        It is recommended that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not 
        recommended.  Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
