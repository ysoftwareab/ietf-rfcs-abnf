Abstract

   Public safety agencies need to provide information to the general
   public before and during large-scale emergencies.  While many aspects
   of such systems are specific to national or local jurisdictions,
   emergencies span such boundaries and notifications need to reach
   visitors from other jurisdictions.  This document summarizes
   requirements for protocols to alert individuals within a defined
   geographic area.

Internet-Draft         Early Warning Communication            March 2009


1.  Introduction

   During large-scale emergencies, public safety authorities need to
   reliably communicate with citizens in the affected areas, to provide
   warnings, indicate whether citizens should evacuate and how, and to
   dispel misinformation.  Accurate information can reduce the impact of
   such emergencies.

   Traditionally, emergency alerting has used church bells, sirens,
   loudspeakers, radio and television to warn citizens and to provide
   information.  However, techniques such as sirens and bells provide
   limited information content; loud speakers cover only very small
   areas and are often hard to understand, even for those not hearing
   impaired or fluent in the local language.  Radio and television offer
   larger information volume, but are hard to target geographically and
   do not work well to address the "walking wounded" or other
   pedestrians.  Both are not suitable for warnings, as many of those
   needing the information will not be listening or watching at any
   given time, particularly during work/school and sleep hours.

   This problem has recently been illustrated by the London underground
   bombing on July 7, 2006, as described in a government report [ref].
   The UK authorities could only use broadcast media and could not, for
   example, easily announce to the "walking wounded" where to assemble.

   This document summarizes key requirements for IP-based protocols to
   enhance and complement existing authority-to-citizen warning systems.
   These protocols may either directly reach the citizen or may be used
   to trigger more traditional alerts, such as, among many others,
   displays in subway stations, electronic bill boards, or SMS.

   Public safety authorities need to reach, with an appropriate message,
   as many affected people as possible within the area impacted by the
   emergency, including not just residents, but also workers and
   travelers who may only be in the area temporarily.

   In addition, people around the immediately affected area should be
   able to receive information and differentiated instructions, such as
   warnings to avoid travel or to clear roads.

   Emergency alerts may be issued once for an emergency or authorities
   may repeat or update information during an event.

   Some messages are addressed to all individuals within a certain
   geographic area.  Other messages may target only specific individuals
   or groups of individuals, such as medical personnel or those
   particularly susceptible to an incident.

   Machine-parseable alerts may also be used to trigger automated
   behaviors, such as closing vents during a chemical spill or
   activating sirens or other warning systems in commercial buildings.

   At least initially, mobile and stationary devices may not have the
   appropriate capabilities to receive such warnings.  Thus, protocols
   need to be designed to allow gatewaying to traditional systems, e.g.,
   the PSTN.

   We assume an event notification model, i.e., individuals subscribe to
   warnings that affect their current location.  As a mobile device
   moves, the subscription may need to be updated.  Thus, location
   information needs to be available during the subscription process.

   Users may want to subscribe to warnings that do not affect their
   current location.  For example, parents may want to be alerted of
   emergencies affecting the school attended by their children and adult
   children may need to know about emergencies affecting elderly
   parents.

   Some technologies may also support network-level broadcast or
   multicast.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119], with the
   important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these terms
   apply to the design of a protocol conveying emergency alerts and
   early warning messages, not its implementation or application.

   This document reuses the terminology introduced by [3GPP-TR-22.968]
   and modifies it to fit to IETF terminology:

   Notification Population:

      The term notification population refers to the set of warning
      notification consumers that receive a warning notification.

   Public Warning System:

      A public warning system delivers warning notifications provided by
      warning notification providers to IP-capable end hosts within
      notification areas.

Internet-Draft         Early Warning Communication            March 2009


   Warning Notification:

      Warning notifications inform recipients of the occurrence of
      current or pending public safety-related events and additionally
      may provide users with instructions on what to do and where to get
      help for the duration of the emergency.

   Warning Notification Provider:

      A warning notification provider is an agency that injects warning
      notifications in the communication system.  Examples of such
      agencies are branches of governments, public transport providers
      or weather organizations.  A private institution, such as a
      university, hospital or enterprise, may also provide such warnings
      to people located within their facilities.

   Warning Notification Consumer:  A warning notification consumer is
      the final recipient of a warning notification from an IP
      communication point of view.  Examples are Web browsers and SIP
      clients on mobile phones and laptops that process warning
      notification messages.  Once received such a warning is shown to
      the user (a human) via an appropriately designed user interface to
      ensure that it is properly understood.

   Warning Notification Aggregator:

      A warning notification aggregator receives alert notifications
      from different providers, performs security functions (e.g.,
      authentication, authorization) and may need to transform message
      into a different format before forwarding them towards warning
      notification consumers.


3.  Architectures

   The following sub-sections illustrate different architectural
   approaches.

3.1.  Closed Warning Notification Provider and Aggregator Groups

   The first architectural variant allows the distribution of warning
   notifications from warning notification providers to warning
   notification aggregators.  The communication is largely in a point-
   to-point fashion and the number of involved players is rather small,
   particularly on the side of the warning notification providers.
   Furthermore, a new warning notification aggregator is allowed to
   receive warning notifications only after certain verification
   procedures are conducted and thereby the entire communication

Internet-Draft         Early Warning Communication            March 2009


   infrastructure re-essembles a closed group.  To ensure that the
   content of the warning notifications is properly understood the
   involved parties are very likely to agree on the detailed semantics
   of the warning messages prior to distributing any alert.

   Figure 1 shows the involved parties graphically.

    |                          //            |

   Figure 1: Closed Warning Notification Provider and Aggregator Groups

   An example of this system can be seen in national early warning
   systems where regulatory requirements force warning notification
   provider and aggregators to work together.

3.2.  Open Communication between Warning Notification Provider and
      Aggregator

   This model is similar to the closed group presented in the previous
   section with a difference in the way how warning notification
   aggregators can retrieve warning notifications from warning



Norreys, et al.         Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 6]

   notification providers.  When the aggregator interacts with the
   provider then no special client-side authentication procedure is
   assumed and no access restrictions are enforced.  As such, the
   aggregator might be located anywhere on the Internet to retrieve the
   warning notifications.  Warning notification aggregators might offer
   their subscribers the ability to receive warnings of a certain type
   (e.g., weather alerts) for a specific region (e.g., for a specific
   country or an entire continent).  Hence, the aggregator might find
   the relevant warning notification providers and interacts with them
   to retrieve alerts.  Finally, the aggregator might use different
   protocol mechanisms (e.g., SMS, Web pages) towards the warning
   notification customers, often depending on the client capabilities.
   In general, the number of aggregators is very likely larger than in a
   closed group but there are no significant challenges with respect to
   scalability or congestion to expect.

   Figure 2 shows the involved parties graphically.

3.3.  Open Communication towards Warning Notification Customers

   In the following architectural variant the customers directly
   interact with various warning notification providers that a relevant
   for a specific type of alert type.  In order to learn about the
   relevant warning notification providers it may be necessary to
   consult some form of discovery service; this may be done out-of-band
   via manual configuration or via a protocol mechanism.

   Scalability and congestion control concerns arise with this scenario
   as this model assumes an opt-in approach from the customer.  The
   total number of warning notification customers are provider has to
   serve may be considerable.  There are a more security challenges
   since there are no pre-established trust relationships between the
   warning notification customers and the providers.

         Open Communication towards Warning Notification Customers

3.4.  Notification Population

   What warning notification customers are put into the notification
   population is an important architectural aspect that is largely
   orthongonal to the architecture presented in Section 3.1 and
   Section 3.2.

   In an opt-in model the the warning notification customer need to
   provide information about what type of alerts it is interested in
   and, in order for the warning notification aggregator or the warning
   notification provider to be able to distribute warnings it is
   necessary for them to know the context, such as the current location,
   preferred language or device capabilities.  This information may be
   provided by the customer itself or by other entities, such as the
   access provider.

   Alternatively, the topological structure of networks is used to
   distribute warning notifications to all hosts that are located within
   a specific IP-subsetwork or hosts in a specific link layer broadcast
   domain.  This approach typically requires co-operation from the
   network provider.


4.  Requirements

   The following requirements are related to the communication protocol
   and the context.

   Req-1:

      The protocol mechanisms MUST allow targeting notifications to
      specific individuals, groups of individuals or specific geographic
      regions.  Different regions or groups may receive different
      instructions for the same disaster.  (For example, people very
      close to a chemical spill may be asked to evacuate, while those
      further away may be asked to close windows.)

   Req-2:

      The protocol solution MUST provide real-time message delivery.

   Req-3:

      The solution MUST support the delivery of warning notifications
      that allow for predictable or likely events.

Internet-Draft         Early Warning Communication            March 2009


   Req-4

      The protocol mechanisms MUST allow delivery of messages
      simultaneously to a large audience.

   Req-5

      The protocol mechanisms MAY provide an option to return a receipt
      on reading message.  However, the confirmation SHOULD NOT be
      required.

   Req-6:

      The protocol mechanism MUST be independent of the underlying
      access network technology.

   Req-7:

      Protocol mechanisms MUST allow to tailor the message to the
      language preferences of the receiver and/or deliver multiple
      versions in different languages within the same message, so that
      the recipient can choose the most appropriate one.

   Req-8:

      A user SHOULD be able to indicate the preferred method of

      by email, different instant messaging protocols or automated voice
      calls.

   Req-9:

      The protocol conveying warning notifications SHOULD identify the
      warning notification provider in a secure manner.

   Req-10:

      The solution MUST provide a mechanism for transmitting warning
      notification test messages.

   Req-11:

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.


6.  Security considerations

   This document outlines requirements and security security
   requirements are a part of them.


7.  Acknowledgments

   This document reuses requirements captured outside the IETF, namely
   ETSI (with [ETSI-TS-102-182]), and the 3GPP (with [3GPP-TR-22.968]).
   We would like to thank the authors of these specifications for their
   work.  Note, however, that only a small subset of the requirements
   have been reflected that do not relate to specific deployments, user
   interface aspects, detailed regulatory requirements, management and
   operational considerations, and non-IP specific technologies.

   We would like to thank Leopold Murhammer for his review in July 2007.
