Abstract

   This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning
   Tree capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t and P802.1w amendments to
   IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN)
   segments.  The objects in this MIB are defined to apply both to
   transparent bridging and to bridges connected by subnetworks other
   than LAN segments.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

   This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning
   Tree (RSTP) capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t [802.1t] and
   P802.1w [802.1w] amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 [802.1D-1998] for
   bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.  The objects in
   this MIB are defined to apply both to transparent bridging and to
   bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.


3.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1t and 802.1w amendments

   This document defines managed object for the Rapid Spanning Tree
   Protocol defined by the IEEE P802.1t and IEEE P802.1w amendments to
   802.1d-1998.

4.  Relation to the BRIDGE-MIB

   The Original BRIDGE-MIB [RFC1493] has been updated in an
   SMIv2-compliant version [RFC1493bis]. Conformance statements have
   been added and some description and reference clauses have been
   updated. The interpretations of some objects were changed to
   accommodate IEEE 802.1t and 802.1w amendments.

   The object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 was added to support IEEE 802.1t,
   and the permissible values of dot1dStpPriority and
   dot1dStpPortPriority have been clarified for bridges supporting IEEE
   802.1t or IEEE 802.1w. The interpretation of
   dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange has been clarified for bridges
   supporting the RSTP.

   See the updated BRIDGE-MIB [RFC1493bis] for details.

   The objects in the RSTP-MIB supplement those defined in the Bridge
   MIB [RFC1493bis].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires an OID assignment to be made by IANA:

            Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
            ----------        -----------------------
            rstpMIB           { mib-2 xxxx }



8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Writable objects that could be misused to cause network delays and
   spanning tree instabilities include dot1dStpVersion,
   dot1dStpTxHoldCount, dot1dStpPortProtocolMigration,
   dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort, and dot1dStpPortAdminPathCost.

   dot1dStpVersion could be read by an attacker to identify environments
   containing applications or protocols which are potentially sensitive
   to RSTP mode.

   dot1dStpPortAdminPointToPoint could be used to mislead an access
   control protocol, such as 802.1x, to believe that only one other
   system is attached to a LAN segment and to enable network access
   based on that assumption.  This situation could permit potential man-
   in-the-middle attacks.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy), and user-based access control.
