Internet-Draft         Geopriv Policy Capabilities          October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Authorization policies are an important component of presence
   [RFC2778].  They allow the presentity to grant access to specific
   pieces of information to watchers.  Authorization policies have been
   designed to be extensible.  For this reason [I-D.ietf-simple-common-
   policy-caps] defines a generic Extensible Markup Language (XML) based
   format for representing policy capabilities.  That format applies to
   many policy types, including location and presence.  This
   specification extends that one by defining policy capabilities
   specific to geographic location information.  Those policy
   capabilities correspond to the conditions, actions and
   transformations defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Structure of Geopriv Policy Capabilities

   The structure of common policy capability documents is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-simple-common-policy-caps].  In that specification, each
   policy capability document has three components - a list of supported
   conditions, a list of supported actions, and a list of supported
   transformations.  This specification merely extends that document
   with the conditions, actions and transformations defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].  It does so by defining the following
   empty elements:

      civic-loc-condition
      geospatial-loc-condition
      distribution-transformation
      retention-tranformation
      keep-rules-transformation
      civic-loc-transformation
      geospatial-loc-transformation

   Each of these elements indicates whether the respective attribute in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy] is supported.  All of these elements are
   defined within the namespace:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv-policy-capabilities

5.  Example Document

   The following document indicates that the identity and validity
   conditions are supported, each of which is defined in [I-D.ietf-
   geopriv-common-policy], while no support of sphere conditions is
   indicated.  Furthermore, the example indicates that the geolocation-
   specific condition named civic-loc-condition is supported.  With
   respect to transformations, the example gives the indication that the
   geolocation-specific transformations named keep-rules-transformation
   is supported.  This is also the case for geospatial-loc-
   transformations, namely, for latitude and longitude values, but not
   for altitude values:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <policy-capabilities
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:policy-capabilities"
      xmlns:gpc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv-policy-capabilities"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

      <conditions>
         <identity/>
         <validity/>
         <gpc:civic-loc-condition/>
      </conditions>

      <actions>
      </actions>

      <transformations>
        <gpc:keep-rules-transformation/>
        <gpc:geospatial-loc-transformation>
           <gpc:lat-resolution/>
           <gpc:lon-resolution/>
        </gpc:geospatial-loc-transformation>
      </transformations>

   </policy-capabilities>
