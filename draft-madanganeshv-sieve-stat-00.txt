Abstract
        
    This draft describes a mechanism of collecting the statistical
    information about sieve action on the received mail. It 
    introduces GETSTAT and RESETSTAT commands to [MSIEVE] to get and 
    reset the statistic information about the sieve actions.

1.  Introduction

    Currently manage sieve [MSIEVE] does not have a mechanism by which 
    an user can know how many mails are rejected, discarded or a 
    particular action performed. This draft describes a machanism of 
    collecting the action counters and a way of getting and clearing 
    the statistics.

2.  Conventions Used in this Document
    
    The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"
    [KEYWORDS].

    In protocol examples, "C:" designates lines sent by the client,
    while "S:" show lines sent by the server.  In such examples, line
    breaks are for editorial clarity only. 
    
3.  Requirement

    The requirement is to allow an user to get the statistical         
    information about sieve's action on their mails.

4.  Updation of action counters

    Sieve [SIEVE] implementation SHOULD maintain a counter for each of 
    the supported action for each user. When a particular action is 
    completed successfully on the received mail, sieve [SIEVE] 
    implementation MUST increment the corresponding action counter. When 
    updating the the action counters, sieve [SIEVE] implementaion MUST 
    make sure that the existing action counters are in consistent state. 

    Action counters for sieve [SIEVE] actions reject, redirect and 
    discard MUST be supported by the sieve [MSIEVE] implementation which 
    support GETSTAT and RESETSTAT commands.
                
5.  CAPABILITY Identification
        
    Manage Sieve [MSIEVE] implementation that support these commands 
    MUST include GETSTAT and RESETSTAT response in the response list to 
    the CAPABILITY command. This entry indicates that the manage sieve
    [MSIEVE] implementation supports these commands. 
    
    S: "GETSTAT RESETSTAT"

6.  GETSTAT Command
        
    The GETSTAT command retrieves the supported action counters for the
    particular user. This command MUST be given after the client is 
    authenticated.
    
    Example: 
    
    C: GETSTAT
    S: "discard" 5
    S: "divert" 2
    S: "reject" 8
    S:  OK

    Server implementations MAY provide zero valued action counters.

7.  RESETSTAT Command

    The RESETSTAT command initializes the supported action counters to
    zero. RESETSTAT implementation MUST make sure this operation is
    atomic. That is, server should initialize all the counters or none.
    This command MUST be given after the client is authenticated.

    C: RESETSTAT
    S: OK
      
8. Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (BNF) notation as specified in [ABNF]. This uses the ABNF core
    rules as specified in Appendix A of the ABNF specification [ABNF].

    command-getstat       = "GETSTAT" CRLF

    command-resetstat     = "RESETSTAT" CRLF
    
9. Security Considerations

    The sieve action counters should be kept per user. In order to 
    protect one user's information, it should have proper access 
    control lists such that other users will NOT have access to it.

9. Future works

    To write MIB definitions for Sieve actions and scripts.
