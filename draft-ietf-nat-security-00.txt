Abstract

   There are a variety of NAT flavors, as described in [Ref 1]. Of the
   domains supported by NATs, only Host-NAT-clients are allowed to 
   pursue end-to-end IPsec secure sessions. However, all flavors of NAT 
   can offer tunnel-mode IPsec security to private domain hosts peering 
   with nodes in external realm. This document describes a security 
   model by which tunnel mode IPsec security can be recognized on NAT 
   devices. In addition, a section is devoted to describing how Secure 
   policies may be communicated to IKE for automated KEY exchange and 
   setup of Security Associations for an IPsec secure NAT gateway. 


1. Introduction and Overview

   NATs provide transparent routing to end hosts trying to communicate 
   from disparate routing realms, by modifying IP and transport headers

   en-route. This solution works best when the end user identifier 
   (such as host name) is different from the address used to locate 
   end user. 
   
   End-to-end transport level payload security can be provided for 
   applications that do not embed realm-specific information that is 
   meaningless to one of the end-users. Applications that do embed 
   realm-specific information will require an application level 
   gateway (ALG) to make the payload meaningful in both realms. 
   However, applications that require assistance of an ALG en-route 
   cannot pursue end-to-end transport level security.
   
   All applications traversing a NAT device, irrespective of whether 
   they require assistance of an ALG or not, can benefit from IPsec 
   tunnel-mode security, when NAT device acts as the IPsec tunnel 
   end point. 

   Section 2 below defines terms specific to this document.

   Section 3 describes how tunnel mode IPsec security can be 
   recognized on NAT devices. IPsec Security architecture, format and 
   operation of various types of security mechanisms may be found in 
   [Ref 2], [Ref 3] and [Ref 4].  This section does not address how 
   session keys and policies are exchanged between a NAT device acting
   as IPsec gateway and external peering nodes. The exchange could 
   have taken place manually or using any of known automatic exchange 
   techniques. 
   
   Section 4 assumes that Public Key based IKE protocol [Ref 5] may 
   be used to automate exchange of secure policies, session keys 
   and other Security Association (SA) attributes. This section 
   describes a method by which secure policies administered for 
   private domain may be translated for communicating with external 
   nodes. Detailed description of IKE protocol operation may be 
   found in [Ref 5] and [Ref 6]. 

   Section 5 describes applications of the security model described 
   in the document. Applications listed include secure extternal 
   realm connectivity for private domain hosts and secure remote 
   access to enterprise mobile hosts.


2. Terminology

   Definitions for majority of terms used in this document may be 
   found in one of (a) NAT Terminology and Considerations document 
   [Ref 1], (b) IP security Architecture document [Ref 2], or 
   (c) Internet Key Enchange (IKE) document [Ref 5]. Below are

   terms defined specifically for this document.

2.1. Clear-NAT

   The term "Clear-NAT" is introduced to distinguish NAT processing on 
   the outer packet header from that of NAT processing used for secure 
   packets embedded within an IPsec secure tunnel, for which the NAT 
   device is a tunnel end point.

2.2. Secure-NAT

   For lack of a better alternative, the term "Secure-NAT" is defined to
   describe the manifestation of NAT applied to packets embedded 
   within an IPsec secure IP tunnel, for which the NAT node is a tunnel 
   end point. A Secure-NAT device is essentially a tunnel-mode IPsec 
   gateway with NAT extensions applied to embedded packets. 
   
   Packets subject to secure-NAT processing are beneficiaries of IPsec 
   security between the NAT device and an external peer entity, be it a 
   host or a gateway node. 
   
   Just as with Clear-NAT, Secure-NAT can assume any of NAT flavors,
   including traditional NAT, bi-directional NAT and Twice NAT.


3.0. Secure NAT operation

   The IP security architecture document [Ref 2] describes how IP
   network level security may be accomplished within a routing realm. 
   Transport and tunnel mode security are discussed. For purposes 
   of this document, we will assume IPsec security to mean tunnel 
   mode IPsec security, unless specified otherwise. Elements 
   fundamental to this security architecture are (a) Secure 
   Policies, that determine which packets are permitted to be 
   subject to Security processing, and (b) Security Association 
   Attributes that identify the parameters for security processing, 
   including IPsec protocols, algorithms and session keys to be 
   applied. 
   
   Operation of tunnel mode IPsec security on a device that does not 
   support Network Address Translation may be described as below in 
   figures 1 and 2.

   Figure 2. Operation of Tunnel-Mode IPsec on Incoming packets


   A NAT device that provides tunnel-mode IPsec security would be 
   required to administer security policies based on private realm 
   addressing. In addition, the device would be required to perform 
   address translation for packets that adhere to secure policies. 
   A Secure-NAT performs address translation and secure processing
   together, based on secure policies.  The following diagrams 
   (figure 3 and figure 4) illustrate the operation of IPsec 
   tunneling in conjunction with NAT. Operation of Secure-NAT device 
   may be distinguished from that of a traditional IPsec gateway that 
   does not support NAT may be summarized as follows.

	(1) Secure-NAT device has secure policies administered using 
	    private realm addressing. A traditional IPsec gateway
	    will have its security policies administered using a
	    single realm (say, external realm) addressing.

        (2) Elements fundamental to the security model of a secure-NAT
	    device includes Secure-NAT address mapping  and other NAT 
	    parameter definitions in conjunction with Secure policies 
	    and SA attributes. Fundamental elements of a traditional 
	    IPsec gateway are limited to Secure policies and SA 
	    attributes.

   Traditional NAT is session oriented, allowing outbound-only sessions 
   to be translated. All other flavors of NAT are Bi-directional.  Any 
   and all flavors of NAT mapping may be used in conjunction with the 
   secure policies and secure processing on a secure-NAT device. For 
   illustration purposes in this document, we will assume tunnel mode 
   IPsec on a Bi-directional NAT device providing secure-NAT. 

   Notice however that a NAT device capable of providing security across
   IPsec tunnels can continue to support Clear-NAT for packets that
   do not require secure-NAT. Address mapping and other NAT parameter
   definitions for clear-NAT and Secure-NAT are distinct. Figure 3
   identifies how a NAT device distinguishes between outgoing packets 
   that need to be processed through clear-NAT vs. secure-NAT. As for 
   packets incoming from external realm, figure 4 outlines the packets 
   that may be subject to secure-NAT. All other packets are subject to 
   clear-NAT processing only.

   Secure-NAT operation described in the previous section can be 
   accomplished based on manual session key exchange or using an 
   automated key Exchange protocol between peering entities. In this 
   section, we will consider adapting IETF recommended Internet Key 
   Exchange (IKE) protocol on a Secure-NAT device for automatic 
   exchange of security filters and SA parameters. In other words, we 
   will focus on the operation of IKE in conjunction with tunnel mode 
   IPsec on NAT devices. For the reminder of this section, we will 
   refer NAT device to mean secure-NAT device, unless specified 
   otherwise.

   IKE is based on UDP protocol and uses public-key encryption to 
   exchange session keys and other attributes securely across a 
   routing realm. The detailed protocol and operation of IKE in the 
   context of IP may be found in [Ref 3] and [Ref 4]. Essentially, 
   IKE has 2 phases.  
   
   In the first phase, IKE peers operate in main or aggressive mode 
   to authenticate each other and set up a secure channel between 
   themselves. A NAT device  has an interface to the external realm
   and is no different from any other node in the realm to negotiate 
   phase I with peer external nodes. The NAT device may assume any of 
   the valid Identity types necessary to communicate and authenticate 
   with peers in the realm. The NAT device may also interface with a 
   Certification Authority (CA) in the realm to retrieve certificates  
   and perform signature validation.

   In the second phase, IKE peers operate in Quick Mode to exchange 
   policies and IPsec security proposals to negotiate and agree upon 
   security transformation algorithms, policies, keys, lifetime and 
   other security attributes. During this phase, IKE process must 
   communicate with IPsec Engine to (a) collect secure session 
   attributes and other parameters  to negotiate with peer IKE 
   nodes, and to (b) notify security parameters agreed upon (with 
   peer) during the negotiation.

   A secure-NAT device, operating as IPsec gateway, has the secure 
   policies administered based on private realm addressing. An ALG
   will be required to translate policies from private realm 
   addressing into external addressing, as the IKE process needs to
   communicate these policies to peers in external realm. The 
   following diagram illustrates how an IKE-ALG process interfaces 
   with secure-NAT to take the secure policies and secure-NAT maps 
   and generates secure policies that IKE could communicate to 
   peers in the external realm.  

   Depending on the nature of secure policies in place(ex: end-to-end
   sessions between a pair of nodes vs. sessions with an address 



Srisuresh                                                       [Page 6]

   range), IKE-ALG may need to request NAT to set up address bindings 
   and/or transport bindings for the lifetime (in seconds or 
   Kilo-Bytes) the sessions are negotiated. In the case the ALG is 
   unable to setup the necessary address bindings or transport 
   bindings, IKE-ALG will not be able to translate secure policies 
   and that will result in IKE not pursuing phase II negotiation for 
   the effected policies.

   When the Negotiation is complete and successful, IKE will 
   communicate the negotiated security parameters directly to the
   Secure-NAT gateway engine as described in the following diagram.

5.0. Secure NAT applications

   Secure-NAT operational model described thus far illustrates how a 
   NAT device can be used as an IPsec tunnel end point to provide 
   secure transfer of data in the external realm. This has a direct
   application of being able to provide clear as well as secure 
   connectivity with external realm using a NAT device. 

   There are other benefits that can be derived from this security 
   model. One such would be  Secure remote access for mobile hosts. 
   Say, a node from an enterprise moves out of the enterprise, and 
   attempts to connect to the enterprise from remote site, using a 
   temporary service provider assigned address. In such a case, the 
   remote user could setup an IPsec tunnel session with the corporate 
   secure-NAT device using a user-ID and authentication mechanism that 
   is agreed upon. Further, the user may be configured with enterprise 
   DNS server, as an extension of authentication following IKE Phase I. 
   This would allow the user to access enterprise resources by name. 
   However, many enterprise servers and applications deny access for 
   packets that do not originate from the enterprise address space. In 
   such a case, secure-NAT has the provision (unlike a traditional 
   IPsec gateway) to perform Network Address Translation (NAT) for 
   remote access users, so their temporary address in external realm 
   is translated into a enterprise domain address, while the packets 
   are within private realm. The flavor of NAT performed would be 
   traditional NAT (i.e., assuming mobile-user address space to be 
   private realm and Enterprise address space to be external realm).
   Clearly, traditional NAT can either be Basic NAT (using a block of 
   enterprise addresses for remote access translation) or NAPT(using a 
   single enterprise address for remote access translation).

   The secure remote access application described is pertinent to all 
   enterprises, irrespective of whether an enterprise uses IANA 
   registered addresses or not. A mobile users is allowed secure remote
   access to corporate resources. The security model outlined in the
   document makes such an application possible.


6.0. Security Considerations
 
   If NATs and ALGs are not in a trusted boundary, that is a major
   security problem, as ALGs snoop end user traffic payload. 
   Session level payload could be encrypted end to end, so long as 
   the payload does not contain IP addresses and/or transport 
   identifiers that are valid in only one of the realms. With the 
   exception of Host-NAT, end-to-end IP network level security 
   assured by current IPsec techniques is not attainable with NATs 
   in between. The secure-NAT model described in this document



Srisuresh                                                       [Page 8]

Internet Draft          Security for NAT domains           November 1998


   offers network level security only in the external realm.
    
   NATs, when combined with ALGs, can ensure that the datagrams 
   injected into Internet have no private addresses in headers or 
   payload. Applications that do not meet these requirements may 
   be dropped using firewall filters. For this reason, it is not 
   uncommon to find that Secure-NATs, ALGs and firewalls co-exist 
   to provide security at the borders of a private network.
