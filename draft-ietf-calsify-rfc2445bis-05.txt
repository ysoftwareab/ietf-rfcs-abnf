Abstract

   This document defines a MIME media type for representing and
   exchanging calendaring and scheduling information such as events, to-
   dos, journal entries and free/busy information.  The definition of
   the text/calendar media type, known as iCalendar, is independent of
   any particular calendar service or protocol.

1.  Introduction

   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade.  Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology.  However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these knowledgeware applications.  This memo is intended to progress
   the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring
   and scheduling applications.  This memo defines a MIME content type
   for exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information.
   The Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
   iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information
   normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such
   as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling
   product.

   The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between
   applications or systems.  The format is defined in terms of a MIME
   content type.  This will enable the object to be exchanged using
   several transports, including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file
   system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-
   based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point
   asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of
   unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.

   The memo also provides for the definition of iCalendar object methods
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments, to-dos and
   journal entries.  The iCalendar object methods can be used to define
   other calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data.  Such a scheduling protocol is
   defined in the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) defined in [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   The memo also includes a formal grammar for the content type based on
   the Internet ABNF defined in [RFC4234].  This ABNF is required for
   the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive
   reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the
   descriptive prose definition of the memo.  Additional restrictions
   that could not easily be expressed with the ABNF syntax are specified
   as comments in the ABNF.  Comments with normative statements should
   be treated as such.

2.  Basic Grammar and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This memo makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC4234].
   Readers intending on implementing the format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications of this memo.

   All numeric values used in this memo are given in decimal notation.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive.  However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

      Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are intended
      to provide the reader with additional information.  The
      information is not essential to the building of an implementation
      conformant with this memo.  The information is provided to
      highlight a particular feature or characteristic of the memo.

   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   text/directory media type [RFC2425].  While the iCalendar object is
   not a profile of the text/directory media type [RFC2425], it does
   reuse a number of the elements from the [RFC2425] specification.

2.1.  Formatting Conventions

   The elements defined in this memo are defined in prose.  Many of the
   terms used to describe these have common usage that is different than
   the standards usage of this memo.  In order to reference within this
   memo elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
   (this memo) or interoperability protocol [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis]
   some formatting conventions have been used.  Calendaring and
   scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of text with the
   first character of each word in upper case.  For example, "Organizer"
   refers to a role of a "Calendar User" within the scheduling protocol
   defined by [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].  Calendar components defined
   by this memo are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of
   text.  All calendar components start with the letter "V".  For
   example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO"

   refers to the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to the
   daily journal calendar component.  Scheduling methods defined by iTIP
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-
   strings of text.  For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for
   requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified,
   "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update
   their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.

   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property".  For
   example, "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to
   convey the calendar address of a calendar user.  Property parameters
   defined by this memo are referred to with lowercase, quoted-strings
   of text, followed by the word "parameter".  For example, "value"
   parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override
   the default value type for a property value.  Enumerated values
   defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either
   alone or followed by the word "value".  For example, the "MINUTELY"
   value can be used with the "FREQ" component of the "RECUR" value type
   to specify repeating components based on an interval of one minute or
   more.

2.2.  Related Memos

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards.  This memo specifies a core specification of
   objects, value types, properties and property parameters.

   o  iTIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] specifies an interoperability
      protocol for scheduling between different implementations;

   o  iMIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis] specifies an Internet email
      binding for [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos.  Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

2.3.  International Considerations

   In the rest of this document, descriptions of characters are of the
   form "character name (codepoint)", where "codepoint" is from the US-
   ASCII character set.  The "character name" is the authoritative
   description; (codepoint) is a reference to that character in US-
   ASCII.

3.  iCalendar Object Specification

   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification.  This information is intended
   to be an integral part of the MIME content type registration.  In
   addition, this information can be used independent of such content
   registration.  In particular, this memo has direct applicability for
   use as a calendaring and scheduling exchange format in file-, memory-
   or network-based transport mechanisms.

3.1.  Content Lines

   The iCalendar object is organized into individual lines of text,
   called content lines.  Content lines are delimited by a line break,
   which is a CRLF sequence (US-ASCII decimal 13, followed by US-ASCII
   decimal 10).

   Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
   break.  Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
   representations using a line "folding" technique.  That is, a long
   line can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF
   immediately followed by a single linear white space character (i.e.,
   SPACE, US-ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9).  Any
   sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear white space
   character is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content
   type.

   For example the line:

      DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

      DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
       ng description
        that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple line representation
   to its single line representation is called "unfolding".  Unfolding
   is accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the linear white
   space character that immediately follows.

   When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first be unfolded
   according to the unfolding procedure described above.

      Note: It is possible for very simple implementations to generate
      improperly folded lines in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet
      sequence.  For this reason, implementations need to unfold lines

      in such a way to properly restore the original sequence.

   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by [RFC2425].  That
   is, the content information consists of CRLF-separated content lines.

   The following notation defines the lines of content in an iCalendar
   object:

      contentline   = name *(";" param ) ":" value CRLF
      ; This ABNF is just a general definition for an initial parsing
      ; of the content line into its property name, parameter list,
      ; and value string

      ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first
      ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
      ; described above. When generating a content line, lines
      ; longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded according to
      ; the folding procedure described above.

      name          = iana-token / x-name

      iana-token    = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      ; iCalendar identifier registered with IANA

      x-name        = "X-" [vendorid "-"] 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      ; Reserved for experimental use.

      vendorid      = 3*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
      ; Vendor identification

      param         = param-name "=" param-value *("," param-value)
      ; Each property defines the specific ABNF for the parameters
      ; allowed on the property. Refer to specific properties for
      ; precise parameter ABNF.

      param-name    = iana-token / x-name

      param-value   = paramtext / quoted-string

      paramtext     = *SAFE-CHAR

      value         = *VALUE-CHAR

      quoted-string = DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

      QSAFE-CHAR    = WSP / %x21 / %x23-7E / NON-US-ASCII
      ; Any character except CONTROL, DQUOTE, ";", ":", ","

                    / NON-US-ASCII
      ; Any character except CONTROL, DQUOTE, ";", ":", ","

      VALUE-CHAR    = WSP / %x21-7E / NON-US-ASCII
      ; Any textual character

      NON-US-ASCII  = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
      ; UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 are defined in [RFC3629]

      CONTROL       = %x00-08 / %x0A-1F / %x7F
      ; All the controls except HTAB

   The property value component of a content line has a format that is
   property specific.  Refer to the section describing each property for
   a definition of this format.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive.  However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

3.1.1.  List and Field Separators

   Some properties and parameters allow a list of values.  Values in a
   list of values MUST be separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44).  There is no significance to the order of values in a
   list.  For those parameter values (such as those that specify URI
   values) that are specified in quoted-strings, the individual quoted-
   strings are separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

   Some property values are defined in terms of multiple parts.  These
   structured property values MUST have their value parts separated by a
   SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Some properties allow a list of parameters.  Each property parameter
   in a list of property parameters MUST be separated by a SEMICOLON
   character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Property parameters with values containing a COLON character (US-
   ASCII decimal 58) , a SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59) or a
   COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) MUST be placed in quoted text.

   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters from each other, and a COMMA is used to
   separate property values in a value list.

3.1.2.  Multiple Values

   Some properties defined in the iCalendar object can have multiple
   values.  The general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to
   simply create a new content line for each value, including the
   property name.  However, it should be noted that some properties
   support encoding multiple values in a single property by separating
   the values with a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).  Individual
   property definitions should be consulted for determining whether a
   specific property allows multiple values and in which of these two
   forms.

3.1.3.  Binary Content

   Binary content information in an iCalendar object SHOULD be
   referenced using a URI within a property value.  That is the binary
   content information SHOULD be placed in an external MIME entity that
   can be referenced by a URI from within the iCalendar object.  In
   applications where this is not feasible, binary content information
   can be included within an iCalendar object, but only after first
   encoding it into text using the "BASE64" encoding method defined in
   [RFC4648].  Inline binary contact SHOULD only be used in applications
   whose special circumstances demand that an iCalendar object be
   expressed as a single entity.  A property containing inline binary
   content information MUST specify the "ENCODING" property parameter.
   Binary content information placed external to the iCalendar object
   MUST be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (URI).

   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property that references
   an attachment external to the iCalendar object with a URI reference:

      ATTACH:http://example.com/public/quarterly-report.doc

   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property with inline
   binary encoded content information:

      ATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/basic;ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:
       MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1U
       EBhMCVVMxLDAqBgNVBAoTI05ldHNjYXBlIENvbW11bmljYXRpb25zIE
         <...remainder of "BASE64" encoded binary data...>

3.1.4.  Character Set

   There is not a property parameter to declare the charset used in a
   property value.  The default charset for an iCalendar stream is UTF-8
   as defined in [RFC3629].

   The "charset" Content-Type parameter MUST be used in MIME transports
   to specify the charset being used.

3.2.  Property Parameters

   A property can have attributes associated with it.  These "property
   parameters" contain meta-information about the property or the
   property value.  Property parameters are provided to specify such
   information as the location of an alternate text representation for a
   property value, the language of a text property value, the value type
   of the property value and other attributes.

   Property parameter values that contain the COLON (US-ASCII decimal
   58), SEMICOLON (US-ASCII decimal 59) or COMMA (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   character separators MUST be specified as quoted-string text values.
   Property parameter values MUST NOT contain the DQUOTE (US-ASCII
   decimal 22) character.  The DQUOTE (US-ASCII decimal 22) character is
   used as a delimiter for parameter values that contain restricted
   characters or URI text.  For example:

      DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="http://www.example.org":The Fall'98 Wild
        Wizards Conference - - Las Vegas\, NV\, USA

   Property parameter values that are not in quoted strings are case
   insensitive.

      value MUST be specified in a quoted-string.

   Example:

        ORGANIZER;DIR="ldap://example.com:6666/o=ABC%20Industries,
         c=US???(cn=Jim%20Dolittle)":mailto:jimdo@example.com

3.2.7.  Inline Encoding

   Parameter Name:  ENCODING

   Purpose:  To specify an alternate inline encoding for the property
      value.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        encodingparam      = "ENCODING" "="
                             ("8BIT"
           ; "8bit" text encoding is defined in [RFC2045]
                           / "BASE64"
           ; "BASE64" binary encoding format is defined in [RFC4648]
                           / iana-token
           ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar encoding type
                           / x-name)
           ; A non-standard, experimental encoding type

   Description:  This property parameter identifies the inline encoding
      used in a property value.  The default encoding is "8BIT",
      corresponding to a property value consisting of text.  The
      "BASE64" encoding type corresponds to a property value encoded
      using the "BASE64" encoding defined in [RFC2045].

      If the value type parameter is ";VALUE=BINARY", then the inline
      encoding parameter MUST be specified with the value
      ";ENCODING=BASE64".

3.2.8.  Format Type

   Parameter Name:  FMTTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the content type of a referenced object.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        fmttypeparam       = "FMTTYPE" "=" iana-token
                                        ; A IANA registered media type
                                        / x-name
                                        ; A non-standard media type

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties that are
      used to reference an object.  The parameter specifies the content
      type of the referenced object.  For example, on the "ATTACH"
      property, a FTP type URI value does not, by itself, necessarily
      convey the type of content associated with the resource.  The
      parameter value MUST be the text for either an IANA registered
      media type or a non-standard media type.

   Example:

        ATTACH;FMTTYPE=application/msword:ftp://example.com/pub/docs/
         agenda.doc

3.2.9.  Free/Busy Time Type

   Parameter Name:  FBTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the free or busy time type.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        fbtypeparam        = "FBTYPE" "=" ("FREE" / "BUSY"
                           / "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE" / "BUSY-TENTATIVE"
                           / x-name
                 ; Some experimental iCalendar free busy type.
                           / iana-token)

                 ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar free busy type.

   Description:  This parameter specifies the free or busy time type.
      The value FREE indicates that the time interval is free for
      scheduling.  The value BUSY indicates that the time interval is
      busy because one or more events have been scheduled for that
      interval.  The value BUSY-UNAVAILABLE indicates that the time
      interval is busy and that the interval can not be scheduled.  The
      value BUSY-TENTATIVE indicates that the time interval is busy
      because one or more events have been tentatively scheduled for
      that interval.  If not specified on a property that allows this
      parameter, the default is BUSY.

   Example:  The following is an example of this parameter on a
      "FREEBUSY" property.

        FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=BUSY:19980415T133000Z/19980415T170000Z

3.2.10.  Language

   Parameter Name:  LANGUAGE

   Purpose:  To specify the language for text values in a property or
      property parameter.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        languageparam = "LANGUAGE" "=" language

        language = Language-Tag
                   ; As defined in [RFC4646]

   Description:  This parameter identifies the language of the text in
      the property or property parameter value.  The value of the
      "language" property parameter is that defined in [RFC4646] .

      For transport in a MIME entity, the Content-Language header field
      can be used to set the default language for the entire body part.
      Otherwise, no default language is assumed.

   Example:  The following are examples of this parameter on the SUMMARY
      and LOCATION properties:

        SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=us-EN:Company Holiday Party

        LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en:Germany

                             *("," DQUOTE cal-address DQUOTE)

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties with a
      CAL-ADDRESS value type.  The parameter identifies the groups or
      list membership for the calendar user specified by the property.
      The parameter value is either a single calendar address in a
      quoted-string or a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of calendar addresses, each in a quoted-string.  The
      individual calendar address parameter values MUST each be
      specified in a quoted-string.

                           / "END")        ; Trigger off of end

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties that
      specify an alarm trigger with a "DURATION" value type.  The
      parameter specifies whether the alarm will trigger relative to the
      start or end of the calendar component.  The parameter value START
      will set the alarm to trigger off the start of the calendar
      component; the parameter value END will set the alarm to trigger
      off the end of the calendar component.  If the parameter is not
      specified on an allowable property, then the default is START.

                                         ; relationship type

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar.  The parameter specifies the
      hierarchical relationship type of the calendar component
      referenced by the property.  The parameter value can be PARENT, to
      indicate that the referenced calendar component is a superior of
      calendar component; CHILD to indicate that the referenced calendar
      component is a subordinate of the calendar component; SIBLING to
      indicate that the referenced calendar component is a peer of the
      calendar component.  If this parameter is not specified on an
      allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.

3.2.16.  RSVP Expectation

   Parameter Name:  RSVP

   Purpose:  To specify whether there is an expectation of a favor of a
      reply from the calendar user specified by the property value.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        rsvpparam = "RSVP" "=" ("TRUE" / "FALSE")
        ; Default is FALSE

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties with a
      CAL-ADDRESS value type.  The parameter identifies the expectation
      of a reply from the calendar user specified by the property value.
      This parameter is used by the "Organizer" to request a
      participation status reply from an "Attendee" of a group scheduled

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties with a
      CAL-ADDRESS value type.  The parameter specifies the calendar user
      that is acting on behalf of the calendar user specified by the
      property.  The parameter value MUST be a mailto URI as defined in
      [RFC2368].  The individual calendar address parameter values MUST
      each be specified in a quoted-string.

   Example:

        ORGANIZER;SENT-BY="mailto:sray@example.com":mailto:
         jsmith@example.com

3.2.18.  Time Zone Identifier

   Parameter Name:  TZID

   Purpose:  To specify the identifier for the time zone definition for
      a time component in the property value.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        tzidparam  = "TZID" "=" [tzidprefix] paramtext

        tzidprefix = "/"

   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on the "DTSTART",
      "DTEND", "DUE", "EXDATE" and "RDATE" properties when either a
      DATE-TIME or TIME value type is specified and when the value is
      not either a UTC or a "floating" time.  Refer to the DATE-TIME or
      TIME value type definition for a description of UTC and "floating
      time" formats.  This property parameter specifies a text value
      which uniquely identifies the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component to be
      used when evaluating the time portion of the property.  The value
      of the "TZID" property parameter will be equal to the value of the
      "TZID" property for the matching time zone definition.  An
      individual "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be specified for
      each unique "TZID" parameter value specified in the iCalendar
      object.

      The parameter MUST be specified on properties with a DATE-TIME
      value if the DATE-TIME is not either a UTC or a "floating" time.

      The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47) as a
      prefix, indicates that this "TZID" represents a unique ID in a
      globally defined time zone registry (when such registry is
      defined).

         Note: This document does not define a naming convention for
         time zone identifiers.  Implementers may want to use the naming
         conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such
         as the public-domain TZ Database [TZDB].  The specification of
         globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
         document and is left for future study.

      The following are examples of this property parameter:

        DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19980119T020000

        DTEND;TZID=US-Eastern:19980119T030000

      The "TZID" property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME or
      TIME properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

      The use of local time in a DATE-TIME or TIME value without the
      "TZID" property parameter is to be interpreted as a local time

      components in the iCalendar object.

3.2.19.  Value Data Types

   Parameter Name:  VALUE

   Purpose:  To explicitly specify the value type format for a property
      value.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        valuetypeparam = "VALUE" "=" valuetype

        valuetype  = ("BINARY"
                   / "BOOLEAN"
                   / "CAL-ADDRESS"
                   / "DATE"
                   / "DATE-TIME"
                   / "DURATION"
                   / "FLOAT"
                   / "INTEGER"
                   / "PERIOD"
                   / "RECUR"
                   / "TEXT"
                   / "TIME"
                   / "URI"
                   / "UTC-OFFSET"

                   / iana-token)
                   ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar value type.

   Description:  This parameter specifies the value type and format of
      the property value.  The property values MUST be of a single value
      type.  For example, a "RDATE" property cannot have a combination
      of DATE-TIME and TIME value types.

      If the property's value is the default value type, then this
      parameter need not be specified.  However, if the property's
      default value type is overridden by some other allowable value
      type, then this parameter MUST be specified.

3.3.  Property Value Data Types

   The properties in an iCalendar object are strongly typed.  The
   definition of each property restricts the value to be one of the
   value data types, or simply value types, defined in this section.
   The value type for a property will either be specified implicitly as
   the default value type or will be explicitly specified with the
   "VALUE" parameter.  If the value type of a property is one of the
   alternate valid types, then it MUST be explicitly specified with the
   "VALUE" parameter.

   Value Name:  BINARY

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a character encoding of inline binary data.  For example, an
      inline attachment of a document might be included in an iCalendar
      object.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        binary     = *(4b-char) [b-end]
        ; A "BASE64" encoded character string, as defined by [RFC4648].

        b-end      = (2b-char "==") / (3b-char "=")

        b-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"

   Description:  Property values with this value type MUST also include
      the inline encoding parameter sequence of ";ENCODING=BASE64".
      That is, all inline binary data MUST first be character encoded
      using the "BASE64" encoding method defined in [RFC2045].  No
      additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is an abridged example of a "BASE64" encoded
      binary value data.

3.3.2.  Boolean

   Value Name:  BOOLEAN

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      either a "TRUE" or "FALSE" Boolean value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        boolean    = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

   Description:  These values are case insensitive text.  No additional
      content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding) is
      defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is an example of a hypothetical property that
      has a BOOLEAN value type:

        TRUE

3.3.3.  Calendar User Address

   Value Name:  CAL-ADDRESS

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a calendar user address.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        cal-address        = uri

   Description:  The value is a URI as defined by [RFC3986] or any other
      IANA registered form for a URI.  When used to address an Internet
      email transport address for a calendar user, the value MUST be a
      mailto URI, as defined by [RFC2368].  No additional content value
      encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding) is defined for this
      value type.

   Example:

     mailto:jane_doe@example.com

3.3.4.  Date

   Value Name:  DATE

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      calendar date.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        date               = date-value

        date-value         = date-fullyear date-month date-mday
        date-fullyear      = 4DIGIT
        date-month         = 2DIGIT        ;01-12
        date-mday          = 2DIGIT        ;01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31

                                           ;based on month/year

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "date" values are
      specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  The format for the value type is expressed as the
      [ISO.8601.1988] complete representation, basic format for a
      calendar date.  The textual format specifies a four-digit year,
      two-digit month, and two-digit day of the month.  There are no
      separator characters between the year, month and day component
      text.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following represents July 14, 1997:

        19970714

3.3.5.  Date-Time

   Value Name:  DATE-TIME

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that specify a
      precise calendar date and time of day.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        date-time  = date "T" time ;As specified in the date and time
                                   ;value definitions

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "date-time" values
      are specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  No additional content value encoding (i.e.,
      BACKSLASH character encoding) is defined for this value type.

      The "DATE-TIME" value type is used to identify values that contain
      a precise calendar date and time of day.  The format is based on
      the [ISO.8601.1988] complete representation, basic format for a
      calendar date and time of day.  The text format is a concatenation
      of the "date", followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character
      (US-ASCII decimal 84) time designator, followed by the "time"
      format.

      The "DATE-TIME" value type expresses time values in three forms:






Desruisseaux             Expires August 2, 2007                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      The form of date and time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used.  For
      example, the following is not valid for a date-time value:

        19980119T230000-0800       ;Invalid time format

      FORM #1: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME

      The date with local time form is simply a date-time value that
      does not contain the UTC designator nor does it reference a time
      zone.  For example, the following represents January 18, 1998, at
      11 PM:

        19980118T230000

      Date-time values of this type are said to be "floating" and are
      not bound to any time zone in particular.  They are used to
      represent the same hour, minute, and second value regardless of
      which time zone is currently being observed.  For example, an
      event can be defined that indicates that an individual will be
      busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day, no matter which time zone
      the person is in.  In these cases, a local time can be specified.
      The recipient of an iCalendar object with a property value
      consisting of a local time, without any relative time zone
      information, SHOULD interpret the value as being fixed to whatever
      time zone the "ATTENDEE" is in at any given moment.  This means
      that two "Attendees", in different time zones, receiving the same
      event definition as a floating time, may be participating in the
      event at different actual times.  Floating time SHOULD only be
      used where that is the reasonable behavior.

      In most cases, a fixed time is desired.  To properly communicate a
      fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
      time zone reference MUST be specified.

      The use of local time in a DATE-TIME value without the "TZID"
      property parameter is to be interpreted as floating time,
      regardless of the existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in
      the iCalendar object.

      FORM #2: DATE WITH UTC TIME

      The date with UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN
      CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC
      designator, appended to the time value.  For example, the
      following represents January 19, 1998, at 0700 UTC:

        19980119T070000Z

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      The "TZID" property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME
      properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

      FORM #3: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

      The date and local time with reference to time zone information is
      identified by the use the "TZID" property parameter to reference
      the appropriate time zone definition.  "TZID" is discussed in
      detail in Section 3.2.18.  For example, the following represents 2
      AM in New York on Janurary 19, 1998:

        TZID=US-Eastern:19980119T020000

   Example:  The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in New
      York City in each of the three time formats, using the "DTSTART"
      property.

        DTSTART:19970714T133000            ;Local time
        DTSTART:19970714T173000Z           ;UTC time
        DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970714T133000    ;Local time and time
                           ; zone reference

      A time value MUST ONLY specify 60 seconds when specifying the
      periodic "leap second" in the time value.  For example:

        19970630T235960Z

3.3.6.  Duration

   Value Name:  DURATION

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a duration of time.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        dur-value  = (["+"] / "-") "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

        dur-date   = dur-day [dur-time]
        dur-time   = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
        dur-week   = 1*DIGIT "W"
        dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
        dur-minute = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
        dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"
        dur-day    = 1*DIGIT "D"

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "duration" values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  The format is expressed as the [ISO.8601.1988]
      basic format for the duration of time.  The format can represent
      durations in terms of weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
      Negative durations are typically used to schedule an alarm to
      trigger before an associated time (see Section 3.8.6.3).

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) are defined for this value type.

   Example:  A duration of 15 days, 5 hours and 20 seconds would be:

        P15DT5H0M20S

      A duration of 7 weeks would be:

        P7W

3.3.7.  Float

   Value Name:  FLOAT

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a real number value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        float      = (["+"] / "-") 1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "float" values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:

3.3.8.  Integer

   Value Name:  INTEGER

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a signed integer value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        integer    = (["+"] / "-") 1*DIGIT

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "integer" values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  The valid range for "integer" is -2147483648 to
      2147483647.  If the sign is not specified, then the value is
      assumed to be positive.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:

        1234567890
        -1234567890
        +1234567890

3.3.9.  Period of Time

   Value Name:  PERIOD

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        period     = period-explicit / period-start

        period-explicit = date-time "/" date-time
        ; [ISO.8601.1988] complete representation basic format for a
        ; period of time consisting of a start and end. The start MUST
        ; be before the end.

        period-start = date-time "/" dur-value
        ; [ISO.8601.1988] complete representation basic format for a
        ; period of time consisting of a start and positive duration

        ; of time.

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "period" values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  There are two forms of a period of time.  First,
      a period of time is identified by its start and its end.  This
      format is expressed as the [ISO.8601.1988] complete
      representation, basic format for "DATE-TIME" start of the period,
      followed by a SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47), followed by
      the "DATE-TIME" of the end of the period.  The start of the period
      MUST be before the end of the period.  Second, a period of time
      can also be defined by a start and a positive duration of time.
      The format is expressed as the [ISO.8601.1988] complete
      representation, basic format for the "DATE-TIME" start of the
      period, followed by a SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47),
      followed by the [ISO.8601.1988] basic format for "DURATION" of the
      period.

   Example:  The period starting at 18:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 1997 and
      ending at 07:00:00 UTC on January 2, 1997 would be:

        19970101T180000Z/19970102T070000Z

      The period start at 18:00:00 on January 1, 1997 and lasting 5
      hours and 30 minutes would be:

        19970101T180000Z/PT5H30M

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

3.3.10.  Recurrence Rule

   Value Name:  RECUR

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a recurrence rule specification.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        recur           = recur-rule-part *( ";" recur-rule-part )
                        ;
                        ; The rule parts are not ordered in any
                        ; particular sequence
                        ;
                        ; The FREQ rule part is REQUIRED,

   Description:  This value type is a structured value consisting of a
      list of one or more recurrence grammar parts.  Each rule part is
      defined by a NAME=VALUE pair.  The rule parts are separated from
      each other by the SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).  The
      rule parts are not ordered in any particular sequence.  Individual
      rule parts MUST only be specified once.

      The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule.  This
      rule part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule.  Valid values
      include SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval
      of a second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based
      on an interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating
      events based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify
      repeating events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to
      specify repeating events based on an interval of a week or more;
      MONTHLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a
      month or more; and YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an
      interval of a year or more.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      The INTERVAL rule part contains a positive integer representing
      how often the recurrence rule repeats.  The default value is "1",
      meaning every second for a SECONDLY rule, or every minute for a
      MINUTELY rule, every hour for an HOURLY rule, every day for a
      DAILY rule, every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a
      MONTHLY rule and every year for a YEARLY rule.

      The UNTIL rule part defines a date-time value which bounds the
      recurrence rule in an inclusive manner.  If the value specified by
      UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence, this date or
      date-time becomes the last instance of the recurrence.  If
      specified as a date-time value, then it MUST be specified in a UTC
      time format.  If not present, and the COUNT rule part is also not
      present, the "RRULE" is considered to repeat forever.

      The COUNT rule part defines the number of occurrences at which to
      range-bound the recurrence.  The "DTSTART" property value always
      counts as the first occurrence.

      The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of seconds within a minute.  Valid
      values are 0 to 60.  The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA
      character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list of minutes within
      an hour.  Valid values are 0 to 59.  The BYHOUR rule part
      specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
      of hours of the day.  Valid values are 0 to 23.  The BYSECOND,
      BYMINUTE and BYHOUR rule parts MUST NOT be specified when the
      associated "DTSTART" property has a DATE value type.  These rule
      parts MUST be ignored in RECUR value that violate the above
      requirement (e.g., generated by applications that pre-date this
      revision of iCalendar).

      The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
      44) separated list of days of the week; SU indicates Sunday; MO
      indicates Monday; TU indicates Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH
      indicates Thursday; FR indicates Friday; SA indicates Saturday.

      Each BYDAY value can also be preceded by a positive (+n) or
      negative (-n) integer.  If present, this indicates the nth
      occurrence of the specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY
      "RRULE".  For example, within a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO)
      represents the first Monday within the month, whereas -1MO
      represents the last Monday of the month.  If an integer modifier
      is not present, it means all days of this type within the
      specified frequency.  For example, within a MONTHLY rule, MO
      represents all Mondays within the month.

      The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of days of the month.  Valid values are
      1 to 31 or -31 to -1.  For example, -10 represents the tenth to
      the last day of the month.

      The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of days of the year.  Valid values are
      1 to 366 or -366 to -1.  For example, -1 represents the last day
      of the year (December 31st) and -306 represents the 306th to the
      last day of the year (March 1st).

      The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the
      year.  Valid values are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1.  This corresponds to
      weeks according to week numbering as defined in [ISO.8601.1988].
      A week is defined as a seven day period, starting on the day of
      the week defined to be the week start (see WKST).  Week number one
      of the calendar year is the first week which contains at least
      four (4) days in that calendar year.  This rule part is only valid
      for YEARLY rules.  For example, 3 represents the third week of the
      year.

         Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when
         Thursday is January 1 or if it is a leap year and Wednesday is
         January 1.

      The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of months of the year.  Valid values
      are 1 to 12.

      The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts.
      Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA and SU.  This is
      significant when a WEEKLY "RRULE" has an interval greater than 1,
      and a BYDAY rule part is specified.  This is also significant when
      in a YEARLY "RRULE" when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified.  The
      default value is MO.

      The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of values which corresponds to the nth
      occurrence within the set of events specified by the rule.  Valid
      values are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1.  It MUST only be used in
      conjunction with another BYxxx rule part.  For example "the last
      work day of the month" could be represented as:

        FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1

      Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+n) or negative (-n)
      integer.  If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the

      specific occurrence within the set of occurences specified by the
      rule.

      Recurrence rules may generate recurrence instances with invalid
      date (e.g., February 30) or nonexistent local time (e.g., 1:30 AM
      on a day where the local time is moved forward by an hour at 1:00
      AM).  Such recurrence instances MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be
      counted as part of the recurrence set.

      Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
      various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from
      the Start Time ("DTSTART") component attribute.  For example,
      "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1" doesn't specify a specific day within the
      month or a time.  This information would be the same as what is
      specified for "DTSTART".

      BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner.  BYxxx rule
      parts for a period of time which is the same or greater than the
      frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of
      the recurrence generated.  For example, "FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1"
      reduces the number of recurrence instances from all days (if
      BYMONTH rule part is not present) to all days in January.  BYxxx
      rule parts for a period of time less than the frequency generally
      increase or expand the number of occurrences of the recurrence.
      For example, "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2" increases the number of
      days within the yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH rule part
      is not present) to 2.

      If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating
      the specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts
      are applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the
      following order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY,
      BYHOUR, BYMINUTE, BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are
      evaluated.

      Here is an example of evaluating multiple BYxxx rule parts.

        DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970105T083000
        RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=2;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU;BYHOUR=8,9;
         BYMINUTE=30

      First, the "INTERVAL=2" would be applied to "FREQ=YEARLY" to
      arrive at "every other year".  Then, "BYMONTH=1" would be applied
      to arrive at "every January, every other year".  Then, "BYDAY=SU"
      would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January, every
      other year".  Then, "BYHOUR=8,9" would be applied to arrive at
      "every Sunday in January at 8 AM and 9 AM, every other year".
      Then, "BYMINUTE=30" would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in

      January at 8:30 AM and 9:30 AM, every other year".  Then, lacking
      information from "RRULE", the second is derived from "DTSTART", to
      end up in "every Sunday in January at 8:30:00 AM and 9:30:00 AM,
      every other year".  Similarly, if the BYMINUTE, BYHOUR, BYDAY,
      BYMONTHDAY or BYMONTH rule part were missing, the appropriate
      minute, hour, day or month would have been retrieved from the
      "DTSTART" property.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is a rule which specifies 10 occurences which
      occur every other day:

        FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10;INTERVAL=2

      There are other examples specified in Section 3.8.5.3.

3.3.11.  Text

   Value Name:  TEXT

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain
      human readable text.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation.

        text       = *(TSAFE-CHAR / ":" / DQUOTE / ESCAPED-CHAR)
           ; Folded according to description above

        ESCAPED-CHAR = ("\\" / "\;" / "\," / "\N" / "\n")
           ; \\ encodes \, \N or \n encodes newline
           ; \; encodes ;, \, encodes ,

        TSAFE-CHAR = %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-39 / %x3C-5B /
                     %x5D-7E / NON-US-ASCII
           ; Any character except CTLs not needed by the current
           ; character set, DQUOTE, ";", ":", "\", ","

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple TEXT values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.

      The language in which the text is represented can be controlled by
      the "LANGUAGE" property parameter.

      An intentional formatted text line break MUST only be included in
      a "TEXT" property value by representing the line break with the
      character sequence of BACKSLASH (US-ASCII decimal 92), followed by
      a LATIN SMALL LETTER N (US-ASCII decimal 110) or a LATIN CAPITAL
      LETTER N (US-ASCII decimal 78), that is "\n" or "\N".

      The "TEXT" property values may also contain special characters
      that are used to signify delimiters, such as a COMMA character for
      lists of values or a SEMICOLON character for structured values.
      In order to support the inclusion of these special characters in
      "TEXT" property values, they MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH
      character.  A BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92) in a
      "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped with another BACKSLASH
      character.  A COMMA character in a "TEXT" property value MUST be
      escaped with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92).  A
      SEMICOLON character in a "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped
      with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92).  However, a
      COLON character in a "TEXT" property value SHALL NOT be escaped
      with a BACKSLASH character.

   Example:  A multiple line value of:

        Project XYZ Final Review
        Conference Room - 3B
        Come Prepared.

      would be represented as:

        Project XYZ Final Review\nConference Room - 3B\nCome Prepared.

3.3.12.  Time

   Value Name:  TIME

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      time of day.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        time         = time-hour time-minute time-second [time-utc]

        time-hour    = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
        time-minute  = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
        time-second  = 2DIGIT        ;00-60
        ;The "60" value is used to account for positive "leap" seconds.

        time-utc     = "Z"

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "time" values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  No additional content value encoding (i.e.,
      BACKSLASH character encoding) is defined for this value type.

      The "TIME" value type is used to identify values that contain a
      time of day.  The format is based on the [ISO.8601.1988] complete
      representation, basic format for a time of day.  The text format
      consists of a two-digit 24-hour of the day (i.e., values 00-23),
      two-digit minute in the hour (i.e., values 00-59), and two-digit
      seconds in the minute (i.e., values 00-60).  The seconds value of
      60 MUST only be used to account for positive "leap" seconds.
      Fractions of a second are not supported by this format.

      In parallel to the "DATE-TIME" definition above, the "TIME" value
      type expresses time values in three forms:

      The form of time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used.  For example,
      the following is not valid for a time value:



        230000-0800        ;Invalid time format

      FORM #1 LOCAL TIME

      The local time form is simply a time value that does not contain
      the UTC designator nor does it reference a time zone.  For
      example, 11:00 PM:



        230000

      Time values of this type are said to be "floating" and are not
      bound to any time zone in particular.  They are used to represent
      the same hour, minute, and second value regardless of which time
      zone is currently being observed.  For example, an event can be
      defined that indicates that an individual will be busy from 11:00
      AM to 1:00 PM every day, no matter which time zone the person is
      in.  In these cases, a local time can be specified.  The recipient
      of an iCalendar object with a property value consisting of a local
      time, without any relative time zone information, SHOULD interpret
      the value as being fixed to whatever time zone the "ATTENDEE" is
      in at any given moment.  This means that two "Attendees", may
      participate in the same event at different UTC times; floating
      time SHOULD only be used where that is reasonable behavior.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      In most cases, a fixed time is desired.  To properly communicate a
      fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
      time zone reference MUST be specified.

      The use of local time in a TIME value without the "TZID" property
      parameter is to be interpreted as a local time value, regardless
      of the existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in the
      iCalendar object.

      FORM #2: UTC TIME

      UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN CAPITAL
      LETTER Z suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC
      designator, appended to the time value.  For example, the
      following represents 07:00 AM UTC:



        070000Z

      The "TZID" property parameter MUST NOT be applied to TIME
      properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

      FORM #3: LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

      The local time with reference to time zone information form is
      identified by the use the "TZID" property parameter to reference
      the appropriate time zone definition.  "TZID" is discussed in
      detail in Section 3.2.18 .

   Example:  The following represents 8:30 AM in New York in Winter,
      five hours behind UTC, in each of the three formats :

        083000
        133000Z

        TZID=US-Eastern:083000

3.3.13.  URI

   Value Name:  URI

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      uniform resource identifier (URI) type of reference to the
      property value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        uri = URI ; As defined in [RFC3986]

   Description:  This value type might be used to reference binary
      information, for values that are large, or otherwise undesirable
      to include directly in the iCalendar object.

      The URI value formats in [RFC3986] and any other IETF registered
      value format can be specified.

      Any IANA registered URI format can be used.  These include, but
      are not limited to, those defined in [RFC3986].

      When a property parameter value is a URI value type, the URI MUST
      be specified as a quoted-string value.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is a URI for a network file:

        http://example.com/my-report.txt

3.3.14.  UTC Offset

   Value Name:  UTC-OFFSET

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      an offset from UTC to local time.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        utc-offset = time-numzone

        time-numzone = ("+" / "-") time-hour time-minute [time-second]

   Description:  The PLUS SIGN (US-ASCII decimal 43) character MUST be
      specified for positive UTC offsets (i.e., ahead of UTC).  The
      HYPHEN-MINUS character (US-ASCII decimal 45) MUST be specified for
      negative UTC offsets (i.e., behind of UTC).  The value of "-0000"
      and "-000000" are not allowed.  The time-second, if present, MUST
      NOT be 60; if absent, it defaults to zero.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following UTC offsets are given for standard time for
      New York (five hours behind UTC) and Geneva (one hour ahead of
      UTC):

        -0500

3.4.  iCalendar Object

   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
   calendaring and scheduling information.  Typically, this information
   will consist of an iCalendar stream with a single iCalendar object.
   However, multiple iCalendar objects can be sequentially grouped
   together in an iCalendar stream.  The first line and last line of the
   iCalendar object MUST contain a pair of iCalendar object delimiter
   strings.  The syntax for an iCalendar stream is as follows:

        icalstream = 1*icalobject

        icalobject = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                     icalbody
                     "END" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF

   The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:

        BEGIN:VCALENDAR
        VERSION:2.0
        PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
        BEGIN:VEVENT
        UID:19970610T172345Z-AF23B2@example.com

3.5.  Property

   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing a
   calendar object or a calendar component.  A property takes the form
   defined by the "contentline" notation defined in Section 3.1 .

   The following is an example of a property:

        DTSTART:19960415T133000Z

   This memo imposes no ordering of properties within an iCalendar
   object.

   Property names, parameter names and enumerated parameter values are
   case insensitive.  For example, the property name "DUE" is the same
   as "due" and "Due", DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19980714T120000 is the
   same as DtStart;TzID=US-Eastern:19980714T120000.

3.6.  Calendar Components

   The body of the iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components.  The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar object as a
   whole.  The calendar components are collections of properties that
   express a particular calendar semantic.  For example, the calendar
   component can specify an event, a to-do, a journal entry, time zone
   information, free/busy time information, or an alarm.

   The body of the iCalendar object is defined by the following
   notation:

        icalbody   = calprops component

        calprops   = *(

                   ; 'prodid' and 'version' are both REQUIRED,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   prodid / version /

                   ; 'calscale' and 'method' are OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   calscale        /
                   method          /

                   ; 'x-prop' is OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MAY occur more than once

                   x-prop
                   )

        component  = 1*(eventc / todoc / journalc / freebusyc /
                     timezonec / iana-comp / x-comp)

        iana-comp  = "BEGIN" ":" iana-token CRLF
                     1*contentline
                     "END" ":" iana-token CRLF

        x-comp     = "BEGIN" ":" x-name CRLF
                     1*contentline
                     "END" ":" x-name CRLF

   An iCalendar object MUST include the "PRODID" and "VERSION" calendar
   properties.  In addition, it MUST include at least one calendar
   component.  Special forms of iCalendar objects are possible to
   publish just busy time (i.e., only a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component)
   or time zone (i.e., only a "VTIMEZONE" calendar component)
   information.  In addition, a complex iCalendar object that is used to
   capture a complete snapshot of the contents of a calendar is possible
   (e.g., composite of many different calendar components).  More
   commonly, an iCalendar object will consist of just a single "VEVENT",
   "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

   Description:  A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties, and possibly including "VALARM" calendar
      components, that represents a scheduled amount of time on a
      calendar.  For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour
      long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow.
      Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar.
      Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval in a search for
      busy time.  Alternately, the event can have its Time Transparency
      set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent blocking of the event in
      searches for busy time.

      The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
      anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.  These events
      have a DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the
      default value type of DATE-TIME.  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DTEND"
      property, it MUST be specified as a DATE value also.  The
      anniversary type of "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e,
      "DTEND" property value is set to a calendar date after the
      "DTSTART" property value).  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DURATION"
      property, it MUST be specified as a "dur-day" or "dur-week" value.

      The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive
      start of the event.  For recurring events, it also specifies the
      very first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTEND" property
      for a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end
      of the event.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
      specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE value type but no
      "DTEND" nor DURATION property, the event's duration is taken to be
      one day.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies
      a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME value type but no "DTEND"
      property, the event ends on the same calendar date and time of day
      specified by the "DTSTART" property.

      The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, "VEVENT" calendar components can be
      related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
      component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   Example:  The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar
      component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
      searches for busy time:

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
      transparent, to searches for busy time:

        END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent an anniversary that will occur annually.  Since
      it takes up no time, it will not appear as opaque in a search for
      busy time; no matter what the value of the "TRANSP" property
      indicates:

        BEGIN:VEVENT
        UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@example.com

   Description:  A "VTODO" calendar component is a grouping of component
      properties and possibly "VALARM" calendar components that
      represent an action-item or assignment.  For example, it can be
      used to represent an item of work assigned to an individual; such
      as "turn in travel expense today".

      The "VTODO" calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, "VTODO" calendar components can be
      related to each other or to a "VEVENT" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
      component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

      A "VTODO" calendar component without the "DTSTART" and "DUE" (or
      "DURATION") properties specifies a to-do that will be associated
      with each successive calendar date, until it is completed.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VTODO" calendar
      component:

        BEGIN:VTODO
        UID:19970901T130000Z-123404@example.com

                   rstatus / x-prop
                   )

   Description:  A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties that represent one or more descriptive text
      notes associated with a particular calendar date.  The "DTSTART"
      property is used to specify the calendar date that the journal
      entry is associated with.  Generally, it will have a DATE value
      data type, but it can also be used to specify a DATE-TIME value
      data type.  Examples of a journal entry include a daily record of
      a legislative body or a journal entry of individual telephone
      contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments for the
      day.  The "VJOURNAL" calendar component can also be used to
      associate a document with a calendar date.

      The "VJOURNAL" calendar component does not take up time on a
      calendar.  Hence, it does not play a role in free or busy time
      searches -- it is as though it has a time transparency value of
      TRANSPARENT.  It is transparent to any such searches.

   Description:  A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties that represents either a request for, a reply
      to a request for free or busy time information or a published set
      of busy time information.

      When used to request free/busy time information, the "ATTENDEE"
      property specifies the calendar users whose free/busy time is
      being requested; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar
      user who is requesting the free/busy time; the "DTSTART" and
      "DTEND" properties specify the window of time for which the free/
      busy time is being requested; the "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties

      time requests.

      When used to reply to a request for free/busy time, the "ATTENDEE"
      property specifies the calendar user responding to the free/busy
      time request; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user
      that originally requested the free/busy time; the "FREEBUSY"
      property specifies the free/busy time information (if it exists);
      and the "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to assist in
      proper sequencing of multiple free/busy time replies.

      When used to publish busy time, the "ORGANIZER" property specifies
      the calendar user associated with the published busy time; the
      "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties specify an inclusive time window
      that surrounds the busy time information; the "FREEBUSY" property
      specifies the published busy time information; and the "DTSTAMP"
      property specifies the date/time that iCalendar object was
      created.

      The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  Multiple "VFREEBUSY" calendar components can
      be specified within an iCalendar object.  This permits the
      grouping of Free/Busy information into logical collections, such
      as monthly groups of busy time information.

      The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is intended for use in
      iCalendar object methods involving requests for free time,
      requests for busy time, requests for both free and busy, and the
      associated replies.

      Free/Busy information is represented with the "FREEBUSY" property.
      This property provides a terse representation of time periods.
      One or more "FREEBUSY" properties can be specified in the
      "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.

      When present in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, the "DTSTART"
      and "DTEND" properties SHOULD be specified prior to any "FREEBUSY"
      properties.  In a free time request, these properties can be used
      in combination with the "DURATION" property to represent a request
      for a duration of free time within a specified window of time.

      The recurrence properties ("RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE") are not
      permitted within a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.  Any recurring
      events are resolved into their individual busy time periods using
      the "FREEBUSY" property.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VFREEBUSY" calendar
      component used to request free or busy time information:

        BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
        ORGANIZER:mailto:jane_doe@example.com

   Description:  A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time
      measurement rules determined by the governing body for a given
      geographic area.  These rules describe at a minimum the base
      offset from UTC for the time zone, often referred to as the
      Standard Time offset.  Many locations adjust their Standard Time

      forward or backward by one hour, in order to accommodate seasonal
      changes in number of daylight hours, often referred to as Daylight
      Saving Time.  Some locations adjust their time by a fraction of an
      hour.  Standard Time is also known as Winter Time.  Daylight
      Saving Time is also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal
      Time in certain countries.  The following table shows the changes
      in time zone rules in effect for New York City starting from 1967.
      Each line represents a description or rule for a particular
      observance.

         Note: The specification of a global time zone registry is not
         addressed by this document and is left for future study.
         However, implementers may find the TZ Database [TZDB] a useful
         reference.  It is an informal, public-domain collection of time
         zone information, which is currently being maintained by
         volunteer Internet participants, and is used in several
         operating systems.  This database contains current and
         historical time zone information for a wide variety of
         locations around the globe; it provides a time zone identifier
         for every unique time zone rule set in actual use since 1970,
         with historical data going back to the introduction of standard
         time.

      Interoperability between two calendaring and scheduling
      applications, especially for recurring events, to-dos or journal
      entries, is dependent on the ability to capture and convey date
      and time information in an unambiguous format.  The specification
      of current time zone information is integral to this behavior.

      If present, the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component defines the set of
      Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time observances (or rules) for
      a particular time zone for a given interval of time.  The
      "VTIMEZONE" calendar component cannot be nested within other
      calendar components.  Multiple "VTIMEZONE" calendar components can
      exist in an iCalendar object.  In this situation, each "VTIMEZONE"



Desruisseaux             Expires August 2, 2007                [Page 61]

      MUST represent a unique time zone definition.  This is necessary
      for some classes of events, such as airline flights, that start in
      one time zone and end in another.

      The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be present if the
      iCalendar object contains an "RRULE" that generates dates on both
      sides of a time zone shift (e.g., both in Standard Time and
      Daylight Saving Time) unless the iCalendar object intends to
      convey a floating time (see Section 3.3.12 for proper
      interpretation of floating time).  It can be present if the
      iCalendar object does not contain such a "RRULE".  In addition, if
      a "RRULE" is present, there MUST be valid time zone information
      for all recurrence instances.

      The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST include the "TZID"
      property and at least one definition of a "STANDARD" or "DAYLIGHT"
      subcomponent.  The "STANDARD" or "DAYLIGHT" subcomponent.  MUST
      include the "DTSTART", "TZOFFSETFROM" and "TZOFFSETTO" properties.

      An individual "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be specified for
      each unique "TZID" parameter value specified in the iCalendar
      object.

      Each "VTIMEZONE" calendar component consists of a collection of
      one or more sub-components that describe the rule for a particular
      observance (either a Standard Time or a Daylight Saving Time
      observance).  The "STANDARD" sub-component consists of a
      collection of properties that describe Standard Time.  The
      "DAYLIGHT" sub-component consists of a collection of properties
      that describe Daylight Saving Time.  In general this collection of
      properties consists of:

      *  the first onset date-time for the observance;

      *  the last onset date-time for the observance, if a last onset is
         known;

      *  the offset to be applied for the observance;

      *  a rule that describes the day and time when the observance
         takes effect;

      *  an optional name for the observance.

      For a given time zone, there may be multiple unique definitions of
      the observances over a period of time.  Each observance is
      described using either a "STANDARD" or "DAYLIGHT" sub-component.
      The collection of these sub-components is used to describe the
      time zone for a given period of time.  The offset to apply at any
      given time is found by locating the observance that has the last
      onset date and time before the time in question, and using the
      offset value from that observance.

      The top-level properties in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar component are:

      The mandatory "TZID" property is a text value that uniquely
      identifies the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component within the scope of
      an iCalendar object.

      The optional "LAST-MODIFIED" property is a UTC value that
      specifies the date and time that this time zone definition was
      last updated.

      The optional "TZURL" property is a url value that points to a
      published "VTIMEZONE" definition.  "TZURL" SHOULD refer to a
      resource that is accessible by anyone who might need to interpret
      the object.  This SHOULD NOT normally be a "file" URL or other URL
      that is not widely-accessible.

      The collection of properties that are used to define the
      "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components include:

      The mandatory "DTSTART" property gives the effective onset date
      and local time for the time zone sub-component definition.
      "DTSTART" in this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME
      value.

      The mandatory "TZOFFSETFROM" property gives the UTC offset which
      is in use when the onset of this time zone observance begins.
      "TZOFFSETFROM" is combined with "DTSTART" to define the effective
      onset for the time zone sub-component definition.  For example,
      the following represents the time at which the observance of
      Standard Time took effect in Fall 1967 for New York City:

        DTSTART:19671029T020000

        TZOFFSETFROM:-0400

      The mandatory "TZOFFSETTO" property gives the UTC offset for the
      time zone sub-component (Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time)
      when this observance is in use.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      The optional "TZNAME" property is the customary name for the time
      zone.  It may be specified multiple times, to allow for specifying
      multiple language variants of the time zone names.  This could be
      used for displaying dates.

      If specified, the onset for the observance defined by the time
      zone sub-component is defined by either the "RRULE" or "RDATE"
      property.  If neither is specified, only one sub-component can be
      specified in the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component and it is assumed
      that the single observance specified is always in effect.

      The "RRULE" property defines the recurrence rule for the onset of
      the observance defined by this time zone sub-component.  Some
      specific requirements for the usage of "RRULE" for this purpose
      include:

      *  If observance is known to have an effective end date, the
         "UNTIL" recurrence rule parameter MUST be used to specify the
         last valid onset of this observance (i.e., the UNTIL date-time
         will be equal to the last instance generated by the recurrence
         pattern).  It MUST be specified in UTC time.

      *  The "DTSTART" and the "TZOFFSETTO" properties MUST be used when
         generating the onset date-time values (instances) from the
         "RRULE".

      Alternatively, the "RDATE" property can be used to define the
      onset of the observance by giving the individual onset date and
      times.  "RDATE" in this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-
      TIME value .

      The optional "COMMENT" property is also allowed for descriptive
      explanatory text.

   Example:  The following are examples of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
      component:

      This is an example showing time zone information for the Eastern
      United States using "RDATE" property.  Note that this is only
      suitable for a recurring event that starts on or later than April
      6, 1997 at 03:00:00 EDT (i.e., the earliest effective transition
      date and time) and ends no later than April 7, 1998 02:00:00 EST
      (i.e., latest valid date and time for EST in this scenario).  For
      example, this can be used for a recurring event that occurs every
      Friday, 8:00AM-9:00 AM, starting June 1, 1997, ending December 31,
      1997.

   Description:  A "VALARM" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a
      to-do.  For example, it may be used to define a reminder for a
      pending event or an overdue to-do.

      The "VALARM" calendar component MUST include the "ACTION" and
      "TRIGGER" properties.  The "ACTION" property further constrains
      the "VALARM" calendar component in the following ways:

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      When the action is "AUDIO", the alarm can also include one and
      only one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a sound resource,
      which is rendered when the alarm is triggered.

      When the action is "DISPLAY", the alarm MUST also include a
      "DESCRIPTION" property, which contains the text to be displayed
      when the alarm is triggered.

      When the action is "EMAIL", the alarm MUST include a "DESCRIPTION"
      property, which contains the text to be used as the message body,
      a "SUMMARY" property, which contains the text to be used as the
      message subject, and one or more "ATTENDEE" properties, which
      contain the email address of attendees to receive the message.  It
      can also include one or more "ATTACH" properties, which are
      intended to be sent as message attachments.  When the alarm is
      triggered, the email message is sent.

      When the action is "PROCEDURE", the alarm MUST include one and
      only one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a procedure
      resource, which is invoked when the alarm is triggered.

      The "VALARM" calendar component MUST only appear within either a
      "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.  "VALARM" calendar
      components cannot be nested.  Multiple mutually independent
      "VALARM" calendar components can be specified for a single
      "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.

      The "TRIGGER" property specifies when the alarm will be triggered.
      The "TRIGGER" property specifies a duration prior to the start of
      an event or a to-do.  The "TRIGGER" edge may be explicitly set to
      be relative to the "START" or "END" of the event or to-do with the
      "RELATED" parameter of the "TRIGGER" property.  The "TRIGGER"
      property value type can alternatively be set to an absolute
      calendar date with UTC time.

      In an alarm set to trigger on the "START" of an event or to-do,
      the "DTSTART" property MUST be present in the associated event or
      to-do.  In an alarm in a "VEVENT" calendar component set to
      trigger on the "END" of the event, either the "DTEND" property
      MUST be present, or the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST
      both be present.  In an alarm in a "VTODO" calendar component set
      to trigger on the "END" of the to-do, either the "DUE" property
      MUST be present, or the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST
      both be present.

      The alarm can be defined such that it triggers repeatedly.  A
      definition of an alarm with a repeating trigger MUST include both
      the "DURATION" and "REPEAT" properties.  The "DURATION" property
      specifies the delay period, after which the alarm will repeat.
      The "REPEAT" property specifies the number of additional
      repetitions that the alarm will be triggered.  This repetition
      count is in addition to the initial triggering of the alarm.  Both
      of these properties MUST be present in order to specify a
      repeating alarm.  If one of these two properties is absent, then
      the alarm will not repeat beyond the initial trigger.

      The "ACTION" property is used within the "VALARM" calendar
      component to specify the type of action invoked when the alarm is
      triggered.  The "VALARM" properties provide enough information for
      a specific action to be invoked.  It is typically the
      responsibility of a "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) to deliver the
      alarm in the specified fashion.  An "ACTION" property value of
      AUDIO specifies an alarm that causes a sound to be played to alert
      the user; DISPLAY specifies an alarm that causes a text message to
      be displayed to the user; EMAIL specifies an alarm that causes an
      electronic email message to be delivered to one or more email
      addresses; and PROCEDURE specifies an alarm that causes a
      procedure to be executed.  The "ACTION" property MUST specify one
      and only one of these values.

      In an AUDIO alarm, if the optional "ATTACH" property is included,
      it MUST specify an audio sound resource.  The intention is that
      the sound will be played as the alarm effect.  If an "ATTACH"
      property is specified that does not refer to a sound resource, or
      if the specified sound resource cannot be rendered (because its
      format is unsupported, or because it cannot be retrieved), then
      the CUA or other entity responsible for playing the sound may
      choose a fallback action, such as playing a built-in default
      sound, or playing no sound at all.

      In a DISPLAY alarm, the intended alarm effect is for the text
      value of the "DESCRIPTION" property to be displayed to the user.

      In an EMAIL alarm, the intended alarm effect is for an email
      message to be composed and delivered to all the addresses
      specified by the "ATTENDEE" properties in the "VALARM" calendar
      component.  The "DESCRIPTION" property of the "VALARM" calendar
      component MUST be used as the body text of the message, and the
      "SUMMARY" property MUST be used as the subject text.  Any "ATTACH"
      properties in the "VALARM" calendar component SHOULD be sent as
      attachments to the message.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      In a PROCEDURE alarm, the "ATTACH" property in the "VALARM"
      calendar component MUST specify a procedure or program that is
      intended to be invoked as the alarm effect.  If the procedure or
      program is in a format that cannot be rendered, then no procedure
      alarm will be invoked.  If the "DESCRIPTION" property is present,
      its value specifies the argument string to be passed to the
      procedure or program.  "Calendar User Agents" that receive an
      iCalendar object with this category of alarm, can disable or allow
      the "Calendar User" to disable, or otherwise ignore this type of
      alarm.  While a very useful alarm capability, the PROCEDURE type
      of alarm SHOULD be treated by the "Calendar User Agent" as a
      potential security risk.

   Example:  The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component
      that specifies an audio alarm that will sound at a precise time
      and repeat 4 more times at 15 minute intervals:

        BEGIN:VALARM
        TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19970317T133000Z
        REPEAT:4
        DURATION:PT15M
        ACTION:AUDIO
        ATTACH;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:ftp://example.com/pub/
         sounds/bell-01.aud
        END:VALARM

      The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
      specifies a display alarm that will trigger 30 minutes before the
      scheduled start of the event or of the to-do it is associated with
      and will repeat 2 more times at 15 minute intervals:

        BEGIN:VALARM
        TRIGGER:-PT30M
        REPEAT:2
        DURATION:PT15M
        ACTION:DISPLAY
        DESCRIPTION:Breakfast meeting with executive\n
         team at 8:30 AM EST.
        END:VALARM

      The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
      specifies an email alarm that will trigger 2 days before the
      scheduled due date/time of a to-do it is associated with.  It does
      not repeat.  The email has a subject, body and attachment link.

3.7.  Calendar Properties

   The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the iCalendar
   object, as a whole.  These properties do not appear within a calendar
   component.  They SHOULD be specified after the "BEGIN:VCALENDAR"
   delimiter string and prior to any calendar component.

3.7.1.  Calendar Scale

   Property Name:  CALSCALE

   Purpose:  This property defines the calendar scale used for the
      calendar information specified in the iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


   Conformance:  Property can be specified in an iCalendar object.  The
      default value is "GREGORIAN".

   Description:  This memo is based on the Gregorian calendar scale.
      The Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if this property is not
      specified in the iCalendar object.  It is expected that other
      calendar scales will be defined in other specifications or by
      future versions of this memo.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        calscale   = "CALSCALE" calparam ":" calvalue CRLF

        calparam   = *(";" xparam)

        calvalue   = "GREGORIAN" / iana-token

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        CALSCALE:GREGORIAN

3.7.2.  Method

   Property Name:  METHOD

   Purpose:  This property defines the iCalendar object method
      associated with the calendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
      property MUST be the same as the Content-Type "method" parameter
      value.  If either the "METHOD" property or the Content-Type
      "method" parameter is specified, then the other MUST also be
      specified.

      No methods are defined by this specification.  This is the subject
      of other specifications, such as the iCalendar Transport-
      independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined by
      [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

      If this property is not present in the iCalendar object, then a
      scheduling transaction MUST NOT be assumed.  In such cases, the
      iCalendar object is merely being used to transport a snapshot of
      some calendar information; without the intention of conveying a
      scheduling semantic.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        method     = "METHOD" metparam ":" metvalue CRLF

        metparam   = *(";" xparam)

        metvalue   = iana-token

   Example:  The following is a hypothetical example of this property to
      convey that the iCalendar object is a scheduling request :

        METHOD:REQUEST

3.7.3.  Product Identifier

   Property Name:  PRODID

   Purpose:  This property specifies the identifier for the product that
      created the iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property MUST be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  The vendor of the implementation SHOULD assure that
      this is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as
      an FPI value, as defined in [ISO.9070.1991].

      This property SHOULD not be used to alter the interpretation of an
      iCalendar object beyond the semantics specified in this memo.  For
      example, it is not to be used to further the understanding of non-
      standard properties.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        prodid     = "PRODID" pidparam ":" pidvalue CRLF

        pidparam   = *(";" xparam)

        pidvalue   = text
        ;Any text that describes the product and version
        ;and that is generally assured of being unique.

   Example:  The following is an example of this property.  It does not
      imply that English is the default language.

        PRODID:-//ABC Corporation//NONSGML My Product//EN

3.7.4.  Version

   Property Name:  VERSION

   Purpose:  This property specifies the identifier corresponding to the
      highest version number or the minimum and maximum range of the
      iCalendar specification that is required in order to interpret the
      iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified by an iCalendar object,
      but MUST only be specified once.

   Description:  A value of "2.0" corresponds to this memo.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        version    = "VERSION" verparam ":" vervalue CRLF

        verparam   = *(";" xparam)

        vervalue   = "2.0"         ;This memo
                   / maxver
                   / (minver ";" maxver)

        minver     = <A IANA registered iCalendar version identifier>
        ;Minimum iCalendar version needed to parse the iCalendar object

        maxver     = <A IANA registered iCalendar version identifier>
        ;Maximum iCalendar version needed to parse the iCalendar object

        VERSION:2.0

3.8.  Component Properties

   The following properties can appear within calendar components, as
   specified by each component property definition.

3.8.1.  Descriptive Component Properties

   The following properties specify descriptive information about
   calendar components.

3.8.1.1.  Attachment

   Property Name:  ATTACH

   Purpose:  This property provides the capability to associate a
      document object with a calendar component.

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to BINARY to indicate inline binary
      encoded content information.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, inline encoding, format type and
      value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in a "VEVENT", "VTODO",
      "VJOURNAL" or "VALARM" calendar components.

   Description:  This property can be specified within "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", or "VALARM" calendar components.  This
      property can be specified multiple times within an iCalendar
      object.

3.8.1.3.  Classification

   Property Name:  CLASS

   Purpose:  This property defines the access classification for a
      calendar component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified once in a "VEVENT",
      "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description:  An access classification is only one component of the
      general security system within a calendar application.  It
      provides a method of capturing the scope of the access the
      calendar owner intends for information within an individual
      calendar entry.  The access classification of an individual
      iCalendar component is useful when measured along with the other
      security components of a calendar system (e.g., calendar user

      authentication, authorization, access rights, access role, etc.).
      Hence, the semantics of the individual access classifications
      cannot be completely defined by this memo alone.  Additionally,
      due to the "blind" nature of most exchange processes using this
      memo, these access classifications cannot serve as an enforcement
      statement for a system receiving an iCalendar object.  Rather,
      they provide a method for capturing the intention of the calendar
      owner for the access to the calendar component.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        class      = "CLASS" classparam ":" classvalue CRLF

        classparam = *(";" xparam)

        classvalue = "PUBLIC" / "PRIVATE" / "CONFIDENTIAL" / iana-token

   Description:  This property value specifies latitude and longitude,
      in that order (i.e., "LAT LON" ordering).  The longitude
      represents the location East or West of the prime meridian as a
      positive or negative real number, respectively.  The longitude and
      latitude values MAY be specified up to six decimal places, which
      will allow for accuracy to within one meter of geographical
      position.  Receiving applications MUST accept values of this
      precision and MAY truncate values of greater precision.

      Values for latitude and longitude shall be expressed as decimal
      fractions of degrees.  Whole degrees of latitude shall be
      represented by a two-digit decimal number ranging from 0 through
      90.  Whole degrees of longitude shall be represented by a decimal
      number ranging from 0 through 180.  When a decimal fraction of a
      degree is specified, it shall be separated from the whole number
      of degrees by a decimal point.

      Latitudes north of the equator shall be specified by a plus sign
      (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
      designating degrees.  Latitudes south of the Equator shall be
      designated by a minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
      degrees.  A point on the Equator shall be assigned to the Northern
      Hemisphere.

      Longitudes east of the prime meridian shall be specified by a plus
      sign (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the
      digits designating degrees.  Longitudes west of the meridian shall
      be designated by minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
      degrees.  A point on the prime meridian shall be assigned to the
      Eastern Hemisphere.  A point on the 180th meridian shall be
      assigned to the Western Hemisphere.  One exception to this last
      convention is permitted.  For the special condition of describing
      a band of latitude around the earth, the East Bounding Coordinate
      data element shall be assigned the value +180 (180) degrees.

      Any spatial address with a latitude of +90 (90) or -90 degrees
      will specify the position at the North or South Pole,
      respectively.  The component for longitude may have any legal
      value.

      With the exception of the special condition described above, this
      form is specified in Department of Commerce, 1986, Representation
      of geographic point locations for information interchange (Federal
      Information Processing Standard 70-1): Washington, Department of
      Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.

      "Organizer".

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in a "VTODO" calendar
      component.

   Description:  The property value is a positive integer between zero
      and one hundred.  A value of "0" indicates the to-do has not yet
      been started.  A value of "100" indicates that the to-do has been
      completed.  Integer values in between indicate the percent
      partially complete.

      When a to-do is assigned to multiple individuals, the property
      value indicates the percent complete for that portion of the to-do
      assigned to the assignee or delegatee.  For example, if a to-do is
      assigned to both individuals "A" and "B".  A reply from "A" with a
      percent complete of "70" indicates that "A" has completed 70% of
      the to-do assigned to them.  A reply from "B" with a percent
      complete of "50" indicates "B" has completed 50% of the to-do
      assigned to them.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        percent = "PERCENT-COMPLETE" pctparam ":" integer CRLF

3.8.1.9.  Priority

   Property Name:  PRIORITY

   Purpose:  This property defines the relative priority for a calendar
      component.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in a "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
      calendar component.

   Description:  This priority is specified as an integer in the range
      zero to nine.  A value of zero (US-ASCII decimal 48) specifies an
      undefined priority.  A value of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) is the
      highest priority.  A value of two (US-ASCII decimal 50) is the
      second highest priority.  Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing
      ordinal priority.  A value of nine (US-ASCII decimal 57 ) is the
      lowest priority.

      A CUA with a three-level priority scheme of "HIGH", "MEDIUM" and
      "LOW" is mapped into this property such that a property value in
      the range of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) to four (US-ASCII decimal
      52) specifies "HIGH" priority.  A value of five (US-ASCII decimal

      53) is the normal or "MEDIUM" priority.  A value in the range of
      six (US-ASCII decimal 54) to nine (US-ASCII decimal 57 ) is "LOW"
      priority.

      A CUA with a priority schema of "A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", ...,
      "C3" is mapped into this property such that a property value of
      one (US-ASCII decimal 49) specifies "A1", a property value of two
      (US-ASCII decimal 50) specifies "A2", a property value of three
      (US-ASCII decimal 51) specifies "A3", and so forth up to a
      property value of 9 (US-ASCII decimal 57 ) specifies "C3".

      Other integer values are reserved for future use.

      Within a "VEVENT" calendar component, this property specifies a
      priority for the event.  This property may be useful when more
      than one event is scheduled for a given time period.

      Within a "VTODO" calendar component, this property specified a
      priority for the to-do.  This property is useful in prioritizing
      multiple action items for a given time period.

   Format Definition:  This . property is defined by the following
      notation:

        priority   = "PRIORITY" prioparam ":" priovalue CRLF
        ;Default is zero (i.e., undefined)

        prioparam  = *(";" xparam)

        priovalue   = integer       ;Must be in the range [0..9]
           ; All other values are reserved for future use

   Example:  The following is an example of a property with the highest
      priority:

      "VFREEBUSY" or "VALARM" calendar components.

   Description:  In a "VEVENT" calendar component the property may be
      used to specify a duration of the event, instead of an explicit
      end date/time.  In a "VTODO" calendar component the property may
      be used to specify a duration for the to-do, instead of an
      explicit due date/time.  In a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component the
      property may be used to specify the interval of free time being
      requested.  In a "VALARM" calendar component the property may be
      used to specify the delay period prior to repeating an alarm.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        duration   = "DURATION" durparam ":" dur-value CRLF
                     ;consisting of a positive duration of time.

        durparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Value Type:  PERIOD

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard or free/busy time type property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar
      component.

   Description:  These time periods can be specified as either a start
      and end date-time or a start date-time and duration.  The date and
      time MUST be a UTC time format.

      "FREEBUSY" properties within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component
      SHOULD be sorted in ascending order, based on start time and then
      end time, with the earliest periods first.

      The "FREEBUSY" property can specify more than one value, separated
      by the COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).  In such cases, the
      "FREEBUSY" property values MUST all be of the same "FBTYPE"
      property parameter type (e.g., all values of a particular "FBTYPE"
      listed together in a single property).

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        freebusy   = "FREEBUSY" fbparam ":" fbvalue CRLF

        fbparam    = *(
                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

3.8.2.7.  Time Transparency

   Property Name:  TRANSP

   Purpose:  This property defines whether an event is transparent or
      not to busy time searches.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in a "VEVENT"
      calendar component.

   Description:  Time Transparency is the characteristic of an event
      that determines whether it appears to consume time on a calendar.
      Events that consume actual time for the individual or resource
      associated with the calendar SHOULD be recorded as OPAQUE,
      allowing them to be detected by free-busy time searches.  Other
      events, which do not take up the individual's (or resource's) time
      SHOULD be recorded as TRANSPARENT, making them invisible to free-
      busy time searches.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        transp     = "TRANSP" transparam ":" transvalue CRLF

         transparam = *(";" xparam)

         transvalue = "OPAQUE"

3.8.3.  Time Zone Component Properties

   The following properties specify time zone information in calendar
   components.

3.8.3.1.  Time Zone Identifier

   Property Name:  TZID

   Purpose:  This property specifies the text value that uniquely
      identifies the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in a "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component.

   Description:  This is the label by which a time zone calendar
      component is referenced by any iCalendar properties whose value
      type is either DATE-TIME or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC
      or a "floating" time.  The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-
      ASCII decimal 47) as a prefix, indicates that this "TZID"
      represents an unique ID in a globally defined time zone registry
      (when such registry is defined).

         Note: This document does not define a naming convention for
         time zone identifiers.  Implementers may want to use the naming
         conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such
         as the public-domain TZ Database [TZDB].  The specification of
         globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
         document and is left for future study.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in a "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component.

   Description:  This property provides a means for a "VTIMEZONE"
      component to point to a network location that can be used to
      retrieve an up-to-date version of itself.  This provides a hook to
      handle changes government bodies impose upon time zone
      definitions.  Retrieval of this resource results in an iCalendar
      object containing a single "VTIMEZONE" component and a "METHOD"
      property set to PUBLISH.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        tzurl      = "TZURL" tzurlparam ":" uri CRLF

3.8.4.1.  Attendee

   Property Name:  ATTENDEE

   Purpose:  This property defines an "Attendee" within a calendar
      component.

   Value Type:  CAL-ADDRESS

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, language, calendar user type,
      group or list membership, participation role, participation
      status, RSVP expectation, delegatee, delegator, sent by, common
      name or directory entry reference property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
      that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity.  This property
      MUST NOT be specified in an iCalendar object when publishing the
      calendar information (e.g., NOT in an iCalendar object that
      specifies the publication of a calendar user's busy time, event,
      to-do or journal).  This property is not specified in an iCalendar
      object that specifies only a time zone definition or that defines
      calendar components that are not group scheduled components, but
      are components only on a single user's calendar.

   Description:  This property MUST only be specified within calendar
      components to specify participants, non-participants and the chair
      of a group scheduled calendar entity.  The property is specified
      within an "EMAIL" category of the "VALARM" calendar component to
      specify an email address that is to receive the email type of
      iCalendar alarm.

      The property parameter "CN" is for the common or displayable name
      associated with the calendar address; "ROLE", for the intended
      role that the attendee will have in the calendar component;
      "PARTSTAT", for the status of the attendee's participation;
      "RSVP", for indicating whether the favor of a reply is requested;
      "CUTYPE", to indicate the type of calendar user; "MEMBER", to
      indicate the groups that the attendee belongs to; "DELEGATED-TO",
      to indicate the calendar users that the original request was
      delegated to; and "DELEGATED-FROM", to indicate whom the request
      was delegated from; "SENT-BY", to indicate whom is acting on
      behalf of the "ATTENDEE"; and "DIR", to indicate the URI that
      points to the directory information corresponding to the attendee.
      These property parameters can be specified on an "ATTENDEE"
      property in either a "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar
      component.  They MUST NOT be specified in an "ATTENDEE" property
      in a "VFREEBUSY" or "VALARM" calendar component.  If the

3.8.4.3.  Organizer

   Property Name:  ORGANIZER

   Purpose:  This property defines the organizer for a calendar
      component.

   Value Type:  CAL-ADDRESS

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, language, common name, directory
      entry reference, sent by property parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
      that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity.  This property
      MUST be specified in an iCalendar object that specifies the
      publication of a calendar user's busy time.  This property MUST
      NOT be specified in an iCalendar object that specifies only a time
      zone definition or that defines calendar components that are not
      group scheduled components, but are components only on a single
      user's calendar.

   Description:  This property is specified within the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar components to specify the organizer
      of a group scheduled calendar entity.  The property is specified
      within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component to specify the calendar

3.8.4.4.  Recurrence ID

   Property Name:  RECURRENCE-ID

   Purpose:  This property is used in conjunction with the "UID" and
      "SEQUENCE" property to identify a specific instance of a recurring
      "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.  The property
      value is the effective value of the "DTSTART" property of the
      recurrence instance.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
      The time format can be any of the valid forms defined for a DATE-
      TIME value type.  See DATE-TIME value type definition for specific
      interpretations of the various forms.  The value type can be set
      to DATE.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property, value data type, and
      time zone identifier parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in an iCalendar object
      containing a recurring calendar component.

   Description:  The full range of calendar components specified by a
      recurrence set is referenced by referring to just the "UID"
      property value corresponding to the calendar component.  The
      "RECURRENCE-ID" property allows the reference to an individual
      instance within the recurrence set.

      If the value of the "DTSTART" property is a DATE type value, then
      the value MUST be the calendar date for the recurrence instance.

      The date/time value is set to the time when the original
      recurrence instance would occur; meaning that if the intent is to
      change a Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time is still set to
      the original Friday meeting.

      The "RECURRENCE-ID" property is used in conjunction with the "UID"
      and "SEQUENCE" property to identify a particular instance of a
      recurring event, to-do or journal.  For a given pair of "UID" and
      "SEQUENCE" property values, the "RECURRENCE-ID" value for a
      recurrence instance is fixed.  When the definition of the
      recurrence set for a calendar component changes, and hence the
      "SEQUENCE" property value changes, the "RECURRENCE-ID" for a given
      recurrence instance might also change.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

3.8.4.5.  Related To

   Property Name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and another.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard and relationship type property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified one or more times in the
      "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description:  The property value consists of the persistent, globally
      unique identifier of another calendar component.  This value would
      be represented in a calendar component by the "UID" property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship.  The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar
      component is a subordinate of the referenced calendar component.
      The CHILD relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      superior of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a peer of
      the referenced calendar component.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
      an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
      property is intended only to provide information on the
      relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

      associated with the iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  URI

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description:  This property may be used in a calendar component to
      convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the calendar
      information associated with the calendar component can be found.
      This memo does not attempt to standardize the form of the URI, nor
      the format of the resource pointed to by the property value.  If
      the URL property and Content-Location MIME header are both
      specified, they MUST point to the same resource.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        url        = "URL" urlparam ":" uri CRLF

        urlparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        URL:http://abc.com/pub/calendars/jsmith/mytime.ics

3.8.4.7.  Unique Identifier

   Property Name:  UID

   Purpose:  This property defines the persistent, globally unique
      identifier for the calendar component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property MUST be specified in the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description:  The "UID" itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.
      The generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier
      is unique.  There are several algorithms that can be used to
      accomplish this.  The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the
      identical syntax to the [RFC2822] addr-spec.  A good method to
      assure uniqueness is to put the domain name or a domain literal IP
      address of the host on which the identifier was created on the
      right hand side of the "@", and on the left hand side, put a
      combination of the current calendar date and time of day (i.e.,
      formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some other currently
      unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on the system
      (for example, a process id number).  Using a date/time value on
      the left hand side and a domain name or domain literal on the
      right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since no
      two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP address at
      the same time.  Though other algorithms will work, it is
      RECOMMENDED that the right hand side contain some domain
      identifier (either of the host itself or otherwise) such that the
      generator of the message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness
      of the left hand side within the scope of that domain.

      This is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the
      referenced "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

      The full range of calendar components specified by a recurrence
      set is referenced by referring to just the "UID" property value
      corresponding to the calendar component.  The "RECURRENCE-ID"
      property allows the reference to an individual instance within the
      recurrence set.

      This property is an important method for group scheduling
      applications to match requests with later replies, modifications
      or deletion requests.  Calendaring and scheduling applications
      MUST generate this property in "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL"
      calendar components to assure interoperability with other group
      scheduling applications.  This identifier is created by the
      calendar system that generates an iCalendar object.

      Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
      least 255 octets for this property but MUST NOT truncate values in
      the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet sequence.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        uid        = "UID" uidparam ":" text CRLF

        uidparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

3.8.5.  Recurrence Component Properties

   The following properties specify recurrence information in calendar
   components.

3.8.5.1.  Exception Date/Times

   Property Name:  EXDATE

   Purpose:  This property defines the list of date/time exceptions for
      recurring events, to-dos, journal entries or time zone
      definitions.

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
      The value type can be set to DATE.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, value data type and time zone
      identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" calendar components as well as in the
      "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components of the "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component.

   Description:  The exception dates, if specified, are used in
      computing the recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete
      set of recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The
      recurrence set is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART"
      property along with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties
      contained within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property
      defines the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART"
      property value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property

      value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
      The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
      start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE" and
      "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start date and times
      specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start date
      and times specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence over
      those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and
      "RRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE"
      and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
      Duplicate instances are ignored.

      The "EXDATE" property can be used to exclude the value specified
      in "DTSTART".  However, in such cases the original "DTSTART" date
      MUST still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system
      because the original "DTSTART" value has inherent usage
      dependencies by other properties such as the "RECURRENCE-ID".

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        exdate     = "EXDATE" exdtparam ":" exdtval *("," exdtval) CRLF

        exdtparam  = *(

                   ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   (";" "VALUE" "=" ("DATE-TIME" / "DATE")) /

                   (";" tzidparam) /

                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MAY occur more than once

                   (";" xparam)

                   )

        exdtval    = date-time / date
        ;Value MUST match value type

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        EXDATE:19960402T010000Z,19960403T010000Z,19960404T010000Z

3.8.5.2.  Recurrence Date/Times

   Property Name:  RDATE

   Purpose:  This property defines the list of date/times for recurring
      events, to-dos, journal entries or time zone definitions.

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
      The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, value data type and time zone
      identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" calendar components as well as in the
      "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components of the "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component.

   Description:  This property can appear along with the "RRULE"
      property to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences.
      When they both appear in a recurring component, the recurrence
      instances are defined by the union of occurrences defined by both
      the "RDATE" and "RRULE".

      The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
      recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
      recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
      is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along
      with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties contained
      within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property defines
      the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART" property
      value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property
      value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
      The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
      start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE" and
      "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start date and times
      specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start date/
      times specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence over those
      specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE").
      Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE"
      properties, only one recurrence is considered.  Duplicate
      instances are ignored.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

3.8.5.3.  Recurrence Rule

   Property Name:  RRULE

   Purpose:  This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for
      recurring events, to-dos, journal entries or time zone
      definitions.

   Value Type:  RECUR

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",
      "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar components as well as in the
      "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components of the "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component, but it SHOULD NOT be specified more than once.
      The recurrence set generated with multiple "RRULE" properties is
      undefined.

   Description:  The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
      the recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
      recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
      is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along
      with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties contained
      within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property defines
      the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART" property
      value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property
      value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
      The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
      start date/times generated by any of the specified "RRULE" and
      "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start date/times
      specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start date/
      times specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence over those
      specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE").
      Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE"
      properties, only one recurrence is considered.  Duplicate
      instances are ignored.

      The "DTSTART" property specified within the iCalendar object
      defines the first instance of the recurrence.  In most cases, a
      "DTSTART" property of DATE-TIME value type used with a recurrence
      rule, should be specified as a date with local time and time zone
      reference to make sure all the recurrence instances start at the
      same local time regardless of time zone changes.

      Any duration associated with the calendar component applies to all
      members of the generated recurrence set.  The duration of a
      specific recurrence may be modified in an exception component or
      simply by using an "RDATE" property of PERIOD value type.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        rrule      = "RRULE" rrulparam ":" recur CRLF

        rrulparam  = *(";" xparam)

   Purpose:  This property defines the action to be invoked when an
      alarm is triggered.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified once in a "VALARM"
      calendar component.

   Description:  Each "VALARM" calendar component has a particular type
      of action associated with it.  This property specifies the type of
      action

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        action     = "ACTION" actionparam ":" actionvalue CRLF

        actionparam        = *(";" xparam)

        actionvalue        = "AUDIO" / "DISPLAY" / "EMAIL" / "PROCEDURE"
                           / iana-token / x-name

   Example:  The following are examples of this property in a "VALARM"
      calendar component:

        ACTION:AUDIO

        ACTION:DISPLAY

        ACTION:PROCEDURE

3.8.6.2.  Repeat Count

   Property Name:  REPEAT

   Purpose:  This property defines the number of time the alarm should
      be repeated, after the initial trigger.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in a "VALARM" calendar
      component.

   Description:  If the alarm triggers more than once, then this
      property MUST be specified along with the "DURATION" property.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        repeat  = "REPEAT" repparam ":" integer CRLF
        ;Default is "0", zero.

        repparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property for an alarm
      that repeats 4 additional times with a 5 minute delay after the
      initial triggering of the alarm:

        REPEAT:4
        DURATION:PT5M

3.8.6.3.  Trigger

   Property Name:  TRIGGER

   Purpose:  This property specifies when an alarm will trigger.

   Value Type:  The default value type is "DURATION".  The value type
      can be set to a DATE-TIME value type, in which case the value MUST
      specify a UTC formatted DATE-TIME value.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, value data type, time zone
      identifier or trigger relationship property parameters can be
      specified on this property.  The trigger relationship property
      parameter MUST only be specified when the value type is
      "DURATION".

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in the "VALARM"
      calendar component.

   Description:  Within the "VALARM" calendar component, this property
      defines when the alarm will trigger.  The default value type is
      "DURATION", specifying a relative time for the trigger of the
      alarm.  The default duration is relative to the start of an event
      or to-do that the alarm is associated with.  The duration can be
      explicitly set to trigger from either the end or the start of the
      associated event or to-do with the "RELATED" parameter.  A value
      of START will set the alarm to trigger off the start of the
      associated event or to-do.  A value of END will set the alarm to
      trigger off the end of the associated event or to-do.

      Either a positive or negative duration may be specified for the
      "TRIGGER" property.  An alarm with a positive duration is
      triggered after the associated start or end of the event or to-do.
      An alarm with a negative duration is triggered before the
      associated start or end of the event or to-do.

      The "RELATED" property parameter is not valid if the value type of
      the property is set to DATE-TIME (i.e., for an absolute date and
      time alarm trigger).  If a value type of DATE-TIME is specified,
      then the property value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.
      If an absolute trigger is specified on an alarm for a recurring

      absolute date/time, along with any specified repeating instances.

      If the trigger is set relative to START, then the "DTSTART"
      property MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
      calendar component.  If an alarm is specified for an event with
      the trigger set relative to the END, then the "DTEND" property or
      the "DTSTART" and "DURATION " properties MUST be present in the
      associated "VEVENT" calendar component.  If the alarm is specified
      for a to-do with a trigger set relative to the END, then either
      the "DUE" property or the "DTSTART" and "DURATION " properties
      MUST be present in the associated "VTODO" calendar component.

      Alarms specified in an event or to-do which is defined in terms of
      a DATE value type will be triggered relative to 00:00:00 UTC on
      the specified date.  For example, if "DTSTART" is a DATE value set
      to 19980205 then the duration trigger will be relative to
      19980205T000000Z.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


3.8.7.1.  Date/Time Created

   Property Name:  CREATED

   Purpose:  This property specifies the date and time that the calendar
      information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar
      store.

         Note: This is analogous to the creation date and time for a
         file in the file system.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified once in "VEVENT", "VTODO"
      or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description:  The date and time is a UTC value.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        created    = "CREATED" creaparam ":" date-time CRLF

        creaparam  = *(";" xparam)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        CREATED:19960329T133000Z

3.8.7.2.  Date/Time Stamp

   Property Name:  DTSTAMP

   Purpose:  This property indicates the date/time that the instance of
      the iCalendar object was created.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be included in the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


   Description:  The value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.

      This property is also useful to protocols such as
      [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis] that have inherent latency issues
      with the delivery of content.  This property will assist in the
      proper sequencing of messages containing iCalendar objects.

      This property is different than the "CREATED" and "LAST-MODIFIED"
      properties.  These two properties are used to specify when the
      particular calendar data in the calendar store was created and
      last modified.  This is different than when the iCalendar object
      representation of the calendar service information was created or
      last modified.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        dtstamp    = "DTSTAMP" stmparam ":" date-time CRLF

        stmparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:

        DTSTAMP:19971210T080000Z

3.8.7.3.  Last Modified

   Property Name:  LAST-MODIFIED

   Purpose:  This property specifies the date and time that the
      information associated with the calendar component was last
      revised in the calendar store.

         Note: This is analogous to the modification date and time for a
         file in the file system.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.

   Description:  The property value MUST be specified in the UTC time
      format.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        last-mod   = "LAST-MODIFIED" lstparam ":" date-time CRLF

        lstparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:  The following are examples of this property:

        LAST-MODIFIED:19960817T133000Z

3.8.7.4.  Sequence Number

   Property Name:  SEQUENCE

   Purpose:  This property defines the revision sequence number of the
      calendar component within a sequence of revisions.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
      "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

   Description:  When a calendar component is created, its sequence
      number is zero (US-ASCII decimal 48).  It is monotonically
      incremented by the "Organizer's" CUA each time the "Organizer"
      makes a significant revision to the calendar component.  When the
      "Organizer" makes changes to one of the following properties, the
      sequence number MUST be incremented:

      *  "DTSTART"

      *  "DTEND"

      *  "DURATION"

      *  "DUE"

      *  "RDATE"

      *  "RRULE"

      *  "EXDATE"

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      *  "STATUS"

      In addition, changes made by the "Organizer" to other properties
      can also force the sequence number to be incremented.  The
      "Organizer" CUA MUST increment the sequence number when ever it
      makes changes to properties in the calendar component that the
      "Organizer" deems will jeopardize the validity of the
      participation status of the "Attendees".  For example, changing
      the location of a meeting from one locale to another distant
      locale could effectively impact the participation status of the
      "Attendees".

      The "Organizer" includes this property in an iCalendar object that
      it sends to an "Attendee" to specify the current version of the
      calendar component.

      The "Attendee" includes this property in an iCalendar object that
      it sends to the "Organizer" to specify the version of the calendar
      component that the "Attendee" is referring to.

      A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
      "Organizer" uses to request a response from the "Attendees".  The
      "RSVP" parameter on the "ATTENDEE" property is used by the
      "Organizer" to indicate that a response from the "Attendees" is
      requested.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        seq = "SEQUENCE" seqparam ":" integer CRLF
        ; Default is "0"

        seqparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property for a calendar
      component that was just created by the "Organizer".

        SEQUENCE:0

      The following is an example of this property for a calendar
      component that has been revised two different times by the
      "Organizer".

        SEQUENCE:2

3.8.8.  Miscellaneous Component Properties

   The following properties specify information about a number of
   miscellaneous features of calendar components.

3.8.8.1.  Non-standard Properties

   Property Name:  Any property name with a "X-" prefix

   Purpose:  This class of property provides a framework for defining
      non-standard properties.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard and language property parameters
      can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in any calendar
      component.

   Description:  The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
      provides a "standard mechanism for doing non-standard things".
      This extension support is provided for implementers to "push the
      envelope" on the existing version of the memo.  Extension
      properties are specified by property and/or property parameter
      names that have the prefix text of "X-" (the two character
      sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X character followed by the HYPHEN-
      MINUS character).  It is recommended that vendors concatenate onto
      this sentinel another short prefix text to identify the vendor.
      This will facilitate readability of the extensions and minimize
      possible collision of names between different vendors.  User
      agents that support this content type are expected to be able to
      parse the extension properties and property parameters but can
      ignore them.

      At present, there is no registration authority for names of
      extension properties and property parameters.  The value type for
      this property is TEXT.  Optionally, the value type can be any of
      the other valid value types.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        x-prop = x-name *(";" parameter) ":" text CRLF
           ; Lines longer than 75 octets should be folded

   Example:  The following might be the ABC vendor's extension for an
      audio-clip form of subject property:

        X-ABC-MMSUBJ;VALUE=URI;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:http://www.example.
         org/mysubj.au

3.8.8.2.  Request Status

   Property Name:  REQUEST-STATUS

   Purpose:  This property defines the status code returned for a
      scheduling request.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard and language property parameters
      can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
      "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.

   Description:  This property is used to return status code information
      related to the processing of an associated iCalendar object.  The
      value type for this property is TEXT.

      The value consists of a short return status component, a longer
      return status description component, and optionally a status-
      specific data component.  The components of the value are
      separated by the SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

      The short return status is a PERIOD character (US-ASCII decimal
      46) separated 3-tuple of integers.  For example, "3.1.1".  The
      successive levels of integers provide for a successive level of
      status code granularity.

      The following are initial classes for the return status code.
      Individual iCalendar object methods will define specific return
      status codes for these classes.  In addition, other classes for
      the return status code may be defined using the registration
      process defined later in this memo.

   The following is an example of a to-do due on April 15, 1998.  An
   audio alarm has been specified to remind the calendar user at noon,
   the day before the to-do is expected to be completed and repeat
   hourly, four additional times.  The to-do definition has been
   modified twice since it was initially created.

5.  Recommended Practices

   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.

   1.   Content lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded.

   2.   A calendar entry with a "DTSTART" property but no "DTEND"
        property does not take up any time.  It is intended to represent
        an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time
        of day, such as an anniversary.  Since the event does not take
        up any time, it MUST NOT be used to record busy time no matter
        what the value for the "TRANSP" property.

   3.   When the "DTSTART" and "DTEND", for "VEVENT", "VJOURNAL" and
        "VFREEBUSY" calendar components, and "DTSTART" and "DUE", for
        "VTODO" calendar components, have the same value data type
        (e.g., DATE-TIME), they SHOULD specify values in the same time
        format (e.g., UTC time format).

   4.   When the combination of the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties on an
        iCalendar object produces multiple instances having the same
        start date/time, they should be collapsed to, and considered as,
        a single instance.

   5.   When a calendar user receives multiple requests for the same
        calendar component (e.g., REQUEST for a "VEVENT" calendar
        component) as a result of being on multiple mailing lists
        specified by "ATTENDEE" properties in the request, they SHOULD



Desruisseaux             Expires August 2, 2007               [Page 145]

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


        respond to only one of the requests.  The calendar user SHOULD
        also specify (using the "MEMBER" parameter of the "ATTENDEE"
        property) which mailing list they are a member of.

   6.   An implementation can truncate a "SUMMARY" property value to 255
        octets, but MUST NOT truncate the value in the middle of a UTF-8
        multi-octet sequence.

   7.   If seconds of the minute are not supported by an implementation,
        then a value of "00" SHOULD be specified for the seconds
        component in a time value.

   8.   If the value type parameter (VALUE=) contains an unknown value
        type, it SHOULD be treated as TEXT.

   9.   "TZURL" values SHOULD NOT be specified as a file URI type.  This
        URI form can be useful within an organization, but is
        problematic in the Internet.

   10.  Some possible English values for "CATEGORIES" property include
        "ANNIVERSARY", "APPOINTMENT", "BUSINESS", "EDUCATION",
        "HOLIDAY", "MEETING", "MISCELLANEOUS", "NON-WORKING HOURS", "NOT
        IN OFFICE", "PERSONAL", "PHONE CALL", "SICK DAY", "SPECIAL
        OCCASION", "TRAVEL", "VACATION".  Categories can be specified in
        any registered language.

   11.  Some possible English values for "RESOURCES" property include
        "CATERING", "CHAIRS", "COMPUTER PROJECTOR", "EASEL", "OVERHEAD
        PROJECTOR", "SPEAKER PHONE", "TABLE", "TV", "VCR", "VIDEO
        PHONE", "VEHICLE".  Resources can be specified in any registered
        language.


6.  Registration of Content Type Elements

   This section provides the process for registration of MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object methods and
   new or modified properties.

6.1.  Registration of New and Modified iCalendar Object Methods

   New MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object
   methods are registered by the publication of an IETF Request for
   Comments (RFC).  Changes to an iCalendar object method are registered
   by the publication of a revision of the RFC defining the method.

6.2.  Registration of New Properties

   This section defines procedures by which new properties or enumerated
   property values for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   can be registered with the IANA.  Non-IANA properties can be used by
   bilateral agreement, provided the associated properties names follow
   the "X-" convention.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

6.2.1.  Define the property

   A property is defined by completing the following template.

        To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

        Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX

        Property name:

        Property purpose:

        Property value type(s):

        Property parameter (s):

        Conformance:

        Description:

        Format definition:

        Examples:

   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

   Property name:  The name of the property, as it will appear in the
      body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line
      to the left of the colon ":".

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


   Property purpose:  The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
      delegate for the event or to-do, etc.).  Give a short but clear
      description.

   Property value type (s):  Any of the valid value types for the
      property value needs to be specified.  The default value type also
      needs to be specified.  If a new value type is specified, it needs
      to be declared in this section.

   Property parameter (s):  Any of the valid property parameters for the
      property needs to be specified.

   Conformance:  The calendar components that the property can appear in
      needs to be specified.

   Description:  Any special notes about the property, how it is to be
      used, etc.

   Format definition:  The ABNF for the property definition needs to be
      specified.

   Examples:  One or more examples of instances of the property needs to
      be specified.

6.2.2.  Post the Property definition

   The property description MUST be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

6.2.3.  Allow a comment period

   Discussion on the new property MUST be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks.  Consensus MUST be reached on the
   property before proceeding to the next step.

6.2.4.  Submit the property for approval

   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Method Reviewer
   for approval.  The Method Reviewer is appointed by the Application
   Area Directors and can either accept or reject the property
   registration.  An accepted registration should be passed on by the
   Method Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA method
   registry.  The registration can be rejected for any of the following
   reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not reached; 3)
   Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere have not been
   addressed.  The Method Reviewer's decision to reject a property can



Desruisseaux             Expires August 2, 2007               [Page 148]

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


   be appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the objections raised can
   be addressed by the proposer and the property resubmitted.

6.3.  Property Change Control

   Existing properties can be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.

   1.  Define the change

   2.  Post the change

   3.  Allow a comment period

   4.  Submit the property for approval

   Note that the original author or any other interested party can
   propose a change to an existing property, but that such changes
   should only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in
   the published memo.  The Method Reviewer can object to a change if it
   is not backward compatible, but is not required to do so.

   Property definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   properties which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.


7.  Internationalization Considerations


8.  Security Considerations

   SPOOFING:  In this memo, the "Organizer" is the only person
      authorized to make changes to an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO",
      "VJOURNAL" calendar component and redistribute the updates to the
      "Attendees".  An iCalendar object that maliciously changes or
      cancels an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY"
      calendar component might be constructed by someone other than the
      "Organizer" and sent to the "Attendees".  In addition in this
      memo, other than the "Organizer", an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar component is the only other person
      authorized to update any parameter associated with their
      "ATTENDEE" property and send it to the "Organizer".  An iCalendar
      object that maliciously changes the "ATTENDEE" parameters can be
      constructed by someone other than the real "Attendee" and sent to
      the "Organizer".

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


   PROCEDURAL ALARMS:  An iCalendar object can be created that contains
      a "VEVENT" and "VTODO" calendar component with "VALARM" calendar
      components.  The "VALARM" calendar component can be of type
      PROCEDURE and can have an attachment containing some sort of
      executable program.  Implementations that incorporate these types
      of alarms are subject to any virus or malicious attack that might
      occur as a result of executing the attachment.

   ATTACHMENTS:  An iCalendar object can include references to Uniform
      Resource Locators that can be programmed resources.

      Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
      security implications of accepting and parsing such information.
      In addition, the security considerations observed by
      implementations of electronic mail systems should be followed for
      this memo.


9.  IANA Consideration

9.1.  Media Type Registration Information

   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification is intended
   for use as a MIME content type.  However, the implementation of the
   memo is in no way limited solely as a MIME content type.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of media type text/calendar

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  calendar

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset, method, component and optinfo

      The "charset" parameter is defined in [RFC2046] for subtypes of
      the "text" media type.  It is used to indicate the charset used in
      the body part.  The charset supported by this revision of
      iCalendar is UTF-8.  The use of any other charset is deprecated by
      this revision of iCalendar; however note that this revision
      requires that compliant applications MUST accept iCalendar objects
      using either the UTF-8 or US-ASCII charset.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      The "method" parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object
      method or transaction semantics for the calendaring and scheduling
      information.  It also is an identifier for the restricted set of
      properties and values that the iCalendar object consists of.  The
      parameter is to be used as a guide for applications interpreting
      the information contained within the body part.  It SHOULD NOT be
      used to exclude or require particular pieces of information unless
      the identified method definition specifically calls for this
      behavior.  Unless specifically forbidden by a particular method
      definition, a text/calendar content type can contain any set of
      properties permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
      Specification.  The "method" parameter MUST be specified and MUST
      be set to the same value as the "METHOD" component property of the
      iCalendar objects of the iCalendar stream if and only if the
      iCalendar objects in the iCalendar stream all have a "METHOD"
      component property set to the same value.

      The value for the "method" parameter is defined as follows:

        method  = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
        ; IANA registered iCalendar object method

      The "component" parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calendar
      component within the body part.  If the iCalendar object contains
      more than one calendar component type, then multiple component
      parameters MUST be specified.

      The value for the "component" parameter is defined as follows:

        component = "VEVENT"
                  / "VTODO"
                  / "VJOURNAL"
                  / "VFREEBUSY"
                  / "VTIMEZONE"
                  / iana-token
                  / x-name

      The "optinfo" parameter conveys optional information about the
      iCalendar object within the body part.  This parameter can only
      specify semantics already specified by the iCalendar object and
      that can be otherwise determined by parsing the body part.  In
      addition, the optional information specified by this parameter
      MUST be consistent with that information specified by the
      iCalendar object.  For example, it can be used to convey the
      "Attendee" response status to a meeting request.  The parameter
      value consists of a string value.

Internet-Draft                  iCalendar                   January 2007


      The parameter can be specified multiple times.

      This parameter MAY only specify semantics already specified by the
      iCalendar object and that can be otherwise determined by parsing
      the body part.

      The value for the "optinfo" parameter is defined as follows:

        optinfo    = infovalue / qinfovalue

        infovalue  = iana-token / x-name

        qinfovalue = DQUOTE (infovalue) DQUOTE

   Encoding considerations:  This media type can contain 8bit
      characters, so the use of quoted-printable or base64 MIME Content-
      Transfer-Encodings might be necessary when iCalendar objects are
      transferred across protocols restricted to the 7bit repertoire.
      Note that a text valued property in the content entity can also
      have content encoding of special characters using a BACKSLASH
      character (US-ASCII decimal 92) escapement technique.  This means
      that content values can end up encoded twice.

   Security considerations:  See Section 8.

   Interoperability considerations:  This media type is intended to
      define a common format for conveying calendaring and scheduling
      information between different systems.  It is heavily based on the
      earlier [VCAL] industry specification.

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications which use this media type:  This media type is designed
      for widespread use by Internet calendaring and scheduling
      applications.  In addition, applications in the workflow and
      document management area might find this content-type applicable.
      The iTIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis], iMIP
      [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis] and CalDAV [I-D.dusseault-caldav]
      Internet protocols directly use this media type also.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  None.

      File extension(s):  The file extension of "ics" is to be used to
         designate a file containing (an arbitrary set of) calendaring
         and scheduling information consistent with this MIME content
         type.

         The file extension of "ifb" is to be used to designate a file
         containing free or busy time information consistent with this
         MIME content type.

      Macintosh file type code(s):  The file type code of "iCal" is to
         be used in Apple MacIntosh operating system environments to
         designate a file containing calendaring and scheduling
         information consistent with this MIME media type.

         The file type code of "iFBf" is to be used in Apple MacIntosh
         operating system environments to designate a file containing
         free or busy time information consistent with this MIME media
         type.

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  TBD

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  There are no restrictions on where this media
      type can be used.

   A detailed list of changes is available at the following page:
   http://tools.ietf.org/wg/calsify/draft-ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis/
   draft-ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis-04.changes.html.

   a.  Issue 16: Clarified that recurrence instances, generated by a
       recurrence rule, with an invalid date or nonexistent local time
       must be ignored and not counted as part of the recurrence set.

   b.  Issue 26: Clarified how to handle the BYHOUR, BYMINUTE and
       BYSECOND rule parts when "DTSTART" is a DATE value.

   c.  Issue 28: Removed the MUST requirement to specify the "RDATE"

       modified.

   d.  Issue 29: Clarified that the "DTSTART" property is REQUIRED in
       all types of recurring components.

   e.  Issue 32: Introduced the notion of an "iCalendar stream" to make
       it explicit when we are refering to a "single iCalendar object"
       or a "sequence of iCalendar objects".

   f.  Issue 34: Clarified what should be done with the "method"
       parameter when the iCalendar stream is a sequence of iCalendar
       objects.

       do.

   i.  Issue 44: Changed the x-prop ABNF to allow any parameters on non-
       standard properties.
