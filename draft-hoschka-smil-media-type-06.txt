Abstract

   This document specifies the Media Type for version 1 of the
   Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 1.0). SMIL allows
   integrating a set of independent multimedia objects into a
   synchronized multimedia presentation.

1.  Introduction

   The World Wide Web Consortium has issued a Recommendation [1], which
   defines version 1 of  the Synchronized Multimedia Integration
   Language (SMIL 1.0). This memo provides information about the
   application/smil Media Type.

   The definition is based on the RFC defining the use of the
   "application/xml" media type [3]. Before using the "application/smil"
   media type, implementors must thus be familiar with [3].

   At the time of writing, the definition of the "application/xml" media
   type is being updated [4]. This update recommends use of the prefix
   "+xml" for mediatypes that are based on XML. This document does not
   follow this recommendation, since the mediatype "application/smil" is
   already in widespread news, and its definition predates [4] by about
   two years. This does not preclude future registration of
   "application/smil+xml", should the need arise.
2.  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language

   SMIL allows integrating a set of independent multimedia objects into
   a synchronized multimedia presentation. Using SMIL, an author can

   1.describe the temporal behavior of the presentation
   2.describe the layout of the presentation on a screen
   3.associate hyperlinks with media objects

   SMIL is defined using XML [2], and the definition of the SMIL media
   type is based on the defintion of XML media types [3].

3.  Registration Information

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/smil

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: smil

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

   The SMIL language contains "switch" elements. SMIL provides no
   mechanism that assures the media objects contained in a "switch"
   element provide equivalent information. An author, knowing that one
   SMIL player will display one alternative of a "switch" and another
   will display a different part, can put different information in the
   two parts. While there are legitimate use cases for this, this also
   gives rise to a security consideration:  The author can fool viewers
   into thinking that the same information was displayed when in fact it
   was not.

   All of the considerations for "application/xml" media type [3] also
   apply to the SMIL media type. The relevant paragraphs are copied
   below for convenience:

      Although listed as an optional parameter, the use of the charset
      parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information can be
      used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the character
      encoding of the XML entity. The charset parameter can also be used
      to provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-based
      content negotiation in HTTP.  "UTF-8" [RFC-2279] is the
      recommended value, representing the UTF-8 charset. UTF-8 is
      supported by all conforming XML processors [REC-XML].

      If the XML entity is transmitted via HTTP, which uses a MIME-like
      mechanism that is exempt from the restrictions on the text top-
      level type (see section 19.4.1 of HTTP 1.1 [RFC-2068]), "UTF-16"
      (Appendix C.3 of [UNICODE] and Amendment 1 of [ISO-10646]) is also
      recommended.  UTF-16 is supported by all conforming XML processors
      [REC-XML].  Since the handling of CR, LF and NUL for text types in
      most MIME applications would cause undesired transformations of
      individual octets in UTF-16 multi-octet characters, gateways from
      HTTP to these MIME applications MUST transform the XML entity from
      a text/xml; charset="utf-16" to application/xml; charset="utf-16".

      Conformant with [RFC-2046], if a text/xml entity is received with
      the charset parameter omitted, MIME processors and XML processors
      MUST use the default charset value of "us-ascii".  In cases where
      the XML entity is transmitted via HTTP, the default charset value
      is still "us-ascii".

      Since the charset parameter is authoritative, the charset is not
      always declared within an XML encoding declaration.  Thus, special
      care is needed when the recipient strips the MIME header and
      provides persistent storage of the received XML entity (e.g., in a
      file system). Unless the charset is UTF-8 or UTF-16, the recipient
      SHOULD also persistently store information about the charset,
      perhaps by embedding a correct XML encoding declaration within the
      XML entityAlthough listed as an optional parameter, the use of the
      charset parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information
      can be used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the
      charset of the XML entity. The charset parameter can also be used
      to provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-based
      content negotiation in HTTP.

      "UTF-8" [RFC-2279] and "UTF-16" (Appendix C.3 of [UNICODE] and
      Amendment 1 of [ISO-10646]) are the recommended values,
      representing the UTF-8 and UTF-16 charsets, respectively. These
      charsets are  preferred since they are supported by all conforming
      XML processors [REC-XML].

      If an application/xml entity is received where the charset
      parameter is omitted, no information is being provided about the
      charset by the MIME Content-Type header. Conforming XML processors
      MUST follow the requirements in section 4.3.3 of [REC-XML] which
      directly address this contingency. However, MIME processors which
      are not XML processors should not assume a default charset if the
      charset parameter is omitted from an application/xml entity.

      Since the charset parameter is authoritative, the charset is not
      always declared within an XML encoding declaration.  Thus, special
      care is needed when the recipient strips the MIME header and
      provides persistent storage of the received XML entity (e.g., in a
      file system).  Unless the charset is UTF-8 or UTF-16, the
      recipient SHOULD also persistently store information about the
      charset, perhaps by embedding a correct XML encoding declaration
      within the XML entity.


Encoding considerations:

All of the considerations for "application/xml" media type [3] also
apply to the SMIL media type. The relevant paragraphs are copied below
for convenience:

   This media type MAY be encoded as appropriate for the charset and the
   capabilities of the underlying MIME transport. For 7-bit transports,
   data in both UTF-8 and UTF-16 is encoded in quoted- printable or
   base64.  For 8-bit clean transport (e.g., ESMTP, 8BITMIME, or NNTP),
   UTF-8 is not encoded, but UTF-16 is base64 encoded.  For binary clean
   transport (e.g., HTTP), no content- transfer-encoding is necessary.

Security considerations:

   SMIL documents contain a construct that allows "infinite loops".
   This is indispensible for a multimedia format. However, SMIL clients
   should foresee provisions such as a "stop" button that lets users
   interrupt such an "infinite loop".

   As with HTML, SMIL documents contain links to other media
   (images,sounds, videos, text, ...) and those links are typically
   followed automatically by software, resulting in the transfer of
   files without the explicit request of the user for each one. The
   security considerations of each linked file are those of the
   individual registered types.

   In addition, SMIL has some of the same security considerations as
   specified in [3], with the following exceptions: the section on XML
   entities does not apply, since SMIL 1.0 disallows entities.

Interoperability considerations:

   SMIL documents contain links to other media objects. The SMIL player
   must be able to decode the media types of these media in order to
   display the whole document. To increase interoperability, SMIL has
   provisions for including alternate versions of a media object in a
   document.

Published specification: see [1]

Applications which use this media type:

SMIL players and editors

Additional information:

Semantics of fragment identifiers in URIs: The SMIL media type allows to
append a fragment identifier to a URI pointing to a SMIL resource (e.g.
http://www.example.com/test.smil#foo).  The semantics of fragment
identifers for SMIL resources are defined in [1].

Magic number(s): none

   All of the considerations for "application/xml" media type [3] also
   apply to the SMIL media type.

File extension(s): .smil, .smi, .sml

NOTE: On the Windows operating system and the Macintosh
platform, the ".smi" extension is
used by other formats. To avoid conflicts, it is thus
strongly recommended not to use the extension ".smi" for storing
SMIL files on these platforms.

Macintosh File Type Code(s): "TEXT", ".SMI", "SMIL", "PNRM"
Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): none
