Path Computation Element communication Protocol extension for signaling
                        LSP diversity constraint
                draft-ietf-pce-association-diversity-01

Abstract

   This document introduces a simple mechanism to associate a group of
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via an extension to the Path Computation
   Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) with the purpose of computing
   diverse paths for those LSPs.  The proposed extension allows a PCC to
   advertise to a PCE the belonging of a particular LSP to a disjoint-
   group, thus the PCE knows that LSPs in the same group must be
   disjoint from each other.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of
   MPLS-TE and GMPLS tunnels.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the
   active stateful PCE model, without the need for local configuration
   on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
   configuration parameters or behaviours) and is equally applicable to
   the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] or a stateless PCE [RFC5440].

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to signal that a particular
   group of LSPs should use diverse paths including the requested type
   of diversity.  A PCC can use this extension to signal to a PCE the
   belonging of a particular LSP to a disjoint-group.  When a PCE
   receives LSP states belonging to the same disjoint-group from some
   PCCs, the PCE should ensure that the LSPs within the group are
   disjoint from each other.

3.  Motivation

   Path diversity is a very common use case today in IP/MPLS networks
   especially for layer 2 transport over MPLS.  A customer may request
   that the operator provide two end-to-end disjoint paths across the
   IP/MPLS core.  The customer may use those paths as primary/backup or
   active/active.

   Different level of disjointness may be offered:

   o  Link disjointness: the paths of the associated LSPs should transit
      different links (but may use common nodes or different links that
      may have some shared fate).

   o  Node disjointness: the paths of the associated LSPs should transit
      different nodes (but may use different links that may have some
      shared fate).

   o  SRLG disjointness: the paths of the associated LSPs should transit
      different links that do not share fate (but may use common transit
      nodes).

   o  Node+SRLG disjointness: the paths of the associated LSPs should
      transit different links that do not have any common shared fate
      and should transit different nodes.

   The associated LSPs may originate from the same or from different
   head-end(s) and may terminate at the same or different tail-end(s).

     Figure 1 - Disjoint paths with different head-ends and tail-ends

   In the figure above, the customer wants to have two disjoint paths
   between CE1/CE2 and CE3/CE4.  From an IP/MPLS network point view, in
   this example, the CEs are connected to different PEs to maximize
   their disjointness.  When LSPs originate from different head-ends,
   distributed computation of diverse paths can be difficult.  Whereas,
   computation via a centralized PCE ensures path disjointness
   correctness and simplicity.

   The SVEC (Synchronization VECtor) object [RFC5440] allows a PCC to
   request the synchronization of a set of dependent or independent path
   computation requests.  As per [RFC5440], the SVEC object is optional
   and may be carried within a PCReq message.  It uses the Request-ID-
   number carried within the respective RP (Request Parameters) object
   to identify the computation request that should be syncronized.

   The PCEP extension for stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   defined new PCEP messages - PCRpt, PCUpd and PCInitiate.  These
   messages uses PLSP-ID in the LSP object for identification.  Moreover
   to allow diversity between LSPs originating from different PCCs, the
   generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] equally applicable to the active and
   passive modes of a stateful PCE is better suited.

   Using PCEP, the PCC MUST indicate that disjoint path computation is
   required, such indication SHOULD include disjointness parameters such
   as the type of disjointness, the disjoint group-id, and any

   customization parameters according to the configured local policy.
   As mentioned previously, the extension described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] is well suited to associated a set
   of LSPs with a particular disjoint-group.

   The management of the disjoint group-ids will be a key point for the
   operator as the Association ID field is limited to 65535.  The local
   configuration of IPv4/IPv6 association source, or Global Association
   Source/Extended Association ID should allow to overcome this
   limitation.  For example, when a PCC or PCE initiates all the LSPs in
   a particular disjoint-group, it can set the IPv4/IPv6 association
   source can be set to one of its IP address.  When disjoint LSPs are
   initiated from different head-ends, a unique association identifier
   SHOULD be used for those LSPs: this can be achieved by setting the
   IPv4/IPv6 source address to a common value (zero value can be used)
   as well as the Association ID.

   Using the disjoint-group within a PCUpd or PCInitiate may have two
   purposes:

   o  Information: in case the PCE is performing the path computation,
      it may communicate to the PCC the locally used parameters in the
      attribute-list of the LSP.

   o  Configuration: in case the PCE is updating the diversity
      parameters.

4.  Protocol extension

4.1.  Association group

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], LSPs are associated with
   other LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common
   association group.  The Association ID will be used to identify the
   disjoint group a set of LSPs belongs to.  This document defines a new
   Association type, based on the generic Association object -

   o  Association type = TBD1 ("Disjointness Association Type").

   A disjoint group can have two or more LSPs.  But a PCE may be limited
   in how many LSPs it can take into account when computing
   disjointness.  If a PCE receives more LSPs in the group than it can
   handle in its computation algorithm, it SHOULD apply disjointness
   computation to only a subset of LSPs in the group.  The subset of
   disjoint LSPs will be decided by the implementation.

   Local polices on the PCC or PCE MAY define the computational behavior
   for the other LSPs in the group.  For example, the PCE may provide no
   path, a shortest path, or a constrained path based on relaxing
   disjointness, etc.

   Associating a particular LSP to multiple disjoint groups is
   authorized from a protocol perspective, however there is no insurance
   that the PCE will be able to compute properly the multi-disjointness
   constraint.

4.2.  Mandatory TLV

   The disjoint group MUST carry the following TLV:

   o  DISJOINTNESS-INFORMATION-TLV: Used to communicate some
      disjointness specific parameters.

   The DISJOINTNESS-INFORMATION-TLV is shown in the following figure:

      Flags:

      *  L (Link diverse) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed paths within the disjoint group MUST NOT have any link
         in common.

      *  N (Node diverse) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed paths within the disjoint group MUST NOT have any node
         in common.

      *  S (SRLG diverse) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed paths within the disjoint group MUST NOT share any
         SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group).

      *  P (Shortest path) bit: when set, this indicates that the
         computed path of the LSP SHOULD satisfies all constraints and
         objective functions first without considering the diversity
         constraint.  This means that an LSP with P flag set should be
         placed as if the disjointness constraint has not been
         configured, while the other LSP in the association with P flag
         unset should be placed by taking into account the disjointness
         constraint.  Setting P flag changes the relationship between
         LSPs to a unidirectional relationship (LSP 1 with P=0 depends
         of LSP 2 with P=1, but LSP 2 with P=1 does not depend of LSP 1
         with P=0).

      *  T (Strict disjointness) bit: when set, if disjoint paths cannot
         be found, PCE should return no path for LSPs that could not be
         be disjoint.  When unset, PCE is allowed to relax disjointness
         by using either applying a requested objective function or any
         other behavior if no objective function is requested (e.g.:
         using a lower disjoint type (link instead of node) or relaxing
         disjointness constraint at all).

   If a PCEP speaker receives a disjoint-group without DISJOINTNESS-
   INFORMATION-TLV, it SHOULD reply with a PCErr Error-type=6 (Mandatory
   Object missing) and Error-value=TBD7.

4.3.  Optional TLVs

   The disjoint group MAY carry some optional TLVs including but not
   limited to:

   o  VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV: Used to communicate arbitrary vendor
      specific behavioral information, described in [RFC7150].

4.4.  Disjointness objective functions

   An objective function MAY be applied to the disjointness computation
   to drive the PCE computation behavior.  In this case, the OF-List TLV
   (defined in ([RFC5541]) is used as an optional TLV in the Association
   Group Object.  The PCEP OF-List TLV allow multiple OF-Codes inside
   the TLV, a sender SHOULD include a single OF-Code in the OF-List TLV
   when included in the Association Group, and the receiver MUST
   consider the first OF-code only and ignore others if included.  The
   OF-Code to maximize diversity are specified in
   ([I-D.dhody-pce-of-diverse]).

4.5.  P-flag considerations

   As mentioned in Section 4.2, the P-flag (when set) indicates that the
   computed path of the LSP SHOULD satisfies all constraints and
   objective functions first without considering the diversity
   constraint.  This could be required in some primary/backup scenarios
   where the primary path should use the more optimal path available
   (taking into account the other constraints).  When disjointness is
   computed, it is important for the algorithm to know that it should
   try to optimize the path of one or more LSPs in the disjoint group
   (for instance the primary path) while other paths are allowed to be
   longer (compared to a similar path without the disjointness
   constraint).  Without such a hint, the disjointness algorithm may set
   a path for all LSPs that may not completely fulfil the customer
   requirement.

                                 Figure 3

   In the figure above, a customer has two dual homed sites (CE1/CE3 and
   CE2/CE4).  This customer wants two disjoint paths between the two
   sites.  Due to physical meshings, the customer wants to use CE1 and
   CE2 as primary (for instance CE3 and CE4 are hosted in a remote site
   for redundancy purpose compared the customer hosts).

   Without any hint (constraint) provided, the PCE may compute the two
   disjoint LSPs as a batch leading to PE1->PE2 using a path
   PE1->R1->R2->PE2 and PE3->PE4 using PE3->R3->R4->PE4.  In this case,
   even if the disjointness constraint is fulfilled, the path from PE1
   to PE2 does not use the best optimal path available in the network
   (RTD may be higher): the customer requirement is thus not completely
   fulfilled.

   The usage of the P-Flag allows the PCE to know that a particular LSP
   should be tied to the best path as if the disjointness constraint was
   not requested.

   In our example, if the P-Flag is set to the LSP PE1->PE2, the PCE
   should use the path PE1->R1->R3->R4->R2->PE2 for this LSP, while the
   other LSP should be disjoint from this path.  The second LSP will be
   placed on PE3->R5->R6->PE4 as it is allowed to be longer.

   Driving the PCE disjointness computation may be done in other ways by
   for instance setting a metric boundary reflecting an RTD boundary.
   Other constraints may also be used.

   The P-Flag allows a simple expression that the disjointness
   constraint should not make the LSP worst.

   Any constraint added to a path disjointness computation may reduce
   the chance to find suitable paths.  The usage of the P-flag, as any
   other constraint, may prevent to find a disjoint path.  In the
   example above, if we consider that the router R5 is down, if PE1->PE2
   has the P-flag set, there is no room available to place PE3->PE4 (the
   disjointness constraint cannot be fulfilled).  If PE->PE2 has the
   P-flag unset, the algorithm may be able to place PE1->PE2 on R1->R2
   link leaving a room for PE3->PE4 using the R3->R4 link.  When using
   P-flag or any additional constraint on top of the disjointness
   constraint, the user should be aware that there is less chance to
   fulfill the disjointness constraint.

   Multiple LSPs in the same disjoint group may have the P-flag set.  In
   such a case, those LSPs may not be disjoint from each other but will
   be disjoint from others LSPs in the group that have the P-flag unset.

                                 Figure 4

   In the figure above, we still consider the same previous
   requirements, so PE1->PE2 LSP should be optimized (P-flag set) while
   PE3->PE4 should be disjoint and may use a longer path.

   Regarding PE1->PE2, there are two paths that are satisfying the
   constraints (ECMP): PE1->R1->R4->R2->PE2 (path 1) and
   PE1->R1->R3->R4->R2->PE2 (path 2).  An implementation may choose one

   of the paths or even use boths (using both may happen in case Segment
   Routing TE is used, allowing ECMP).

   If the implementation elects only one path, there is a chance that
   picking up one path may prevent disjointness.  In our example, if
   path 2 is used for PE1->PE2, there is no room left for PE3->PE4 while
   if path 1 is used, PE3->PE4 can be placed on R3->R4 link.

   When P-flag is set for an LSP and when ECMPs are available, an
   implementation MAY select a path that allows disjointness.

4.6.  Disjointness computation issues

   There may be some cases where the PCE is not able to provide a set of
   disjoint paths for one or more LSPs in the association.

   When the T-bit is set (Strict disjointness requested), if
   disjointness cannot be found for one or more LSPs, the PCE SHOULD
   reply with a PCUpd message containing an empty ERO.  In addition to
   the empty ERO Object, the PCE MAY add the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV
   ([RFC5440]) in the LSP Object.

   This document adds new bits in the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV:

      bit "TBD3": when set, the PCE indicates that it could not find a
      disjoint path for this LSP.

      bit "TBD4": when set, the PCE indicates that it does not support
      the requested disjointness computation.

   The NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV MAY also be used when T-bit is unset and when
   the PCE cannot provide a path for an LSP in the disjoint group.

   When the T-bit is unset, the PCE is allowed to relax the constraint
   if it cannot be satisfied.  This document introduces a new RELAXED-
   CONSTRAINT-TLV that MAY be used by a PCE to indicate that some
   constraints have been relaxed.

   When used, the RELAXED-CONSTRAINT-TLV SHOULD be included in the LSP
   Object of a PCUpd message.  The RELAXED-CONSTRAINT-TLV has the
   following format:

   All LSPs in a particular disjoint group MUST use the same combination
   of T,S,N,L flags in the DISJOINTNESS-INFORMATION-TLV.  If a PCE
   receives PCRpt messages for LSPs belonging to the same disjoint group
   but having an inconsistent combination of T,S,N,L flags, the PCE
   SHOULD NOT try to compute disjointness path and SHOULD reply a PCErr
   with Error-type 5 (Policy Violation) and Error-Value TBD6
   (Inconsistent parameters in DISJOINTNESS-INFORMATION TLV) to all PCCs
   involved in the disjoint group.
