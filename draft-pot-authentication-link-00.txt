Internet-Draft Link relationship types for authentication       May 2019


1.  Introduction

   [RFC8288] defines a framework and registry for Link Relationships
   types.  This specification defines a set of new relationship types to
   aid clients in discovering endpoints for authentication and
   registration: "authenticate", "authenticated-as", "logout" and
   "register-user".

2.  authenticate

   The "authenticate" can be used to link to a resource that hosts a
   page where a user can authenticate itself for the current resource.

   For example, this link might refer to a HTML login page.

   Example:

   <a href="/login" rel="authenticate">Login</a>

   This specification doesn't define the authentication protocol.  For
   example, the link could refer to an OAuth2 authorization endpoint.

3.  authenticated-as

   The "authenticated-as" link refers to a resource that describes the
   effective authenticated user for a HTTP response.

   Following this link might allow a client to answer the question 'who
   am I?'.  This might link to a user profile page, or it might link to
   an API that returns a JSON response with user information.

   Example:

   Link: <https://api.example.org/users/123-abc>; rel="authenticated-as"

4.  logout

   The "logout" refers to a resource where an authenticated user might
   end their session.

   In a browser this might clear cookies, or in the case of OAuth2 it
   could revoke any active authentication tokens.

5.  register-user

   The "register-user" Link Relation refers to a resource where a user
   might sign up for a service for the context URI.

   The linked resource might contain a HTML registration form, or
   otherwise instructions that allow a client to find out how to sign up
   for the service.

6.  IANA considerations

   This document defines "authenticate", "authenticated-as", "logout"
   and "register-user" link relation types and adds them to the "Link
   Relations" registry:

6.1.  authenticate link relation

   o  Relation name: authenticate

   o  Description: Refers to a resource where a client may authenticate
      for the the context URI.

   o  Reference: TBD

6.2.  authenticated-as link relation

   o  Relation name: authenticated-as

   o  Description: Refers to a resource that describes the authenticated
      entity for the HTTP response.

   o  Reference: TBD

6.3.  logout link relation

   o  Relation name: logout

   o  Description: Refers to an endpoint where a client may invalidate
      the current authentication session.

   o  Reference: TBD

6.4.  register-user link relation

   o  Relation name: register-user

   o  Description: Refers to a resource where a client may create a new
      user account for the context URI.

   o  Reference: TBD
