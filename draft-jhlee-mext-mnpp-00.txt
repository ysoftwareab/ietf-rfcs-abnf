Abstract

   In the context of vehicular networks for Intelligent Transportation
   Systems (ITS), vehicles that comprise in-vehicle networks require to
   discover Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) of other vehicles in order to
   communicate with other vehicles or the roadside infrastructure on the
   same wireless link.  This document proposes Mobile Network Prefix
   Provisioning (MNPP), a solution to advertise an MNP assigned to a
   vehicle to others in both a proactive or reactive fashion.

Internet-Draft     Mobile Network Prefix Provisioning       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In vehicular networks for ITS, vehicles require to communicate with
   other vehicles or the roadside infrastructure on the same wireless
   link.  Vehicles comprise their in-vehicle networks where permanent
   IPv6 prefixes are allocated.  The permanet IPv6 prefix is here
   referred as an MNP as defined in [RFC3753], [RFC3963].  The MNP being
   used in the in-vehicle network of the vehicle is provided by a Home
   Agent operating in a remote central ITS network.  The in-vehicle
   network is attached to a public or private network through its
   Vehicular Mobile Router (VMR) operating as NEMO Basic Support
   [RFC3963] for maintaining IP session continuity while performing
   vertical and horizontal handovers.  As such, VMRs attached to the in-
   vehicle network of the VMR have permanent Home Addresses (HoAs)
   configured from the MNP.

   While VMRs remain in a reachable wireless communication range of a
   Roadside Access Router (RAR), the VMRs would configure a link-local
   address and a global Care-of Address (CoA).  However, vehicles need
   to discover IPv6 prefixes, i.e., MNPs, associated with neighbor
   vehicles in order for Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs) to talk to one
   another.

   Without any specific mechanisms, VMRs would only know what is the
   link-local address or CoA of neighbor vehicles, but not their
   associated MNPs.  This document proposes Mobile Network Prefix
   Provisioning (MNPP), a solution based on an extension of Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861] to distribute the MNP in both a
   proactive or reactive fashion.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The document uses the terminology specified in [RFC3753], [RFC3963].
   In addition, this document defines the following:

   o  Vehicular Mobile Router (VMR): A mobile router located at the
      vehicle that provides communication service to devices connected
      to its in-vehicle network.

   o  Roadside Access Router (RAR): An access router located at the
      roadside infrastructure that provides communication service to
      vehicles.

   o  Mobile Network Prefix Provisioning (MNPP) Solicitation Message: A
      solicitation message sent by the VMR or the RAR to receive an
      advertisement message containing the MNP information quickly.

   o  Mobile Network Prefix Provisioning (MNPP) Advertisement Message:
      An advertisement message sent by the VMR to announce its MNP
      information.  This message is periodically sent, or in response to
      a solicitation message.


3.  Mobile Network Prefix Provisioning

   The proposed mechanism in this document extends the router
   advertisement (RA) and router solicitation (RS) messages defined in
   NDP to announce the MNP assigned to a vehicle to other vehicles or
   the roadside infrastructure on the same wireless link.

   In order to distribute the MNP, MNPP Advertisement messages are sent
   through the egress interface of VMR which is used to communicate with
   other vehicles or the roadside infrastructure.  Note that the ingress
   interface of the VMR is connected with its in-vehicle network.  MNPP
   Solicitation messages are used to request MNPP Advertisement messages
   quickly.

   o  As a proactive fashion, the VMR periodically sends the unsolicited
      MNPP Advertisement messages including the MNP being used in its
      in-vehicle network.  Upon reception of the MNPP Advertisement
      message, other VMRs and RARs obtain the MNP of the VMR.  It is
      similar to the case of sending unsolicited RA messages defined in
      NDP.

   o  As a reactive fashion, the VMR upon reception of the MNPP
      Solicitation messages immediately sends the solicited MNPP
      Advertisement messages including the MNP being used in its in-
      vehicle network.  The MNPP Solicitation messages SHOULD be used to
      prompt VMRs to generate the MNPP Advertisement messages quickly.
      It is similar to the case of requesting solicited RA messages
      defined in NDP.

6.  Security Considerations

8.  Next Text

   The following issues will be covered in the next version of this
   document.

   o  Applicable Scenarios: MNPP operates in both infrastructure-based
      and infrastructure-less scenarios.  In the next version of this
      document, applicable scenarios will be covered.

   o  Security Considerations: A number of threats addressed in
      [RFC3756] are expected to launch on MNPP used to announce the MNP
      of a VMR.  Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] SHOULD be
      extended to protect the transaction of MNPP Solicitation and
      Advertisement messages.  In the next version of this document,
      security considerations will be covered.
