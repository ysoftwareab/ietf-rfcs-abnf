   Abstract 
    
   A handover is the process during which a mobile node is handed over 
   between access routers. Handovers occur as a consequence of lower 
   layer (i. e., link-layer) handovers that signify a switch of the 
   physical connection to a new location. In IP based networks the 
   handover can be performed on IP layer by using MIPv6. For the 
   duration of a Mobile IPv6 handover, a mobile node is unable to send 
   or receive traffic. The length of this disruption is considered 
   critical because it affects the performance of the communication. An 
   additional factor is the access router selection. It implies the 
   selection of the most suitable access router from which a mobile node 
   should receive services. 
    
   With the help of link layer information it is possible on one side to 
   provide proactive Mobile IPv6 handover decisions and on the other 
   side to select the best access router. This draft describes a method 
   that allows seamless Mobile IPv6 handovers and optimal access router 
   selection based on link layer information.

1. Introduction 
    
   In cellular and wireless networks, Mobile IPv6 handover decision 
   making can benefit from link layer information for the support of 
   seamless roaming which leads to low packet loss during handovers. 
   This draft describes a method that considers the aforementioned link 
   layer information that are indicative of the status of any underlying 
   bearer technology to determine the terms of each handover. 
    
   Due to the wide range of wireless bearer systems with different 
   characteristics, this draft defines an intermediate layer between 
   Mobile IPv6 and any bearer system. This layer gathers and evaluates 
   information from the various link layers generating hints towards 
   Mobile IPv6. It can monitor the changes of the link layer parameters, 
   determining tendencing or forecasting upcoming changes in link state. 
   Moreover, it can monitor the link characteristic for each of the 
   underlying bearer system separatelly. This leads to effective Mobile 
   IPv6 handover decisions making without the need for major changes in 
   the Mobile IPv6 protocol.

4. Mobile IPv6 Handovers in wireless Networks û Problem Overview 
    
   Mobile IPv6 handovers in heterogeneous wireless networks are based on 
   movement detection that forces handovers from the previous network to 
   the new network (see fig. 1). Movement detection for Mobile IPv6 is 
     
   POLIMAND              Expires August 2004                        3 
   described in [2] and is used by mobile nodes to detect whether an 
   access router is reachable for data transmission or not.  
    
   An optimization of movement detection is described in [5] and 
   contains an overview about possible movement detection in Mobile 
   IPv6. Movement detection can be used as a basis for an enhanced 
   handover decision to establish Mobile IPv6 handovers between 
   different networks (see fig. 1) before the previous link breaks.  
    
   Movement detection which is described in [2] is based on Neighbor 
   Discovery/Neighbor Unreachablility Detection [3] and on router 
   advertisements which are frequently broadcast by the access routers.  
    
   The following statements have to be considered to determine whether 
   the movement detection in [2] is appropriate for seamless handovers 
   in heterogeneous and overlay networks or not. 
    
        ôGeneric movement detection uses Neighbor Unreachability 
        Detection to detect when the default router is no longer bi-
        directional reachable, in which case the mobile node must 
        discover a new default router (usually on a new link). However, 
        this detection only occurs when the mobile node has packets to 
        send, and in the absence of frequent Router Advertisements or 
        indications from the link-layer, the mobile node might become 
        unaware of an L3 handover that occurred. Therefore, the mobile 
        node should supplement this method with other information 
        whenever it is available to the mobile node (e.g., from lower 
        protocol layers).ô [2]. 
 
        ôRouters generate Router Advertisements frequently enough that 
        hosts will learn of their presence within a few minutes, but not 
        frequently enough to rely on an absence of advertisements to 
        detect router failure; a separate Neighbor Unreachability 
        Detection algorithm provides failure detection.ö [3].  
         
        ôThis limitation, however, is not suitable to providing timely 
        movement detection for mobile nodes.ö [2]. 
         
   In [2] it is described how often the router advertisements have to be 
   broadcast by access routers to support movement detection in 
   heterogeneous networks, so-called unsolicited router advertisements. 
    
        ôOne method which can provide for faster movement detection is 
        to increase the rate at which unsolicited Router Advertisements 
        are sent. Mobile IPv6 relaxes this limit such that routers may 
        send unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements more 
        frequently. This method can be applied where the router is 
        expecting to provide service to visiting mobile nodes (e.g., 
        wireless network interfaces), or on which it is serving as a 
        home agent to one or more mobile nodes (who may return home and 
        need to hear its Advertisements).Routers supporting mobility 
        should be able to be configured with a smaller MinRtrAdvInterval 
        value and MaxRtrAdvInterval value to allow sending of 
        unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements more often. The 
        minimum allowed values are: 
        MinRtrAdvInterval 0.03 seconds 
        MaxRtrAdvInterval 0.07 seconds.ö [2].  
         
     
   POLIMAND              Expires August 2004                        4 
        ôIn the case where the minimum intervals and delays are used, 
        the mean time between unsolicited multicast router 
        advertisements is 50ms.ö [2]. 
    
   This method can be applied by access routers which expect visiting 
   mobile nodes within their access networks which are roaming between 
   previous networks and new networks.  
    
   Movement detection which is based on Neighbor Unreachability 
   Detection is not appropriate for seamless mobility due to the fact 
   that the previous link breaks before the handover is performed. This 
   causes too long service disruptions, because the Neighbor 
   Unreachability Detection detects that the link cannot be used for 
   further communication only after the previous link breaks. 
    
   It has to be understood that all statements in [2] and [3] describe 
   movement detection and neighbor unreachability detection after the 
   previous link breaks.  
    
   Movement detection considered in this draft is based on router 
   advertisements which are frequently broadcast by access routers 
   (described in [2] as movement detection for mobile nodes). The 
   following describes how the handover decision can be enhanced by 
   using so-called proactive Mobile IPv6 handovers in heterogeneous 
   networks without major changes in the Mobile IPv6 protocol.

5. Reactive/Proactive Mobile IPv6 Handover Decision 
    
   There are two different handover decisions which have an impact of 
   the packet loss during handovers: reactive and proactive handover 
   decision. The reactive Mobile IPv6 handover allows an active link 
   connection to the previous access router until the previous link 
   breaks. Afterwards it establishes an active link to the new access 
   router.  
    
   For the proactive Mobile IPv6 handover the mobile node has an active 
   link connection to the new access router before the link breaks and 
   can maintain the previous link even when the handover from the 
   previous access router to the new access router has been established. 
   In that case the handover can be established before the previous link 
   breaks.  
    
   The proactive handover from one access router to another may be 
   forced by a link layer hint that is based on link layer information 
   about the link conditions. A list of link layer parameters which are 
   available in different bearer systems is given in [6]. 
    
   In the following the reactive handover decision and the proactive 
   handover decision based on link layer information are described to 
   show the advantages on the proactive handover decision to reduce 
   packet loss during Mobile IPv6 handovers. 
 
5.1 Reactive Handover Decision 
 
   In fig.2 the mobile node roams between (n) different access networks 
   (see also fig.1). Link(n) is the connection to the router in 
   network(n) and Link(n+1) is the connection to the router in 
   network(n+1). While Link(n) is permanently reliable, Link(n+1) 
   changes its link characteristics (good/bad link layer conditions).  
    
   After the link conditions have been changed the link breaks (bad 
   conditions). When the previous link has been broken the mobile node 
   starts the stateful/stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration [4] if 
   it is required. When the address configuration has been successfully 
   finished, the new IPv6 address can be used by the interface of the 
   mobile node for data transmission. The handover duration between the 
   previous link and the new link is named link disruption. Link 
   disruption is the reason for packet loss during handovers between the 
   previous network and the new network. It has to be reduced to 
   minimize packet loss during Mobile IP handovers.

   Figure 2: Mobile IPv6 handover from Link(n+1) to Link (n) based on a 
   reactive handover scenario. 
    
   In [7] a reactive handover design is described which is based on link 
   layer hints for Mobile IPv6 handovers after the previous link breaks. 
   It forces an IPv6 address autoconfiguration during Mobile IP handover 
   to the new access router after the previous link has been lost by the 
   mobile node. 
 
5.2 Proactive Handover Decision 
 
   For the proactive Mobile IPv6 handover decision the mobile node has a 
   link connection to a new network before the link of the previous 
   network breaks. Thus, the proactive handover decision differs from 
   the reactive scenario that has no link connection during the 
   handover.  
    
   In fig. 3 the characteristic of Link(n+1) has changed and a hint can 
   be used to establish a Mobile IPv6 handover. The hint contains 
   information about the link characteristic and may be used to control 
   Mobile IPv6 handovers. After the hint has been occurred, the router 
   advertisements can be controlled for movement detection of the mobile 
   node.  
    
   How the router advertisements may be controlled is described in 
   chapter 8 of this draft. The hint should trigger an anticipated IPv6 
   (stateful/stateless) address configuration [4] if this is required 
   (see fig.3). When the new IPv6 address is available and can be used 
   by the mobile node interface (Link(n+1)), the handover can be 
   established and the new link can be used for data transmission.

   Figure 3: Mobile IPv6 handover from Link(n+1) to Link(n) based on a 
   proactive handover scenario.  
 
    
   The proactive handover decision reduces link disruption to a minimum 
   because a new link will be established for ongoing data transmission 
   while the previous link is still used. It reduces furthermore the 
   packet loss during handovers and can be used in anticipated handover 
   scenarios.     
 
6. Mobile IPv6 Handovers based on Link Layer Information 
    
   There are different bearer systems available which provide different 
   link layer information. Different bearer systems like IEEE 
     
   POLIMAND              Expires August 2004                        7 
   802.11a/b/g, hiperLAN2, GSM, GPRS and UMTS are currently available 
   and may be used by Mobile IPv6 networks. These bearer systems use 
   various link layers with different types of link layer information.  
    
   Different link layer information requires a generic platform which 
   combines link layer information from different link layer systems. 
   However, a list of different link layer parameters from various 
   network systems is required that simplifies the control of Mobile 
   IPv6 handovers between different access domains. 
    
   Link layer parameters can be divided several classes, e.g. in Link 
   Information, Environment Information, Neighborhood Information, and 
   Link Layer Management Information.  
    
7. Mobile IPv6 Handover Enhancements 
    
   This draft proposes a so-called ôHandover decision enhancement 
   functionö. It is a proactive Mobile IPv6 handover decision method, 
   which is the basis for zero or less packet loss during vertical 
   handovers in heterogeneous and overlay networks. This method forces 
   Mobile IPv6 handovers before the previous link breaks. This so-called 
   anticipated handover has the advantage that a more suitable link can 
   be used instead of the previous link, which may not provide adequate 
   link conditions. It minimizes packet loss and provides seamless and 
   reliable link connectivity of the mobile node. 
    
   This method provides a uniform interface for a range of heterogeneous 
   bearer systems for the interaction with Mobile IPv6. It should 
   interact with Mobile IPv6 and indicates when and how a Mobile IPv6 
   handover should occur. It may be able to even force a handover.  
    
   The control Mobile IPv6 handovers based on link layer information is 
   handled by an enhanced handover decision. It uses link layer 
   information to decide if there is a handover required from the 
   previous network to a new network (handover decision). Fig. 4 shows 
   the control of Mobile IPv6 handovers based on link layer information.

   Figure 4: Interaction between the handover decision enhancement 
   function and network layer to control Mobile IPv6 handovers based on 
   link layer information. 
    
    
   The handover decision enhancement function establishes Mobile IPv6 
   handovers from the previous network to the new network when the link 
   characteristic is no longer adequate for data transmission. Thus, a 
   decision is required when the handover has to be forced. The decision 
   should be based on a combination of different link layer information 
   to control Mobile IPv6 handovers.

   Figure 5: Interaction of the handover decision enhancement function 
   between link layer and network layer with respect of current bearer 
   access systems. 
    
    
   The handover decision enhancement function should consider the 
   functionality of hierarchical Mobile IP approaches (Hierarchical 
   Mobile IPv6) that is described in [8] and fast Mobile IP handovers 
   (Fast Mobile IPv6) that is described in [9]. HMIPv6 and FMIPv6 may 
   use an enhanced handover decision to reduce link disruption and to 
   minimize packet loss during vertical handovers in heterogeneous and 
   overlay networks. 
    
7.1 Link Layer Parameters for enhanced Handover Decision 
    
   Different link layer parameters [6] can be used for an enhanced 
   handover decision to determine Mobile IPv6 handovers between 
   different bearer systems. The following link layer information should 
   be helpful to decide when a handover has to be established. 
    
   TBD 
    
7.2 Handover Decision Enhancement Function

8. Interaction between enhanced Handover Decision and Mobile IPv6 
    
   The handover decision enhancement function uses link layer 
   information to define when a Mobile IPv6 handover has to be 
   established. There are three different approaches: 
    
   - Control of router advertisements 
   - Sending router solicitations 
   - Sending triggers for Mobile IP handoffs

8.1 Control of Router Advertisements 
    
   Router advertisements are needed for movement detection of the mobile 
   node. Movement detection and its various algorithms are described in 
   [10]. When a mobile node does not detect router advertisements of the 
   network where it is currently attached, the mobile node forces a 
   handover to a new network which sends unknown router advertisements. 
   This is mainly based on receiving router advertisements for movement 
   detection, especially for Lazy Cell Switching (LCS) and Eager Cell 
   Switching (ECS) which are also described in [10].  
    
   The handover decision enhancement function may control router 
   advertisements of the previous link. The control of router 
   advertisements may forces the mobile node to establish a handover 
   from the previous network to the new network due to the fact that 
   router advertisements of the previous network are no longer visible.  
 
8.2 Sending Router Solicitations 
    
   TBD 
    
8.3 Sending Mobile IPv6 Handover Triggers 
    
   TBD  
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   The implementation of the enhanced handover decision should guarantee 
   that all link layer information which have to be considered by the 
   handover decision are generated by the link layer of the mobile node.
