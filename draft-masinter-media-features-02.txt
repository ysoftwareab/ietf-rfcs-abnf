Abstract

This specification defines some common media features for describing
image resolution, size, color, and image representation methods that
are common to web browsing, printing, and facsimile applications.
These features are registered for use within the framework of [FEATURES].
This specification does not define a syntax for describing sets of
features.

Introduction
    
This work was originally motivated by the requirements from web
browsers to send the browser's display characteristics to the web
server to allow the server to choose an appropriate representation.
     
This specification defines media features [5].  These features are the
means by which a recipient may inform a sender as to the
characteristics of its message handling.  The sender may then provide
the variant of the message that is most suitable for the recipient.

Different variants would typically be higher or lower resolution
images (for example) as appropriate.  In the case of a sending to a
printer, the result would be higher quality output.  In the case of a
small screen device (cellphone, portable digital assistant), the
result would be faster transmission.

Media features may be used in many different protocol situations.
Those defined in this specification can indicate the display or
printer dimensions (in pixels), display resolution (in pixels/inch),
color capability and bit-depth, display media type, or . The physical
dimensions of the display can be inferred from the display size and
display resolution. In the case of paper output, the paper size may be
expressed as a token from a list of certain standard paper sizes.
    
pix-x=n  
pix-y=m 
    
  These features indicate the maximum display size that the recipient
  can conveniently display or print, measured in pixels; they indicate
  horizontal (n) and vertical (m) dimensions. 

res=nXm
    
   This feature indicates a discrete resolution in horizontal and
   vertical inch-based units. The characteristic of a resource or
   the capability of a device can be indicated using this feature.
   "n" represents the horizontal resolution, and "y" represents the
   vertical resolution.  Each is measured in integer pixels per inch,
   and the value of res is one discrete token describing both resolutions.
   For example: res=72x72.  Certain resources such as images may have
   similar total pixel size but differing data size, quality, or aspect
   ratio.  Common values of res are:  60x60, 72x72, 100x100, 200x100,
   200x200, 300x300, and 400x400.  Other values may be used.
     
   Note: While English units are not universal, it is preferable to
   avoid multiple unit definitions. 

UA-media=token  
    
   This feature indicates the recipients device media, indicated with
   an simple token.  Basic token values are: screen, stationery,
   transparency, envelope, or continuous-long.  Other values may be
   defined.  Except for "screen" and "Screen-paged", these tokens are
   a subset of the Printer MIB MediaType set defined in RFC-1759 [6].
   Other tokens may be registered and used as needed.
    
   They are defined as:  
     screen:           a refreshable display 
     screen-paged:     a refreshable display which cannot scroll 
     stationery:       separately cut sheets of an opaque material  
     transparency:     separately cut sheets of a transparent material  
     envelope:         envelopes that can be used for conventional  
                       mailing purposes 
     continuous-short: continuously connected sheets of an opaque   
                       material connected along the short edge  
    
papersize=token

   For ua-media types such as stationery, it is often useful to have
   information about the size of display used.  While it is more
   precise and predictable to use absolute resolution and pixel sizes,
   some applications find it useful to provide paper size in lieu of
   or in addition to this information.  Paper sizes names and
   definitions are taken from the the Printer MIB RFC [6].

   Examples of paper size tokens, with names from [6], are:
     na-letter:        8.5x11.0 inches 
     iso-A4:           210x297 mm    
     iso-B4:           250x353 mm
     iso-A3:           297x420 mm            
     na-legal:         8.5x14 inches

color=n 
grey=n  
    
   The color capabilities of the recipient are indicated with feature
   tag and a parameter describing the number of color channel bits
   available.  Values of n are typically (but not limited to) 2, 8, or
   24.  For example: grey=8 indicates a display capable of
   representing an image in 256 levels of a single color, while
   color=8 indicates a display capable of representing an image with a
   palette of 256 colors.
  
tiff=p

   The ability to process image/tiff application profiles, defined by [TIFF].
   Image/tiff application profiles are used to indicate subsets of resolution, 
   size and coding methods supported by a TIFF application.  Additional 
   feature tags describing resolution, media size and so forth may be
   required to completely describe a resource or device.

Examples    

   pix-x=1024 
   pix-y=768 
      indicates a 1024x768 display or a resource best viewed using a
      1024x768 display. 
    
   res=72x72  
      indicates a 72 dpi display or a resource intended for use with
      a 72 dpi display. 
    
   UA-media=stationery  
      indicates the display is a cut sheet of opaque material, such as   
      paper, or a resource intended for use with paper.  
  
   papersize=iso-a4
      indicates the display size is 210x297mm, or the resource is
      intended for output on this display size. 
   
   color=24  
      indicates the display supports 24-bit (8-bit/channel) color, or
      a resource intended for display on such a device.   
       
   tiff=F
      indicates a devices supporting tiff-profile F or a resource
      intended for display with such a device.
