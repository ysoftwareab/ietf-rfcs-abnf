                  ENUM Service Registration for H.323 URL 

Introduction 
    
   The H.323 specification [2] defines a means for building multimedia 
   communication services over an arbitrary Packet Based Network, 
   including the Internet. When H.323 is used in the context of the 
   Internet, it would be useful to take advantages of such services as 
   domain name system (DNS) and ENUM in order to help facilitate the 
   completion of multimedia calls. 
    
   This document registers an ENUM service for H.323 according to 
   specifications and guidelines in RFC2916bis [3]. 
    
ENUM Service Registration 
    
   As defined in [3], the following is a template covering information 
   needed for the registration of the enumservice specified in this 
   document. 
     
   -  Service Name: "E2U+H323"  
   -  URI Scheme(s): "h323:"  
   -  Functional Specification: see "The E2U+H323 ENUM Service" section  
   -  Security considerations: see "Security Considerations" section  
   -  Intended usage: COMMON  
   -  Author: Orit Levin  
   -  Any other information that the author deems interesting: None 
     
The E2U+H323 ENUM Service 
    
   This document defines the "E2U+H323" service to be used in the 
   "service" sub-field of the "enumservice" as defined in [3]. 
    
   The H.323 related ENUM record MUST be populated with a standard 
   H.323 URL as defined in [2]. This URL MAY include parameters 
   specifying the specific protocols and the transport means the H.323 
   entity supports. 
    
   The H.323 entity MUST fully comply with the procedures defined in [3] 
   for both record retrieval and processing by the DNS client. 
    
   If, as a result of the ENUM DNS lookup, an H.323 URL matching local 
   policies and capabilities is retrieved, the procedure defined in 
   section "Address Resolution Procedure using DNS" of [5] SHOULD be 
   performed. 
    
Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 
    
Security Considerations 
 
   The h323-URL information, once populated in the DNS, effectively 
   becomes publicly accessible. The access to the H.323 destinations

                  ENUM Service Registration for H.323 URL 

   (published using ENUM) can be secured by techniques and procedures 
   defined in H.235 [4] - the security framework for H.323. The 
   framework defines means for achieving integrity, authentication, 
   non-repudiation, encryption, etc. for H.323 calls. 
    
IANA Considerations 
 
   This document registers the "E2U+H323" ENUM service according to 
   specifications and guidelines in RFC2916bis [3] and the definitions 
   in this document.
