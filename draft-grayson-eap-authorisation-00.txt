Abstract 

   This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
   mechanism for authorization information exchange. EAP TLV is a 
   container type for EAP messages. This mechanism describes an EAP TLV 
   for exchange of authorization related information which can take 
   place within the EAP framework and allows an authentic user to 
   provide the network with additional information in order to 
   determine which Internet Service is being requested.  This mechanism 
   may be chained after any EAP-Authentication mechanism.

1. Introduction 

    

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), described in [2], 
   provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication 
   methods. Through the use of EAP, support for a number of 
   authentication schemes may be added, including GSM smart card 
   support, one time password and others.  

   The encapsulation of EAP has been defined over IEEE 802 link layers 
   in IEEE 802.1X [3]. In 802.1X, an authentication failure will result 
   in denied access to the controlled port. Conversely, an 
   authenticated peer will be allowed access.  

   This document specifies an extension to EAP using TLV encapsulation 
   for authorization exchange which may be used to authorize additional 
   resources for the peer, e.g., above access to the controlled port 
   defined in 802.1X. In particular, this document describes techniques 
   for the definition and authorization of tunnel resources in a manner 
   which is secure, independent of the selected authentication method 
   and compatible with existing AAA based configuration, e.g., for

   configuring compulsory network based tunnels [4]. Other 
   authorization attributes are expected to be defined in the future.  

   This method relies upon a security association to provide message 
   protection established using PEAP [1] or Protected TLV [9]. This 
   approach provides a consistent authorization interfaces for various 
   access systems and allows the authorization to be decoupled from a 
   specific authentication method. 

     

    

2. Terms 

 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5]. 

   This document frequently uses the following terms and abbreviations: 

   AAA protocol 

      Authentication, Authorization and Accounting protocol 

   Authentication service  

      The Authentication Service verifies, from the credentials 
      supplied by the peer, the claim of identity made by the peer.  

   Authorization Service 

      The Authorization Service verifies the service requested by the 
      peer is valid. Optionally, the Authorization Service may be 
      involved in configuring the authorized service on behalf of the 
      peer. 

   EAP 

      Extensible Authentication Protocol. 

   EAP Server 

      The network element that terminates the EAP protocol. Typically, 
      the EAP server functionality is implemented in a AAA server. In 
      this document, the AAA server provides both Authentication and 
      Authorization service.

      Network Access Identifier

   PEAP 

      Protected EAP 

   Peer 

      A peer is an entity that is being authenticated by an 
      Authenticator. Once authenticity is validated the peer can be 
      allowed access to authorized resources.  

   TLV 

      A TLV is an attribute formatted as type, length and value. 

       

3. Overview 

    

   Whilst established EAP methods define exchanges for providing an 
   Authentication Service for a peer, EAP-TLV/Authorization exchanges 
   define procedures for providing an Authorization Service. EAP-
   TLV/Authorization uses a minimum of a single roundtrip to provide 
   additional authorization information towards the EAP server. 

   The EAP Authorization phase must be chained after Authentication has 
   completed and a key is available for protecting the confidentiality 
   and authenticity of the authorization exchange.  The protection of 
   the exchange may be provided by a mechanism such as PEAP or by 
   Protected TLVs described in [9].   

   After authentication is complete and keys are established the server 
   sends a request of type EAP-TLV/Start-Authorization.   

   The peer responds with an EAP-TLV/Request-Authorization packet 
   including one or more EAP-Authorization attributes which the peer 
   provides to the network in order to define service parameters which 
   are to be authorized.   

   After receiving the EAP-TLV/Authorization-Request packet, the EAP 
   sever can confirm which services the peer is requesting resources 
   for and perform authorization checks. Authorization checks may 
   involve third parties for which the peer may use an identification 
   distinct from that which was previously used for port based 
   authentication. EAP-TLV/Authorization-Request therefore includes the 
   capability to carry additional identification and authentication 
   information, according to the service being authorized.  

   It is possible that the authenticating server may wish to request 
   additional information from the client.  It may use an EAP-
   TLV/Authorization-Request packet containing one or more 
   Authorization attributes for this purpose.   
  
Grayson and Salowey     Expires in six months                [Page 4] 
Internet Draft            EAP Authorization              January 2003 
 
 
   Since the EAP-failure message does not include the option to 
   transport a Displayable Message, the EAP server can use an EAP-
   Notification message to provide the supplicant with additional 
   information, e.g., if service authorization fails. 

3.1. Providing Additional Information 

   The specific information related to authorization will depend upon 
   the authorized resources being requested. The EAP-Authorization 
   methods are extensible to allow new authorization information to be 
   defined. The document describes the minimum supported attributes for 
   the mandatory tunnel service includes authorization identifier, 
   tunnel password and tunnel endpoint description. 

3.2. Mandatory Tunnel Example 

    
   In the mandatory tunnel example the client is requesting that a 
   secure tunnel be established from within the local network to which 
   the client is connected to a home network.  A pre-arranged 
   relationship is established between the local network and the home 
   network to allow for this.  The authentication is proxied by the 
   local network to the home network using AAA techniques.  
    
   After the user has successfully completed an EAP authentication 
   method such as EAP-MD5 within PEAP the authenticator sends an EAP-
   TLV/Authorization-Start request to see if the client wishes to 
   request additional services.  The client then responds with an EAP-
   TLV/Authorization-Request message containing the following 
   attributes: 
    
   Authorization Identity 
   Service Type 
   Tunnel FQDN 
   Tunnel Password 
    
   The authenticator then verifies that the authenticated user is 
   allowed to use the authorization identity and service defined by the 
   service type and tunnel FQDN.  It may also verify the tunnel 
   password.  The authenticator then saves these parameters to be 
   passed back to the local network using AAA, e.g., using RADIUS 
   attributes in the Access-Accept defined in RFC 2868.  It is possible 
   that the authenticator may return different attributes to the local 
   network based on its policy (for example it may return a different 
   tunnel password).  The local network then establishes a tunnel back 
   to the home network according to the parameters in the access 
   accept.  The tunnel endpoint in the home network authenticates the 
   local endpoint using the username (authorization identity) and 
   password passed back in the access accept.   
    
   This is just one example of how EAP Authorization may be used, there 
   are many other possibilities.

4. Message Format 

 
   The authorization message consists of a series of attributes. The 
   collection of all attributes MUST be protected with PEAP and/or 
   protected TLV as in [11].  The following attributes are defined by 
   this document.

6. Protection of EAP-TLV/Authorization 

 
   The EAP-TLV/Authorization mechanism SHOULD be protected.  The 
   recommended way to achieve this is to run within a protected EAP 
   mechanism such as PEAP or Protected TLV.

IANA Considerations 
 
   Since multi-vendor interoperability is desired, an EAP Authorization 
   Type number is required to be allocated by IANA. 

    
Security Considerations 
    
   The authorization exchange should be protected either by an external 
   mechanism such as PEAP or by using protected TLVs.
