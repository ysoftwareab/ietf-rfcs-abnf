     2.  Abstract

     This  memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS authen-
     tication server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the
     Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management pro-
     tocols in the Internet community.   Using  these  extensions  IP-based
     management stations can manage RADIUS authentication servers.


     3.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     authentication servers.

     RADIUS authentication servers are  today  widely  deployed  by  dialup
     Internet  Service  Providers,  in order to provide authentication ser-
     vices. As a result, the effective management of RADIUS  authentication
     servers is of considerable importance.

     4.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The  SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major compo-
     nents.  They are:

           o  RFC 1902 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
              describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

           o  RFC 1905 which defines the protocol used for network access to
              managed objects.

           o  RFC 1907 defines the core set of managed objects for the
              Internet suite of protocols.

           o  RFC 1909 which defines the administrative aspects of the
              framework.

     The Framework permits new objects to be defined  for  the  purpose  of
     experimentation and evaluation.


     4.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are defined
     using  the  subset  of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in
     the SMI. In particular, each object object type is named by an  OBJECT
     IDENTIFIER,  an  administratively  assigned  name.   The  object  type
     together with an object instance serves to uniquely  identify  a  spe-
     cific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often use
     a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object  type.


     5.  Overview

     The  RADIUS  authentication  protocol, described in [1], distinguishes
     between the client function and the server function. In RADIUS authen-
     tication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers reply with Access-
     Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges. Typically NAS  devices
     implement the client function, and thus would be expected to implement
     the RADIUS authentication  client  MIB,  while  RADIUS  authentication
     servers  implement  the server function, and thus would be expected to
     implement the RADIUS authentication server MIB.

     However, it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to  perform
     both  client and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act
     as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while simul-
     taneously  acting as an authentication client to one or more authenti-
     cation servers. In such situations, it is expected that  RADIUS  enti-
     ties  combining  client and server functionality will support both the
     client and server MIBs.

     5.1.  Selected objects

     This MIB module contains five scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Authentication Client Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS authentication client that the server shares a secret with.

     Each entry in the RADIUS Authentication Client Table  includes  twelve
     entries presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS authentication
     server.
