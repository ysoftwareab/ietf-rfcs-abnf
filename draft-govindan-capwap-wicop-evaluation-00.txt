3.  Introduction

   The Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) [I-D.iino-capwap-wicop]
   addresses the most important issue for current WLANs - the ability to
   control and manage systems made up of different types of WTPs.  WiCoP
   provides this ability and enables administrators to manage WLANs with
   a mix of local-MAC and split-MAC WTPs.

   This document evaluates WiCoP with respect to the CAPWAP Objectives
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-objectives] and indicates how the protocol realizes
   those requirements.

Internet-Draft              WiCoP Evaluation                    May 2005


4.  WiCoP Evaluation

   The CAPWAP Objectives are being devised by the CAPWAP WG as the core
   set of requirements needed to control and provision large-scale
   WLANs.  The following sections describe how WiCoP realizes all those
   requirements.

4.1  Mandatory and Accepted Objectives

   The Mandatory and Accepted Objectives represent those requirements
   that have been deemed of highest importance.  WiCoP realizes all
   these requirements and in doing so, delivers an effective solution
   for managing large-scale WLANs.

4.1.1  Logical Groups

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST be capable of controlling and managing
   physical WTPs in terms of logical groups including BSSID-based
   groups.

4.1.1.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP establishes logical groups using BSSIDs for the wireless medium
   segment and VLANs for the switching segment [WiCoP Section 6.4.1].
   The protocol maps the two logical groups using the BSSID-TunnelID
   item of the Conf WTP Data message element [WiCoP Section 5.2.2].

4.1.1.2  Comparison

   The authors believe that CTP [I-D.singh-capwap-ctp] provides a
   feature that would enhance the realization of the Logical Groups
   objective in terms of QoS policy.  For example, the CTP 'Policy'
   field may be integrated with WiCoP's logical BSSID-TunnelID
   configuration parameter to specify QoS attributes for the logical
   groups.

4.1.1.3  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.2  Support for Traffic Separation

   The CAPWAP Protocol MUST define transport control messages such that
   the transport of control messages is separate from the transport of
   data messages.

Internet-Draft              WiCoP Evaluation                    May 2005


4.1.2.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP uses separate tunnels for data and control traffic.
   Additionally, the protocol uses distinct VLAN tunnels for traffic
   from different logical groups [WiCoP Section 6.4.1].  This ensures
   that traffic flows are separated between WTPs and WLAN controller.

   Furthermore, WiCoP uses distinct messages for control and data
   traffic.  The two are never combined.

4.1.2.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.3  Wireless Terminal Transparency

   Wireless terminals MUST NOT be required to recognize or be aware of
   the CAPWAP protocol.

4.1.3.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP does not mandate any changes to wireless terminals.  The
   specifications only address the interface between WTPs and their WLAN
   controller.

4.1.3.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.4  Configuration Consistency

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST include support for regular exchanges of
   state information between WTPs and WLAN controller.  Examples of
   state information include WTP processing load and memory utilization.

4.1.4.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP uses the Feedback Interval timer [WiCoP Section 5.4.2] to
   maintain regular exchanges of Feedback messages [WiCoP Section
   5.2.3], which contain information on the configuration state of WTPs
   and WLAN controller.  This helps the WLAN controller in effecting
   consistent configuration changes to all WTPs.

4.1.4.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.5  Firmware Trigger

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST support a trigger for delivery of firmware
   updates.

4.1.5.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP activates Firmware Download message to initiate firmware check
   and download [WiCoP Section 5.2.3].

4.1.5.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.6  Monitoring and Exchange of System-wide Resource State

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST allow for the exchange of statistics,
   congestion and other WLAN state information.

4.1.6.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP Feedback messages [WiCoP Section 5.2.3] together with QoS
   Value, Statistics, Interface Error and QoS Capability message
   elements to monitor configuration state of WTPs and WLAN Controller
   [WiCoP Section 5.2.2].

4.1.6.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.7  Resource Control Objective

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST map the IEEE 802.11e QoS priorities to
   equivalent QoS priorities across the switching and wireless medium
   segments.

4.1.7.1  Protocol Evaluation

   The current specifications do not directly address this objective,
   however WiCoP can map IEEE 802.11e requirements to VLAN priority tags
   using the BSSID-TunnelID item of the Conf WTP Data message element
   [WiCoP Section 5.2.2].

4.1.7.2  Compliance

   WiCoP partially satisfies this objective.

4.1.8  CAPWAP Protocol Security

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST support mutual authentication of WTPs and
   the centralized controller.  It must also ensure that information
   exchanges between them are secured.

4.1.8.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP makes use of IPSec based authentication and encryption
   mechanisms [WiCoP Section 6.3] to secure all exchanges.

4.1.8.2  Comparison

   The authors feel that the use of DTLS such as in SLAPP
   [I-D.narasimhan-ietf-slapp]is effective in addressing this objective.
   SLAPP describes an existing mechanism that can be reused in the
   CAPWAP context.  It would be preferable for CAPWAP to use DTLS as
   opposed to adopting a new mechanism for key exchange and protocol
   security.

4.1.8.3  Compliance

   WiCoP partially satisfies this objective.

4.1.9  System-wide Security

   The design of the CAPWAP protocol MUST NOT allow for any compromises
   to the WLAN system by external entities.

4.1.9.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP does not yet address the issue of potential problems due to PMK
   sharing.

4.1.9.2  Compliance

   WiCoP does not satisfy this objective.

4.1.10  IEEE 802.11i Considerations

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST determine the exact structure of the
   centralized WLAN architecture in which authentication needs to be
   supported, i.e. the location of major authentication components.
   This may be achieved during WTP initialization where major
   capabilities are distinguished.

   The protocol must allow for the exchange of key information when
   authenticator and encryption roles are located in distinct entities.

Internet-Draft              WiCoP Evaluation                    May 2005


4.1.10.1  Protocol Evaluation

   This objective brings out the important architecture condition of the
   authenticator being located distinctly from the point of encryption.
   WiCoP addresses this condition with the use of the Key Config message
   [WiCoP Section 5.2.3].  Key Config is used to explicitly transport
   the 3rd message of the four-way handshake from the authenticator
   (WLAN controller) to the point of encryption (WTP) [WiCoP Section
   6.5.6].  As a result of this feature, WiCoP allows the WTP to
   calculate the KeyMIC with its KeyRSC.

4.1.10.2  Comparison

   The authors believe that, based on prevailing specifications of the
   other candidate protocols, only WiCoP explicitly addresses this
   objective.

4.1.10.3  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.11  Interoperability Objective

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST include sufficient capabilities negotiations
   to distinguish between major types of WTPs.

4.1.11.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP realizes this objective of managing co-existence of WTPs of
   different MAC designs.  The protocol uses the 'M' field of the WiCoP
   header to distinguish between local-MAC and split-MAC WTPs [WiCoP
   Section 5.1].

   So for each WiCoP packet from a WTP, the WLAN controller simply
   parses the packet header and then processes it accordingly, i.e. for
   packets from local-MAC WTP certain MAC processing are bypassed.

   If however, the 'M' field is not used, then the WLAN controller must
   first parse incoming packet header and then use the parsed
   information to perform a lookup operation to determine the type of
   WTP and then determine how to process the packet.  This is an
   extended procedure which will adversely affect WLAN operational
   performance.

   So using 'M' field, a WLAN controller can handle packets from
   different types of WTPs faster and with fewer processing steps.

Internet-Draft              WiCoP Evaluation                    May 2005


4.1.11.2  Comparison

   The authors believe that, based on prevalent specifications of
   alternative candidate protocols, WiCoP realizes the Interoperability
   Objective in the most efficient manner.

4.1.11.3  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.12  Protocol Specifications

   Any WTP or AC vendor or any person MUST be able to implement the
   CAPWAP protocol from the specification itself and by that it is
   required that all such implementations do interoperate.

4.1.12.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP is a complete specification and does not require any additional
   proprietary information to implement.

4.1.12.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.13  Vendor Independence

   A WTP vendor can make modifications to hardware without any AC vendor
   involvement.

4.1.13.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP is a complete specification and does not require any additional
   proprietary information to implement.

4.1.13.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.1.14  Vendor Flexibility

   WTP vendors must not be bound to a specific MAC.

4.1.14.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP is a complete specification and does not require any additional
   proprietary information to implement.

4.1.14.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.2  Desirable Objectives

   The Desirable Objectives are those that are not crucial to a CAPWAP
   protocol but would be beneficial.  WiCoP realizes all these
   requirements.

4.2.1  Multiple Authentication Mechanisms

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST support different authentication mechanisms
   in addition to IEEE 802.11i.

4.2.1.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP does not prevent the operation of any authentication mechanism.
   It is generic to support all types of authentication mechanisms.

4.2.1.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfy this objective.

4.2.2  Support for Future Wireless Technologies

   CAPWAP protocol messages MUST be designed to be extensible for
   specific layer 2 wireless technologies.  It should not be limited to
   the transport of elements relating to IEEE 802.11.

4.2.2.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP is generic and extensible to support future developments in
   wireless technologies.

4.2.2.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.2.3  Support for New IEEE Requirements

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST be openly designed to support new IEEE
   802.11 extensions.

4.2.3.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP is generic and extensible to support future developments in
   wireless technologies and standards.

4.2.3.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfy this objective.

4.2.4  Interconnection Objective

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST NOT be constrained to specific underlying
   transport mechanisms.

4.2.4.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP does not rely of the specifics of underlying transport
   technologies.  Although WiCoP uses UDP, it does not require any UDP-
   specific information for its operation.

4.2.4.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.2.5  Access Control

   The CAPWAP protocol MUST be capable of exchanging information
   required for access control of WTPs and wireless terminals.

4.2.5.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP uses the Terminal Data message element [WiCoP Section 5.2.2] to
   exchange association and authentication information on wireless
   terminals.  This is used by the WLAN controller to supervise access
   control.

4.2.5.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.3  Non-objectives

   These objectives have been recognized by the CAPWAP WG as having
   relatively lower priorities for the current phase of CAPWAP.

4.3.1  Support for Non-CAPWAP WTPs

   The CAPWAP protocol SHOULD be capable of recognizing legacy WTPs and
   existing network management systems.

4.3.1.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP can configure local-MAC WTPs, which in some cases require

   limited management. This case is similar to those of legacy WTPs.
 
4.3.1.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.3.2  Technical Specifications

   WTP vendors SHOULD NOT have to share technical specifications for
   hardware and software to AC vendors in order for interoperability to
   be achieved.

4.3.2.1  Protocol Evaluation

   WiCoP is a complete specification and does not require any additional
   proprietary information to implement.

4.3.2.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

4.4  Operator Requirements

   The following objective addresses the concerns of WLAN service
   providers.

4.4.1  AP Fast Handoff

   The CAPWAP protocol operations MUST NOT impede or obstruct the
   efficacy of AP fast handoff procedures.

4.4.1.1  Protocol Evaluation

   Since WiCoP addresses the centralized WLAN architecture in which
   information can be managed across WTPs.  Consequently, the protocol
   would only serve to enhance AP fast handoff procedures instead of
   impeding it.

4.4.1.2  Compliance

   WiCoP completely satisfies this objective.

   satisfies most of the crucial objectives.  The authors also believe
   that WiCoP addresses some objectives in highly efficient and
   effective ways.
