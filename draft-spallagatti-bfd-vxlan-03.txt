1.  Introduction

   "Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)" has been defined in
   [RFC7348] that provides an encapsulation scheme which allows VM's to
   communicate in data center network.

   VXLAN is typically deployed in data centers interconnecting
   virtualized hosts, which may be spread across multiple racks.  The
   individual racks may be part of a different Layer 3 network or they
   could be in a single Layer 2 network.  The VXLAN segments/overlay
   networks are overlaid on top of these Layer 2 or Layer 3 networks.

   A virtual machine (VM) can communicate with a VM in other host only
   if they are on same VXLAN.  VM's are unaware of VXLAN tunnels as
   VXLAN tunnel is terminated on VXLAN Tunnel End Point(VTEP)

   (hypervisor/TOR).  VTEPs (hypervisor/TOR) are responsible for
   encapsulating and decapsulating frames exchanged among VM's.

   Since underlay is a L3 network, continuity check for these tunnels
   becomes important.  BFD as defined in [RFC5880] can be used to
   monitor the VXLAN tunnels.  Use of [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] is for
   future study.

   This draft addresses requirements outlined in
   [I-D.ashwood-nvo3-operational-requirement].  Specifically with
   reference to the OAM model to Figure 3 of
   [I-D.ashwood-nvo3-operational-requirement], this draft outlines
   proposal to implement the OAM mechanism between the NV Edges using
   BFD.

2.  Use cases

   Main use case of BFD for VXLAN is for tunnel continuity check.  BFD
   packets between VTEPs will exercise the VXLAN path in underlay/
   overlay ensuring the VXLAN path reachability.  BFD failure detection
   can be used for maintenance.  There are other use cases such as

      Layer 2 VM's:

         Most deployments will have VM's with only L2 capabilities that
         may not support L3.  BFD being a L3 protocol can be used as
         tunnel CC mechanism, where BFD will start and terminate at the
         Network Virtualization (NV) Edge (VTEPs).

         It is possible to aggregate the CC sessions for multiple
         tenants by running a BFD session between the VTEPs over VxLAN
         tunnel.  In rest of this document terms NV Edge and VTEP are
         used interchangeably.

      Fault localization:

         It is also possible that VM's are L3 aware and can possibly
         host a BFD session.  In these cases BFD sessions can be
         established among VM's for CC.  In addition BFD sessions can be
         established among VTEPs for tunnel CC.  Having a hierarchical
         OAM model helps localize faults though requires additional
         consideration.

      Service node reachability:

         Service node is responsible for sending BUM traffic.  In case
         of service node tunnel terminates at VTEP and it might not even

         host VM's.  BFD session between TOR/hypervisor and service node
         can be used to monitor service node reachability.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where we have two servers, each of
   them hosting two VMs.  These VTEPs terminate two VXLAN tunnels with
   VNI number 100 and 200 between them.  Separate BFD sessions can be
   established between the VTEPs (IP1 and IP2) for monitoring each of
   the VXLAN tunnels (VNI 100 and 200).  No BFD packets intended to
   Hypervisor VTEP should be forwarded to a VM as VM may drop BFD

   packets leading to false negative.  This method is applicable whether
   VTEP is a software or a physical device.

4.  BFD Packet Transmission

   BFD packet MUST be encapsulated and sent to remote VTEP as explained
   in Section 4.1.  Implementations SHOULD ensure that the BFD packets
   follow the same lookup path of VXLAN packets within the sender
   system.

4.1.  BFD Packet Encapsulation

   VXLAN packet format has been defined in Section 5 of [RFC7348].  The
   Outer IP/UDP and VXLAN headers MUST be encoded by the sender as per
   [RFC7348].

   If VTEP is equipped with Generic Protocol Extension (GPE) header
   capabilities and decides to use GPE instead of VXLAN then GPE header
   MUST be encoded as per Section 3.3 of [I-D.quinn-vxlan-gpe].  Next
   Protocol Field in GPE header MUST be set to IPv4 or IPv6.

   Details of how VTEP decides to use VXLAN or GPE header are outside
   the scope of this document.

   The BFD packet MUST be carried inside the inner MAC frame of the
   VxLAN packet.  The inner MAC frame carrying the BFD payload has the
   following format:

      Ethernet Header:

         Destination MAC: This MUST be a well-known MAC [TBD] OR the MAC
         address of the destination VTEP.  The details of how the
         destination MAC address is obtained are outside the scope of
         this document.

         Source MAC: MAC address of the originating VTEP

      IP header:

         Source IP: IP address of the originating VTEP.

         Destination IP: IP address of the terminating VTEP.

         TTL: This MUST be set to 1.  This is to ensure that the BFD
         packet is not routed within the L3 underlay network.

         [Ed.Note]:Use of inner source and destination IP addresses
         needs more discussion by the WG.

Internet-Draft                BFD for VXLAN                   April 2016


      The fields of the UDP header and the BFD control packet are
      encoded as specified in RFC 5881 for p2p VXLAN tunnels.

5.  Reception of BFD packet

   Once a packet is received, VTEP MUST validate the packet as described
   in Section 4.1 of [RFC7348].  If the Destination MAC of the inner MAC
   frame matches the well-known MAC or the MAC address of the VTEP the
   packet MUST be processed further.

   The UDP destination port and the TTL of the inner MAC frame MUST be
   validated to determine if the received packet can be processed by
   BFD.  BFD packet with inner MAC set to VTEP or well-known MAC address
   MUST not be forwarded to VM's.

   To ensure BFD detects the proper configuration of VXLAN Network
   Identifier(VNI) in a remote VTEP, a lookup SHOULD be performed with
   the MAC-DA and VNI as key in the Virtual Forwarding Instance(VFI)
   table of the originating/ terminating VTEP in order to exercise the
   VFI associated with the VNI.

5.1.  Demultiplexing of the BFD packet

   Demultiplexing of IP BFD packet has been defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC5881].  Since multiple BFD sessions may be running between two
   VTEPs, there needs to be a mechanism for demultiplexing received BFD
   packets to the proper session.  The procedure for demultiplexing
   packets with Your Discriminator = 0 is different from [RFC5880].  For
   such packets, the BFD session MUST be identified using the inner
   headers, i.e. the source IP and the destination IP present in the IP
   header carried by the payload of the VXLAN encapsulated packet.  The
   VNI of the packet SHOULD be used to derive interface related
   information for demultiplexing the packet.  If BFD packet is received
   with non-zero your discriminator then BFD session should be
   demultiplexed only with your discriminator as the key.

6.  Use of reserved VNI

   BFD session MAY be established for the reserved VNI 0.  One way to
   aggregate BFD sessions between VTEP's is to establish a BFD session
   with VNI 0.  A VTEP MAY also use VNI 0 to establish a BFD session
   with a service node.

7.  Echo BFD

   Support for echo BFD is outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft                BFD for VXLAN                   April 2016


8.  IANA Considerations

   The well-known MAC to be used for the Destination MAC address of the
   inner MAC frame needs to be defined

9.  Security Considerations

   Document recommends setting of inner IP TTL to 1 which could lead to
   DDoS attack, implementation MUST have throttling in place.
   Throttling MAY be relaxed for BFD packeted based on port number.

   Other than inner IP TTL set to 1 this specification does not raise
   any additional security issues beyond those of the specifications
   referred to in the list of normative references.
