           IPv6 Router Advertisement Option for Network Boot
                      draft-qin-6man-nb-option-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) option
   (called "Boot File URL option") to allow IPv6 routers to advertise
   configuration information for booting a node from the network.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) option
   (called BFURL option) that can be used to provide configuration
   information for nodes to be booted from network instead of local
   media.

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] and IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] define ways to configure IPv6
   addresses, on-link prefix list, default routers and other parameters.

   The existing ND message (RA) is used to carry this network boot
   information.  Nodes can get the boot file url and parameters through
   RA messages via BFRUL option.

   This approach is useful in networks with no DHCPv6 infrastructure.
   The intention is to simplify the implementation on both node side
   (i.e.  PXE firmware), and network side.

   A boot file can be a boot-loader program or a minimal OS kernel.  The
   node firmware needs to download the boot file and execute it.  The
   distribution of additional information and further communications
   between the node and network side (e.g., an install server) should be
   handled by applications built in the boot file.

   The configuration of a Boot-File-URL would be required into routers
   sending RA messages.  The configuration mechanism ( manual or
   automatic) is out of scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Option

   The option formats comply with ND options per [RFC4861]
   (Section 4.6).

2.1.  Boot File Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Option

   Routers send this option to nodes with a URL to a boot file.

   Type                    TBD.

   Length                  The length of this option (including the Type
                           and Length fields) in octets.

   Boot-File-URL           The URL for a boot file in string.  Its
