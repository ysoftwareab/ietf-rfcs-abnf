       RADIUS Extension for Certificate-based SSH Authentication
              draft-vishwakarma-opsawg-ssh-cert-radius-01

Abstract

   A scalable and centralized mechanism is required for a certificate-
   based administrative access to multitude of virtualized and physical
   network functions.  While there are mechanisms that exist today to
   provide secure administrative command-line and API-based access,
   there are certain management and maintenance overheads as well as
   certain scalability challenges related to it.  In this draft we
   discuss these challenges and propose a standardized, centralized
   server-based mechanism to authenticate a user over an SSH session
   using its client certificate.

2.  Introduction

   With the pervasive use of virtualized infrastructure (e.g.,
   microservices-based application designs), a high magnitude of
   individual and autonomous software application components are working
   together to realize a complete system functionality.  With a large
   number of highly interacting agents, an authentication and
   authorization mechanism which is scalable and flexible is very
   critical for administrative access.  A typical service authentication
   and authorization (AAA) infrastructure comprise of an identity
   management, verification and, validations functions.

   In a typical day of an IT (Information Technology) enabled
   organization, IT engineers often connect to many different servers
   while carrying their tasks such as, change of configurations, write a
   software code, save a file, fetch an image, etc.  There are mainly
   three different ways engineers can authenticate to the servers they
   are connecting to.

   o  Password based

   o  RSA key based

   o  OpenSSH certificate based local authentication

   While these methods are currently being used, they suffer from the
   following limitations respectively.

   o  Password based: In this method, user needs to enter the username
      and password each time it tries to login to a server.  With the
      increasing frequency and number of servers, the manual
      configuration becomes untenable.  While script-based automation is
      an option, it is highly insecure as passwords are stored in
      cleartext.  Also, a frequent password changes and adherence to
      complex password policies are required to prevent against any
      misuse.  A 2-factor authentication mechanism provides some
      protection but it still involves a certain level of human
      interaction, which is difficult to automate.

   o  The RSA key-based authentication requires a frequent copy of files
      to each device, server, cloud-native network function (CNF), and
      virtual network functions (VNFs) and hence is not scalable.  In
      addition, if a key gets compromised, the revocation of it from all
      servers and VNFs involves a lot of effort.

   o  OpenSSH certificate based local authentication requires root
      certification authority (CA) certificate to be copied to each
      individual device, server, and the VNF.  If the developers are

      using client certificate from multiple certification authorities,
      all of the certification authority (CA) root certificate and
      intermediate certificate has to be installed on each of the
      servers that's being accessed.  Also, a connectivity to the
      certificate revocation list (CRL) is required from all the
      devices, servers, and VNFs to check for revoked certificates.  In
      a typical customer environment all the device, servers, and VNFs
      do not have access to a public CRL location.  Also, any changes in
      the certificates (e.g. expiry or revocation) requires a manual or
      a script based cleanup of certificates from all the servers.

   In order to address these limitations and move towards a password-
   less mechanism, we propose an approach that uses certificate based
   SSH authentication using RADIUS protocol.  The centralized server-
   based system also helps solve all the above outlined limitations.

2.1.  Centralized RADUIS Server based Solution

   As shown in Figure 1, a method is devised to authenticate SSH
   sessions using client certificates, where the device, server, VNF,
   and CNF uses RADIUS protocol to validate the authenticity of the
   certificate from a centralized RADIUS server.  The RADIUS server will
   get the username from the CN (common name) field in the client
   certificate.

   The benefits of using certificates for SSH session authentication are
   as follows:

   o  It does not require a frequent client certificate replacement
      (e.g., a certificate is typically valid for a year), which solves
      the problem seen in the password-based authentications.

   o  It does not require client public keys to be copied to each
      device, server, VNF, or CNF that needs to be accessed.

   o  It doesn't need any secondary out-of-band authentication like OTP
      or a complex MFA (Multi-factor Authentication) solution.

   o  All the root certificates and intermediate certificates needs to
      be installed on the RADIUS server only.  This makes it easy for
      many administrative tasks including initial setup, adding a new
      CA, retiring of an old CA, certificate revocation check, and the
      centralized access to the internet to download the revocation
      list.

   o  Both the certificate validation and revocation check happen at a
      centralized AAA server.

3.  Operational Details

   Operation is identical to that defined in [RFC2865], [RFC5216], and
   [RFC4252].

3.1.  Basic Setup

   Analogous to 802.1X authentication where there is an EAP Supplicant
   (also known as EAP peer), pass-through authenticator, and a RADIUS
   server.  This solution has an SSH client that is similar to EAP
   supplicant, an SSH server similar to pass-through authenticator, and
   a RADIUS server.  The SSH transport protocol defined in RFC 4253 MUST
   be used as the lower layer of the EAP.  The SSH transport protocol
   satisfies all the requirements of the EAP lower layer defined in the
   section 3.1 of the RFC 3748.

   o  Unreliable transport: Even though the EAP assumes that the lower
      layer can be a unreliable transport and has retransmission built
      into EAP itself.  The SSH transport protocol is a reliable
      transport protocol and handles its own retransmission when used
      over TCP/IP.  RFC 793 section 3.7 has the details of data
      communication and retransmission behavior of TCP.

   o  Lower layer error detection: Error detection must be provided by
      the EAP lower layer and SSH TP does that using the sequence
      numbers in the TCP packets.  This is detailed in the section 3.3
      of the RFC 793.

   o  Lower layer security: EAP does not require lower layers to provide
      security services, however SSH TP over TCP provides for

Internet-Draft               SSL Cert Radius                   June 2021


   o  Data integrity: as detailed in section 6.4 of RFC 4253 and section
      9.3.2 of RFC 4251

   o  Replay protection: as detailed in section 9.3.3 of RFC 4251

   o  Authentication: as detailed in section 9.4 of RFC 4251

   o  Confidentiality: as detailed in section 6.3 of RFC 4253 and
      section 9.3.1

   o  Minimum MTU: EAP requires the lower layer to support 1020 bytes or
      higher MTU.  SSH TP satisfies this requirement.  In a typical TCP/
      IP network the MTU is by default set to 1500 bytes which satisfies
      the requirement for EAP.

   o  Possible duplication: while it is desirable that lower layers
      provide for non-duplication, this is not a requirement.

   o  Ordering guarantees: Lower layer transports for EAP MUST preserve
      ordering between a source and destination at a given priority
      level (the ordering guarantee provided by [IEEE-802]).  SSH TP
      when used over TCP/IP guarantees ordered delivery of data from
      source to destination.  Section 2.6 of RFC 793 details the use of
      sequence numbers in TCP.

   The SSH client MUST support certificate-based authentication for the
   SSH session.  The SSH client MUST also have a X.509 client
   certificate installed on the operating system.  The client
   certificate MUST have "client authentication" as value in the
   enhanced key usage field of the certificate.  This will ensure that
   the client is ready to complete SSH authentication using the
   installed X.509 client certificate.

   The SSH server MUST be configured to send SSH authentication requests
   to a RADIUS server.

   The RADIUS server MUST have an X.509 server certificate installed on
   the operating system.  The server certificate MUST have ''server
   authentication" as value in the enhanced key usage field of the
   certificate.  This will ensure that the RADIUS server is ready to
   authenticate SSH clients using certificates.  The RADIUS server MUST
   also be configured to do EAP-TLS authentication as described in
   [RFC3748].

3.2.  EAP TLS authentication

   Although other inner methods of EAP could be supported for
   authentication here such as EAP-MSCHAP, EAP-MD5 or EAP-FAST etc,
   however they do not provide much benefit over the current password
   based authentication that exist.  This draft only focuses on the EAP-
   TLS inner method as that gives the ability to allow certificate based
   authentication.

   The SSH client will initiate an SSH connection to the SSH server.
   The SSH server drives the authentication by telling the SSH client
   which authentication methods can be used during the session.

   The SSH client MUST choose a client certificate installed in the
   operating system as described in the section 2.1 Basic Setup.  If
   there are multiple client certificates then the SSH client SHOULD
   choose a client certificate.  If there is no certificate installed on
   the SSH client, then the client MAY choose another authentication
   methods defined in [RFC4251].

   The SSH client initiates an SSH session to the SSH server.  The SSH
   server upon receiving the connection request MUST initiate the EAP-
   TLS authentication by sending an EAP identity request to the SSH
   client.

   The SSH client picks the common name from the user certificate and
   sends that as the EAP identity back to the SSH server.

3.3.  RADIUS Access Request

   The SSH server constructs a RADIUS authentication request and MUST
   set the service type = Cert Login.  This service type will be an
   indication to the RADIUS server to use EAP-TLS authentication method
   for that SSH session.

   The RADIUS server MUST use EAP-TLS authentication for this session.
   RADIUS server sends a response back to the SSH server as Radius
   Access Challenge(EAP-Message(Code=Request TYPE=TLS EAP(EAP-TLS)))

   The SSH server strips the EAP message from the RADIUS packet received
   and forwards it to the SSH client.  The message is (EAP-
   Message(Code=Request TYPE=TLS EAP(EAP-TLS)).

   The SSH client starts the TLS handshake by sending the EAP-
   Message(TLS Client Hello) to the SSH server.  The SSH server takes
   the EAP message received in the previous step and wraps it in the
   RADIUS access request and sends it to the RADIUS server.  The message
   is Radius Access Request(EAP-Message(TLS Client Hello)).

   Upon receipt of this message the RADIUS server processes the client
   hello message and sends a reply back to the SSH server with server
   hello, server certificate, server key exchange and certificate
   request. The message is Radius Access Challenge(EAP-Message(Server
   Hello, Server Certificate, Server Key exchange, Certificate
   Request).

   The SSH server strips the EAP message from the RADIUS packet received
   in the previous step and forwards it to the SSH client.  The message
   is EAP-Message(Server Hello, Server Certificate, Server Key exchange,
   Certificate Request).  The SSH client validates the server root
   certificate installed.  The SSH client moves ahead in the TLS
   handshake process and sends the client certificate in a message to
   the SSH server EAP-Message(TLS Client Certificate, TLS Client key
   exchange, TLS Certificate Verify)).

   The SSH server takes the EAP message received in the previous step
   and wraps it in the RADIUS access request and sends it to the RADIUS
   server.  The message is Radius Access Request(EAP-Message(TLS Client
   Certificate, TLS Client key exchange, TLS Certificate Verify)).

   The RADIUS server validates the client certificate using the root CA
   certificate chain.  RADIUS server sends a TLS finished message to the
   SSH server.  The message is Radius Access Challenge(EAP-Message(TLS
   Finished)).

   The SSH server strips the EAP message from the RADIUS packet received
   in the previous step and forwards it to the SSH client.  The message
   is EAP-Message(TLS Finished).  The SSH client moves ahead in the EAP
   phase and sends the next message.  The message is EAP-
   Message(TYPE=EAP-TLS)).

   The SSH server takes the EAP message received in the previous step
   and wraps it in the RADIUS access request and sends it to the RADIUS
   server.  The message is Radius Access Request(EAP-Message(TYPE=EAP-
   TLS)).

   RADIUS server processes the previous request and at this the EAP
   authentication is successful.  The message sent back to the SSH
   server is Radius Accept(EAP-Message(EAP-Success)).  The SSH server
   strips the EAP message from the RADIUS packet received in the
   previous step and forwards it to the SSH client.  The message is EAP-
   Message(EAP-Success).

   The SSH session is established at this point.  A message to this
   effect is sent to the SSH client from the SSH server.

3.5.  Radius Access Accept

   As shown in Figure 2, when the Radius server supports the new
   service-type, it sends a Radius Access Accept message.  In case where
   server does not support the certificate-based login type, it responds
   with Radius Access Reject response indicating the new login not
   supported.  The corresponding call flow is shown in Figure 3.

   The Cert Login value shall be used by AAA Client in an Access-Request
   packet to indicate to the RADIUS server that EAP-TLS authentication
   needs to be used for this session.  It is recommended that the
   endpoint shall have a client certificate installed and ready to be
   used during the authentication.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   RADIUS protocol, in accordance with [RFC8126].

   A new attribute is proposed to be added to the RADIUS Radius Access
   Request in the Service-Type Enum.

6.  Security Considerations

   The user certificate used by the clients must be stored in a non-
   shared location of the operating system.  This will ensure that the
   users on the same system are not able to use each other certificates.

   All the security considerations apply from the RFC 2865 as well.

7.  Summary

   A scalable, centralized, and standard-based method for management of
   user login authentication is described.  The proposal comprise of an
   enhancement to the RADIUS protocol message and certain server side
   enhancements shall be required to support the new functionality.
   Once implemented, the enhanced server shall provide an improved user
   experience involving a high frequency and a high scale of user
   authentication across a range of interconnected agents (e.g. client
   and servers).  The enhancement provides an improved configuration and
   management of the authentication infrastructure and reduces the
   overhead related to deployment of root and intermediate certificates
   at individual network nodes.  This enhancement not only makes the
   initial setup easier, but also revocation check easier due to the
   centralized design.  Addition and retirement of root and intermediate
   certificates are among the most time saving aspects of the proposed
   enhancement.

8.  Acknowledgments

   We are grateful for the input from IESG members and from a number of
   individual members of the IETF community who share our concern for
   doing the right thing.
