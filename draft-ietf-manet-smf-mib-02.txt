1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)
   [I-D.ietf-manet-smf] for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).  SMF
   provides multicast Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD) and supports
   algorithms for constructing an estimate of a MANET Minimum Connected
   Dominating Set (MCDS) for efficient multicast forwarding.  The SMF-
   MIB also reports state information, performance metrics, and
   notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state
   and performance information is useful to operators troubleshooting
   multicast forwarding problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding
   with the optional use of Connected Dominating Set (CDS)-based relay
   sets.  The CDS provides a complete connected coverage of the nodes
   comprising the MANET.  The MCDS is the smallest set of MANET nodes
   (comprising a connected cluster) which cover all the nodes in the
   cluster with their transmissions.  As the density of the MANET nodes
   increase, the fraction of nodes required in an MCDS decreases.  Using
   the MCDS as a multicast forwarding set then becomes an efficient
   multicast mechanism for MANETs.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  January 2011


   Various algorithms for the construction of estimates of the MCDS
   exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework [I-D.ietf-manet-smf]
   describes some of these.  It further defines various operational
   modes for a node which is participating in the collective creation of
   the MCDS estimates.  These modes depend upon the set of related MANET
   routing and discovery protocols and mechanisms in operation in the
   specific MANET node.

   A SMF router's MIB contains SMF process configuration parameters
   (e.g. specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g., current
   membership in the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet counters),
   and notifications.

4.1.  SMF Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the SMF node process.

   Figure 1 (reproduced from Figure 4 of [I-D.ietf-manet-smf]) shows the
   relationship between the SMF Relay Set selection algorithm and the
   related algorithms, processes and protocols running in the MANET
   nodes.  The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon
   topology information gotten from the MANET Neighborhood Discovery
   Protocol (NHDP), from the specific MANET routing protocol running on
   the node, or from Layer 2 information passed up to the higher layer
   protocol processes.

   RGC Note: update this figure from the latest SMF draft.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the SMF RS process.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the SMF RS process in the router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      CDS multicast process on the router and the overall multicasting
      performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the SMF-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  smfMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the SMF-MIB.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  January 2011


   o  smfMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the SMF-
      MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the following
      groups:

   o

      *  Capabilities Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         the device uses to advertise its local capabilities with
         respect to, e.g., the supported RSSAs.

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of the SMF RSSA and the resulting multicast performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the SMF RSSA process such as the Neighbor Table.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the SMF RSSA process, typically statistics
         counters.

   o  smfMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this SMF-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions defined within the SMF-MIB are as follows:

   o  The SmfStatus is defined within the SMF-MIB.  This contains the
      current operational status of the SMF process on an interface.

   o  The SmfOpModeID represents an index that identifies a specific SMF
      operational mode.

   o  The SmfRssaID represents an index that identifies, through
      reference, a specific RSSA available for operation on the device.

5.2.  The Capabilities Group

   The SMF device supports a set of capabilities.  The list of
   capabilities which the device can advertise are:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.  Note that
      configuration, state and performance objects related to a specific
      RSSA must be defined within another separate MIB.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  January 2011


5.3.  The Configuration Group

   The SMF device is configured with a set of controls.  Some of the
   prominent configuration controls for the SMF device follow:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv4 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv6 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  SMF Type Message TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the SMF
      Type Message TLV may be included in the NHDP exchanges.

   o  SMF Address Block TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the SMF
      Address Block TLV included in the NHDP exchanges.  (Note: is this
      correct?)

5.4.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information, e.g.,

   o  Node RSS State - is the node currently in or out of the Relay Set.

   o  Neighbors Table - a table containing current neighbors and their
      operational RSSA.

5.5.  The Performance Group

   The Performance subtree reports primarily counters that relate to SMF
   RSSA performance.  The SMF performance counters consists of per node
   and per interface objects:

   o  Total multicast packets received.

   o  Total multicast packets forwarded.

   o  Total duplicate multicast packets detected.

   o  Per interface statistics table with the following entries:

   o

      *  Multicast packets received.

      *  Multicast packets forwarded.

      *  Duplicate multicast packets detected.

5.6.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the SMF-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SMF-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The textual conventions imported for use in the SMF-MIB are as
   follows.  The MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
   Counter32, Unsigned32, Integer32 and mib-2 textual conventions are
   imported from RFC 2578 [RFC2578].  The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, RowStatus
   and TruthValue textual conventions are imported from RFC 2579
   [RFC2579].  The MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP and NOTIFICATION-
   GROUP textual conventions are imported from RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  The
   InterfaceIndexOrZero textual convention is imported from RFC 2863
   [RFC2863].  The SnmpAdminString textual convention is imported from
   RFC 3411 [RFC3411].  The InetAddress, InetAddressType and
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual conventions are imported from RFC
   4001 [RFC4001].

6.3.  Relationship to the Future RSSA-MIBs

   In a sense, the SMF-MIB is a general front-end to a set of, yet to be
   developed, RSSA-specific MIBs.  These RSSA-specific MIBs will define
   the objects for the configuration, state, performance and

   notification objects required for the operation of these specific
   RSSAs.  The SMF-MIB Capabilities Group allows the remote management
   station the ability to query the router to discover the set of
   supported RSSAs.

           "Updated draft of this MIB module published as
            draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-00.txt. A few changes
            were made in the development of this draft.
            Specifically, the following changes were made:
               - Removed the smfGatewayFilterTable from this
                 draft.  It is a useful construct, e.g.,
                 an IPTABLES-MIB, but might best be handled
                 as a seperate MIB and worked within a
                 security focused working group.
               - Removed the smfReportsGroup. This capability
                 is being replaced with a new and more general
                 method for offline reporting.  This is being
                 worked as a new MIB module refered to as the
                 REPORT-MIB.
               - Rev'd as a new MANET WG document.

            changes were made in development of this version:
               - added a Capabilities Group within the Objects
                 Group to allow the device to report supported
                 capabilities, e.g., RSSAs supported.

               - added administrative status objects for device
                 and interfaces
               - added multicast address forwarding tables, both
                 for configured (within Configuration Group) and
                 discovered (within the State Group).
               - added additional Performance counters related
                 to DPD functions.
               - Split up the performance counters into IPv4
                 and IPv6, for both global and per interface
                 statistics.
               - Split out the reports capability into a seperate

            of SMF operation with reduced relay sets:

                  set selection using information from an associated
                  MANET NHDP process.

              CDS-aware unicast routing operation - a coexistent
                  unicast routing protocol provides dynamic relay
                  set state based upon its own control plane
                  CDS or neighborhood discovery information.

              Cross-layer operation -  SMF operates using
                  neighborhood status and triggers from a
                  cross-layer information base for dynamic relay
                  set selection and maintenance

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to

   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section tracks the revision history in the development of this
   SMF-MIB.  It will be removed from the final version of this document.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-01 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-02.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                  January 2011


   1.  Added the NotificationGroup to the MIB and updated the
       ConformanceGroup.

   2.  Added the definition of an smfRouterID to the MIB.  This is later
       used in the Notifications to indicate the origin of the event to
       the management station.

   3.  Removed the Router Priority object as this was used only in the
       eCDS algorithm and hence should be contained within the future
       eCDS-MIB.

   4.  Cleaned up the TEXTUAL CONVENTION for the `SmfOpMode'.

   5.  Filled in some of the missing text in various object
       descriptions.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-00 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dsmf-mib-01.

   1.  Editorial changes to the textual material.  These included the
       addition of the paragraphs on TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS defined and
       imported into this MIB and relationships to other MIBs.

   2.  Identified those objects in the SMF-MIB requiring non-volatile
       storage.

   3.  Changed the name of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 'Status', defined
       within this MIB to 'SmfStatus'.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the SMF-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  The SMF draft states that use of the SMF Type Message TLV is
       optional and is used when the router runs NHDP.  But the draft
       does not clearly state if the use of the SMF Address Block TLV is
       also optional.

   2.  Is it useful to track the effectiveness of the coverage of the
       current RSSA?  Is it possible to track this?

   3.  Complete the security analysis and section.

   4.  Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.
