Abstract

   This document describes a new resource record for DNS.  This record
   may be used to store public keys for use in IPsec systems.

   This record replaces the functionality of the sub-type #1 of the KEY
   Resource Record, which has been proposed to be obsoleted by [1].

1. Introduction

1.1 Overview

2. Storage formats

   The IPSECKEY resource record (RR) is used to document a key that is
   associated with a Domain Name System (DNS) name.  It will be a public
   key as only public keys are stored in the DNS.  This can be the
   public key of a host, network, or application (in the case of per-
   port keying).

   An IPSECKEY RR is, like any other RR, authenticated by a SIG RR.
   Security aware DNS implementations MUST be designed to handle at
   least two simultaneously valid keys of the same type associated with
   a name.

   The type number for the IPSECKEY RR is TBD.

2.1 IPSECKEY RDATA format

   The RDATA for an IPSECKEY RR consists of a series of type/length/

   value and type/value records.  The canonical ordering of the fields
   is by increasing ordinal values of the type field.

   A type may not occur more than once.

   Each field consistsa reserved field, a field type octet, and a length
   of that field.

   (XXX - Do we really need a 16-bit length? 8-bits will not suffice for
   public keys.  Or should we for for 11 or 12 bits with a 4 or 5 bit
   field type?)

   The meaning of the IPSECKEY RR field type are described in the
   following sections.  The length field is the number of the octets in
   this field type, and includes the size of the common header.

   Definitions for field types:

   0  no more fields

   1  priority of this entry

   2  IPv4 address of the gateway for this host

   3  IPv6 address of the gateway for this host

   4  FQDN of the gateway for this host

   5  RSA public key for the gateway


2.2 priority of this entry

   This is a 16-bit preference for this record.  This is interpreted in
   a similar way to the PREFERENCE field described in section 3.3.9 of
   [3].

2.3 IPv4 address of the gateway

   The data portion is an IPv4 address as described in section 3.4.1 of
   [3].  This is a 32-bit number in network byte order.

   The presence of this value indicates the end point for an IPsec
   tunnel.  This record is mutually exclusive with types 3 and 4.

2.4 IPv6 address of the gateway

   The data portion is an IPv6 address as described in section 3.2 of
   [4].  This is a 128-bit number in network byte order.

   The presence of this value indicates the end point for an IPsec
   tunnel.  This record is mutually exclusive with types 2 and 4.

2.5 FQDN of the gateway

   The data portion is a %lt;domain-name%gt; encoded as described in
   section 3.3 of [4].

   The presence of this value indicates the end point for an IPsec
   tunnel.  This record is mutually exclusive with types 2 and 3.

2.6 RSA public of the gateway

   The data portion of the field contains an RSA public key, encoded as
   described in secion 2 of [6], and repeated here:

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | pub exp length|        public key exponent                    /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               /
      +-                           modulus                            /
      |                                                               /
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-/

   RFC2065 limited the exponent and modulus to 2552 bits in length, and
   RFC3110 to 4096 bits.  No such limit is specified here for the
   purposes of encoding and decoding.  The length in octets of the
   public exponent length is represented as one octet if it is in the
   range of 1 to 255 and by a zero octet followed by a two octet
   unsigned length if it is longer than 255 bytes.  The public key
   modulus field is a multiprecision unsigned integer.  The length of
   the modulus can be determined from the RDLENGTH and the preceding
   RDATA fields including the exponent.

   Leading zero bytes are prohibited in the exponent and modulus.

3. Presentation formats

3.1 File Representation of IPSECKEY RRs

   IPSECKEY RRs may appear as lines in a zone data master file.  The
   preference and at least one key are mandatory.

   As the IPv4, IPv6 and FQDN references to the gateway are mutually
   exclusive, they can share a position.  If no gateway is to be
   indicated, then the special tokens of either "-" or "none" may be
   used.

   Additional field types must be assigned by IANA.  A document must
