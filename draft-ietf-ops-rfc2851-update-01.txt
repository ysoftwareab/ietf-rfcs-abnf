Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent commonly
   used Internet network layer addressing information.  The intent is
   that these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB
   modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

   This document obsoletes RFC 2851.

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses         July  2001


1. Introduction

   Several standard-track MIB modules use the IpAddress SMIv2 base type.
   This limits the applicability of these MIB modules to IP Version 4
   (IPv4) since the IpAddress SMIv2 base type can only contain 4 byte
   IPv4 addresses.  The IpAddress SMIv2 base type has become problematic
   with the introduction of IP Version 6 (IPv6) addresses [19].

   This document defines multiple textual conventions as a mechanism to
   express generic Internet network layer addresses within MIB module
   specifications.  The solution is compatible with SMIv2 (STD 58) and
   SMIv1 (STD 16).  New MIB definitions which need to express network
   layer Internet addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined
   in this memo.  New MIB modules SHOULD NOT use the SMIv2 IpAddress
   base type anymore.

   A generic Internet address consists of two objects, one whose syntax
   is InetAddressType, and another whose syntax is InetAddress.  The
   value of the first object determines how the value of the second
   object is encoded.  The InetAddress textual convention represents an
   opaque Internet address value.  The InetAddressType enumeration is
   used to "cast" the InetAddress value into a concrete textual
   convention for the address type.  This usage of multiple textual
   conventions allows expression of the display characteristics of each
   address type and makes the set of defined Internet address types
   extensible.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can be used to
   define Internet addresses by using DNS domain names in addition to
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  A MIB designer can write compliance
   statements to express that only a subset of the possible address
   types must be supported by a compliant implementation.

   MIB developers who need to represent Internet addresses SHOULD use
   these definitions whenever applicable, as opposed to defining their
   own constructs.  Even MIB modules that only need to represent IPv4 or
   IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined in this
   memo.

   There are many widely deployed MIB modules that use IPv4 addresses
   and which need to be revised to support IPv6.  These MIBs can be
   categorized as follows:

   1.  MIB modules which define management information that is in
       principle IP version neutral, but the MIB currently uses
       addressing constructs specific to a certain IP version.

   2.  MIB modules which define management information that is specific

       to particular IP version (either IPv4 or IPv6) and which is very
       unlikely to be ever applicable to another IP version.

   MIB modules of the first type SHOULD provide object definitions (e.g.
   tables) that work with all versions of IP.  In particular, when
   revising a MIB module which contains IPv4 specific tables, it is
   suggested to define new tables using the textual conventions defined
   in this memo which support all versions of IP.  The status of the new
   tables SHOULD be "current" while the status of the old IP version
   specific tables SHOULD be changed to "deprecated".  The other
   approach of having multiple similar tables for different IP versions
   is strongly discouraged.

   MIB modules of the second type, which are inherently IP version
   specific, do not need to be redefined.  Note that even in this case,
   any additions to these MIB modules or new IP version specific MIB
   modules SHOULD use the textual conventions defined in this memo.

   MIB developers SHOULD NOT use the textual conventions defined in this
   document to represent generic transport layer addresses.  Instead the
   SMIv2 TAddress textual convention and associated definitions should
   be used for transport layer addresses.

   This memo introduces some ordering constraints in order to achieve
   the following two goals:

   1.  Enable programs to identify the InetAddressType object which
       discriminates a certain InetAddress object.  This allows tools
       such as MIB compilers to understand the dependencies and to
       generate code to e.g.  handle some error conditions.

   2.  Provide some rules that prevent MIB module authors from doing
       certain mistakes which can make future extensions of tables with
       new objects impossible.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses         July  2001


      16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [6], STD 58, RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC
      1906 [11].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574
      [13].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [14].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [16].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

            Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
            accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
            with that InetAddressType.

            The InetAddressType textual convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed
            in object type definitions to support future extensions. It
            MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to require
            only a subset of these address types for a compliant
            implementation.

            Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
            and any dependent objects (e.g. InetAddress objects) are
            consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
            if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
            for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In
            particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
            changed together if the address type changes (e.g. from
            ipv6(2) to ipv4(1))."

       DESCRIPTION
           "Represents an autonomous system number which identifies an
            Autonomous System (AS). An AS is a set of routers under a
            single technical administration, using an interior gateway
            protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS,
            and using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to
            other ASs'. IANA maintains the AS number space and has
            delegated large parts to the regional registries.

            Autonomous system numbers are currently limited to 16 bits
            (0..65535). There is however work in progress to enlarge the
            autonomous system number space to 32 bits. This textual
            convention therefore uses an Unsigned32 value without a
            range restriction in order to support a larger autonomous
            system number space."

4. Usage Hints

   One particular usage of InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs is to avoid
   over-constraining an object definition by the use of the IpAddress
   SMI base type.  An InetAddressType/InetAddress pair allows to
   represent IP addresses in various formats.

   The InetAddressType and InetAddress objects SHOULD NOT be sub-typed.
   Sub-typing binds the MIB module to specific address formats, which
   may cause serious problems if new address formats need to be
   introduced.  Note that it is possible to write compliance statements
   in order to express that only a subset of the defined address types
   must be implemented to be compliant.

   The InetAddressType object must be registered immediately before the
   InetAddress object(s) or InetAddressPrefixLength object(s).  In other
   words, the object identifiers for the InetAddressType object and the
   InetAddress object MUST have the same length and the last sub-
   identifier of the InetAddressType object MUST be less than the last
   sub-identifier of the InetAddress object.  This rule allows programs
   such as MIB compilers to identify the InetAddressType of a given
   InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength object by searching for the
   InetAddressType object which precedes InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength registration.

4.1 Table Indexing

   When a generic Internet address is used as an index, both the
   InetAddressType and InetAddress objects MUST be used.  The
   InetAddressType object MUST be listed immediately before the
   InetAddress object in the INDEX clause.

   The IMPLIED keyword MUST NOT be used for an object of type
   InetAddress in an INDEX clause.  Instance sub-identifiers are then of
   the form T.N.O1.O2...On, where T is the value of the InetAddressType
   object, O1...On are the octets in the InetAddress object, and N is
   the number of those octets.

   There is a meaningful lexicographical ordering to tables indexed in
   this fashion.  Command generator applications may lookup specific
   addresses of known type and value, issue GetNext requests for
   addresses of a single type, or issue GetNext requests for a specific
   type and address prefix.

4.2 Uniqueness of Addresses

   IPv4 addresses were intended to be globally unique, current usage
   notwithstanding.  IPv6 addresses were architected to have different



Daniele, et. al.        Expires December 30, 2001              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses         July  2001


   scopes and hence uniqueness [19].  In particular, IPv6 "link-local"
   and "site-local" addresses are not guaranteed to be unique on any
   particular node.  In such cases, the duplicate addresses must be
   configured on different interfaces.  So the combination of an IPv6
   address and an interface number is unique.  The interface number may
   therefore be used as a scope identifier.

   The InetAddressIPv6 textual convention has been defined to represent
   global and non-global IPv6 addresses.  MIB designers who use
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs therefore do not need define
   additional objects in order to support link-local or site-local
   addresses.

   The size of the scope identifier has been chosen so that it matches
   the sin6_scope_id field of the sockaddr_in6 structure defined in RFC
   2553 [20].

4.3 Multiple InetAddresses per Host

   A single host system may be configured with multiple addresses (IPv4
   or IPv6), and possibly with multiple DNS names.  Thus it is possible
   for a single host system to be accessible by multiple
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.

   If this could be an implementation or usage issue, then the
   DESCRIPTION clause of the relevant objects MUST fully describe
   required behavior.

4.4 Resolving DNS Names

   DNS names must be resolved to IP addresses when communication with
   the named host is required.  This raises a temporal aspect to
   defining MIB objects whose value is a DNS name: When is the name
   translated to an address?

   For example, consider an object defined to indicate a forwarding
   destination, and whose value is a DNS name.  When does the forwarding
   entity resolve the DNS name? Each time forwarding occurs or just once
   when the object was instantiated?

   The DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely define how
   and when any required name to address resolution is done.

   Similarly, the DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely
   define how and when a reverse lookup is being done if an agent has
   accessed instrumentation that knows about an IP address and the MIB
   module or implementation requires to map the IP address to a DNS
   name.

5. Table Indexing Example

   This example shows a table listing communication peers that are
   identified by either an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or a DNS name.
   The table definition also prohibits entries with an empty address
   (whose type would be "unknown").  The size of a DNS name is limited
   to 64 characters.


   peerTable OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF PeerEntry
       MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "A list of communication peers."
       ::= { somewhere 1 }

   peerEntry OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      PeerEntry
       MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "An entry containing information about a particular peer."
       INDEX       { peerAddressType, peerAddress }
       ::= { peerTable 1 }

   PeerEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
       peerAddressType     InetAddressType,
       peerAddress         InetAddress,
       peerStatus          INTEGER
   }

   peerAddressType OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      InetAddressType
       MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "The type of Internet address by which the peer
            is reachable."
       ::= { peerEntry 1 }

   peerAddress OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      InetAddress (SIZE (1..64))
       MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "The Internet address for the peer. Note that
            implementations must limit themselves to a single

            entry in this table per reachable peer.

            The peerAddress may not be empty due to the SIZE
            restriction.

            If a row is created administratively by an SNMP
            operation and the address type value is dns(16), then
            the agent stores the DNS name internally. A DNS name
            lookup must be performed on the internally stored DNS
            name whenever it is being used to contact the peer.

            If a row is created by the managed entity itself and
            the address type value is dns(16), then the agent
            stores the IP address internally. A DNS reverse lookup
            must be performed on the internally stored IP address
            whenever the value is retrieved via SNMP."
       ::= { peerEntry 2 }


   The following compliance statement specifies that implementations
   need only support IPv4 addresses and globally unique IPv6 addresses
   to be compliant.  Support for DNS names or scoped IPv6 addresses is
   not required.

   peerCompliance MODULE-COMPLIANCE
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "The compliance statement the peer MIB."

       MODULE      -- this module
       MANDATORY-GROUPS    { peerGroup }

       OBJECT  peerAddressType
       SYNTAX  InetAddressType { ipv4(1), ipv6(2) }
       DESCRIPTION
           "An implementation is only required to support IPv4
            and IPv6 addresses."

       OBJECT  peerAddress
       SYNTAX  InetAddress (SIZE(4|16))
       DESCRIPTION
           "An implementation is only required to support IPv4
            and globally unique IPv6 addresses."

       ::= { somewhere 2 }

   Note that the SMIv2 does not permit inclusion of not-accessible
   objects in an object group (see section 3.1 in STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]).

   It is therefore not possible to formally refine the syntax of
   auxiliary objects which are not-accessible.  In such a case, it is
   suggested to express the refinement informally in the DESCRIPTION
   clause of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro invocation.

6. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

9. Changes from RFC 2851

   The following changes have been made relative to RFC 2851:

   o  Added new TCs: InetAddressPrefixLength, InetPortNumber,
      InetAutonomousSystemNumber

   o  Rewrote the introduction to say clearly that in general, one
      should define MIB tables that work with all versions of IP.  The
      other approach of multiple tables for different IP versions is
      strongly discouraged.  (kzm)

   o  Added text to the InetAddressType and InetAddress descriptions
      which requires that implementations must reject set operations
      with an inconsistentValue error if they lead to inconsistencies.

   o  Relaxed the rules to make it possible to register tuples where
      multiple objects share an InetAddressType value, which is needed
      for filters of the form (InetAddressType, InetAddress,
      InetPortNumber, InetAddress InetPortNumber).

   o  Added a paragraph in the Introduction which explains the
      motivation for the ordering constraints.


10. Open Issues

   o  Check that the document is consistent with draft-ietf-ipngwg-
      scoping-arch-02.txt and add a reference to it.

   o  Addition of an InetScopeIdentifier TC? (Bill Fenner)
