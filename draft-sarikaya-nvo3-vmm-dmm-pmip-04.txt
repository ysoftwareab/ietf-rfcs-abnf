   Virtual Machine Mobility Protocol Using Distributed Registrations
                draft-sarikaya-nvo3-vmm-dmm-pmip-04.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies a new IP level protocol for seamless virtual
   machine mobility in data centers.  Source network virtualization edge
   registers the newly created virtual machine with the centrally
   available management node.  When the virtual machine moves to the
   destination network virtualization edge, the destination network
   virtualization edge updates the virtual machine record in the
   management node.  Management node sends registration message to all
   previous source network virtualization edges in order to direct the
   ongoing traffic to the destination network virtualization edge.  Hot,
   warm and and cold virtual machine mobility and intra data center and
   inter data center virtual machine mobility solutions are presented.

1.  Introduction

   Data center networks are being increasingly used by telecom operators
   as well as by enterprises.  Currently these networks are organized as
   Layer 3 switched data center networks or one large Layer 2 network
   geographically distributed in several buildings.

   Virtualization which is being used in almost all of today's data
   centers enables many virtual machines to run on a single physical
   computer or compute server.  Virtual machines (VM) need hypervisor
   running on the physical compute server to provide them shared
   processor/memory/storage.  Network connectivity is provided by the
   network virtualization edge (NVE) [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch],
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-nve-nva-cp-req].  Being able to move VMs dynamically,

   or live migration, from one server to another allows for dynamic load
   balancing or work distribution and thus it is a highly desirable
   feature [RFC7364], [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues].

   There are many challenges and requirements related to migration,
   mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual
   Network Elements (VNEs).  Retaining IP addresses after a move is a
   key requirement [RFC7364].  Such a requirement is needed in order to
   maintain existing transport connections.

   In view of many virtual machine mobility schemes that exist today,
   there is a desire to define standard control plane protocol for Layer
   3 based virtual machine mobility.  The protocol should be based on
   IPv4 or IPv6.  In this document we specify such a protocol.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC7365].  In addition
   we make the following definitions:

   Hot VM Mobility.  A given VM could be moved from one server to
   another in running state.

   Warm VM Mobility.  In case of warm VM mobility, the VM states are
   mirrored to the secondary server (or domain) at a predefined
   (configurable) regular intervals.  This reduces the overheads and
   complexity but this may also lead to a situation when both servers
   may not contain the exact same data (state information)

   Cold VM Mobility.  A given VM could be moved from one server to
   another in stopped or suspended state.

3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on data center network virtual
   machine mobility.

   Data center network MUST support virtual machine mobility in IPv6.

   IPv4 SHOULD also be supported in virtual machine mobility.

Internet-Draft        VM Mobility Solution Protocol         October 2014


   Tunneling MAY be used between VMs in the same or different data
   centers.  Tunneling MUST NOT be used between a VM located in a data
   center and a host in some other site.

   Host routes MAY be used between VMs in different data centers and
   between a VM located in a data center and a host in some other site
   [I-D.shima-clouds-net-portability-reqs-and-models].

   Triangular routing MAY be be used between VMs in different data
   centers.  The use of triangular routing SHOULD be minimized between a
   VM located in a data center and a host in some other site.

4.  Architecture

   Datacenter is Layer-2 based if packets are switched inside a rack and
   bridged among the racks, i.e. completely in Layer-2.  From IP point
   of view the nodes are connected to a single link.  Layer-2 based
   networks make it easy to move Virtual Machines from one server to
   another but on the other hand they don't scale well for address
   resolution protocols like ARP [RFC6820].

   In this document we assume L3-based datacenter network and design
   live virtual machine migration protocol.  The design makes minimum
   use of Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol as in [RFC5213].

4.1.  VM Mobility Protocol Architecture

   Virtual Machines connect to the network using a virtual interface
   supported by the NVE.  In this document, the NVE is the source NVE
   after VM moves to another NVE called destination NVE (see Figure 1).

   Top of Rack Switch (ToR) is a switch used to connect the servers in a
   data center to the data center network.  Border Router (BR) is the
   data center border router that provides connectivity between VMs and
   hosts communicating with the VMs.  The data center has an associated
   storage center.  The storage center is connected to the data center
   using fast means such as fiber channel (fc).

   When VM is created it registers with the data center management
   system called Virtual Machine (VM) Manager.  The management system
   keeps a record of all VMs and their most recent addresses.  VM
   Manager manages all intra- and inter-data center VM mobility.

   After VM is created it starts to serve its users.  During this
   process, VM may be moved anytime.  VM moves from the source NVE to
   the destination NVE.  Because of the requirement, even if the VM
   moves to a different subnet its IP address(es) do not change.  In

   Figure 1, if a VM moves from NVE A to NVE B, NVE A is the source and
   NVE B is the destination NVE.

5.  VM Mobility Protocol Operation

   When a virtual machine is created, source Network Virtualization Edge
   sends a VM mobility registration message called VM Mobility
   Registration Request or registration request in short to the
   management node.  The message is as UDP message.  Message data
   contains various options which are structured in Type Length Value
   (TLV) format.

   VM Mobility Registration request message contains MAC address of the
   VM, Virtual Machine Identifier option containing VM-ID, Virtual
   Machine Address option containing VM address.  More than one Virtual
   Machine Address option can be included, possibly one for each
   interface of VM.  Source address of VM Mobility Registration Request
   packet is used as the new address to which packets need to be sent.
   Source NVE keeps all these values for each VM in a data structure
   called Binding Update List [RFC5213], one entry for each VM.

   The management node records the virtual machine information in a
   binding cache entry for this virtual machine including the source
   address.  The management node sends a VM Mobility Registration Reply
   message to the NVE.  The message is structured in UDP.  VM
   Registration Reply message MUST contain a status field which should
   be set to accepted or rejected.

   Virtual machine moves from its source NVE to a new, destination NVE.
   The move could be initiated by the VM Manager.  The virtual machine
   IP address(es) do not change.  However, the address of the serving
   NVE changes.  Because of this, registration message exchange MUST be
   conducted after the move.  The destination NVE MUST send a VM
   Mobility Registration Request message to the management node.

   The management node receives VM Mobility Registration Request message
   and searches the binding cache for a matching entry.  Once the match
   is found, the entry is modified to point to the new IP address of the
   serving NVE.  Previous NVE addresses are kept in the entry.  The
   management node sends a reply (VM Mobility Registration Reply
   message) to the destination NVE to indicate the acceptance of the
   registration.

   Source NVE or previous source NVEs need to be informed of the new IP
   address(es) of the serving NVE.  For this purpose, the management
   node sends VM Mobility Registration Request message to the source
   NVEs.  NVE verifies that this message is coming from the management
   node otherwise rejects any such message.

   Source NVE sends VM Mobility Registration Reply back to the
   management node.  Source NVE creates a host route pointing the old

   serving NVE address to the new serving NVE address.  The old serving
   NVE address is obtained from the Binding Update List entry matching
   this VM and the new serving NVE address from the VM Mobility
   Registration Request message received from the management node.

   Tunneling in the data plane MAY be supported instead of establishing
   source routes in the control plane.  In this case, the source NVE
   initiates a tunnel interface to the destination NVE.  Source NVE
   encapsulates all packets for this virtual machine (IPv4-in-IPv4 or
   IPv6-in-IPv6) and sends them to the tunnel interface.

   Virtual Machine Mobility Registration Request message contains a
   Lifetime field, a 16-bit unsigned integer.  Lifetime field contains
   the lifetime of the registration in the number of time units (each 4
   seconds).  Source NVE sends its suggested value and the management
   node sends the final value of the lifetime which is equal or less
   than the suggested value.  In order to extend a binding that is
   expiring, the Hypervisor sends periodic reregistration messages (VM
   Mobility Registration Requests).

   All source NVEs keep one entry in their Binding Update List for each
   virtual machine that was in communication before it was moved, i.e.
   VMs in hot VM mobility.  Binding Update List is used to create the
   host routes or for tunneling.

   In the data plane, if host routes are established, source NVE sends
   all packets from ongoing connections of the virtual machine to the
   destination NVE using the host route.  Destination NVE receives the
   packet and sends it to the VM.  This delivery mechanism does not
   avoid triangular routing but it avoids tunneling.  Route
   optimization, i.e. avoiding triangular routing is explained in
   Section 7.

   At the source NVE, virtual machine entries are kept in the binding
   update list until all inbound traffic to the virtual machine stops.
   A timer may be used for this purpose.  When the timer times out, the
   entry is deleted.

   The virtual machine after the move sends IPv4 gratuitous Address
   Resolution Protocol or IPv6 unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement
   message upstream.  This update serves to update ARP or neighbor
   caches of the VMs in the same link so that all traffic from new
   connections are directed to the new location of the virtual machine
   with no tunneling or triangular routing.

6.  Moving Local State of VM

   After VM mobility related signaling (VM Mobility Registration
   Request/Reply), the virtual machine state needs to be transferred to
   the destination Hypervisor.  The state includes its memory and file
   system.  Source Hypervisor opens a TCP connection with destination
   Hypervisor over which VM's memory state is transferred.

   File system or local storage is more complicated to transfer.  The
   transfer should ensure consistency, i.e. the VM at the destination
   should find the same file system it had at the source.  Precopying is
   commonly used technique for transferring the file system.  First the
   whole disk image is transferred while VM continues to run.  After the
   VM is moved any changes in the file system are packaged together and
   sent to the destination Hypervisor which reflects these changes to
   the file system locally at the destination.

7.  Handling of Hot, Warm and Cold Virtual Machine Mobility

   Cold Virtual Machine mobility is facilitated by the VM initially
   sending an ARP or Neighbor Discovery message which enables the
   correspondents to direct their communication to the destination NVE
   in the link.  A registration message needs to be sent to the source
   NVE because the messages from all other correspondents will be routed
   to the source NVE.  Previous source NVEs in the chain (if any) need
   not be informed of the move.  Cold VM mobility also allows all
   previous source NVEs to delete binding update list entries of the VM.

   The VMs that are used for cold standby receive scheduled backup
   information but less frequently than that would be for warm standby
   option.  Therefore, the cold mobility option can be used for non-
   critical applications and services.

   In cases of warm standby option, the backup VMs receive backup
   information at regular intervals.  The duration of the interval
   determines the warmth of the standby option.  The larger the
   duration, the less warm (and hence cold) the standby option becomes.

   In case of hot standby option, the VMs in both primary and secondary
   domains have identical information and can provide services
   simultaneously as in load-share mode of operation.  If the VMs in the
   primary domain fails, there is no need to actively move the VMs to
   the secondary domain because the VMs in the secondary domain already
   contains identical information.  The hot standby option is the most
   costly mechanism for providing redundancy, and hence this option is
   utilized only for mission-critical applications and services.

7.1.  Route Optimization

   When VM in motion has ongoing communications with outside hosts, the
   packets will continue to be received at the source NVEs.  Source NVEs
   create host routes or tunnels based on the binding cache entries they
   have for the VM.  Source route enables them to route ongoing
   communications to the destination NVE.  If the VM moved to a
   different data center then the packets are routed to the new data
   center.

   Host routes avoid tunneling.  However host routes do not avoid
   triangular routing.  Route optimization is needed to avoid triangular
   routing.  In mobility protocols route optimization is achieved by
   establishing a direct route between all communicating hosts, a.k.a.
   correspondent nodes and the destination virtual machine.  Such a
   solution requires host modifications and not scalable in virtual
   machine mobility.

   Optimal IP routing of the incoming traffic is divided into two
   components: intra data center traffic and inter data center traffic.

7.2.  Intra Data Center Hot Virtual Machine Mobility

   Optimal IP routing of the incoming intra data center traffic is
   achieved as follows: Management node after sending VM Mobility
   Registration Request message to the source NVEs in Section 5, it also
   exchanges VM Mobility Registration Request/Reply messages with the
   default router of the source NVE.  Default router is usually the Top
   of Rack switch or the default router could be a different node
   depending on the configuration of the data center.

   The default router interprets (source NVE, destination NVE) values in
   pairs as host routes for virtual machines.  The default router
   establishes these host routes and uses them to redirect traffic from
   any correspondent nodes or from VMs in the servers.

   The default routers MUST allow configuration of the host route
   generated by our VM Mobility Registration protocol.  VM is not moved
   until Interior gateway protocol (IGP), e.g.  OSPF or IS-IS to
   announce the route by the default router of the destination NVE.  The
   VMs can wait to move until the host route is set-up.  The VM Mobility
   Registration protocol is basically used to inform both routers that
   this process is going on.

   Optimal IP routing of the incoming inter data center traffic can be
   achieved by propagating the host routes using inter-domain routing
   protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271].  If the
   host routes are propagated within a Data Center using IGPs, the
   normal redistribution mechanism can by policy redistribute the host
   routes at the Border Router.  A BGP Community can be tagged to the
   host routes to make it easier to process.

   Border router (BR) MAY send BGP UPDATE message to its BGP peers.
   Source NVEs receiving incoming traffic for a VM that has moved first
   try to reroute the traffic using host routes.  Next action should be
   to inform the border router to initiate a BGP update message.  Source
   NVE may inform each host route that it has in its binding update list
   for the VM to the BR.

   Border router generates an UPDATE message using the information it
   received from the source NVEs.  UPDATE message contains one or more
   ORIGIN path attributes which is set to IGP.  The address prefix
   values in IPv4 or IPv6 of the VM when it was at the source NVE and
   the destination prefix are contained in Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRI) field of the UPDATE message.

   UPDATE messages with host routes should be exchanged among a
   particular set of data centers, possibly the data centers belonging
   to the same operator.  This constrained propagation can be achived by
   policy enforcement.

8.  Virtual Machine Operation

   Virtual machines are not involved in any mobility signalling.  Once
   VM moves to the destination hypervisor, VM should be able to continue
   to receive packets to its previous address(es).  This happens in hot
   VM mobility scenarios.

   Virtual machine sends a gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol or
   unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement message upstream after each move.

8.1.  Virtual Machine Lifecycle Management

   Managing the lifecycle of VM includes creating a VM with all of the
   required resources, and managing them seamlessly as the VM migrates
   from one service to another during its lifetime.  The on-boarding
   process includes the following steps:

   1.  Sending an allowed (authorized/authenticated) request to
       Management/Orchestration module in an acceptable format with

       mandatory/optional virtualized resources {cpu, memory, storage,
       process/thread support, etc.} and interface information

   2.  Receiving an acknowledgement from the Management/Orchestration
       module regarding availability and usability of virtualized
       resources and interface package

   3.  Sending a confirmation message to the Management/Orchestration
       module with request for approval to adapt/adjust/modify the
       virtualized resources and interface package for utilization in a
       service

9.  Handling IPv4/IPv6 Virtual Machine Mobility and NAT Issues

   Virtual machine registration protocol uses UDP request and reply
   messages.  In case of IPv4, the fields include IPv4 addresses.  In
   case of IPv6, the fields include IPv6 prefixes.

   In case of IPv4, Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) may be
   in use.  In this document we assume that in the case of intra DC VM
   mobility, NAPT operation happens in some upstream node such as the
   border router and thus does not affect the virtual machine
   registration protocol operation.  This enables intra-data center VM
   mobility of privately addressed VMs.

   In case of inter DC VM mobility, NAPT operation has to be considered.
   Private IPv4 addresses in the VM Mobility Registration messages have
   to be converted into public IPv4 addresses at the NAPT box before
   sending out to the destination data center.  For incoming packets,
   the NAPT box has to convert public addresses into their corresponding
   private addresses before sending the registration packet downstream.
