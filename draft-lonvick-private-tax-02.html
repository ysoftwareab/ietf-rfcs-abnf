  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Simply put, communications protocols are standardized ways for computing entities to convey information.  Within each communications protocol, there must be standardized pieces of information that will be communicated, and there may be non-standardized information that can be communicated.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The <a href="#RFC0868">Time Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0868]</cite> is an example of a protocol that only conveys standardized information.  There is no way to add anything other than what is specified in the document.  On the other hand, <a href="#RFC0761">DoD standard Transmission Control Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0761]</cite> does have "options" but they must be registered through the IANA <a href="#IANAtcp">[IANAtcp]</a>, which does not leave any room for optional information supplied by equipment vendors, network operators, or experimenters.  Finally, <a href="#RFC3925">Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3925]</cite> does allow for vendor specific options.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">If a network operator wanted to add specific information to the <a href="#RFC0868">Time Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0868]</cite>, they could modify the code of the senders and receivers and run this within their own domain without any problems.  However, if an equipment vendor wanted to include information specific to their equipment, they would have to ensure that all senders and receivers within all network domains would either accept the change in the protocol, or would not have problems with it.  As a final case, if several equipment vendors desired to add equipment-specific information to this protocol, they would have to take great care that only their own receivers would accept information from their own transmitters.  An extension to that would be that if one equipment vendor would like to transmit or receive the same information that another vendor is using.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">For the case of TCP <a href="#RFC0761">[RFC0761]</a>, standard options are expected; senders may use them and receivers may be configured to act upon that information, or to ignore it.  If an experimenter wants to add an option, they will have to create a new IETF RFC with the details, or obtain approval from the IESG to have the IANA add to the registry <a href="#IANAtcp">[IANAtcp]</a>.  Similarly, if equipment vendors Foo and Bar were to have a need for a similar option within TCP, they would each have to go through the process to add to the registry.  On the other hand, if a properly crafted multipurpose, private use option were to be registered, such as in the case of multiple vendor instances within <a href="#RFC3925">DHCPv4</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3925]</cite> then vendors and experimenters would each be able to use it for their own purposes as long as all network participants could easily differentiate between the entities using the option.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document explores the various ways that protocols may allow optional information using fields designated as "private use" to be included in protocols, without disrupting the desired harmony of the network.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#history" id="history">Origins of the Private Use Name Space</a>
</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC2432">Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2432]</cite> describes that values of specific name spaces may either be registered with the IANA, or not.  In most cases, there are well defined values for name spaces.  However, as the document explains, not all name spaces require centralized administration.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">In that document, it seems to be assumed that private use name spaces will be domain specific and it will be up to the administrators of any domain to avoid conflicts.  The first example given about private use name spaces refers to <a href="#RFC2131">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2131]</cite> and presumably <a href="#RFC2132">DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2132]</cite>.  In this the example states that "site-specific options in DHCP have significance only within a single site".  As noted below this became a problem that was rectified in a later revision of DHCP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Later works identified a need to place a scope on private use name spaces.  The second example of private use name spaces in <a href="#RFC2432">[RFC2432]</a> is from <a href="#RFC0822">STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT OF ARPA INTERNET TEXT MESSAGES</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0822]</cite> which describes X- headers.  Again, there is no effort made to control the name space.  It appears however that the users of X- headers have self-organized; most consistently use features that are universally useful and many have incorporated identifiers for useful features that may overlap.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#words" id="words">Nomenclature</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">In this document, the following words are defined to prevent ambiguity.  Some of these words have not been used in the referenced works but their meanings can be ascertained.  </p>

<ul>
<li>communications protocol - a formal description of digital message formats and the rules for exchanging those messages in or between computing systems and in telecommunications <a href="#wpProt">[wpProt]</a> </li>
<li>protocol frame - a defined container of fields used to convey information in a communications protocol </li>
<li>field - any defined container within a communications protocol frame </li>
<li>standard option - a field in a protocol frame that may only use values that are strictly defined within a specification </li>
<li>private use option - a field in a protocol frame that is reserved for private or local use only name spaces </li>
<li>name space - the set of possible values a field may contain; its actual content may be a name, a number or another kind of value </li>

It has well defined fields and standard options.  <a href="#RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5424]</cite> is another example of a communications protocol.  It has well defined fields, standard options, and it also has private use options.  </li>
<li>protocol frame - An Internet Protocol packet <a href="#RFC0791">[RFC0791]</a> is considered to be a protocol frame.  In the case of <a href="#RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0959]</cite>, an FTP message from the client to the server within the <a href="#RFC0791">Internet Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0791]</cite> containing an FTP command is a protocol frame.  In the case of <a href="#RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5424]</cite>, a message from the client to the server within the <a href="#RFC0791">Internet Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0791]</cite> containing a syslog message is also a protocol frame.  </li>
<li>field - In the case of <a href="#RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0959]</cite>, a command will be contained within a field.  In the case of <a href="#RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5424]</cite>, the HOSTNAME is a field.  </li>
<li>standard option - In the case of <a href="#RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0959]</cite>, an FTP command, such as CDUP and QUIT, is a standard option.  The reason that a command is a standard option is that only the values listed by the IANA in the registry <a href="#IANAftp">[IANAftp]</a> may be used.  The standard options are not limited to the values defined in the original RFC, but also include any additions to the registry.  In the case of <a href="#RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5424]</cite>, an SD-ID may be a standard option.  The example given in Section 7.1.4 of <a href="#RFC5424">[RFC5424]</a> of <a href="#IANAslg">[IANAslg]</a>.  </li>
<li>private use option - In the case of The Syslog Protocol, an SD-ID may be a private use option.  Example 3 given in Section 6.5 contains a private use option.  <a href="#IANAslg">[IANAslg]</a>.  It is a way for an equipment vendor to insert their specific information without having to register anything.  In this case if the receiver knows the format of that SD-ID then it can immediately interpret its meaning.  However, if it does not know how to interpret that SD-ID, it can still log the message and an Operator or Administrator can look up its meaning at a later time.  </li>
<li>name space - In the same Example 3 from Section 6.5 of <a href="#RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5424]</cite>, "exampleSDID@32473" provides the name space so the context of the rest of the SD-ID may be interpreted.  Specifically the Private Enterprise Number <a href="#IANApen">[IANApen]</a> (PEN) is used to associate the option with a private enterprise, and the text before the "@" identifies the option defined within that private enterprise.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">SMI is a well described tree of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.  It has an origin and a path for defined object identifiers which this document describes as standard options.

<p><a href="#RFC2058">The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2058]</cite> specification documented how to use just the PEN (without the rest of the SMI path to the root) to allow "vendors" to articulate their own options.  In that document, these are called Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSA).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.2">The updated RADIUS document, <a href="#RFC2865">[RFC2865]</a>, gives guidance for using the VSA.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Servers not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).  </li>
<li>Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific information SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may do so (and report they are doing so) in a degraded mode.  </li>
<li>The Attribute-Specific field is dependent on the vendor's definition of that attribute.  </li>
<li>It SHOULD be encoded as a sequence of vendor type / vendor length / value fields.  </li>
<li>Multiple subattributes MAY be encoded within a single Vendor-Specific Attribute, although they do not have to be.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.3">There are many attributes defined in RADIUS <a href="#RFC2058">[RFC2058]</a> which may be considered to be standard variables.  Each of these attributes are specified within a "type length value" (tlv) container.  For this protocol, the VSA "type" is a specific numerical value which separates it from other attributes.  Type 26 (decimal) denotes a VSA, and the PEN starts the "value" which should then include a subsequent nested tlv so the vendor may enumerate their own options within the field.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">In that specification, two tlv's have been defined to contain private use options.  These are called Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions (VSE).  <a href="#RFC2002">[RFC2002]</a> which states: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.1">The introduction to <a href="#RFC3925">Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3925]</cite> states:</p>

<ul class="empty"><li>The DHCP protocol for IPv4, <a href="#RFC2131">[RFC2131]</a>, defines options that allow a client to indicate its vendor type (option 60), and the DHCP client and server to exchange vendor-specific information (option 43) <a href="#RFC2132">[RFC2132]</a>.  Although there is no prohibition against passing multiple copies of these options in a single packet, doing so would introduce ambiguity of interpretation, particularly if conveying vendor-specific information for multiple vendors.  </li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.2">This meant that <a href="#RFC2131">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2131]</cite> specified that there was one instance of the vendor type, and the receiver used that name space to set the scope for the fields in the vendor-specific information option.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.3">This situation was resolved with the publication of <a href="#RFC3925">Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3925]</cite> which states:</p>

<p><a href="#RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5424]</cite> also uses the PEN to uniquely qualify the name space for a private use option.  Standard options do not contain the "@" character.  Private use options must have the PEN following the "@" character.  This allows a vendor or experimenter to have overlapping name spaces which the PEN will then uniquely identify.  For example a standard option is tzKnown which may only have associated values of "0" and "1".  However tzKnown@32473 may have any value assigned to it by the owner of enterprise number 32473.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.4.p.2">Syslog transport receivers are supposed to accept all correctly formatted Syslog messages.  Unlike RADIUS, the receiving Syslog application does not have to have immediate knowledge of all variable options to continue operations.

<p><a href="#RFC4251">The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4251]</cite> uses character strings rather than PENs.  Similar to Syslog, but actually predating it, standard options must not have the "@" character in them.  Private use options will have an origin identifier preceding an "@" character followed by a name space field.  For example, in <a href="#RFC4254">The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4254]</cite> SSH channels may be opened by specifying a channel type when sending the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN message.  Standard options for the channel type include "session" and "x11".  A private use option for a channel type could be "example_session@example.com".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">Obviously, these character strings are domain names <a href="#RFC1034">[RFC1034]</a> <a href="#RFC1035">[RFC1035]</a>.  This is specified in <a href="#RFC4251">The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4251]</cite>.

<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#means" id="means">Characteristics of Useful Private Use Options</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This section summarizes the observed characteristics of private use options that are successful and deployed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">There seem to be three characteristics of successful private use options.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> <a href="#means1" id="means1">Source of Authority</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">A private use option requires a path to an origin that has the authority to create and maintain the option.  As shown above, this referent should be unique, and not be dependent upon local interpretation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">The <a href="#pen">PEN</a> <cite title="NONE">[pen]</cite> is sourced by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  While there seems to be no reports of problems using PENs, PENs do not seem to be unique.  It appears that some private enterprises have registered multiple PENs, and that there are some private enterprises whose PENs are no longer serviceable, mostly because they have been acquired by other companies, or they have gone out of business.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">Domain names have similar problems as they can be more ephemeral than eternal.  The top level domains are maintained by the <a href="#ICANN">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> <cite title="NONE">[ICANN]</cite> however the specific names are assigned much more locally.  Unlike PENs that become unserviceable when their owning organization goes out of business, domain names that fall into disuse may be acquired and used by entirely different organizations.  Again however, like the use of PENs there have not been any problems reported from this.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#means2" id="means2">Focus of the Name Space</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">Once the source of authority is established, an actual option, or multiple options, must be specified.  This is usually an indicator of what value is expected.  Within the domain established by the source of authority, the focus of each value must be unique.  In a very simple example, a private use option may consist of "PEN"@"focus"="value".  The PEN will be unique and will specify the source of authority.  The focus will be unique as long as the source of authority maintains that uniqueness; e.g., it would be poor form for a private enterprise to define a focus, then to redefine it at a later time.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">In some cases, multiple focuses and values need to be transmitted.  When the PEN has been used, this has most often been achieved by nesting tlv's within the field.  Each type is then a focus for the private use option.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">Within the protocol, an understanding needs to be established between the transmitter and receiver about what to do if the receiver does not understand a focus.  Some protocols have defined that a receiver will silently discard packets that contain private use options they do not understand.  Other protocols have defined that they will only discard the private use option rather than the entire packet.  While other protocols have no need for the receiver to have any understanding of any private use options.  If this understanding is not established in the protocol then some means needs to be enabled so that the endpoints of the protocol can discuss this and form a resolution to one of them not understanding a private use option.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> <a href="#means3" id="means3">Value of the Option</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">The value of each private use option must be extensible but bounded.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">Generally speaking, values of private use options should follow the same guidance given for standard options.  </p>

However, the namespace resolves to the <a href="#pen">PEN</a> <cite title="NONE">[pen]</cite> which does not seem to be globally unique.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">After the vendor identifier (the PEN) in the management information base (MIB), a vendor can create many different trees to identify objects.  This may result in a very large number of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs; each of which is an identifier of the name space described in this document.  Each of these are uniquely identified by the vendor and do not require registration with any coordinating authority.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">The last item in each OBJECT IDENTIFIER is the value corresponding to the focus.  In a GetRequest the server fills this field with a "0" and the client responds by replacing the "0" with the actual value.  In a SetRequest transmitted to the receiver, this is the last field.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.4">In this, each OBJECT IDENTIFIER contains a globally unique origin which is ISO, a focus which is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER down to the last field, and a value which is the last field in the SetRequest, and the last field in the response to a GetRequest.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#radius-chars" id="radius-chars">RADIUS</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">As noted above, the globally unique origin for <a href="#RFC2865">RADIUS</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2865]</cite> is the PEN.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">The remainder of the Attribute field after the PEN is deliberately undefined in the specification.  It is however suggested that the field contain embedded tlv's.  This is again very practical and practicable.  Each vendor may then have conflicting "types" (e.g. "1") which would be disambiguated by the origin.  For example {PEN="N", type="1"} is different from {PEN="M", type="1"}.  Since there is nothing to prevent vendors from registering multiple PENs, each vendor may have a plethora of {type="1"}.  However, that is actually not needed since the focus may be extended by enumerating multiple types.  For example, the vendor attribute may contain {PEN="M", type="1"(value), type="2"(value), type="3"(value)}.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.3">The values for each type are bounded by the length of the attribute.  Since the entire vendor attribute is defined by the vendor, the values may be human readable or binary.  Since the protocol tends to be machine-to-machine, it is likely that the values will be binary.  It is feasible that the value have no length.  In that case, the transmission of the type alone, would be a signal of some sort to the receiver.  </p>

The PEN is the origin and types and values may be stacked within the field following that.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">It should be noted that this does not have to be the case.  Specifying CVSEs and NVSEs in various packets can give a vendor another dimension in processing these private use fields.  If a vendor placed all CVSEs in a single packet, and the receiver did not understand any one of them, the entire packet must be discarded.  However, if the vendor places individual CVSEs in separate packets, only CVSEs that are not understood by the receiver will be discarded.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Private use options are useful to the community and are gaining popularity.  This is a way to allow vendors, network operators, and experimenters to convey dynamic information without going through a rigorous process to register each variable.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">There is no "one size fits all" mechanism.  The use of a very specific and fixed format works very well for RADIUS which requires speed in processing.  On the other hand, the open nature of the private use options in Syslog are appropriate for that protocol.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">There seem to be four essential features to using a private use option.  (The author would be grateful if the community were to validate these and/or offer more or less.) </p>

<ul>
<li>One requirement is to have a definable way for the community to ascertain the nature of all private use options.  For example, several vendors have published their RADIUS VSAs on web pages which are easy to find.  From that, anyone creating a new RADIUS server would have access to and would be able to incorporate the information available.  </li>
<li>Instructions are needed on how to deal with private use options that are not understood by a receiver.  In some cases, a receiver may not need to understand the options immediately upon receipt as in the case of Syslog.  In other cases, the options are immediately used and instructions must be clear on what to do if the receiver cannot process them.  It appears that Mobile IP has the best thought-through instructions on this.  </li>
<li>Private use options must be extensible in a clearly designed way.  RADIUS suggests that the string containing the option be another tlv.  This allows a vendor to define multiple private use options within their own namespace field.  These are becoming known as subattributes.  This appears to be working in practice and it may be assumed that this has become a de facto rule for RADIUS.  </li>
<li>In most cases, a subattribute will only be named once within the context of an exchange.  RADIUS and DHCP either state or strongly imply this.  However, while it is not explicitly discussed, there is nothing to prevent this within Syslog.  Some guidance should be given about this in describing private use options in protocols.  </li>
