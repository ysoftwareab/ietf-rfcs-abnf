                Segment Routing for Enhanced VPN Service
                draft-dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn-02

Abstract

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN technology to enable it
   to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications
   that are associated with 5G services.  These applications require
   better isolation from both control and data plane's perspective and
   have more stringent performance requirements than can be provided
   with overlay VPNs.  The characteristics of an enhanced VPN as
   perceived by its tenant needs to be comparable to those of a
   dedicated private network.  This requires tight integration between
   the overlay VPN and the underlay network resources in a scalable
   manner.  An enhanced VPN may form the underpinning of 5G network
   slicing, but will also be of use in its own right.  This document
   describes the use of segment routing based mechanisms to provide the
   enhanced VPN service with dedicated network resources.  The proposed
   mechanism is applicable to both SR with MPLS data plane and SR with
   IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

1.  Introduction

   Driven largely by needs arising from the 5G mobile network design,
   the concept of network slicing has gained traction [NGMN-NS-Concept]
   [TS23501][TS28530] [BBF-SD406].  Network slicing requires the
   transport network to support partitioning the network resources to
   provide the client with dedicated (private) networking, computing,

   and storage resources drawn from a shared pool.  The slices may be
   seen as (and operated as) virtual networks.

   Thus there is a need to create virtual networks with enhanced
   characteristics.  The tenant of such a virtual network can require a
   degree of isolation and performance that previously could only be
   satisfied by dedicated networks.  Additionally the tenant may ask for
   some level of control to their virtual network e.g. to customize the
   service paths in the network slice.

   The enhanced VPN service (VPN+) as described in
   [I-D.dong-teas-enhanced-vpn] is targeted at new applications which
   require better isolation from both control plane and data plane's
   perspective and have more stringent performance requirements than can
   be provided with existing overlay VPNs.  An enhanced VPN may form the
   underpinning of network slicing, but will also be of use in its own
   right.

   Although each VPN can be associated with a set of dedicated RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209] LSPs with bandwidth reservation to provide some guarantee
   to service performance, such mechanisms would introduce per-VPN per-
   path states into the network, which is known to have scalability
   issues [RFC5439] and has not been widely adopted in production
   networks.

   Segment Routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] specifies a
   mechanism to steer packets through an ordered list of segments.  It
   can achieve explicit source routing without introducing per-path
   state into the network.  Like RSVP-TE, SR also supports source
   specification of the packet path.  However, currently SR does not
   have the capability of reserving or identifying different network
   resources for different services or customers.  Although the
   controller can have global view of network state and can provision
   different services onto different SR paths, in the data plane it
   still relies on traditional DiffServ QoS model to provide coarse-
   grained traffic differentiation in the network.  While this may be
   sufficient for some traditional services, it cannot meet the
   requirement of the enhanced VPN service.

   This document extends the SR paradigm by allocating different Segment
   Identifiers (SIDs) to represent the different subset of resources
   allocated on each network elements (links or nodes).  The SIDs
   associated with particular network resources can be used to construct
   customized virtual networks for different services, the SID can also
   be used to steer the service traffic to be processed with the
   corresponding allocated resources.  This mechanism can be used to
   provide the enhanced VPN service with dedicated network resources.

   The proposed mechanism is applicable to both SR with MPLS data plane
   and SR with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC8174 [RFC8174][when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Segment Routing with Resource Awareness

   In segment routing, several types of segments are defined to
   represent either topological elements or service instructions.  A
   topological segment may be a node segment or an adjacency segment.
   Some other types of segments may be associated with specific service
   functions for service chaining purpose.  However, so far non of the
   SR segments are associated with network resources for the QoS
   purpose.

   In order to support the enhanced VPNs which require guaranteed
   performance and isolation from other services in the network, the
   overlay VPN needs to been integrated with underlay networks.  Some
   dedicated network resources need to be allocated for enhanced VPN.
   When segment routing is used to build enhanced VPNs, it is necessary
   to associate the segments with network resources.

   By extending the segment routing paradigm, different set of network
   resources are allocated by network elements, and associated with
   dedicated SIDs.  On one particular link, multiple adjacency segment
   identifiers (Adj-SIDs) can be allocated, each of which is associated
   with a subset of the link resource allocated, such as bandwidth,
   queues, etc.  For one particular node, multiple node-SIDs can be
   allocated, each of which may be associated with a subset of resource
   allocated from the node, such as the processing resources.  Per-
   segment resource allocation complies to the SR paradigm, which avoids
   introducing per-path state into the network.

   Different groups of SIDs associated with network resources can be
   used to build virtual networks for different enhanced VPNs, this
   provides the required isolation between enhanced VPNs.  The adj-SIDs
   are used to steer traffic of different enhanced VPNs into different
   set of link resources.  The node SIDs can be used to steer traffic of
   different enhanced VPNs into different node resources.  The node SIDs
   can also be used to build loose SR paths for different enhanced VPNs.
   In this case, the node-SIDs are used by transit nodes to steer
   traffic into the local link resources allocated for the corresponding

   enhanced VPN.  Note in this case Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP)
   [RFC3031] MUST be disabled, as the node-SID is used to identify the
   SR virtual network and the corresponding network resources allocated
   to the enhanced VPN.

4.  Control Plane

   The architecture described in this document makes use of a
   centralized controller that collects the information about the
   network (configuration, state, routing databases, etc.) as well as
   the service information (traffic matrix, performance statistics,
   etc).  The controller is also responsible for the centralized
   computation and optimization of the virtual network used for enhanced
   VPN.  A distributed control plane is needed for the collection and
   distribution of the network topology and state information.
   Distributed routing computation for some services in the enhanced
   VPNs is also possible.

5.  Procedures

   This section describes the procedures of provisioning an enhanced VPN
   service based on segment routing with resource awareness.

   According to the requirement of an enhanced VPN service, a
   centralized network controller calculates a subset of the underlay
   network topology to support this enhanced VPN.  Within this topology,
   the network resources needed on each network element can also be
   determined.  The network resources are allocated in a per-segment
   manner, and are associated with different node-SIDs and adj-SIDs.
   The group of the node-SIDs and adj-SIDs allocated for the enhanced
   VPN will be used by network nodes and the network controller to build
   a SR virtual topology, which is used as the logical underlay of the
   enhanced VPN service.  The extensions to IGP protocol to distribute
   the SIDs and the associated resources allocated for a virtual network
   topology is specified in [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn].

   Suppose that customer requests for an enhanced VPN service from the
   network operator.  The fundamental requirement is that customer A's
   service does not experience interference from other services in the
   network, such as other customers' VPN services, or the non-VPN
   services in the network.  The detailed requirements can be described
   with characteristics such as the following:

   o  Service topology: the service sites and the connectivity between
      them

   o  Service bandwidth: the bandwidth requirement between service sites

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                  October 2018


   o  Isolation: the level of isolation from other services in the
      network

   o  Reliability: whether fast repair or end-to-end protection is
      needed or not.

   o  Latency

   o  Jitter

   o  Visibility: the customer may want to have some form of visibility
      of the network deliversing the service.

5.1.  Topology and Resource Computation

   As described in section 4, a centralized network controller is
   responsible for the provisioning of enhanced VPNs.  The controller
   needs to determine the information of network connectivity, network
   resources, network performance and other relevant network state of
   the underlay network.  This is often done using either IGP [RFC5305]
   [RFC3630] [RFC7471] [RFC7810] or BGP-LS [RFC7752]
   [I-D.ietf-idr-te-pm-bgp].

   Based on the network information collected from the underlay network,
   the controller computes the underlay topology (possibly using
   multiple algorithms) and knows the resources that are available and
   allocated.  When a request is received from a tenant, the controller
   computes the subgraph of the underlay network, along with the
   resources to be allocated on each network element (e.g. links and
   nodes) in the topology to meet the tenant's requirements, whilst
   maintaining the needs of the existing tenants that are using the same
   network.

5.2.  Network Resource and SID Allocation

   According to the output of computation, the network controller
   instructs the network devices involved in the subgraph to allocate
   the required network resources for the enhanced VPN.  This can be
   done with either PCEP [RFC5440] or Netconf/YANG [RFC6241] [RFC7950]
   with necessary extensions.  The network resources are allocated in a
   per-segment manner.  In addition, dedicated segment identifiers, e.g.
   node-SIDs and adj-SIDs are also allocated to represent the network
   resources allocated for the enhanced VPN on each network segment.

   In the forwarding plane, there are multiple ways of allocating or
   reserving network resources to different enhanced VPNs.  For example,
   FlexE may be used to partition the link resource into different sub-
   channels to achieve hard isolation between each other.  The candidate

   data plane technologies of enhanced VPN can be found in
   [I-D.dong-teas-enhanced-vpn].  The SR SIDs are used as a good
   abstraction of the various types of network resource reservation
   mechanisms in the forwarding plane.

Figure 1. SIDs identify resources allocated to different virtual networks

   Figure 1 shows a network fragment of enhanced VPN supported by SR.
   Note that the format of the SIDs in this figure are for illustration,
   both SR-MPLS and SRv6 can be utilized as the data plane.  In this
   example, there are three virtual topologies created for enhanced VPNs
   red (r) , green (g) and blue (b).  The red and green topologies
   consist of nodes A, B, C, D, and E with all their interconnecting
   links, whilst the blue topology only consists of nodes A, B, C and D
   with all their interconnecting links.  Each node allocates a
   dedicated adjacency SID for each link participating in a particular
   topology.  Each node is also allocated with a dedicated node SID for
   each topology it participates in.  The adj-SIDs are associated with
   the link resources (e.g. bandwidth) allocated to each topology, so
   that the adj-SIDs can be used to steer service of different enhanced
   VPNs into different set of reserved resources in the data plane.  The
   node-SIDs can be associated with dedicated nodal resources allocated

   for each topology.  In addition, the node-SIDs of different
   topologies can be used to build loose SR path within each virtual
   topology, and steer service of different enhanced VPNs into the
   different set of reserved resources in the data plane.

   In Figure 1, the notation x:nnnn:y that in topology colour x, the
   adj-SID nnnn will steer the packet over that link which has a total
   bandwidth of y assigned to that topology.  Thus the note r:1002:1G in
   link C->D says that the red topology over link C->D has a reserved
   bandwidth of 1Gb/s and will be used by packets arriving at node C
   with an adj-SID 1002 at the top of the label stack.

5.3.  Construction of SR Virtual Networks

   Each node MUST advertise its set of resources (allocated and
   available) and the associated SIDs both to the centralized controller
   and into the network.  This can be achieve by many different means
   such as (non-exhaustive list) IGP extensions
   [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn], BGP-LS [RFC7752] with possible
   extensions, NETCONF/YANG [RFC6241] [RFC7950].

   With the collected network resource and SIDs information, the
   controller and network nodes are able to construct the SR virtual
   topologies and forwarding entries using the node-SIDs and adj-SIDs
   allocated for each enhanced VPN.  Unlike classic segment routing in
   which network resources are shared by all services and customers, the
   SR virtual networks are associated with dedicated resource allocated
   in the underlay, so that they can be used to meet the service
   requirement of enhanced VPN and provide the required isolation from
   other services in the same network.

   Figure 2 shows the virtual SR topologies created from the underlay
   network in Figure 1.

5.4.  VPN Service to SR Virtual Network Mapping

   The services of an enhanced VPN customer can be provisioned using the
   customized SR virtual network as the underlay.  In this way, services
   of different enhanced VPNs will only use the network resources
   allocated and will not interfere with each other.  For each enhanced
   VPN customer, the service paths can be customized for different
   services within the SR virtual topology, and the allocated network
   resources are shared by different services of the same enhanced VPN
   customer.

   For example, to create a strict path along the path A-B-D-E in the
   red topology in Figure 2, the SR segment list in the service packet
   would be (1001, 1002, 1003).  For the same strict path in green
   topology, the SR segment list would be (2001, 2002, 2003).  In the
   case where we wish to construct a loose path A-D-E in the green
   topology, the service packet SHOULD be set with the SR segment list
   (201, 204, 205).  At node A the packet is sent towards D via either
   node B or C using the link and node resources allocated for the green
   topology.  At node D the packet is forwarded to E using the link and
   node resource allocated for the green topology.  Similarly, a packet
   for the loose path A-D-E in the red topology would arrive at node A
   with the SID list (101, 104, 105).

5.5.  Network Visibility to Customer

   The tenants of enhanced VPNs may request different granularity of
   visibility to the network which deliver the service.  Depending on
   the requirement, the network can be exposed to the tenant either as a
   virtual network topology, or a set of computed paths with transit
   nodes, or simply the connectivity between endpoints without any path
   information.  The visibility can be delivered through different
   possible mechanisms, such as IGPs (e.g.  IS-IS, OSPF) or BGP-LS.  In
   addition, the network operator may want to restrict the visibility of
   the information it delivers to the tenant by either hiding the
   transit nodes between sites (and only delivering the endpoints
   connectivity) or by hiding portions of the transit nodes (summarizing
   the path into fewer nodes).  Mechanisms such as BGP-LS allow the
   flexibility of the advertisement of aggregated network information.

6.  Benefits of the Proposed Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism provides several key characteristics:

   o  Flexibility

   o  Scalability

   o  Resource isolation

   In addition to isolation, the proposed mechanism allows resource
   sharing between different services of the same enhanced VPN customer.
   This gives the customer more flexibility and control in service
   planning and provisioning, the experience would be similar to using a
   dedicated private network.  The performance of critical services
   flows in a particular enhanced VPN can be further ensured using the
   mechanisms defined in [DetNet].

   The detailed comparison with other candidates technologies are given
   in the following subsections.

6.1.  MPLS-TP

   MPLS-TP could be enhanced to include the allocation of specific
   resources along the path to a specific LSP.  This would require that
   the SDN system set up and maintain every resource at every path for
   every customer, and map this to the LSP in the data plane, hence at
   every hop unique LSP label is needed for each path.  Whilst this
   would be a way to produce a proof of concept for network slicing of
   an MPLS underlay, delegation would be difficult, resulting in a high
   overhead and a system needing too much administration.  This leads to
   scaling concerns.  The number of labels needed at any node would be
   the total number of services passing through that node.  Experience
   with early pseudowire designs shows that this can lead to scaling
   issues.

6.2.  RSVP-TE

   RSVP-TE has the same scaling concern as MPLS-TP in terms of the
   number of LSPs that need to be maintained being equal to the number
   of services passing through any given node.  It also has the two RSVP
   disadvantages that basic SR seeks to address:

   o  The use of RSVP for path establishment in addition to the routing
      protocol used to discover the topology and the network resources.

   o  The overhead of the soft-state maintenance associated with RSVP.
      The impact of this overhead would be exacerbated by the increased
      number of end to end paths requiring state maintenance.

6.3.  Basic SR

   Compared to RSVP, SR reduces the number of control protocols to only
   the routing protocol.  It also attempts to minimize the core state by
   pushing state into the packet, although in some cases the binding
   SIDs are required to overcome the limitations in the ability of some

   nodes to push large label stacks.  Moreover, currently SR does not
   support resource allocation or identification below the level of
   link, and none at node level.  This restricts the extent to which
   some particular tenant traffic can be isolated from other traffic in
   the network.

6.4.  SR with Resource Awareness

   The approach described in this document seeks to achieve a compromise
   between the state limitations of traditional TE systems and the lack
   of resource awareness in basic SR.

   By segmenting the path and allocating network resources to each
   element of the virtual network topologies, the operator can choose
   the granularity of resource to path binding within a virtual
   topology.  In network segments where resource is scarce such that the
   service requirement may not always be met, the SR approach can
   allocate specific resources to a particular high priority service.
   By contrast, in other parts of the network where resource is
   plentiful, the resource may be shared by a number of services.  The
   decision to do this is in the hands of the operator.  Because of the
   segmented nature of the path, resource aggregation is possible in a
   way that is more difficult with RSVP-TE and MPLS-TP due to the use of
   dedicated label to identify each end-to-end path.

7.  Service Assurance

   In order to provide service assurance it is necessary to instrument
   the network at multiple levels.  The network operator needs to
   ascertain that the underlay is operating correctly.  A tenant needs
   to ascertain that their services are correctly operating.  In
   principle these can use existing techniques.  These are well known
   problems and solutions either exist or are in development to address
   them.

   New work is needed to instrument the virtual networks that are
   created.  Such instrumentation needs to operate without causing
   disruption to other services using the network.  Given the
   sensitivity of some applications, care needs to be taken to ensure
   that the instrumentation itself does not cause disruption either to
   the service being instrumented or to other services.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   The normal security considerations of VPNs are applicable and it is
   assumed that industry best practise is applied to an enhanced VPN.

   The security considerations of segment routing are applicable and it
   is assumed that these are applied to an enhanced VPN that uses SR.

   Some applications of enhanced VPNs are sensitive to packet latency;
   the enhanced VPNs provisioned to carry their traffic have latency
   SLAs.  By disrupting the latency of such traffic an attack can be
   directly targeted at the customer application, or can be targeted at
   the network operator by causing them to violate their SLA, triggering
   commercial consequences.  Dynamic attacks of this sort are not
   something that networks have traditionally guarded against, and
   networking techniques need to be developed to defend against this
   type of attack.  By rigorously policing ingress traffic and carefully
   provisioning the resources provided to critical services this type of
   attack can be prevented.  However case needs to be taken when
   providing shared resources, and when the network needs to be
   reconfigured as part of ongoing maintenance or in response to a
   failure.

   The details of the underlay MUST NOT be exposed to third parties, to
   prevent attacks aimed at exploiting a shared resource.
