Abstract

   The IP Mobility Protocol [RFC3344] describes the multicast and
   broadcast packet transmission between the mobile node and the home-
   network or visited network.  The Reverse Tunneling for Mobile IP,
   Revised [RFC3024] describes reverse tunneling the multicast and
   broadcast packets to the home network using encapsulating delivery
   style between mobile nodes and the foreign agent.  However, [RFC3024]
   says that all packets must be encapsulated in the IP-in-IP tunnel
   once the encapsulated delivery style is negotiated.  This restriction
   causes over-the-air tunnel overhead in the wireless medium between
   the mobile and the foreign agent.  This document provides a generic
   solution to ease the restriction of unicast packet to be encapsulated
   in encapsulating delivery mode.  It also provides alternatives of
   direct delivery of multicast/broadcast packets between a foreign
   agent and a mobile node in point-to-point link such as Wimax network.

Internet-Draft            Multicast IP Mobility                July 2007


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3344] section 4.3 and 4.4 discusses multicast and broadcast
   routing from and to mobile node in the triangular routing and co-
   located Care-of-address mode.  Reverse tunneling for Mobile IP
   [RFC3024] introduces encapsulating delivery style for reverse
   tunneling multicast and broadcast packets from mobile node through a
   foreign agent.  However, [RFC3344] also mandates that all multicast
   and broadcast packets should be delivered encapsulated from foreign
   agent to mobile-node.  This again imposes tunnel overhead for the
   multicast broadcast packets.  While tunneling overhead on the wired
   link may be acceptable in terms of network performance, it has a much
   higher cost and throughput impact in the wirless link.  So far,
   Mobile IP has been deployed for 3G data services and there has been
   not much usage of multicast or broadcast data transfer to or from the
   mobile node.  Wimax Network Architecture [NWG] uses Mobile IP
   services as one of the mobility services which could be used for both
   Voice-over-IP and data.  In future, PTT (Push-To-Talk) service may be
   popular and thus demands efficient usage of multicast delivery from
   the mobile to the network acess provider network.  Similary, IPTV may
   use multicast to distribute streaming media across high band width
   wireless network such as Wimax [NWG].

   Moreover, neither RFC3344 or RFC3024 clearly specifies multicast/
   broadcast packet delivery for FA-Care-of-address; for example, for
   encapsulated delivery, the source address of the outer and inner IP
   header is home-address of the mobile (RFC3024, section 5.2.2), but it
   is not clear about local delivery of multicast/broadcast packets in
   the visited network.  Multicast messages from the mobile node to the
   visited network may be needed for retrieving service information.
   Currently different organizations [3GPP2] define their own mechanism
   to obtain such information through AAA during link establishment.
   All Mobility-agent multicast is used for router solicitation by the
   mobile and the implementation can treat this address specially at the
   foreign-agent, but the implementation gets very complex if the mobile
   client uses home-address as source address for other multicast
   messages destined to the home and visited network, in the reverse
   tunnel mode.

   This document aims to clarify multicast messages for reverse tunnel
   mode, adds an delivery encapsulation for only multicast/broadcast
   delivery from mobile to foreign agent and explores direct delivery
   options of multicast messages between the mobile and the foreign
   agent by using link-layer information.

4.  Exclusive Encapsulating Delivery Style for Multicast and Broadcast
    only

   The Mobile IP reverse tunneling [RFC3024] defines Encapsulating
   delivery style for delivering multicast and broadcast packets from
   the mobile to the foreign agent in the FA-CoA mode.  It also mandates
   Encapsulating delivery mode for sending multicast/broadcast packets
   to reverse-tunnel to home agent via the foreign agent.  But RFC3024
   section 2 says that all traffic is encapsulated when Encapsulating
   Delivery is negotiated.  This extension is added such that only
   multicast and broadcast packets are encapsulated to the foreign
   agent, but all unicast packets are delivered directly.  The main
   motivation for adding this extension is to save the overhead of
   additional IP header for unicast packets.  This procedure works for
   both shared media like ethernet, IEEE 802.11 and point-to-point links
   such as IEEE 802.16e.

   Foreign agents SHOULD support the Exclusive Encapsulating Delivery
   Style Extension.  A registration request should contain either
   regular Encapsulating delivery extension (see section 3.3 in RFC3024)
   or Exclusive Encapsulating Delivery style, but not both.  If both
   extensions are present, only the first extension will be taken into
   consideration and the second one will be skipped.

   If a foreign agent supports Exclusive Encapsulating Delivery
   Style(EEDS), then the foreign agent SHOULD advertise the EEDS
   extension along with the router advertisement to inform the mobile
   about the type of delivery style it supports.  This will avoid the
   possiblity of multiple registration requests to figure out which
   encapsulating method the foreign agent supports.

   mobile node MUST include the Exclusive Encapsulating Delivery Style
   Extension after the Mobile-Home Authentication Extension, and before
   the Mobile-Foreign Authentication Extension, if present.  The
   Encapsulating Delivery Style Extension MUST NOT be included if the
   'T' bit is not set in the Registration Request.

   If this extension or RFC3024 compliant Encapsulating Delivery style
   extension is absent, Direct Delivery is assumed.  Encapsulation is
   done according to what was negotiated for the forward tunnel (that
   is, IP in IP is assumed unless specified otherwise).

       Value
        It is a 16bit unsigned integer. Value specifies what type of packets are encapsulated.

         0 : All packets are encapsulated between a mobile node and a foreign agent. It is same
             as encapsualted delivery style in RFC3024.
         1 : Only multicast and broadcast packets are encapsulated

        NOTE: Exclusive encapsulated packets are reverse tunneled after being de-capsulated at
               the foreign agent except those are directly destined to the foreign-agent address
               or all mobility agent address.



4.1.  Packet header formats for visited network traffic

   There might be some multicast or broadcast packets other than Mobile
   IP agent solicitation packets towards the visited network.  If the
   mobile node can acquire a local IP address, then it MUST direct
   deliver the multicast and broadcast traffic for local use.  If the
   mobile-node can have only one IP address, (i.e. home address ) then
   it MUST send all the multicast and broadcast packets encapsulated.
   These packets will be sent to the home-network through reverse-tunnel
   after the de-capsulation at the foreign agent; only exceptions are
   the multicast solicitation messages for the mobility agent.

   In some cases, the mobile may want to send multicast or broadcast
   packets to the visited network entities other than the foreign agent.
   In those cases they should always be direct delivered by acquiring a
   local IP address or using link-layer mechanism if possible.  Please
   see the section 'Link direct delivery style' below for details.

4.2.  Packet header formats for homebound traffic

   The packet format and processing for encapsulated multicast and
   broadcast traffic is the same as defined in section 5.2 of Mobile IP

6.  Link Direct Delivery Style for multicast and broadcast packets

   This section discusses direct-delivery of multicast and broadcast
   packets between mobile and the foreign agent by taking advantage of
   link-layer (such as point-to-point link in Wimax) mechanism.  More
   ideas are being discussed by the authors of this draft.  This section
   will have more information in the later version.
