Abstract 
    
   This document registers the Enumservice type "pstn" and subtype "tel" 
   using the URI scheme 'tel', as well as the subtype " sip" using the 
   URI scheme 'sip' as per the IANA registration process defined in the 
   ENUM specification, RFC 3761.  This Enumservice is used to facilitate 
   the routing of telephone calls in those countries where Number 
   Portability exists.

1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC-2119 [1]. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a technology that 
   transforms E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication 
   Numbering Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and 
   then uses DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through 
   NS records and NAPTR records (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System 
   (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database, RFC 3403 
   [4]) to look up what services are available for a specific domain 
   name. 
    
   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines 
   given in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning in the services

   field of a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate the types of 
   functionality associated with an end point and/or telephone number.  
   The registration is defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation 
   Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" 
   DDDS Application defined in RFC 3761. 
    
   Number Portability allows telephone subscribers to keep their 
   telephone numbers when they change service provider, move to a new 
   location, or change the subscribed services [15].  In many countries, 
   such as the United States and Canada, the functions of naming and 
   addressing on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) have been 
   abstracted.  In the case of a ported number, the dialed number is not 
   directly routable on the PSTN and must be translated into a routing 
   number for call completion.  Other numbers, which are not ported, and 
   which can be routed directly on the PSTN based on the dialed number, 
   are typically assigned to carriers and other entities in large blocks 
   or pools.  Number Portability and other numbering information is 
   distributed in a variety of methods and formats around the world.  
    
   The Enumservices described here could enable service providers to 
   place ported, pooled, and blocks of numbers and their associated PSTN 
   contact information, into externally available or highly locally 
   cached ENUM databases.  This, in turn, could enable such parties to 
   consolidate all telephone number lookups in their networks into a 
   single ENUM lookup, thereby simplifying call routing and network 
   operations, which would then result in either an on-net, or IP-based 
   response, or off-net, PSTN-based response.   
    
   The following Enumservice is registered with this document: "pstn" to 
   indicate PSTN routing data, including number portability data, non-
   ported telephone number data (individually or in number blocks), and 
   other PSTN-oriented data that is associated with E.164 telephone 
   numbers.  The purpose of this Enumservice is to describe information 
   about telephone numbers which cannot be used on the public Internet 
   or a private/peered Internet Protocol (IP) network.  Thus, these are 
   numbers which are only reachable via the traditional PSTN. 
    
   The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 indicate that a "type" and 
   a "subtype" may be specified.  Within this set of specifications the 
   convention is assumed that the "type" (being the more generic term) 
   defines the service and the "subtype" defines the URI scheme. 
    
   When only one URI scheme is associated with a given service, it 
   should be assumed that an additional URI scheme to be used with this 
   service may be added at a later time.  Thus, the subtype is needed to 
   identify the specific Enumservice intended.

3. Distribution of Data 
    
   The distribution of number portability data is often highly 
   restricted either by contract or regulation of a National Regulatory 
   Authority (NRA), therefore NAPTR records specified herein may or may 
   not be part of the e164.arpa DNS tree. 
    
   The authors believe that it is more likely that these records will be 
   distributed on a purely private basis.  Distribution of this NAPTR 
   data could be either (a) on a private basis (within a service 
   provider's internal network, or on a private basis between one or 
   more parties using a variety of security mechanisms to prohibit 
   general public access), (b) openly available or, (c) distributed by 
   the relevant number portability organization or other industry 
   organization, but possibly on a national basis and subject to or in 
   accordance with national regulatory policy. 
    
   If such data was distributed nationally, the national telephone 
   numbering authority, or some other regulatory body or numbering 
   organization, may have jurisdiction.  Such a body may choose to 
   restrict distribution of the data in such a way that it may not pass 
   over that country's national borders.

5. Examples 
 
   The following sub-sections document several examples for illustrative 
   purposes.  These examples shall in no way limit the various forms 
   that this Enumservice may take. 
    
5.1 Example of a Ported Number, Using a 'tel' URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:tel"

   In this example, a Routing Number (rn) and a Number Portability Dip 
   Indicator (npdi) are used as shown in draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-08 
   [10].  The 'npdi' field is included in order to prevent subsequent 
   lookups in legacy-style PSTN databases. 
    
5.2 Example of a Ported Number, Using a 'sip' URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:sip" 
      "!^.*$!sip:+1-215-981-7813;npdi;rn=+1-215-555-1212 
   @gw.example.com;user=phone!". 
    
   In this example, a Routing Number (rn) and a Number Portability Dip 
   Indicator (npdi) are used as shown in draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-08 
   [10].  The 'npdi' field is included in order to prevent subsequent 
   lookups in legacy-style PSTN databases.  The method of conversion 
   from a tel to a SIP URI is as demonstrated in RFC 3261, Section 
   19.1.6 [11], as well as in , draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-08 Section 6 
   [10]. 
    
5.3 Example of a Non-Ported Number, Using a 'tel' URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:tel" 
      "!^.*$!tel:+1-215-981-7813;npdi!". 
    
   In this example, a Number Portability Dip Indicator (npdi) is used 
   [10].  The 'npdi' field is included in order to prevent subsequent 
   lookups in legacy-style PSTN databases. 
    
5.4 Example of a Non-Ported Number, Using a 'sip' URI Scheme 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:sip" 
      "!^.*$!sip:+1-215-981-7813;npdi@gw.example.com;user=phone!". 
    
   In this example, a Number Portability Dip Indicator (npdi) is used 
   [10].  The 'npdi' field is included in order to prevent subsequent 
   lookups in legacy-style PSTN databases.  The method of conversion 
   from a tel to a SIP URI is as demonstrated in RFC 3261, Section 
   19.1.6 [11], as well as in , draft-ietf-iptel-tel-np-08 Section 6 
   [10]. 
    
5.5 Example Using a Regular Expression 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:tel" 
      "!(^.*)$!tel:\1;npdi!".

   In this example, a regular expression replacement function is used to 
   reduce the size of the NAPTR record.  The tel URI uses "\1" which 
   would dynamically replace the expression with the TN plus the leading 
   "+", in this case +1-215-981-7813. 
 
6. Implementation Recommendations 
 
6.1 Call Processing When Multiple Records Are Returned 
    
   It is likely that that both E2U+sip and E2U+pstn Enumservice type 
   records will be returned for a given query.  In this case, this could 
   result in what is essentially an on-net and off-net pstn record.  
   Thus, one record gives the associated address on an IP network, while 
   the other gives the associated address on the PSTN.  As with multiple 
   records resulting from a typical ENUM query of the e164.arpa tree, it 
   is up to the application using an ENUM resolver to determine which 
   record(s) to use and which record(s) to ignore.  Implementers should 
   take this into consideration and build logic into their applications 
   that can select appropriately from multiple records based on 
   business, network, or other rules.  For example, such a resolver 
   could be configured to grant preference to the on-net record, or 
   execute other logic as required by the application. 
 
6.2 NAPTR Configuration issues 
    
   It has been suggested that tel URIs may be easier and more efficient 
   to use in practice than SIP URIs.  In addition, the use of tel URIs 
   may result in somewhat smaller NAPTR records which, when considering 
   adding hundreds of millions of these records to the DNS, could have a 
   substantial impact on the processing and storage requirements for 
   service providers or other entities making use of this Enumservice 
   type. 
    
   Implementers may wish to consider using regular expressions in order 
   to reduce the size of individual NAPTRs.  This will have a 
   significant effect on the overall size of the database involved.  
   Using the Section 5.5 example from above, this is 11 bytes per 
   record. 
    
7. Example of E2U+pstn in Call Processing 
    
   This is an example of how a switch, proxy, or other calling 
   application may make use of this Enumservice type during the call 
   initiation process. 
    
7.1 Dialed Number Not Available On-Net 
      a) A user, which is connected to a calling application, dials an 
         E.164 telephone number: +1-215-981-7813. 

 
 
Livingood & Shockey    Expires November 9, 2006               [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft             PSTN Enumservice                   May 2006 
 
 
      b) The calling application uses the dialed number to form a NAPTR 
         record: 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      c) The DNS finds an E2U+pstn:tel record and returns a tel URI for 
         processing by the calling application: tel:+1-215-981-
         7813;npdi. 
      d) The calling application uses routing logic to determine which 
         media gateway is the closest to this number and routes the 
         call appropriately. 
    
7.2 Dialed Number Available On-Net and on the PSTN 
      a) A user, which is connected to a calling application, dials an 
         E.164 telephone number: 1-215-981-7813. 
      b) The calling application uses the dialed number to form a NAPTR 
         record: 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      c) The DNS finds both an E2U+pstn record, as well as an E2U+sip 
         record, since this number happens to be on the IP network of a 
         connected network. 
      d) The calling application prioritizes the on-net record first: 
         sip:+1-215-981-7813;npdi@gw.example.com;user=phone.   
      e) The calling application sets up the SIP call to 
         gw.example.com.  
      f) Should the IP call route fail for whatever reason, the calling 
         application may be able to utilize the E2U+pstn record to 
         invoke a fallback route to a media gateway that is connected 
         to the PSTN. 
 
8. Security Considerations 
    
   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Should 
   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other  
   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining PSTN 
   Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone 
   anonymously.  While this is not qualitatively different from 
   publication in a Telephone Directory, it does open or ease access to 
   such data without any indication that such data has been accessed or 
   by whom it has been accessed. 
    
   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists 
   of targets for unsolicited information.  Thus, a third party could 
   use this to generate a list that they can use to make unsolicited 
   "telemarketing" phone calls.  Many countries have do-not-call 
   registries or other legal or regulatory mechanisms in place to deal 
   with such abuses.   
    
   As noted earlier Carriers, service providers, and other users may 
   simply choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa  
   tree, but may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM 
   routing database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements 
   of their network, such as softswitches and SIP proxy servers.  They

Internet-Draft             PSTN Enumservice                   May 2006 
 
 
   may also choose to publish such information in a carrier-only branch 
   of the E164.ARPA tree, should one be created. 
    
   Although an E.164 telephone number does not appear to reveal as much 
   identity information about a user as a name in the format 
   sip:username@hostname or email:username@hostname, the information is 
   still publicly available, thus there is still the risk of unwanted 
   communication. 
    
   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS 
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [13] to this is provided in RFC 3761 
   [1].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in 
   RFC 3833 [14]. 
    
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document registers the 'pstn' Enumservice type and the subtype 
   "tel" and "sip" under the Enumservice registry described in the IANA 
   considerations in RFC 3761.  Details of this registration are 
   provided in sections 3 and 4 of this document.
