Abstract

   Recent specifications extending the Web Distributed Authoring
   Protocol (WebDAV) restrict the set of properties returned
   automatically upon a PROPFIND/allprop request. This specification
   defines a method to add specific properties to the set of properties
   returned upon PROPFIND/allprop.

2. Introduction

   Recent specifications extending the "Web Distributed Authoring
   Protocol" (WebDAV, [RFC2518]) like "Versioning Extensions to WebDAV"
   [RFC3253] and "WebDAV Access Control Protocol" [ACL] restrict the set
   of properties returned automatically upon a PROPFIND/allprop request
   in order to avoid the expensive computation of properties that the
   client in many cases isn't interested in.

   However, this change from the behaviour defined in WebDAV can lead to
   situations where clients need to perform two requests to retrieve all
   properties they are interested in (one using PROPFIND/allprop, then
   PROPFIND/prop enumerating the new properties that weren't reported
   upon the first request). This specification defines a
   backward-compatible extension to add specific properties to the set
   of properties returned upon PROPFIND/allprop, thus saving at least
   one PROPFIND request.

   This document defines an extension element that could ultimately
   become part of the core WebDAV protocol. Being just an individual
   submission, it currently defines it in the proprietary namespace

     http://sapportals.com/xmlns/cm/webdav

   instead of the "DAV:" namespace. It uses a prefix of "in:" for
   referring to elements in this namespace. However, WebDAV server and
   clients are free to use any prefix, provided that there is a
   namespace declaration that binds the prefix to the URI of the same
   namespace.

3. Extensions to PROPFIND/allprop

   The "allprop" version of PROPFIND is extended to take an optional
   in:include element. When present, it contains a set of property names
   that shall be reported in addition to those properties that the
   server usually would return upon PROPFIND/allprop.

       </propstat>
     </response>
   </multistatus>

   In this example, the server has recognized the extension element
   in:include and included the properties DAV:checked-in and
   DAV:checked-out (as defined in [RFC3253]).

   In this case the in:include element was simply ignored. The client
   can detect this situation by checking for the presence of the
   requested properties and will have to issue an additional PROPFIND/
   prop request (to retrieve the missing properties).

4. Changes to WebDAV DTD

   <!ELEMENT propfind ((allprop, in:include+) | propname | prop) >
   <!ELEMENT in:include ANY >

   Note that the WebDAV DTD is informal only and cannot be used to
   validate request or response bodies (due to the inability to properly
   work with XML namespaces).

5. Compatibility Considerations

   This specification introduces a new child element for the
   DAV:propfind element, defined in Section 4. Old servers will ignore
   this element (see [RFC2518], chapter 14). Clients can detect this
   situation as outlined in Section 3.2.

   Clients not aware of this specification will not be affected at all,
   because they will never use the new in:include element in PROPFIND
   requests.

   internationalizability.

7. IANA Considerations

   it does not specify any new namespaces (in the general sense), but
   merely uses existing ones.

Appendix A. Alternate syntax proposal from interim WebDAV working group
            meeting

   This section briefly describes an alternate approach to the problem
   covered by this draft. It was discussed during the interim WebDAV
   working group meeting in January 2003 and was supported by all
   meeting attendees. It was also added to the latest draft for the
   revision of [RFC2518], [ID-RFC2518bis].

A.1 PROPFIND/prop extension to include dead properties

   Additional PROPFIND marshalling:



   <!ELEMENT propfind (allprop | propname | (prop, dead-props?)) >
   <!ELEMENT dead-props EMPTY >

   The DAV:dead-props element can be added to PROPFIND requests that
   retrieve named properties using DAV:prop. When present, the server
   MUST include all dead properties defined on the resource.

A.2 Example

   This example shows the alternate syntax applied to the example from
   Section 3.1.

   >>Request

   PROPFIND  /container/front.html HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.org
   Depth: 1
   Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx
