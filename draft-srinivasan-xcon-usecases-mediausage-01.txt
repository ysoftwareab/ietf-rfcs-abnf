Internet-Draft                 mediausage                     March 2007


1.  Introduction

   The document clarifies the usages of SDP level attributes used in
   negotiating media to a conferencing server.  RFC 4574 [3] describes a
   mechanism to label media streams to identify them, but leaves the
   offer/answer model as an implementation detail.  RFC 4575 [2] and the
   XCON extensions to the conference event package [10] describe
   mechanisms to notify state of conferences and defines a data model
   for centralized conferencing.  They, however, do not specify
   semantics of those attributes and their use by the conferencing
   server in signaling and media negotiations performed with the
   conferencing client.  This document attempts to close the gap by
   suggesting a means for establishing the relationship between media
   and the conferencing state information maintained by the XCON
   conferencing server (for which the data model is described in [7]).


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Media stream definitions

   The XCON framework [1] describes a framework for establishing and
   participating in a centralized conference.  The sections that follow
   discuss the media aspect of conferencing in more detail.

3.1.  Available media clarification

   The available-media XML element in RFC 4575 [2] offers the ability
   for a conferencing system to provide a list of media stream inputs or
   outputs.  A conferencing client joining the conference via the
   conferencing server (eg. the focus) typically subscribes to the
   conference event package as seen in [11].  The conference event
   package provides a mechanism for conferencing clients to be notified
   of conference state as described in the conference framework [1].
   The XCON event package [10] further extends RFC 4575 [2] to specify
   controls (based on [7]) to media streams negotiated by conferencing
   clients.  The XCON data model [7] is derived from the data model
   described in RFC 4575 [2], so for all practical purposes any
   references to [2] also apply to the XCON data model [7] and the XCON
   extensions to the conference event package [10] with a few exceptions
   (refer [10] for the key differences from the conference event package

   in [2]).

   As more and more conferencing systems begin to offer one or more
   streams of the same type (like video), conferencing clients ought to
   be capable of rendering more than one stream as offered by
   conferencing systems in an inter-operable manner.  Mechanisms such as
   grouping of SDP media lines [8] and SDP media content [9] further
   help in achieving this goal.  It is however important to note that
   unless a conferencing client understands the context of how these
   streams ought to be renedered, the conferencing clients may not be
   able to render streams that it is not aware of.  This document only
   addresses the problem of associating media SDP information (in
   signaling protocols such as SIP) to the media information supplied in
   the conferencing document (refer [7]).

   Media streams offered in a conference in RFC 4575 [2] are each
   identified via a label.  This XML element is defined as optional.  A
   media label, however, SHOULD be assigned if more than one stream of
   the same media type is offered by the conference.  The label also is
   used to associate the media 'id' attribute (as described in the
   subsequent sections) to the corresponding stream (m line) in the SDP.
   This enables conference-aware clients to negotiate SDP media in
   relation to the conference event package data received from the
   conference server without having to deal with the specifics of
   ordering SDP media lines as required or specified by the conferencing
   server.  The label is also unique within the conference-info context
   as defined in RFC 4575 [2].  A label is typically created when a
   conference is scheduled, either via conference blueprints [1] or
   through some other means.  A new label MAY however appear in
   available media element after the conference is active and
   conferencing clients may decide to render these new streams as
   required (based on local policy).  When a conference is activated and
   a conferencing client receives a notification with the conference
   state, the conferencing server typically SHOULD label the media
   streams.  The conferencing client then may use this information or
   may discover available media via signaling (for example, using SIP
   OPTIONS) to join the conference and to start receiving media,
   provided it understands the context in which the specific media needs
   to be rendered.  Mechanisms such as SDP media content [9] further aid
   in providing conferencing clients with this context.

3.2.  Per-user or per-endpoint media definitions

   Streams sent from a specific user's endpoint device is usually
   negotiated via some form of a signaling session.  The conferencing
   event package schema contains media XML elements within the users/
   user/endpoint elements.  The media XML element in RFC 4575 [2] refers
   to a media stream of which there may be more than one.  Each media

Internet-Draft                 mediausage                     March 2007


   stream being sent from the conferencing client to the conference
   server is identified, within the conferencing event package, via an
   'id' (refer [2], for more information).


4.  SDP negotiation and conferencing media usage

   This section explains the semantics of the media label and its usage
   within the XCON framework.  The media label in the conferencing data
   model or the conferencing event package maps to the media label
   defined within SDP in RFC 4574 [3].  The media label is used to
   identify and associate streams in the SDP offer/answer model to the
   specific streams within conferencing.  This section will explain how
   this is done.

4.1.  Criteria for including media label attribute in SDP

   RFC 4574 [3] suggests that the label may appear either in the offer
   or the answer and is used to identify the local stream either in the
   offer or the answer.  This section describes how conferencing servers
   should integrate label into the offer/answer model and associate it
   with the data model (and thus [10]).  All conferencing clients and
   servers MUST follow the offer/answer model as described in [6].  The
   following sections only describe the usage of the media label in the
   context of conferencing within the offer/answer model.

   The conferencing server SHOULD include a SDP 'label' attribute (as
   defined in RFC 4574 [3]) for each stream in SDP sent from the
   conferencing server to the conferencing client (in either the offer
   or the answer).  If there are two or more streams of the same media
   type (as defined in RFC 4575 [2], Section 5.3.4 with type being the
   values registered for "media" of SDP [5]), the conferencing server
   SHOULD include the label for each stream in the SDP sent from the
   server.  The media label MUST follow normative text described in RFC
   4575 [2] and RFC 4574 [3].

4.2.  Mapping of media label (in SDP) to media id

   As the 'id' XML attribute (in Section 5.8 of [2]) is not directly
   carried in the SDP (or any signaling for that matter), the label
   attribute also serves the purpose of mapping the media 'id' defined
   in the data model to the media label defined in the data model.  What
   this means is that a conferencing client will not be able to
   negotiate different m-lines with the same label within the same
   conference via separate signaling sessions.

   [[ Note: Fixing this will require a new SDP attribute for conveying
   the media id in SDP ]]

5.  Media controls definitions

   Media controls may be defined at the global conference-info level
   (under available-media as specified in Section 4.1.5.1 in [7]) or may
   be defined for a specific user and endpoint's media stream (as
   specified in Section 4.5.2.1 of [7]).  The former definition should
   typically override the latter.  For example, if the global audio is
   muted, then none of the participants audio should be unmuted.  The
   control values for the endpoint's media stream may however have mute
   set to false.  But this value is ignored as the global control is set
   to true.

   Note that the global controls only refer to controls for the streams
   coming from the conference mixer for that stream and does not refer
   to controls for media streams being sent from the user's endpoint to
   the mixer.


6.  Media scenarios

6.1.  An example mixer model



    [to-mixer streams]                           [from-mixer streams]
                              |----mixer----|
    userid=23 , id=34     ----|             |--- label='10'
    userid=23 , id=35     ----|             |--- label='11'
    userid=23 , id=36     ----|             |--- label='12'
    userid=24 , id=24     ----|             |
    userid=24 , id=35     ----|             |
                              |-------------|


   The mixer shown above takes in some set of input streams and mixes
   them in some form or manner to produce output streams.  This document
   will not cover how the streams are grouped and/or mixed but will only
   show how the media inputs and outputs tie into the conferencing data
   model and signaling with an example.  For further information refer
   RFC 4575 [2].  The examples shown below are for information purposes
   only and is offered to aid in understanding the solution presented in
   this document.

   The 'label' parameter above identifies the media stream from and to
   the mixer.  The streams to the mixer, from a specific user and
   endpoint, are identified by an 'id' in the conferencing data model.
   The label is unique throughout the conferencing data model.  The id
   is unique within the endpoint media element in the data model and is

Internet-Draft                 mediausage                     March 2007


   generated by the conferencing server.  Furthermore, each user is
   identified by a user identifier, refer [4].

   Consider that the label '10' is the stream containing the audio
   stream mix from all audio input streams offered to every participant.
   And '11' consists of a video mix that contains one of the layouts as
   decribed in the scenarios section.  And that '12' is an alternate mix
   of the video streams that is voice activated.

   And id's 34,35 and 36 for userid 23 are the user's main audio, main
   video stream and secondary video streams respectively.  And id's 24
   and 35 for userid 24 are the user's main audio and main video streams
   respectively.

   Let us also consider that the mixer mixes the incoming video streams
   from the participants (going to the mixer) into both label '11' and
   label '12' streams.  Also, the mixer accepts a single input stream at
   most from the client (in any sendrecv media stream), while rejecting
   the rest.  This is a specific mixer model described here, other mixer
   models may interpret the input streams differently.  The next section
   will cover how this specific mix will appear in the offer/answer
   model in SDP.

   Note that the floor control aspects of the streams above are omitted
   here for brevity as floor control is defined as being optional.

6.1.1.  Conference notification example

   The notification example given below corresponds to the mixer model
   defined above.  The available-media element lists the media labels as
   defined.  Note that the media labels '11' and '12' are defined with a
   status element of sendrecv.

   Using the offer/answer model described earlier, users Bob (userid=23)
   and Carl (userid=24) have joined the Focus and negotiated media
   streams as shown in the notification below.  It is useful to note
   that Bob has chosen to recv all video streams, while Carl has decided
   to opt on the secondary voice-activated video stream.

   It is quite possible for a conferencing system to expose Bob's input
   stream directly (without mixing) to the participants of the
   conference if it deems necessary as Bob has a role of presenter.  It
   may do so, for example, by creating a new label on-the-fly to expose
   this to the conferencing client.

   The notification below is what a presenter (Bob) may receive.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      -

6.2.  Common audio/video scenarios

   The following sections are examples of how conference controls and
   the SDP may be interpreted.  This section will not cover the usages
   of all the controls defined in the XCON data model [7].  [[TBD]]

6.2.1.  Muting an audio stream

6.2.1.1.  Mute all participants

   Muting all participants (in other words, activating the control or
   setting the value to 'true') in the conference typically means that
   for the entire duration where mute is applicable, all current and
   future participants of the conference are muted and will not receive
   any audio.  Typically this control is available to presenter or
   moderator roles in a conferencing system.  Setting this control
   overrides any user-specific control settings specified (see the next
   few sections).  Since no audio is flowing to all participants,
   activating this control, in turn, may cause the conferencing focus to
   re-negotiate SDP with the various participants to stop media flowing
   as and when necessary.  This is entirely up to local policy.  Note
   that doing so may cause changes in conference state (with per-
   endpoint media elements and controls, their respective id's and their
   default states changing).

   In the example mixer, the control appears under available-media
   element as shown below.

                     brevity -->
                    <mute>true</mute>
          </entry>
          <!-- omitted -->
        </available-media>


6.2.1.2.  Muting to-mixer stream from a specific participant

   A mixer stream being sent from a participant to the mixer may be
   mixed in any form or manner.  For example, this may appear in
   multiple media outputs from the mixer (though not the case in this
   specific example).  Thus, activating this control would most
   certainly cause this input not appearing in any of the outputs from
   the mixer.  Similar to the previous scenario, activating this control
   may end up re-negotiating SDP.

   In the example mixer, the control appears under media element for
   each user and endpoint.  Bob's controls is shown below.

          <media id="34">
            <to-mixer name="AudioIn">
              <mute>true</mute>
            </to-mixer>
            <label>10</label>
            <!-- omitted -->
          </media>

        SDP from the conferencing server may look like
        (some elements omitted)

         v=0
         c=IN IP4 131.164.74.2
         t=0 0
         m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0
         a=label:10


   Note that even though the above SDP does not contain any information
   about the media id, the label provides a mapping of the specific
   m-line to the media section in the data model.

6.2.1.3.  Muting from-mixer stream to a specific participant

   This is a control on a specific mixer stream that is sent from a
   mixer to the participant negotiated via SDP.  This is mostly optional
   and many conferencing systems may instead opt to not implement such a
   control.  A client may instead, stop sending the media to the output
   device instead of activating this control to mute the stream.  Doing
   so will have the mixer still sending media packets towards the
   participant thus taking bandwidth on the network and CPU on the
   mixer.  Activating this control would stop media being send back from
   the mixer to the participant.  Similar to the previous scenarios,
   activating this control may end up re-negotiating SDP.

   In the example mixer, the control appears under media element for
   each user and endpoint.  Bob's controls is shown below.

          <media id="34">
             <!-- omitted -->
             <from-mixer name="AudioOut">
               <mute>true</mute>
             </from-mixer>
             <label>10</label>
          </media>

        SDP from the conferencing server may look like
        (some elements omitted)

         v=0
         c=IN IP4 131.164.74.2
         t=0 0
         m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0
         a=label:10

   As before, note that even though the above SDP does not contain any
   information about the media id, the label provides a mapping of the
   specific m-line to the media section in the data model.

6.2.2.  Pausing a video stream

6.2.2.1.  Pausing video to all participants

   Pausing the video being sent to all participants (in other words,
   activating the control or setting the value to 'true') in the
   conference typically means that for the entire duration where pause
   is applicable, all current and future participants of the conference
   would not receive video.  Typically this control is available to
   presenter or moderator roles in a conferencing system.  Setting this
   control overrides any user-specific control settings specified (see

   the next few sections).  Since no media is flowing to all
   participants, activating this control, in turn, may cause the
   conferencing focus to re-negotiate SDP with the various participants
   to stop media flowing as and when necessary.  This is entirely up to
   local policy.  Note that doing so may cause changes in conference
   state (with per-endpoint media elements and controls, their
   respective id's and their default states changing).

   In the example mixer, the control appears under available-media
   element as shown below.

        <available-media>
           <entry label="11">
             <!-- other elements omitted for
               brevity -->
             <pause-video>true</pause-video>
           </entry>
           <!-- omitted -->
        </available-media>

   A mixer stream being sent from a participant to the mixer may be
   mixed in any form or manner.  For example, this may appear in
   multiple media outputs from the mixer (as is the case in the
   example).  Thus, activating this control would most certainly cause
   this input not appearing in any of the outputs from the mixer.
   Similar to the previous scenario, activating this control may end up
   re-negotiating SDP.

   In the example mixer, the control appears under media element for
   each user and endpoint.  Bob's controls is shown below.  Activating
   this control would end up not showing Bob in any of hte output
   streams.

   information about the media id, the label provides a mapping of the

6.2.2.3.  Pausing video from-mixer stream to a specific participant

   This is a control on a specific mixer stream that is sent from a
   mixer to the participant negotiated via SDP.  This is mostly optional
   and many conferencing systems may instead opt to not implement such a
   control.  A client may instead, stop sending the media to the display
   device instead of activating this control to pause the stream.  Doing
   so will have the mixer still sending media packets towards the
   participant thus taking bandwidth on the network and CPU on the
   mixer.  Activating this control would stop media being send back from
   the mixer to the participant.  Similar to the previous scenarios,
