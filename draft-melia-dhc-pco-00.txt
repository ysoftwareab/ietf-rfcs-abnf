   (MN).  There are scenarios defined in 3GPP (TS 23.402) and WiMax
   forum NWG where the mobile node accessing the non-3GPP trusted system
   needs to convey such information to the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG)
   functionality implemented in the serving gateway (S-GW).  The MAG
   requires the PCO field to send such information to the Local Mobility
   Agent (LMA) (implemented in the PDN gateway, P-GW) in a Proxy Binding
   Update (PBU) message.  PCO options are exchanged between the MN and
   the LMA to transport information such as P-CSCF address, DNS server
   address.

Internet-Draft                PCO over DHCP                February 2009


1.  Introduction

   The 3GPP standardization body is currently defining the Evolved
   Packet Core (EPC) architecture.  The system integrates several access
   technologies classified as 3GPP access, non-3GPP trusted access
   system (e.g.  WiMax) or non-3GPP non trusted access system (e.g.
   WIFI).  Among others, two components of the EPC are relevant for this
   document, namely the S-GW and the P-GW implementing the MAG and the
   LMA function respectively.  When the MN performs a network attachment
   it sends several info to allow the MAG functionality to send a Proxy
   Binding Update to the LMA for connectivity setup and IP address
   configuration.  The PBU optionally contains, as specified in 3GPP
   29275, the Protocol Configuration Options.  The LMA receiving the PBU
   message replies with a PBA message containing the requested
   information.  If the interface between the MAG and LMA for non-3GPP
   trusted access (S2a) is implemented via Proxy Mobile IPv6 then the MN
   exchanges DHCPv4, DHCPv6 or Neighbor Discovery messages with the S-GW
   to trigger the MAG functionality to send PBU messages.  This document
   specifies how to encode PCO options into DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages
   when the host accesses the EPC through a non-3GPP access system i.e.
   WiMax interface.


2.  DHCPv4 option for PCO

   This option enables the host using an IPv4 stack to convey PCO data
   to the access network.  The host includes this option in the DHCP
   Request message sent to the access gateway/NAS (Network Access
   Server) which acts as the DHCP server or relay.

4.  Option usage

4.1.  Usage of DHCPv4 Options for PCO transport

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCP options follow the
   rules specified for DHCP options in [RFC2131].

4.1.1.  Mobile Node behavior

   The mobile node may include PCO data in the DHCPREQUEST message.  The
   MN may receive unsolicited PCO data in the DHCPACK message.

4.1.2.  DHCP server behavior

   When the DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST message with a PCO
   Option the DHCP server MUST always construct the response according
   to the requested option.

   The DHCP might optionally decide to send PCO data to the mobile node
   in the DHCPACK message.

4.2.  Usage of DHCPv6 Options for PCO transport

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCP options follow the
   rules specified for DHCP options in [RFC3315].

4.2.1.  Mobile node behavior

   The mobile node may include PCO data in the REQUEST message.  The MN
   may receive unsolicited PCO data in the REPLY message.

4.2.2.  DHCP server behavior

   When the DHCP server receives the REQUEST message with a PCO Option
   the DHCP server MUST always construct the response according to the
   requested option.

   The DHCP might optionally decide to send unsolicited PCO data to the
   mobile node in the REPLY message.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one new DHCPv4 option:

      PCO Option for DHCPv4 (OPTION-IPv4-PCO) To Be Assigned

   This document defines one new DHCPv6 option:

      PCO Option for DHCPv6 (OPTION-IPv6-PCO) To Be Assigned


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply.  If an adversary
   manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own
   response, an MN could be led to obtain rogue PCO information.

   It is recommended to use either DHCP authentication option described
   in [RFC3118] where available, or rely upon link layer security.

   This will also protect the denial of service attacks to DHCP servers.
   [RFC3118] provides mechanisms for both entity authentication and
   message authentication.
