1.  ToDo list

   These further actions are due on the draft:

   o  Align with updated architecture and data plane documents (partly
      done).

   o  App-flow parameters will not be defined in detail (add references
      only, e.g., 802.1Qcc).  We focus on DetNet flows.

   o  Clarification on relationship between DetNet flow model and DetNet
      service model.

   o  Parameter set needs finalization, some re-org of the set may be
      needed.

   o  Sort out which parameter belongs to DetNet flow model and which to
      DetNet service model.

   o  Clarify relationship between App-flow and DetNet flow (N:1 vs
      1:1).

2.  Introduction

   A Deterministic Networking (DetNet) service provides a capability to
   carry a unicast or a multicast data flow for an application with
   constrained requirements on network performance, e.g., low packet
   loss rate and/or latency.  The DetNet service is provided either for
   a Layer 3 (L3) flow or a Layer 2 (L2) flow by an IP/MPLS network,
   see, e.g., [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls].  Similarly, Time-Sensitive
   Networking (TSN) [IEEE8021TSN]) can be used for L2 flows in a bridged
   network.  DetNet and TSN have common architecture as expressed in
   [IETFDetNet] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  DetNet service can
   be leveraged both by L3 and L2 flows, i.e., by DetNet L3 flows and
   DetNet L2 flows.  Therefore, the DetNet flow and service information
   model provided by this document covers both DetNet L3 flows and
   DetNet L2 flows in an integrated fashion.

   In a given network scenario three information models can
   distinguished:

   o  Flow models describe characteristics of data flows.  These models
      describe in detail all relevant aspects of a flow that are needed
      to support the flow properly by the network between the source and
      the destination(s).

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model           March 2019


   o  Service models describe characteristics of services being provided
      for data flows over a network.  These models can be treated as a
      network operator independent information model.

   o  Configuration models describe in detail the settings required on
      network nodes to serve a data flow properly.

   Service and flow information models are used between the user and the
   network operator.  Configuration information models are used between
   the management/control plane entity of the network and the network
   nodes.  They are shown in Figure 1.

         Figure 1: Usage of Information models (flow, service and
                              configuration)

   DetNet flow and service information model is based on
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and on the data model specified by
   [IEEE8021Qcc].  Furthermore, the DetNet flow information model relies
   on the flow identification possibilities described in [IEEE8021CB],
   which is used by [IEEE8021Qcc] as well.  In addition to TSN data
   model, [IEEE8021Qcc] also specifies configuration of TSN features
   (e.g., traffic scheduling specified by [IEEE8021Qbv]).  Due to the
   common architecture and flow model, configuration features can be
   leveraged in certain deployment scenarios, e.g., when the network
   that provides the DetNet service includes both L3 and L2 network
   segments.

   Based on the DetNet architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] (see
   Section 4), this document (this revision) only considers the
   Centralized Network / Distributed User Model out of the models
   specified by [IEEE8021Qcc].  That is, there is a User-Network
   Interface (UNI) between an end system and a network.  Furthermore,
   there is a central entity for the control of the network.  For

   instance, the central entity implements a Path Computation Element
   (PCE) for the calculation and establishment of paths needed for
   packet replication and elimination, if any.

2.1.  Goals

   As it is expressed in the Charter [IETFDetNet], the DetNet WG
   collaborates with IEEE 802.1 TSN in order to define a common
   architecture for both Layer 2 and Layer 3, which is beneficial for
   various reasons, e.g., in order to simplify implementations.  The
   flow and service information models should be also common along those
   lines.  As the TSN flow information/data model specified by
   [IEEE8021Qcc] is mature, the DetNet flow and service information
   models described in this document are based on [IEEE8021Qcc], which
   is an amendment to [IEEE8021Q].

   This document intends to specify flow and service information models
   only.

2.2.  Non Goals

   This document (this revision) does not intend to specify either flow
   data model or DetNet configuration.  From these aspects, the goals of
   this document differ from the goals of [IEEE8021Qcc], which also
   specifies data model and configuration of certain TSN features.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The lowercase forms with an initial capital "Must", "Must Not",
   "Shall", "Shall Not", "Should", "Should Not", "May", and "Optional"
   in this document are to be interpreted in the sense defined in
   [RFC2119], but are used where the normative behavior is defined in
   documents published by SDOs other than the IETF.

4.  Terminology and Definitions

   This document uses the terminology established in Section 2 of the
   DetNet architecture document [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  The
   DetNet <=> TSN dictionary of [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] is used
   to perform translation from [IEEE8021Qcc] to this document.
   Application level flows (app-flow) can be L2 or L3 flows, what may
   impact what header fields are use in order to identify a flow.
   DetNet flows are created by proper DetNet encapsulation of app-
   flow(s) (e.g., with added MPLS labels, etc.).  In some scenarios App-

   flow and DetNet flow looks similar on the wire (e.g., L3 App-flow
   over a DetNet IP network).

5.  Naming Conventions

   The following naming conventions were used for naming information
   model components in this document.  It is recommended that extensions
   of the model use the same conventions.

   o  Names SHOULD be descriptive.

   o  Names MUST start with uppercase letters.

   o  Composed names MUST use capital letters for the first letter of
      each component.  All other letters are lowercase, even for
      acronyms.  Exceptions are made for acronyms containing a mixture
      of lowercase and capital letters, such as IPv6.  Examples are
      SourceMacAddress and DestinationIPv6Address.

6.  Service model

6.1.  Service overview

   The DetNet service can be defined as a service that provides a
   capability to carry a unicast or a multicast data flow for an
   application with constrained requirements on network performance,
   e.g., low packet loss rate and/or latency.

   The simplest DetNet service is to provide bridging over the DN domain
   (i.e., tunneling for L2), where the connected hosts are in the same
   broadcast (BC) domain.  Forwarding over the DetNet domain is based on
   L2 (MAC) addresses (i.e. dst-MAC).  Somewhat more sophisticated is
   DetNet Routing service that provides routing, so available only for
   L3 hosts that are in different BC domains.  Forwarding over the
   DetNet domain is based on L3 (IP) addresses (i.e. dst-IP).

   Figure 5. and Figure 8. in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] show the
   DetNet service related reference points and main components.

6.2.  Service parameters

   A DetNet network receives DetNet flows via a UNI as shown in Figure 5
   in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  The DetNet network connects the
   UNIs via tunnels in order to provide DetNet service as shown in
   Figure 8 in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   The DetNet service attributes are the following:

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model           March 2019


   o  Service type
      It is the flow type (L2 or L3) using the DetNet service.

   o  Bandwidth
      It is the minimum bandwidth guaranteed for the DetNet service.

   o  Delay parameters
      The are two delay parameters for a DetNet service:

      *  Maximum latency, which is the maximum end-to-end one-way
         latency for the DetNet service.

      *  Packet Delay Variation (PDV), which is the difference between
         the minimum and the maximum end-to-end one-way latency.  The
         PDV parameter describes the maximum packet delay variation for
         the DetNet service.  (Note that PDV is sometimes referred to as
         jitter.)

   o  Loss parameters


      *  The maximum Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) parameter describes the
         maximum packet loss ratio for the DetNet service between the
         edges of the DetNet network.

      *  Some applications have special loss requirement.  The maximum
         consecutive loss tolerance parameter describes the maximum
         number of consecutive packets whose loss can be tolerated.  The
         maximum consecutive loss tolerance can be measured based on
         sequence number.

   o  Maximum allowed misordering
      Maximum allowed misordering describes the tolerable maximum number
      of packets that can be received out of order.  The maximum allowed
      misordering can be measured based on sequence number.  The value
      zero for the maximum allowed misordering indicates that in order
      delivery is required, misordering cannot be tolerated.

   o  Connectivity type
      Two connectivity types are distinguished: point-to-point (p2p) and
      point-to-multipoint (p2mp).  Connectivity type p2mp is created by
      a transport layer function (e.g., p2mp LSP).  (Note: mp2mp
      connectivity is a superposition of p2mp connections.)

   o  Service rank
      Service rank provides the rank of a service instance relative to
      other services in the network.  Rank is used by the network in
      case of network resource limitation scenarios.

6.3.  Reference Points

   From service model design perspective a fundamental question is the
   location of the service endpoints, i.e., where the service starts and
   ends.

               Figure 2: FIGURE Placeholder Reference Points

   Note: Further discussion is needed based on data plane encapsulation
   results what reference points should be defined.  Only some possible
   examples listed here:

   o  App-flow endpoint: End system's internal reference point for the
      native data flow.

   o  DetNet-UNI: UNI interface ("U") on a DetNet edge node.

   o  DetNet-NNI: NNI interface ("N") between DetNet domains.

   [[NOTE: Contributions are welcome whether we should define or
   distinguish internal reference point(s) for DetNet-aware end-systems
   as well. ]]

   DetNet-UNI and DetNet-NNI are assumed in this document to be packet-
   based reference points and provide connectivity over the packet
   network and between domains.  A DetNet-UNI may add networking
   technology specific encapsulation to the data flow in order to
   transport it over the network.

   [[NOTE: Differences between the service over end-systems internal
   reference points and DetNet-UNI is for further discussions.  For
   example, in-order delivery is expected in end system internal
   reference points, whereas it is considered optional over the DetNet-
   UNI. ]]

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model           March 2019


6.4.  Service scenarios

   Using the above defined reference points, two major service scenarios
   can be identified:

   o  End-to-End-Service: the service reaches out to final source or
      destination nodes, so it is an e2e service between application
      hosting devices (end systems).

   o  DetNet-Service: the service connects networking islands, so it is
      a service between the borders of network domain(s).

   [[NOTE: we may consider to define further scenarios based on the
   result of reference point related discussions. ]]

7.  End System and DetNet domain

   Deterministic service is required by time/loss sensitive
   application(s) running on an end system during communication with its
   peer(s).  Such a data exchange has various requirements on delay and/
   or loss parameters.

   The DetNet architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] distinguishes
   two kinds of end systems: Source and Destination.  The same
   distinction is applied for the DetNet flow information model.  In
   addition to the end systems interested in a flow, the status
   information of the flow is also important.  Therefore, the DetNet
   flow information model relies on three high level groups:

   o  Source: an end system capable of sourcing a DetNet flow.  The
      Source information group includes elements that specify the Source
      for a single flow.  This information group is applied from the
      user to the network.

   o  Destination: an end system that is a destination of a DetNet flow.
      The Destination information group includes elements that specify
      the Destination for a single flow.  This information group is
      applied from the user to the network.

   o  Flow-Status: the status of a DetNet flow.  The status information
      group includes elements that specify the status of the flow in the
      network.  This information group is applied from the network to
      the user.  This information group informs the user whether or not
      the flow is ready for use.

   From service perspective two kinds of edge nodes can be
   distinguished: Ingress and Egress.  In addition the technology of the
   DetNet domain and the status of the service are also important.

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model           March 2019


   Therefore, the DetNet service information model relies on four high
   level groups:

   o  Ingress: an edge system receiving a DetNet flow from a Source.
      The Ingress information group includes elements that specify the
      entry point for a single flow.  This information group is applied
      from the network to the user.

   o  Egress: an edge system sending traffic towards a Destination of a
      DetNet flow.  The Egress information group includes elements that
      specify the egress point for a single flow.  This information
      group is applied from the network to the user.

   o  DetNet Domain: an administrative domain providing the DetNet
      service.  The DetNet domain information group includes elements
      that specify the forwarding capabilities and methods for a single
      flow.  This information group is applied within the network.

   o  Service-Status: the status of a DetNet service.  The status
      information group includes elements that specify the status of the
      service specific state of the network.  This information group is
      applied from the network to the user.  This information group
      informs the user whether or not the service is ready for use.

   There are three operations for each flow with respect to a Source or
   a Destination (and an Ingress or an Egress):

   o  Join: Source/Destination request to join the flow.

   o  Leave: Source/Destination request to leave the flow.

   o  Modify: Source/Destination request to change the flow.

   Modify operation can be considered to address cases when a flow is
   slightly changed, e.g., only MaxPayloadSize (Section 8.2) has been
   changed.  The advantage of having a Modify is that it allows to
   initiate a change of flow spec while leaving the current flow is
   operating until the change is accepted.  If there is no linkage
   between the Join and the Leave, then in figuring out whether the new
   flow spec can be supported, the central entity has to assume that the
   resources committed to the current flow are in use.  Via Modify the
   central entity knows that the resources supporting the current flow
   can be available for supporting the altered flow.  Modify is
   considered to be an optional operation due to possible control-plane
   limitations.

   As the DetNet UNI can provide service for both L3 and L2 app-flows,
   end systems may not need to implement the L3 <=> L2 Transfer Function

   specified by [IEEE8021CB] (see, e.g., subclause 6.3; see also
   subclause 46.1 in [IEEE8021Qcc]).  A DetNet edge node may implement a
   function similar to the Transfer Function, see, e.g., the Svc Proxy
   in Figure 3 in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

8.  DetNet flows

   The app-flows leveraging DetNet service can be unicast or multicast
   data flows of an application with constrained requirements on network
   performance, e.g., low packet loss rate and/or latency.  Flows can
   require different connectivity types: point-to-point (p2p) or point-
   to-multipoint (p2mp).  The p2mp connectivity is created by a
   transport layer function (e.g., p2mp LSP)
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-mpls].  (Note that mp2mp connectivity is a
   superposition of p2mp connections.)

   Many flows using DetNet service are periodic with fix packet size
   (i.e., Constant Bit Rate (CBR) flows), or periodic with variable
   packet size.

   Delay and loss parameters are correlated because the effect of late
   delivery can result data loss for an application.  However, not all
   applications require hard limits on both parameters (delay and loss).
   For example, some real-time applications allow graceful degradation
   if loss happens (e.g., sample-based processing, media distribution).
   Some others may require high-bandwidth connections that make the
   usage of techniques like packet replication economically challenging
   or even impossible.  Some applications may not tolerate loss, but are
   not delay sensitive (e.g., bufferless sensors).  Time/loss sensitive
   applications may have somewhat special requirements especially for
   loss (e.g., no loss in two consecutive communication cycles; very low
   outage time, etc.).

   Flows have the following attributes:

   a.  DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1)

   b.  TrafficSpecification (Section 8.2)

   c.  FlowRank (Section 8.3)

   Flow attributes are described in the following sections.

8.1.  Identification and Specification of Flows

   Identification options for DetNet flows at the UNI and within the
   DetNet domain are specified as follows; see Section 8.1.1 for DetNet

   L3 flows (at UNI), Section 8.1.2 for DetNet L2 flows (at UNI) and
   Section 8.1.3 for DetNetwork flows (within the network).

8.1.1.  IP flow Identification and Specification at UNI

   L3 data flows can be identified and specified by the following
   attributes:

   a.  SourceIpAddress

   b.  DestinationIpAddress

   c.  IPv6FlowLabel

   d.  Dscp

   e.  Protocol

   f.  SourcePort

   g.  DestinationPort

8.1.2.  L2 Flow Identification and Specification at UNI

   L2 data flows can be identified and specified by the following
   attributes:

   a.  DestinationMacAddress

   b.  SourceMacAddress

   c.  Pcp

   d.  VlanId

   e.  EtherType

   Note: The Multiple Stream Registration Protocol (MSRP) [IEEE8021Q]
   uses StreamID to match Talker registrations with their corresponding
   Listener registrations, i.e., to identify Streams (L2 TSN flows).
   The StreamID includes the following subcomponents:

   o  A 48-bit MAC Address associated with the Talker sourcing the
      stream to the bridged network.

   o  A 16-bit unsigned integer value, Unique ID, used to distinguish
      among multiple streams sourced by the same Talker.

8.1.3.  DetNet Flow Identification and Specification

   Identification of DetNet flows within the DetNet domain are used in
   the service information model.  The attributes are specific to the
   forwarding paradigm within the DetNet domain.  DetNetwork flows can
   be identified and specified by the following attributes:

   a.  SourceIpAddress

   b.  DestinationIpAddress

   c.  IPv6FlowLabel

   d.  DSCP

   e.  Protocol

   f.  SourcePort

   g.  DestinationPort

   h.  MplsLabel

8.2.  Traffic Specification

   TrafficSpecification specifies how the Source transmits packets for
   the flow.  This is effectively the promise/request of the Source to
   the network.  The network uses this traffic specification to allocate
   resources and adjust queue parameters in network nodes.

   TrafficSpecification has the following attributes:

   a.  Interval: the period of time in which the traffic specification
       cannot be exceeded.

   b.  MaxPacketsPerInterval: the maximum number of packets that the
       Source will transmit in one Interval.

   c.  MaxPayloadSize: the maximum payload size that the Source will
       transmit.

   [[NOTE (to be removed from a future revision): These attributes can
   be used to describe any type of traffic (e.g., CBR, VBR, etc.) and
   can be used during resource allocation to represent worst case
   scenarios.  Further optional attributes can be considered to achieve
   more efficient resource allocation.  Such optional attributes might
   be worth for flows with soft requirements (i.e., the flow is only
   loss sensitive or only delay sensitive, but not both delay-and-loss



Farkas, et al.         Expires September 12, 2019              [Page 13]

   sensitive).  Possible options how to extend TrafficSpecification
   attributes is for further discussion.  Identified options are
   described in the following notes.]]

   [[NOTE1: Based on the already defined attributes the most similar
   additional attributes for VBR type flows can be defined as follows:

   o  AveragePacketsPerInterval: the average number of packets that the
      Source will transmit in one Interval.

   o  AveragePayloadSize: the average payload size that the Source will
      transmit.

   ]]

   [[NOTE2: another alternative to deal better with various traffic
   types can rely on [RFC6003], which describes the support of Metro
   Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic parameters for using for
   resource reservation purposes.  Such a Bandwidth Profile can be also
   adapted to describe the set of traffic parameters for a Detnet flow.
   Committed Rate indicates the rate at which traffic commits to be sent
   by the source (described in terms of the CIR (Committed Information
   Rate) and CBS (Committed Burst Size) attributes.)  Excess Rate
   indicates the extent by which the traffic sent by the source exceeds
   the committed rate.  The Excess Rate is described in terms of the EIR
   (Excess Information Rate) and EBS (Excess Burst Size) attributes. ]]

   [[NOTE3: a third alternative is to define application based traffic
   models such as [GPP22885] defines periodic and event-driven traffic
   model, and 5G PPP work defines traffic model for MTC (Machine Type
   Communication) use cases [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  Periodic
   traffic type is usually for status update between devices or devices
   transmit status report to a central unit in regular basis.
   TrafficPeriod, defines the period of the status update message.
   DataSize, defines the data size of the massage which is constant.
   3GPP also defines approximately-periodic transmission with variations
   on period and uncertainty in the time arrival of the packets.  Event-
   triggered traffic type corresponds traffic being triggered by an MTC
   device event.  MinIntervalBetweenEvent, defines the minimum interval
   between two events.  Event-triggered transmission will not happen all
   the time, whenever an alert is sent, it waits until the issue being
   solved to be able to send another alert.  MaxPacketPerEvent, defines
   the max number of packets within one message. ]]

8.3.  Flow Rank

   FlowRank provides the rank of this flow relative to other flows in
   the network.  This rank is used to determine success/failure of flow
   establishment.  Rank (boolean) is used by the network to decide which
   flows can and cannot exist when network resources reach their limit.
   Rank is used to help to determine which flows can be dropped (i.e.,
   removed from node configuration) if a port of a node becomes
   oversubscribed (e.g., due to network reconfiguration).  The true
   value is more important than the false value (i.e., flows with false
   are dropped first).

9.  Source

   The Source object specifies:

   o  The behavior of the Source for the flow (how/when the Source
      transmits).

   o  The requirements of the Source from the network.

   o  The capabilities of the interface(s) of the Source.

   The Source object includes the following attributes:

   a.  DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1)

   b.  TrafficSpecification (Section 8.2)

   c.  FlowRank (Section 8.3)

   d.  EndSystemInterfaces (Section 11.1)

   e.  InterfaceCapabilities (Section 11.2)

   f.  UserToNetworkRequirements (Section 11.3)

   For the join operation, the DataFlowSpecification, FlowRank,
   EndSystemInterfaces, and TrafficSpecification SHALL be included
   within the Source.  For the join operation, the
   UserToNetworkRequirements and InterfaceCapabilities groups MAY be
   included within the Source.

   For the leave operation, the DataFlowSpecification and
   EndSystemInterfaces SHALL be included within the Source.

   For the modify operation, the same object SHALL and MAY included as
   for the join operation.

10.  Destination

   The Destination object includes the following attributes:

   a.  DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1)

   b.  EndSystemInterfaces (Section 11.1)

   c.  InterfaceCapabilities (Section 11.2)

   d.  UserToNetworkRequirements (Section 11.3)

   For the join operation, the DataFlowSpecification and
   EndSystemInterfaces SHALL be included within the Destination.  For
   the join operation, the UserToNetworkRequirements and
   InterfaceCapabilities groups MAY be included within the Destination.

   For the leave operation, the DataFlowSpecification and
   EndSystemInterfaces SHALL be included within the Destination.

   For the modify operation, the same object SHALL and MAY included as
   for the join operation.

   [[NOTE (to be removed from a future revision): Adding a general
   EndpointRank?  That would define the endpoint importance (source,
   destination).  It is only partly covered by FlowRank ...  For
   example, it could distinguish the importance of Destinations if the
   flow cannot be provided for all Destinations.]]

11.  Common Attributes of Source and Destination

   Source and Destination end systems have the following common
   attributes in addition to DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1).

11.1.  End System Interfaces

   EndSystemInterfaces is a list of identifiers, one for each physical
   interface (port) in the end system acting as a Source or Destination.
   An interface is identified by an IP or a MAC address.

   EndSystemInterfaces can refer also to logical sub-Interfaces if
   supported by the end system, e.g., based on IfIndex parameter.

11.2.  Interface Capabilities

   InterfaceCapabilities specifies the network capabilities of all
   interfaces (ports) contained in the EndSystemInterfaces object
   (Section 11.1).  These capabilities may be configured via the

   InterfaceConfiguration object (Section 15.2) of the Status object
   (Section 15).

   Note that an end system may have multiple interfaces with different
   network capabilities.  In this case, each interface should be
   specified in a distinct top-level Source or Destination object (i.e.,
   one entry in EndSystemInterfaces (Section 11.1)).  Use of multiple
   entries in EndSystemInterfaces is intended for network capabilities
   that span multiple interfaces (e.g., packet replication and
   elimination).";.

   InterfaceCapabilities attributes:

   a.  SubInterfaceCapable (sub-interface capable)

   b.  PREF-Capable (packet replication and elimination capable)

   c.  POF-Capable (packet ordering capable)

   [[NOTE (to be removed from a future revision): InterfaceCapabilities
   attributes are to be defined.  For information, [IEEE8021Qcc]
   specifies the following attributes:

   o  VlanTagCapable (Customer VLAN Tag capable)

   o  CB-Capable (frame replication and elimination capable)

   o  CB-StreamIdenTypeList (a list of the optional Stream
      Identification types supported by the interface as specified in
      [IEEE8021CB].)

   o  CB-SequenceTypeList (a list of the optional Sequence Encode/Decode
      types supported by the interface as specified in [IEEE8021CB].)

   ]]

11.3.  User to Network Requirements

   UserToNetworkRequirements specifies user requirements for the flow,
   such as latency and reliability.

   The UserToNetworkRequirements object includes the following
   attributes:

   a.  MaxLatency

   MaxLatency is the maximum latency from Source to Destination(s) for a
   single packet of the flow.  MaxLatency is specified as an integer



Farkas, et al.         Expires September 12, 2019              [Page 17]

   number of nanoseconds.  When this requirement is specified by the
   Source, it must be satisfied for all Destinations.  When this
   requirement is specified by a Destination, it must be satisfied for
   that particular Destination only.  If the UserToNetworkRequirements
   group is not provided within the Source or Destination object, then
   value zero SHALL be used for this element.  Value zero represents a
   special use for the maximum latency requirement.  Value zero locks-
   down the initial latency that the network provides in the
   AccumulatedLatency parameter of the Status object (Section 15) after
   the successful configuration of the flow, such that any subsequent
   increase in the latency beyond that initial value causes the flow to
   fail.

   [[NOTE-1 (to be removed from a future revision): Should we add a
   parameter to specify the maximum packet loss rate that can be
   tolerated for the flow?]]

   [[NOTE-2 (to be removed from a future revision): TrafficSpecification
   (Section 8.2) specifies the Peak Information Rate (PIR) of the flow,
   which is a kind of user requirement to the network.  Should we add
   Committed Information Rate (CIR), i.e., the minimum rate the user
   requests to be guaranteed for the flow by the network?]]

14.  DetNet Domain

   The DetNet Domain may change the encapsulation of a DetNet L2 or L3
   flow at the UNI.  That impacts not only how a flow can be recognised
   inside the DetNet domain but also the resource reservation
   calculations.

   The DetNet Domain object specifies:

   o  The behavior of the flow (how/when it is transmited).

   o  The requirements of the flow from the network.

   o  The capabilities of the DetNet domain.

   The DetNet domain object includes the following attributes:

   a.  DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1)

   b.  TrafficSpecification (Section 8.2)

   c.  ServiceRank (Section 16)

   d.  DetnetDomainCapabilities (Section 14.1)

   e.  UserToNetworkRequirements (Section 11.3)

14.1.  DetNet Domain Capabilities

   DetnetDomainCapabilities specifies the network capabilities, which
   can be used to provide DetNet service.  DetNet Edge nodes may change
   the encapsulation of a flow according to the data plane used inside
   the DetNet domain.

   DetnetDomainCapabilities object includes the following attributes:

   a.  EncapsulationFormat (data plane specific encapsulation)

   b.  PREF-Capable (packet replication and elimination capable)

15.  Flow-status

   The FlowStatus object is provided by the network each Source and
   Destination of the flow.  The Status object provides the status of
   the flow with respect to the establishment of the flow by the
   network.  The Status object is delivered via the corresponding UNI to
   each Source and Destination end system of the flow.  The Status is
   distinct for each Source or Destination because the
   AccumulatedLatency and InterfaceConfiguration objects are distinct,
   see below.

   The Status object SHALL include the attributes a), b), c); and MAY
   include attributes d), e):

   a.  DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1)

   b.  StatusInfo (Section 15.1)

   c.  AccumulatedLatency (this section below)

   d.  InterfaceConfiguration (Section 15.2)

   e.  FailedInterfaces (Section 15.3)





Farkas, et al.         Expires September 12, 2019              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model           March 2019


   DataFlowSpecification identifies the flow for which status is
   provided.  DataFlowSpecification is described in (Section 8.1) If the
   Status object is provided without a Source or Destination object in a
   protocol message via a UNI, then the DataFlowSpecification object
   SHALL be included within the Status object for both join and leave
   operations.  If the Status object immediately follows a Source or
   Destination object in the protocol message, then the
   DataFlowSpecification object is obtained from the Source/Destination
   object, and therefore DataFlowSpecification is not required within
   the Status object.

   AccumulatedLatency provides the worst-case latency that a single
   packet of the flow can encounter along its current path(s) in the
   network.  When provided to a Source, AccumulatedLatency is the worst-
   case latency for all Destinations (worst path).  AccumulatedLatency
   is specified as an integer number of nanoseconds.  Latency is
   measured using the time at which the data frame's message timestamp
   point passes the reference plane marking the boundary between the
   network media and PHY.  The message timestamp point is specified by
   IEEE Std 802.1AS [IEEE8021AS] for various media.  For a successful
   Status, the network returns a value less than or equal to the
   MaxLatency of the UserToNetworkRequirements (Section 11.3).  If the
   NumReplicationTrees of the UserToNetworkRequirements (Section 11.3)
   is one, then the AccumlatedLatency SHALL provide the worst latency
   for the current path from the Source to each Destination.  If the
   path is changed (e.g., due to rerouting), then the AccumulatedLatency
   changes accordingly.  If the NumReplicationTrees of the
   UserToNetworkRequirements (Section 11.3) is greater than one,
   AccumlatedLatency SHALL provide the worst latency for all paths in
   use from the Source to each Destination.

15.1.  Status Info

   StatusInfo provides information regarding the status of a flow's
   configuration in the network.

   The StatusInfo object MAY include the following attributes:

   a.  SourceStatus is an enumeration for the status of the flow's
       Source:

       *  None: no Source

       *  Ready: Source is ready

       *  Failed: Source failed

Internet-Draft        DetNet Flow Information Model           March 2019


   b.  DestinationStatus is an enumeration for the status of the flow's
       Destinations:

       *  None: no Destination

       *  Ready: all Destinations are ready

       *  PartialFailed: One or more Destinations ready, and one or more
          Listeners failed.  The flow can be used if the Source is
          Ready.

       *  Failed: All Destinations failed.

   c.  FailureCode: A non-zero code that specifies the problem if the
       flow encounters a failure (e.g., packet replication and
       elimination is requested but not possible, or SourceStatus is
       Failed, or DestinationStatus is Failed, or DestinationStatus is
       PartialFailed).

   [[NOTE (to be removed from a future revision): FailureCodes to be
   defined for DetNet.  Table 46-1 of [IEEE8021Qcc] describes TSN
   failure codes.]]

15.2.  Interface Configuration

   InterfaceConfiguration provides information about of interfaces in
   the Source/Destination.  This configuration related information
   assists the network in meeting the requirements of the flow.  The
   InterfaceConfiguration object is according to the capabilities of the
   interface.  InterfaceConfiguration can be distinct for each Source or
   Destination of each flow.  If the InterfaceConfiguration object is
   not provided within the Status object, then the network SHALL assume
   zero elements as the default (no interface configuration).

   The InterfaceConfiguration object MAY include one or more the
   following attributes:

   a.  MAC or IP Address to identify the interface

   b.  DataFlowSpecification (Section 8.1)

15.3.  Failed Interfaces

   FailedInterfaces provides a list of one or more physical interfaces
   (ports) in the failed node when a failure occurs in the network.

   The FailedInterface object includes the following attributes:

   a.  MAC or IP Address to identify the interface

   b.  InterfaceName

   InterfaceName is the name of the interface (port) within the node.
   This interface name SHALL be persistent, and unique within the node.

16.  Service Rank

   ServiceRank provides the rank of this service instance relative to
   other services in the network.  This rank is used to determine
   success/failure of service instance establishment.  Rank (boolean) is
   used by the network to decide which services can and cannot exist
   when network resources reach their limit.  Rank is used to help to
   determine which services can be dropped (i.e., removed from node
   configuration) if a port of a node becomes oversubscribed (e.g., due
   to network reconfiguration).  The true value is more important than
   the false value (i.e., services with false are dropped first).

   [[NOTE: relationship between ServiceRank and FlowRank needs further
   discussions.  A 1:N relationship is assumed (a service instance can
   serv multiple flows).  This sub-section is considered to move to the
   service related sections. ]]
