Abstract 

   This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header [1] to include in a BYE 
   Method Request [2] as a result of a session preemption event either 
   at a user agent (UA), or somewhere in the network using RSVP [3].  
   This document does not attempt to address routers failing in the 
   packet path; but a deliberate event of tearing down a flow between 
   UAs.

1.0  Introduction

   With the introduction of the Resource-Priority (R-P) header [4], 
   there became the possibility of sessions being torn down for 
   (scarce) resource reasons; meaning there weren't enough resources 
   for a particular session to continue.  Certain domains will 
   implement this mechanism where resources may become constrained 
   either at the user agent (UA), or for congested router interfaces 
   where more important sessions are to be completed at the expense of 
   less important sessions.  Which sessions are more or less important 
   than others will not be discussed here.  What is proposed here is 
   extending SIP to synchronize SIP elements as to why a preemption 
   event occurred and which type of preemption event occurred, as 
   viewed by the element that performed the preemption of a session. 

   The Reason Header is an application layer feedback mechanism to 
   synchronize SIP elements of events; the particular event explained 
   here deals with preemption of a session.  Q.850 [5] provides an 
   indication for preemption (cause=8) and for preemption "circuit 
   reserved for reuse" (cause=9).  Q.850 Cause=9 does not apply to IP 
   because IP has no concept of circuits. Some domains wish to 
   differentiate appropriate IP reasons for preemption of sessions and 
   topologically where the preemption event occurred.  No other means 
   exists today to give this feedback as to why a session was torn down
   for preemption grounds.


Polk                                                           [Page 2]

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004


   In the event that a session is terminated for a specific reason that
   can (or should) be shared with SIP Servers and UAs, the Reason 
   Header [1] was created to be included in the BYE Request.  This was 
   not the only Method for this new Header; [1] also discusses the 
   CANCEL Method usage. 

   This document will define two use-cases in which new preemption 
   Reason values are necessary:


      Access Preemption Event - this is when a UA receives a new SIP 
             session request message with a valid R-P value that is 
             higher than the one associated with the currently active 
             session at that UA.  The UA must discontinue the existing 
             session in order to accept the new one (based on local 
             policy of some domains).

      Network Preemption Event - this is when a network element - such 
             as a router - reaches capacity on a particular interface 
             and has the ability to statefully choose which sessions 
             will remain active when a new session/reservation is 
             signaled for under the parameters of RSVP in [3] that 
             would otherwise overload that interface (perhaps adversely
             affecting all sessions).  In this case, the router must 
             terminate one or more reservations of lower priority in 
             order to allow this higher priority reservation access to 
             the requested amount of bandwidth (based on local policy 
             of some domains).

   This document will cover the semantics for these two cases, and 
   request IANA registration two new Reason Header values for the above
   preemption conditions.

1.2  Changes from the Individual Submission Version -00

   The following is a list of changes that have been made to this 
   document from the Individual Submission Version -00:

   - Changed the proposed indication from a new token (as defined by 
     RFC 3326) to proposing a new namespace ("preemption") with cause 
     values for each type of occurrence;


Polk                                                           [Page 3]

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004


   - Changed the notion of the "preempted_network" value - which could 
     mean anything not at the endpoint to "RSVP_Preemption" because 
     this more accurately reflects the signaling behavior of the type 
     of event explained here;

   - Added the contributions and acknowledgements sections for those 
     who have provided much help with this effort

   - Added an IPR section to this document;


2.0 Access Preemption Events 

   As mentioned previously, Access Preemption Events (APE) occur at 
   the user agent.  It doesn't matter which UA in a unicast or 
   multicast session this happens to (the UAC or UAS of a session).  If
   local policy dictates in a particular domain, rules regarding the 
   functionality of a UA, there must be a means by which that UA (not 
   the user) informs the other UA(s) why a session was just torn down 
   prematurely.  The appropriate mechanism is to utilize the BYE 
   Method.  The user of the other far side UA will not understand why 
   that session "just went away" without there being a means of 
   informing the UA what occurred (if this event was purposeful), and 
   why it occurred.  Through this type of indication to the preempted 
   UA, it can indicate to the user of that device appropriately. 

   The rules within a domain surrounding informing of UA can be 
   different than the rules of informing the user. Local policy should 
   determine if the user should be informed of the specific reason. 
   This indication in SIP will provide a means for the UA to react in a
   locally determined way if appropriate (play a certain tone or tone 
   sequence, point towards a special announcement uri, etc).

   The following diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the scenario here.  UA1
   invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3 
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this domain).

       Figure 1. Access Preemption with obscure Reason       
                                                             

   After the session between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites 
   UA2 to a new session with an R-P of 2 (a higher priority than the 
   current session between UA1 and UA2).  Local policy within this 
   domain dictates that UA2 MUST preempt all existing calls of lower 
   priority in order to accept a higher priority call.

   What Reason value could be inserted above to mean "preemption" at a 
   UA?  There are several choices: 410 "Gone", 480 "Temporarily 
   Unavailable", 486 "Busy Here", and 503 "Service Unavailable".  The 
   use of any here is questionable because the session is already 
   established.  It is further complicated if there needs to be a 
   difference in the Reason value for an Access versus a Network 
   Preemption Event (which is a requirement here).  The limits of Q.850
   [5] have been stated previously in this document.

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004

2.1  Effects of Preemption at the User Agent

   If 2 UAs are in a session, and one UA must preempt that session to 
   accept another session, a BYE Method message is the appropriate 
   mechanism to perform this task.  However, taking this a step 
   further, if a UA is the common point of a 3-way (or more) adhoc 
   conference participants and must preempt all sessions in that 
   conference due to a higher priority session request received (that 
   this UA must accept), then a BYE message MUST be sent to all UAs in 
   that adhoc conference.


2.2  Reason Header Requirements for Access Preemption Events

   The following is a list of requirements for adding an appropriate 
   Reason value for an Access Preemption Event (APE) as described above
   and shown in Figure 1:

      APE_REQ#1 - create a means by which one UA can inform another UA 
                  (within the same active session) that the active 
                  session between the two devices is being purposely 
                  preempted at one UA for a higher priority session 
                  request from another UA.

      APE_REQ#2 - create a means by which all relevant SIP elements can
                  be informed of this Access Preemption Event to a 
                  specific session.

   For example: perhaps SIP Servers that have incorporated a Record-
   Route header into that session set-up.

      APE_REQ#3 - create a means of informing all participants in a 
                  adhoc conference that the primary UA (the mixer) has 
                  preempted the conference by accepting a higher 
                  priority session request.

      APE_REQ#4 - create a separate indication for the access 
                  preemption event than any used for a Network 
                  Preemption Event (described in the next section) in 
                  the session BYE message.


3.0 Network Preemption Events

   Network Preemption Events (NPE) are those instances in which a 
   intermediate router between SIP elements preempts one or more 
   session(s) at one of its interfaces to place a higher priority 
   session through that interface. Within RSVP, there exists a means to
   execute this functionality in [7]: ResvErr messages - which travel 
   downstream towards appropriate receivers.  The ResvErr message has 
   the ability to carry within it a code why a reservation is being 


Polk                                                           [Page 6]

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004

   torn down.  The ResvErr does not travel upstream to the other UA.  
   This document here proposes a SIP message be generated to 
   synchronize all relevant SIP elements to this preemption event.  
   Creating another Reason value describing that a network element 
   preempted the session is necessary in certain domains. 

   The following 2 diagrams (Figure 2 and 3) illustrate the network 
   preemption scenario:  

   UA1 invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3 
   (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this domain) and is accepted.  The 
   link between Router 1 and Router 2 became saturated with this 
   session between UA1 and UA2 (in this example).  

          UA1                                  UA2           
             \                                /              
              \                              /               
               +--------+          +--------+                
               |        |          |        |                
               | RTR1   |          |  RTR2  |                
               |       Int7-------Int5      |                
               |        |          |        |                
               +--------+          +--------+                
              /                              \               
             /                                \              
          UA3                                  UA4           
                                                             
             Figure 2. Network Diagram Scenario A            
                

   After the session between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites 
   UA4 to a new session with an Resource Priority level of 2 (a higher 
   priority than the current session between UA1 and UA2).  When this 
   second (higher priority session) is signaled, the Path message goes 
   from UA3 to UA4, resulting in the Resv message going from UA4 back 
   to UA3.  Because this link between the two routers is congested (at 
   Interface 5 in Figure 2), Router 2 will (in this example) preempt 
   lower priority BW to ensure this higher priority session is 
   completed.  A ResvErr message is sent to UA1.  The result is that 
   UA1 will know that there has been a preemption event in a router 
   (because the ResvErr message has a error code within it stating 
   "preemption"), UA2 at this point will not know anything other than 
   its reservation went away.  If there are any SIP Proxies in between 
   the 2 UAs (perhaps that inserted a Record-Route Header), each will 
   need to be informed also as to why this reservation was torn down. 

   Figure 3 shows the call flow with Router 2 from Figure 2 included at
   the RSVP layer sending the ResvErr message.  A complete call flow 
   including all UAs and Routers is not shown here for diagram 
   complexity reasons.  The signaling between UA3 and UA4 is also not 
   included.

       Figure 3. Network Preemption with obscure Reason      

   What Reason value could be inserted above to mean "preemption at a 
   router interface"?  There are several choices: 410 "Gone", 480 
   "Temporarily Unavailable", 486 "Busy Here", and 503 "Service 
   Unavailable".  The use of any here is questionable because the 
   session is already established.  It is further complicated if there 
   needs to be a difference in the Reason value for an Access versus a 
   Network Preemption Event.  The limits of Q.850 [5] have already been
   stated previously showing there is nothing in that spec to indicate 
   a problem in an IP network.  

   To generically state that all preemptions are equal is possible, but
   will not provide adequate information.  Therefore, another Reason 
   Header value is necessary to differentiate the APE from the NPE.

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004

3.1  Reason Header Requirements for Network Preemption Events

   The following are the requirements for the appropriate SIP signaling
   in reaction to a Network Preemption Event:

      NPE_REQ#1 - create a means of informing the far end UA that a 
                  Network Preemption Event has occurred in an 
                  intermediate router.

      NPE_REQ#2 - create a means by which all relevant SIP elements can
                  be informed of a Network Preemption Event to a 
                  specific session.

   For example: perhaps SIP Servers that have incorporated a Record-
   Route header into that session set-up.

      NPE_REQ#3 - create a means of informing all participants in a 
                  adhoc conference that the primary UA (the mixer) has 
                  been preempted by a Network Preemption Event.

      NPE_REQ#4 - create a separate description of the Network 
                  Preemption Event relative to an Access Preemption 
                  Event in SIP.


4.0 Preemption Reason Header Cause Codes and Semantics

   We propose the following new protocol value for the protocol field 
   of the Reason header field in RFC 3326 [1]:

      Preemption: The cause parameter contains a preemption cause code

   We define the following preemption cause codes:

   Value    Default Text        Description
     1      UA_Preemption       The session has been preempted by a UA

     2      RSVP_Preemption     The session preemption has been 
                                initiated within the network via a 
                                purposeful RSVP preemption occurrence, 
                                and not a link error 

   Example syntax is as follows:

      Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA_Preemption"
      Reason: preemption ;cause=2 ;text="RSVP_Preemption"

   Sections 4.1 and 4.2 provide use cases for the above two cause 
   codes with message flow diagrams.

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004

4.1 Access Preemption Event Reason Code

   The more elaborate description of the Access Preemption Event 
   cause=1 is as follows:

      A user agent in a session has purposely preempted a session and 
      is informing the far end user agent, or user agents (if part of a
      conference), and SIP Proxies (if stateful of the session's 
      transactions)

   An example usage of this header value would be:


      Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA_Preemption"


4.1.1 Access Preemption Event Call Flow

   The following diagram (Figure 4) replicates the call flow from 
   Figure 1 - but with an appropriate Reason value indication that was 
   proposed in section 4.1 above:

     Figure 4. Access Preemption with Reason : Preemption 

   UA1 invites UA2 to a session with the Resource Priority level of 3 


Polk                                                          [Page 10]

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004

   (levels 1 and 2 are higher is this domain).  After the session 
   between UA1 and UA2 is established, UA3 invites UA2 to a new session
   with an R-P of 2 (a higher priority than the current session to 
   UA1).  Local policy within this domain dictates that UA2 MUST 
   preempt all existing calls of lower priority in order to accept a 
   higher priority call. 

   UA2 sends a BYE Request message with a Reason header with a value: 
   preempted_UA.  This will inform the far end UA (UA1), and all 
   relevant SIP elements (for example: SIP Proxies).  The cause code is
   unique to what is proposed in the RSVP Preemption Event for 
   differentiation purposes.


4.2 Network Preemption Events Reason Code

   The more elaborate description of the RSVP Preemption Event 
   cause=2 is as follows:

      A router has preempted a reservation flow and generated a ResvErr
      (downstream).  The (downstream) UA receiving the ResvErr message 
      generates a BYE request towards the far side UA with a Reason 
      Header with this value indicating that somewhere in between two 
      or more UAs, a layer 3/4 device (router) has administratively 
      preempted this session 

   An example usage of this header value would be:


     Reason: Preemption :cause=2 ;text="RSVP_Preemption"

     Figure 5. Network Preemption with "RSVP_Preemption"        

   Above is the call flow with Router 2 from Figure 2 included at the 
   RSVP layer sending the Resv messages.  A complete call flow 
   including all UAs and Routers is not here for diagram complexity 
   reasons.  The signaling between UA3 and UA4 is also not included.

   Upon receipt of the ResvErr message with the preemption error code, 
   UA1 can now appropriately inform UA2 why this event occurred.  This 
   BYE message will also inform all relevant SIP elements, 
   synchronizing them.  The cause value is unique to that proposed in 
   section 4.1 for Access Preemption Events for differentiation 
   purposes.

Internet Draft         Reason Header for Preemption       Jan 8th, 2004

5.0 Security Considerations

   Eavesdropping on this header field should not prevent proper 
   operation of the SIP protocol, although some domains utilizing this 
   mechanism for notifying and synchronizing SIP elements will likely 
   want the integrity to be assured.  


6.0 IANA Considerations

   RFC [XXXX} (this document) proposes the new SIP "Reason Header" [1] 
   protocol namespace: "Preemption", with 2 defined cause codes:  

      In instances where this namespace is used to indicate preemption 
      at a UA, the following syntax shall be used:

         Reason: preemption ;cause=1 ;text="UA_Preemption"

         Section 4.1 of this document describes in detail the semantics
         of this cause code.

      In instances where this namespace is used to indicate preemption 
      based on receipt of an RSVP ResvErr message at a SIP UA, the 
      following syntax shall be used:

         Reason: preemption ;cause=2 ;text="RSVP_Preemption"

         Section 4.2 of this document describes in detail the semantics
         of this cause code.

   Additional definitions of the preemption namespace cause codes shall
   be defined in Standards Track documents.
