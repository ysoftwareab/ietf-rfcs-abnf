1. Abstract

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends the MPLS control plane to encompass
   time-division, wavelength and spatial switching. A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed to support
   the new types of switching is provided in [GMPLS-SIG]. On the other
   hand, along with the current development on IP over optical
   switching, there are considerable advances in optical transport
   systems based on the multiple optical switching granularities.
   [GMPLS-SIG] currently defines two layers of optical granularity
   (wavelength and fiber). As described in [IPO-MG], a revisited
   definition of waveband switching can be introduced. This document
   presents a functional description of the extensions, to the GMPLS
   protocol suite, to further integrate optical multi-granularity and
   benefit from the features of the corresponding switching layers.

2. Summary for Sub-IP Area

2.1. Summary

   See the Abstract above.

2.2. Where does it fit in the Picture of the Sub-IP Work

   This work fits the CCAMP box.

2.3. Why is it Targeted at this WG

   This draft is targeted at the CCAMP WG, because it specifies the
   extensions to the GMPLS signaling. GMPLS is itself addressed in the
   CCAMP WG.

2.4. Justification of Work

   The WG should consider this document as it specifies the extensions
   to the GMPLS signaling. These extensions are related to the
   definition of waveband switching and the introduction of optical
   multi-granularity.

4. Introduction

   The optical multi-granularity concept relies on technologies working
   at the different switching levels (e.g. wavelength, waveband and
   fiber). In the context of this memo, the granularities considered
   inside optical networks are single wavelengths (Lambda LSP), bundles
   of wavelengths referred to as wavebands (WB LSP), and whole fibers
   (Fiber LSP). One of the key benefits of multi-granularity is to
   simplify the switching procedures of multiple lower order LSPs
   (Lambda LSPs, for instance) by switching these LSPs as a single
   entity or LSP at a higher order (e.g. WB LSP or Fiber LSP). To

   enable such grouping of LSPs, several grooming strategies can be
   employed (either end-to-end or intermediate).

   This memo proposes to extend GMPLS previous set of switching
   capabilities in the optical domain, by identifying uncovered
   characteristics of the optical transport, taking into account
   interest for optical components working at the band level and its
   impact on the control of the optical networks. In the efforts of
   describing the requirements and set of capabilities for optical
   multi-granularity, three approaches to waveband switching have been
   identified:
        - Inverse Multiplexing
        - Wavelength Concatenation
        - Waveband

   The common availability of optical/photonic switching equipment
   capable to work at the band level motivates the redefinition of
   waveband switching as defined in the GMPLS architecture. Current
   definition of waveband switching (see [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG])
   refers to inverse multiplexing mechanism or wavelength concatenation
   (ôcontiguousö lambdas in a trunk defining a logical waveband at the
   control plane level). While this definition is still valid and
   applicable, it does not consider the approach where wavebands have a
   physical significance, i.e. where the interface is WaveBand-Switch
   Capable (WBSC). Physical waveband has the ability to switch directly
   a portion of the frequency spectrum without the need to distinguish
   between its inner components (e.g. wavelengths or even below in
   certain known cases).

   The following document groups the extensions to the GMPLS protocol
   suite required to provide optical multi-granularity (distributed)
   control and particularly the extensions required for waveband
   switching support.

5. Extensions to the GMPLS Architecture and Protocol Suite

5.1. Architecture

   The integration of optical multi-granularity in the GMPLS
   architecture requires some extensions to the definitions it
   currently includes.

   The [GMPLS-ARCH] document considers waveband switching a particular
   case of lambda switching. As specified, a waveband represents a set
   of contiguous wavelengths, which can be switched together. This
   definition of waveband is too restrictive at least on two key
   aspects:
   - The first one is that current definition of waveband implies a
   wavelength composition of the waveband, due to waveband switching by
   wavelength cross-connects (WXC). This definition provides support to
   inverse multiplexing mechanism and wavelength concatenation. This
   approach limits the use of waveband to the wavelength switch capable
   technologies. With waveband switching technologies, the interface

R.Douville et al. - Internet Draft û Expires April 2003              3

draft-douville-ccamp-gmpls-waveband-extensions-03.txt        Oct. 2002


   does not distinguish between the component optical channels, sub-
   channels (i.e. timeslots) or packets on the waveband which is switch
   as a single unit (wide frequency spectrum) like it could be done
   with the fibers (the penultimate frequency spectrum) on photonic
   cross-connect (PXC).
   - The second restrictive point is that the current definition of the
   waveband does not enable intermediate grooming strategies.

   For this purpose, this memo introduces an additional optical
   granularity representing the waveband. This definition is quite
   general and backward compatible, it allows requesting a set of
   contiguous wavelengths (i.e. inverse multiplexing mechanism and
   wavelength concatenation) but also address the "real" waveband
   switching and the corresponding set of capabilities. Therefore, the
   proposed definition better fits into the whole GMPLS architecture.

   Correspondingly, this memo specifies a new type of interface
   switching capable interface: the Waveband-Switch Capable Interface
   (WBSC). The WBSC interface materializes the physical reality of
   optical waveband in the form of an atomic entity or granularity. As
   with the introduction of the waveband switching capable interface, a
   new class of LSP is defined: the WaveBand LSP (WB LSP).

   The below figure illustrates the hierarchy of the (optical)
   switching layers and highlights the optical multi-granularity part.
   The switching element column shows typical (piece of) equipment that
   can be part of the same node and thus simultaneously support such
   interfaces.

     LSP Hierarchy        Interfaces         Switching Element
     -------------        ----------         -----------------

     Lambda LSP (1) <--->    LSC     <---->       WXC    -
                                                          |
       WB LSP (1)   <--->    WBSC    <---->       WBXC     > Optical MG
                                                          |
      Fiber LSP     <--->    FSC     <---->       FXC    -

   (1) WB LSPs can be supported on both Lambda and WaveBand Switch
   Capable interfaces depending on the nature of the waveband being
   requested (inverse multiplexing, wavelength concatenation, and
   physical waveband).

   Note that this representation does not aim at restricting interfaces
   that network elements can support.

5.2 GMPLS Signalling

5.2.1 Generalized Label Request

   To support Waveband LSP request, the values of the LSP Encoding
   Type, the Switching Type and the Generalized PID (G-PID) fields
   included in the Generalized Label Request, are extended.

   The information carried in a Generalized Label Request is:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   LSP Encoding Type: 8 bits

        Indicates the encoding of the LSP being requested. The
        following Value 14 and Type Waveband (Photonic) is added to the
        existing LSP Encoding Type values to provide Waveband LSP
        support:

             Value              Type
             -----              ----
                 1              Packet
                 2              Ethernet
                 3              ANSI/ETSI PDH
                 4              Reserved
                 5              SDH ITU-T G.707 / SONET ANSI T1.105
                 6              Reserved
                 7              Digital Wrapper
                 8              Lambda (photonic)
                 9              Fiber
                10              Reserved
                11              FiberChannel

                13              G.709 Optical Channel
                14              Waveband (Photonic)

        For example, consider an LSP signaled with "WaveBand" encoding.
        It is expected that such an LSP would be supported with no
        electrical conversion and no knowledge of the frequency
        cutting, modulation and speed by the transit nodes. Other
        formats normally require framing knowledge, and field
        parameters are broken into the framing type and speed.

   Switching Type: 8 bits

        Indicates the type of switching that should be performed on a
        particular link. This field is needed for links that advertise
        more than one type of switching capability. For OXC or PXC
        enabling Waveband switching, the WBSC value is used to refer to
        such switching capability. Other values of this field are as
        the Switching Capability field defined in [GMPLS-RTG]

   Generalized PID (G-PID): 16 bits

        An identifier of the payload carried by an LSP, i.e. an
        identifier of the client layer of that LSP.  This is used by

        the nodes at the endpoints of the LSP, and in some cases by the
        penultimate hop.  Standard Ethertype values are used for packet
        and Ethernet LSPs; other values are defined in [GMPLS-SIG].

        A waveband can carry a Lambda LSP while a Waveband LSP can be
        transported on a Fiber LSP, the following additional G-PID
        values must be considered: see [GMPLS-SIG] section 3.1.1 û
        Required Information, paragraph on Generalized-PID

           Value        Type               Technology

            ..          ...                ...
            58          Waveband           Fiber

        In addition the following existing values must be updated in
        order to reflect the transport of Ethernet and SDH/SONET
        payload over a waveband LSP:

            33          Ethernet           SDH, Lambda, Fiber
            34          SDH                Lambda, Waveband, Fiber

            36          Digital Wrapper    Lambda, Waveband, Fiber

5.2.2 Generalized Label

   As currently proposed in [GMPLS-SIG], the waveband label space
   definition is perfectly suitable for waveband switching as proposed
   in this memo and does not require any modification or extension.

5.3. GMPLS Routing

5.3.1 Waveband Interface Switching Capability

   A new WaveBand-Switch Capability (WBSC) value shall be defined to
   identify and distinguish the associated switching capability of a
   link [MPLS-HIER]. If the switching capability of a (TE) link is of
   type WBSC, it means that the node receiving data over this link
   (fiber) can recognize and switch individual WaveBands on this link
   (without distinguishing lambdas, channels or packets).

   Values defined in [GMPLS-RTG] and the one defined in the present
   context gives the following Interface Switching Capabilities list:

                 Packet-Switch Capable-1 (PSC-1)
                 Packet-Switch Capable-2 (PSC-2)
                 Packet-Switch Capable-3 (PSC-3)
                 Packet-Switch Capable-4 (PSC-4)
                 Layer-2 Switch Capable  (L2SC)
                 Time-Division-Multiplex Capable (TDM)
                 Lambda-Switch Capable   (LSC)
                 Waveband-Switch Capable (WBSC)
                 Fiber-Switch Capable    (FSC)

draft-douville-ccamp-gmpls-waveband-extensions-03.txt        Oct. 2002



   Note that the node that is advertising a given link (i.e., the node
   that is transmitting) has to know the switching capabilities at the
   other end of the link (i.e., the receiving end of the link). One way
   to accomplish this is through configuration. Other options to
   accomplish this are outside the scope of this document.

   In brief, if an interface is of type WBSC, it means that the node
   receiving data over this interface can recognize and switch
   wavebands (sets of contiguous lambdas) within the interface as a
   unit (without distinguishing lambdas, sub-channels or packets). On
   the other hand, an interface that allows for waveband switching
   belongs (at least) to the WBSC type.

5.3.2. Interface Switching Capability Descriptor

   For ISIS, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV
   (of type 21) of the extended IS reachability TLV. The length is the
   length of value field in octets.

   For OSPF, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV
   of the Link TLV with type 15. The length is the length of value
   field in octets.

   The common format of the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   is defined in [GMPLS-OSPF] and [GMPLS-ISIS], respectively.

   A new value for the Switching Capability (Switching Cap) field is
   defined here to identify Waveband-Switch Capable (WBSC) interfaces:

        151   Waveband Switching Capable   (WBSC)

   In the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD), when the
   Switching Capability (Switching Cap) field contains the value for
   WBSC, the technology specific information field includes the Minimum
   LSP Bandwidth, which is defined as the number of contiguous
   wavelength constituting a WaveBand entity. Additional technology
   specific information may also be considered such as the channel
   spacing.

5.4. LSP Regions and Forwarding Adjacencies

   The information carried in the Switching Capability field (8 bits)
   of the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) is used to
   construct LSP regions, and determine regionsÆ boundaries as defined
   in [MPLS-HIER].

   The introduction of the new WBSC Interface Switching Capability
   define a new ordering among the switching capabilities: PSC-1 < PSC-
   2 < PSC-3 < PSC-4 < TDM < LSC < WBSC < FSC.

   Path computation may take into account this region boundary when
   computing a path for an LSP. When an LSP need to cross a region

draft-douville-ccamp-gmpls-waveband-extensions-03.txt        Oct. 2002


   boundary, it can trigger the establishment of a Forwarding Adjacency
   LSP (FA-LSP) at the underlying layer. The new cascading of FAs can
   be triggered between layers with the new following obvious order:
   L2SC, then TDM, then LSC, then WBSC and then finally FSC.

6. Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations beyond the one covered in
   RSVP-TE (see [RFC-3209]) and CR-LDP (see [RFC-3212]).
