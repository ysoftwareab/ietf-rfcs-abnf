Abstract

   This document defines conferencing call control features for the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This document builds on the
   Conferencing Requirements and Framework documents to define how a
   tightly coupled SIP conference works.  The approach is explored from
   different user agent (UA) types perspective: conference-unaware,
   conference-aware and focus UAs.  The use of URIs in conferencing,
   OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call control using REFER are
   covered in detail with example call flow diagrams.

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


1. Introduction

   This document uses the concepts and definitions from the high level
   requirements [10] and the SIP conferencing framework [11] documents.

   The approach described in this document implements key functions in
   the conferencing framework using SIP primitives only. This allows for
   conducting simple conferences with defined functionalities using SIP
   mechanisms and conventions. Many other advanced functions can be
   implemented using additional means but they are not in the scope of
   this document.

   This document presents the basic call control (dial-in and dial-out)
   conferencing building blocks from the UA perspective. Possible
   applications include ad-hoc conferences and scheduled conferences.

   Note that a single conference can bridge participants having
   different capabilities and who potentially have joined the conference
   by different means (i.e. dial-in, dial-out, scheduled, and ad-hoc).

   The call control and dialog manipulation approach is based on the
   multiparty framework [12] document.  That document defines the basic
   approach of service design adopted for SIP which includes:

    - Definition of primitives, not services
    - Signaling model independent
    - Invoker oriented
    - Primitives make full use of URIs
    - Include authentication, authorization, logging, etc. policies
    - Define graceful fallback to baseline SIP.

   The use of opaque URIs and the ability to communicate call control
   context information within a URI (as opposed to service-related
   header fields), as discussed in RFC 3087 [13], is fundamental to this
   approach.

2. Usage of the 'isfocus' Feature Parameter

2.1 General

   The main design guidelines for the development of SIP extensions and
   conventions for conferencing are to define the minimum number of
   extensions and to have seamless backwards compatibility with
   conference-unaware SIP UAs.  The minimal requirement for SIP is being
   able to express that a dialog is a part of a certain conference
   referenced to by a URI.  As a result of these extensions, it is
   possible to do the following using SIP:




Johnston & Levin        Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


    - Create a conference
    - Join a conference
    - Invite a user to a conference
    - Expel a user by third party
    - Discover if a URI is a conference URI

   The approach taken is to use the feature parameter "isfocus" to
   express that a SIP dialog belongs to a conference.  The use of
   feature parameters in Contact header fields to describe the
   characteristics and capabilities of a UA is described in the User
   Agent Capabilities [7] document which includes the definition of the
   "isfocus" feature parameter.

2.2 Session Establishment

   In session establishment, a focus MUST include the "isfocus" feature
   parameter in the Contact header field unless the focus wishes to hide
   the fact that it is a focus.  To a participant, the feature parameter
   will be associated with the remote target URI of the dialog.  It is
   an indication to a conference-aware UA that the resulting dialog
   belongs to a conference identified by the URI in the Contact header
   field and that the call control conventions defined in this document
   can be applied.

   The Conference URI MUST meet the requirements to be a GRUU (Globally
   Routable User Agent URI) as detailed in [9]

2.3 OPTIONS

   Currently the only met requirement is: given an opaque URI, being
   able to recognize whether it belongs to a certain conference (i.e.
   meaning that it is a conference URI) or not.  As with any other
   OPTIONS request, it can be done either inside an active dialog or
   outside a dialog.  A focus MUST include the "isfocus" feature
   parameter in a 200 OK response to an OPTIONS unless the focus wishes
   to hide the fact that it is a focus.

3. SIP User Agent Conferencing Capability Types

   From a conferencing perspective, the framework document outlines a
   number of possible different SIP components such as
   conference-unaware participant, conference-aware participant, and
   focus.

   This document applies the concepts above to the SIP call control part
   of the conferencing components. It defines normative behavior of the
   SIP UAs in various conferencing situations (referred later as
   "scenarios").

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


3.1 Focus UA

   A focus, as defined in the framework, hosts a SIP conference and
   maintains a SIP signaling relationship with each participant in the
   conference. A focus contains a conference-aware user agent that
   supports the conferencing call control conventions as defined in this
   document.

   A focus SHOULD support the conference package [5] and indicate so in
   Allow-Events header fields in requests and responses.  A focus MAY
   include information about the conference in SDP message bodies sent.

   A focus SHOULD support the Replaces [8] header field.

   A user agent with focus capabilities could be implemented in end user
   equipment and would be used for the creation of ad-hoc conferences.

   A dedicated conferencing server, whose primary task is to
   simultaneously host conferences of arbitrary type and size, may
   allocate and publish a conference factory URI (as defined in the next
   section) for creating an arbitrary number of ad-hoc conferences (and
   subsequently their focuses) using SIP call control means.


3.2 Conference Factory URI

   According to the framework, there are many ways in which a conference
   can be created.  These are open to the conferencing server
   implementation policy and include non-automated means (such as IVR),
   SIP, and a conference policy control protocol.

   In order to automatically create an arbitrary number of ad-hoc
   conferences (and subsequently their focuses) using SIP call control
   means, a globally routable Conference Factory URI can be allocated
   and published.

   A successful attempt to establish a call to this URI would result in
   the automatic creation a new conference and its focus. As a result,
   note that the Conference Factory URI and the newly created focus URI
   MAY resolve to different physical devices.

   A scenario showing the use of the conference factory URI is shown in
   Section 4.5.

3.3 Conference-Unaware UA

   The simplest user agent can participate in a conference ignoring all
   SIP conferencing-related information. The simplest user agent is able



Johnston & Levin        Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


   to dial into a conference and to be invited to a conference. Any
   conferencing information is optionally conveyed to/from it using
   non-SIP means. Such a user agent would not usually host a conference
   (at least, not using SIP explicitly).  A conference-unaware UA needs
   only to support RFC 3261 [2].  Call flows for conference-unaware UAs
   are not shown in general in this document as they would be identical
   to those in the SIP call flows [15] document.

3.4 Conference-Aware UA

   A conference-aware user agent supports SIP conferencing call control
   conventions defined in this document as a conference participant, in
   addition to support of RFC 3261.

   A conference-aware UA MUST recognize the "isfocus" feature parameter.
   A conference-aware UA SHOULD support REFER [3], SIP events [4], and
   the conferencing package [5].

   A conference-aware UA SHOULD subscribe to the conference package if
   the "isfocus" parameter is in the remote target URI of a dialog and
   if the conference package is listed by a focus in an Allow-Events
   header field.

   A conference-aware UA MAY render to the user any information about
   the conference obtained from the SIP header fields and SDP fields
   from the focus.

4. SIP Conferencing Primitives

   The SIP conferencing call control flows presented in this section are
   the call control building blocks for various SIP tight conferencing
   applications as described in the conferencing requirements [10] and
   framework [11] documents. The major design goal is that the same SIP
   conferencing primitives would be used by user agents having different
   conferencing capabilities and comprising different applications.

4.1 Joining a Conference using the Conference URI - Dial In

   In this section a user knows the conference URI and "dials in" to
   join this conference.

   If the UA is the first participant of the conference to dial in, it
   is likely that this INVITE will create the focus and hence the
   conference.  However, the conference URI must have been reserved
   prior to its use.

   If the conference is up and running already, the dialing-in
   participant is joined to the conference by its focus.

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


   To join an existing specific conference a UA SHOULD send an INVITE
   with the Request-URI set to the conference URI. The focus MUST
   include the "isfocus" feature parameter in the Contact header field
   of the 200 OK response to the INVITE.

   The SUBSCRIBE should be sent outside the INVITE-initiated dialog.

   Participants leaving the conference send a BYE to the focus.  If they
   have a current subscription to the conference package, they also must
   send a SUBSCRIBE with an Expires:0 header field to terminate both
   dialogs.

   An example call flow for joining a conference is shown in Figure 1.

4.2 Adding a Participant by the Focus - Dial Out

   To directly add a participant to a conference, a focus SHOULD send an
   INVITE to the participant containing a Contact header field with the
   conference URI and the "isfocus" feature parameter.

   Note that a conference-unaware UA would simply ignore the
   conferencing information and treat the session (from a SIP
   perspective) as a point to point session.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 2.  It is assumed that Alice
   is already a participant of the conference.  The focus invites Carol
   to the conference by sending an INVITE.  After the session is
   established, Carol subscribes to the conference URI.  It is important
   to note that there is no dependency on Carol's SUBSCRIBE (F5) and the
   NOTIFY to Alice (F9) - they occur asynchronously and independently.

4.3 Manually Creating a Conference by Dialing into a Conferencing
    Application

   In this section, a user sends an INVITE to a conference server
   application.  The application (such as an IVR system or a web page)
   is implemented because the system requires additional input from the
   user before it is able to create a conference.  After a normal dialog
   is established, additional information is received and the conference
   together with its focus are created. At this point the conference
   server MUST re-INVITE the user with the conference URI in Contact

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


   with the "isfocus" feature parameter.

   Alternatively, the additional information MAY be provided by the user
   during an early dialog established.  This could be accomplished by a
   183 Session Progress response sent by the conferencing application.
   After the conference is created, the conference URI MUST then be
   returned in a Contact in the 200 OK.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 3.  In this example, Alice
   uses a conference application which is triggered when Alice sends an
   INVITE to the conference application.  In this example, Conf-App is
   used to represent the conference application URI.  Alice's
   conference-aware UA learns of the existence of the conference from
   the "isfocus" feature parameter and subscribes to the conference
   package to receive notifications of the conference state.

4.4 Creating a Conference by a Conference-Unaware UA

   It is a requirement that a user (human) be able to use a
   conference-unaware UA to create and add participants to a conference.

   A user (human) would choose a conference URI according to system
   rules and insert it into the Request-URI of the INVITE. This same URI
   is echoed by a focus adhering to certain addressing conventions
   (discussed below) in the Contact header by the focus.  Additional
   participants could be added by non-SIP means (publication of the



Johnston & Levin        Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


   chosen conference URI using web pages, email, IM, etc.).
   Alternatively, the conference-unaware UA could then add other
   participants to the conference using SIP call control by establishing
   a session with them, then transferring [17] them to the conference
   URI.  Note that in this scenario only the user (human) is aware of
   the conferencing application, and the conference-unaware UA only need
   support RFC 3261 and optionally call transfer.

   Making this work does impose certain addressing conventions on a
   system. As a service/implementation choice, a system could allow the
   creator of the conference to choose the user portion of the
   conference URI. However, this requires the URI format to be agreed
   upon between a user and the system.

   For example, a service provider might reserve the domain
   conf.example.com for all conference URIs.  Any URI in the domain of
   conf.example.com would resolve to the focus.  The focus could be
   configured to interpret an unknown user part in the conf.example.com
   domain as a request for a conference to be created with the
   conference URI as the Request-URI.  For example, an INVITE sent with
   a Request-URI of sip:k32934208ds72@conf.example.com could be routed
   to the focus that would then create the conference.  This conference
   URI should be registered by the newly created focus to become
   routable as a conference URI within the conf.example.com domain.  The
   returned Contact would look as follows:

        Contact: <sip:k32934208ds72@conf.example.com>;isfocus

   Note, however, that this approach relies on conventions adopted
   between the user (human) and the focus.    Also, the approach is not
   robust against collisions in the conference names.  If a second user
   wishing to create a new conference happened to choose the same user
   part as an existing conference, the result would be that the second
   user would be added into the existing conference instead of creating
   a new one.

   As a result, methods of conference creation in which the conference
   URI is an opaque URI generated by the focus are preferred.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 4.  The participant Alice
   creates the conference URI (using some convention agreed to with the
   focus domain) and sends an INVITE to that URI which creates the
   focus.  The focus creates the conference and returns the same
   conference URI in the 200 OK answer to the INVITE (which is ignored
   by the conference-unaware UA).

   Figure 4. A Conferencing Unaware Participant Creates a Conference


4.5 Creating a Conference using Ad-Hoc SIP Methods

   This section addresses creating a conference by using ad-hoc SIP
   means.  The conference factory URI (as defined in Section 2.4) is
   used to automatically create the conference in this example.

   The benefit of this approach is that the conference URI need not be
   known to the user - instead it is created by a focus and used by the
   participants' UAs.   The main difference between this scenario and
   Section 4.3 is that no user intervention (IVR, web page form, etc.)
   is required to create the conference.

   The SIP URI of the conference factory can be provisioned in the UA
   (as in a "create new conference" button on a SIP phone) or can be
   discovered using other means.

   A SIP entity (such as conferencing server) can distinguish this
   INVITE request as a request to create a new ad-hoc conference from a
   request to join an existing conference by the Request-URI.

   Assuming that all security and policy requirements have been met, a
   new conference will be created with the Contact URI returned in the
   200 OK being the conference URI.  The Contact header field MUST
   contain the "isfocus" feature parameter to indicate that this URI is
   for a conference.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 5. Note that Conf-Factory is
   shorthand for the conference factory URI and Conf-ID Is short for the
   conference URI.  In this flow, Alice has a conference-aware UA and
   creates a conference by sending an INVITE to the conference factory

   URI.  The conference factory application creates the conference and
   redirects using a 302 Moved Temporarily response to the focus.  Note
   that with proxy recursion, Alice may never see the redirect but may
   just receive the responses from the focus starting with message F5.
   Once the media session is established, Alice subscribes to the
   conference URI obtained through the Contact in the 200 OK response
   from the focus.

   Figure 5. Creation of a Conference using SIP Ad-Hoc Methods.


4.6 Requesting the Focus Add a New Resource to a Conference

   A SIP conference URI can be used to inject different kinds of
   information into the conference. Examples include new participants,
   new real-time media sources, new IM messages, and pointers to passive



Johnston & Levin        Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        SIP CC Conferencing for UAs          February 2004


   information references (such as HTTP URIs).

   To request the focus add a new information resource to the specified
   conference, any SIP UA can send a REFER to the conference URI with a
   Refer-To containing the URI of the new resource.  Since this REFER is
   sent to the conference URI and not the conference factory URI, the
   semantics to the focus are to bring the resource into the conference
   and make it visible to the conference participants. The resultant
   focus procedures are dependant both on the nature of the new resource
   (as expressed by its URI) and the own focus policies regarding IM,
   central vs. distributed real time media processing, etc.

   The scenario for adding a new UA participant is important to support
   because it works even if the new participant does not support REFER
   and transfer call control - only the requesting participant and the
   focus need to support the REFER and transfer call control.

   Upon receipt of the REFER containing a Refer-To header with a SIP
   URI, the focus SHOULD send an INVITE to the new participant
   identified by the Refer-To SIP URI containing a Contact header field
   with the conference URI and the "isfocus" feature parameter.

   A conference-unaware UA would simply ignore the conferencing
   information and treat the session (from a SIP perspective) as a point
   to point session.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 6.  It is assumed that Alice
   is already a participant of the conference.  Alice sends a REFER to
   the conference URI.  The focus invites Carol to the conference by
   sending an INVITE.  After the session is established, Carol
   subscribes to the conference URI.    It is important to note that
   there is no dependency on Carol's SUBSCRIBE (F11) and the NOTIFY to
   Alice (F15) - they occur asynchronously and independently.

4.7 Adding a 3rd Party Using Conference URI

   A participant wishing to add a new participant will request this
   participant to send an INVITE to the conference URI.  This can be
   done using a non-SIP means (such as passing or publishing the
   conference URI in an email, IM, or web page).  If a non-SIP means is
   used, then the flow and requirements are identical to Section 4.1.

   The SIP mechanism to do this utilizes the REFER method.

   A UA wishing to add a new participant SHOULD send a REFER request to
   the participant with a Refer-To header containing the conference URI.

   The requirements are then identical to the "dial in" case of Section
   4.1.  The inviting participant MAY receive notification through the
   REFER action that the new participant has been added in addition to
   the notification received through the conference package.

   An example is shown in Figure 7.  In this call flow, it is assumed
   that Alice is already a participant of the conference.  Alice sends
   Bob an "out of band" REFER - that is, a REFER outside of an
   established dialog.  Should Bob reject the REFER, Alice might try
   sending an INVITE to Bob to establish a session first, then send a
   REFER within the dialog, effectively transferring Bob into the
   conference [17].

4.8 Adding a 3rd Party Using a Dialog Identifier

   Under some circumstances, a participant wanting to join a conference
   may only know a dialog identifier of one of the legs of the
   conference.  The information may have been learned using the dialog
   package [18] or some non-SIP means to retrieve this information from
   a conference participant.

   A UA can request to be added to a conference by sending a request to
   the focus containing a Join [6] header field containing a dialog ID
   of one leg of the conference (a dialog between a participant and the
   focus).

   There are other scenarios in which a UA can use the Join header for
   certain conferencing call control scenarios.  See [6] for further
   examples and details.

   An example is shown in Figure 8.  It is assumed that Alice is a
   participant of the conference.  The dialog identifier between Alice
   and the focus is abbreviated as A-F and is known by Bob.  Bob
   requests to be added to the conference by sending an INVITE message
   F1 to the focus containing a Join header which contains the dialog
   identifier A-F.  Bob is added into the conference by the focus.

4.9 Changing User Agents within a Conference

   A participant in a conference may want to change the user agent with
   which they participate in the conference.  While this could be done
   by simply sending a BYE from one user agent to leave the conference
   and an INVITE from the other user agent to rejoin.  However, the SIP
   Replaces [6]  primitive is perfectly suited to this operation.

   An example is shown in Figure 9.  It is assumed that Alice is a
   participant of the conference using user agent #1.  The dialog
   identifier between Alice's user agent #1 and the focus is abbreviated
   as A-F.  Alice switches to user agent #2 and sends an INVITE message
   F1 to the focus containing a Replaces header which contains the
   dialog identifier A-F.  Note that this dialog identifier could be
   learned through some non-SIP mechanism, or by use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY
   and the dialog event package [18].  Alice's user agent #2 is added
   into the conference by the focus.  The focus sends a BYE to user
   agent #1.  User agent #1 then automatically terminates the
   subscription by sending a SUBSCRIBE with Expires:0 to terminate the
   subscription.  Note that as the participant list (roster) has not
   changed during this scenario, no NOTIFYs are sent by the focus to
   subscribers to the participant list.

4.10 Bringing a Point-to-Point Dialog into a Conference

   A focus is capable of bringing an existing point-to-point dialog with
   another UA to a conference that the focus hosts. The focus would do
   it by sending re-INVITE changing the Contact URI to the conference
   URI with the "isfocus" feature parameter. By doing this, the focus
   signals to the UA that it becomes a participant of the conference,
   specified in the Contact header.

   Currently, there is no way for a UA, being in an active

   point-to-point call with a focus, to express by SIP call control
   means a request to bridge its dialog with a specific conference or to
   create a new conference and include the dialog in this conference.
   Instead, a new dialog will need to be created.  Even if the UA
   discovers that the other side has focus capabilities, the UA needs to
   close the old session and to establish a new session/dialog with the
   focus.

4.11 Requesting the Focus Remove a Participant from a Conference

   To request the focus remove a participant from the specified
   conference, a properly authorized SIP UA (typically the conference
   owner) can send a REFER to the conference URI with a Refer-To
   containing the URI of the participant and with the method set to BYE.
   The requestor does not need to know the dialog information about the
   dialog between the focus and the participant who will be removed -
   the focus knows this information and fills it when it generates the
   BYE request.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 10.  It is assumed that Alice
   and Carol are already participants of the conference and that Alice
   is authorized to remove members from the conference.  Alice sends a
   REFER to the conference URI with a Refer-To header containing a URI
   of the form &ltsip:carol@chicago.example.com&method=BYE>.

4.12 Discovery of Conferencing Capabilities using OPTIONS

   A UA MAY send an OPTIONS request to discover if an opaque URI is a
   conference URI (resolves to a focus). In addition, the reply to the
   OPTIONS request can also indicate support for various SIP call
   control extensions used in this document.

   Note that the Allow, Accept, Allow-Events, and Supported header
   fields should be present in an INVITE from a focus or a 200 OK answer
   from the focus to an INVITE as a part of a normal dialog
   establishment process.

   An example is shown in Figure 11 where Alice sends an OPTIONS to a
   URI which resolves to a focus.

   Figure 11. Participant Queries Capabilities of URI which resolves to a Focus.

   Following is an example message detail of message F2 in Figure 11.
   Based on the response, Alice's UA learns that the URI is a conference
   URI and that the responding UA is focus that supports a number of SIP
   call control extensions.

   The response details are as follows:

    F2   SIP/2.0 200 OK
         Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKhjhs8ass877

   Useful information from each of these headers is detailed in the next
   sections.

   Allow.  The support of methods such as REFER, SUBSCRIBE, and NOTIFY
   indicate that the user agent supports call control and SIP Events.

   Accept.  The support of bodies such as message/sipfrag [14],
   application/conference-info+xml [5] also indicates support of call
   control and conferencing.

   Allow-Events. The support of event packages such as refer [3],
   conference [5].

   Supported.  The support of extensions such as replaces, join, and
   gruu.

   Contact.  The presence of the "isfocus" feature parameter in the
   Contact header indicates that the URI is a conference URI and that
   the UA is a focus.

5. Security Considerations

   This document discusses call control for SIP conferencing.  Both call
   control and conferencing have specific security requirements which
   will be summarized here.  Conferences generally have authorization
   rules about who may or may not join a conference, what type of media
   may or may not be used, etc.  This information is used by the Focus
   to admit or deny participation in a conference. It is recommended
   that these types of authorization rules be used to provide security
   for a SIP conference.  For this authorization information to be used,
   the focus needs to be able to authenticate potential participants.
   Normal SIP mechanisms including Digest authentication and
   certificates can be used.  These conference specific security
   requirements are discussed further in the requirements and framework
   documents.

   For call control security, a user agent must maintain local policy on
   who is permitted to perform call control operations, initiate REFERs,
   and replace dialogs.  Normal SIP authentication mechanisms are also
   appropriate here.  The specific authentication and authorization
   schemes are described in the multiparty call control framework
   document.

6. Contributors

   We would like to thank Rohan Mahy, Jonathan Rosenberg, Roni Even,
   Petri Koskelainen, Brian Rosen, Paul Kyzivat, Eric Burger, and others
   in list discussions.

7. Changes since -02

   - Added reference and text about use of GRUUs.

   - Updated for latest version of conference package.

   - Clarified that conference package subscription should use a
   separate dialog from INVITE dialog.

8. Changes since -01

   - Added messages details of selected INVITE, 200 OK, SUBSCRIBE,
   REFER, and NOTIFY messages.

9. Changes since -00

   - Showed separation between conference factory application and focus
   by having the application redirect to the newly created focus in the
   ad-hoc creation scenario.

   - Removed inclusion of "isfocus" parameter in Refer-To header field -
   this may be a useful extension to the REFER mechanism in the future,
   however.

   - Updated reference from Caller Prefs document to the new
   Capabilities of User Agents document.

   - Added scenario of participant changing user agents during a
   conference.

   - Added requirement on focus to support Replaces header field.

   - Added discussion about termination of dialog using BYE and
   subscription using SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY to flows involving termination of
   session with the focus.
