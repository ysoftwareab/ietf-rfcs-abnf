Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it defines a MIB for the Forwarding and Control Element
   Separation (ForCES) Network Element (NE).  The ForCES working group
   is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the
   behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE).

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                      July 2006


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The ForCES MIB is a primarily read-only MIB that captures information
   related to the ForCES protocol ([RFC3654], [RFC3746], [forces-
   applicability-draft] and [forces-protocol-draft]).

   The ForCES MIB does not include information that is specified in
   other MIBs, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.

   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB relative to
   associations that are up includes:

   o  identifiers of the elements in the association,

   o  configuration parameters of the association, and

   o  statistics of the association.


3.  Design of the ForCES MIB

   In an NE composed of one or more FEs and a single CE, the CE is
   clearly aware of all associations and hence can provide this
   information in a single ForCES MIB.  In contrast, in an NE composed
   of more than one CE, such association information is distributed and
   hence more than one ForCES MIB may be necessary, unless this
   information is aggregated into a single ForCES MIB by some means
   beyond the scope of this document.  Nevertheless, the ForCES MIB
   design is compatible with both the single-CE and the multiple-CE
   case.


4.  Association State

   Only associations that are UP are shown in the MIB.  Associations
   enter the UP state as soon as the CE has sent to the FE an
   Association Setup Response message containing a successful
   Association Setup Result.

   Associations are removed from the MIB as soon as they leave the UP
   state, i.e., if the CE has not received any message (Heartbeat or

   other protocol message) from the FE within a given time period or if
   an Association Teardown message has been sent by the CE.


5.  ForCES MIB Definition

   The MIB contains the latest ForCES protocol version supported by the
   CE.  Note that the CE must also allow interaction with FEs supporting
   earlier versions.

   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the
   following associated information is provided by the MIB:

   o  Version number of the ForCES protocol running in this association.

   o  Time when the association entered the UP state.

   o  Time when the association left the UP state.  Note that this is
      only used for notification purposes as the association is removed
      from the MIB immediately after it leaves the UP state.

   o  Number of ForCES Heartbeat messages sent from the CE and received
      by the CE since the association is UP.

   o  Number of other ForCES messages sent from the CE and received by
      the CE since the association is UP.  Only messages other than
      Heartbeat, Association Setup, Association Setup Response, and
      Association Teardown are counted.

   Finally, the MIB defines the following notifications:

   o  Whenever an association enters the UP state, a notification is
      issued containing the version of the ForCES protocol running.
      Note that as CE ID and FE ID are indexes, they appear in the OID
      of the ForCES-protocol running-version object.

   o  Whenever an association leaves the UP state, a notification is
      issued containing all associated information for this association.
      The reason is that the association and all its associated
      information will be removed from the MIB immediately after this
      notification has been issued.

6.  Security Considerations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.



Haas                     Expires January 5, 2007               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                      July 2006


   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to assign a number to this MIB.


8.  Changes from Previous Draft Revisions

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-02.  They are refinements of the
   MIB:

   o  Changed forcesAssociationCEID and forcesAssociationFEID from read-
      only to not-accessible to conform with Section 7.7 in [RFC2578].

   o  Removed forcesAssociationCEID and forcesAssociationFEID from the
      notifications.  This information is conveyed in the OID anyway.

   o  Added MIB conformance information.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-01.  The changes are in response
   to the Working Group Last Call:

   o  Addition of two traps/notifications to signal the associations
      that enter or leave the UP state.

   o  Suppression of the DOWN and ESTABLISHING states.  Only
      associations in the UP state are kept in the table.

   o  Split of the Message counters into Heartbeat and other messages.

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                      July 2006


   o  Addition of the current running version of ForCES protocol for
      each association in the UP state.

   o  Addition of the latest version of the ForCES protocol supported by
      the CE.
