                 Comparison of CoAP Security Protocols
            draft-ietf-lwig-security-protocol-comparison-02

Abstract

   This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size overheads
   when using different security protocols to secure CoAP.  The analyzed
   security protocols are DTLS 1.2, DTLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and
   OSCORE.  DTLS and TLS are analyzed with and without 6LoWPAN-GHC
   compression.  DTLS is analyzed with and without Connection ID.

1.  Introduction

   This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size overheads
   when using different security protocols to secure CoAP over UPD
   [RFC7252] and TCP [RFC8323].  The analyzed security protocols are
   DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347], DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13], TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246], TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], and OSCORE
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security].  The DTLS and TLS record layers are
   analyzed with and without compression.  DTLS is anlyzed with and
   without Connection ID [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id].  Readers are
   expected to be familiar with some of the terms described in RFC 7925
   [RFC7925], such as ICV.

2.  Overhead of Security Protocols

   To enable comparison, all the overhead calculations in this section
   use AES-CCM with a tag length of 8 bytes (e.g.  AES_128_CCM_8 or AES-
   CCM-16-64), a plaintext of 6 bytes, and the sequence number '05'.
   This follows the example in [RFC7400], Figure 16.

Internet-Draft           CoAP Security Overhead             January 2019


   Note that the compressed overhead calculations for DLTS 1.2, DTLS
   1.3, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are dependent on the parameters epoch,
   sequence number, and length, and all the overhead calculations are
   dependent on the parameter Connection ID when used.  Note that the
   OSCORE overhead calculations are dependent on the CoAP option
   numbers, as well as the length of the OSCORE parameters Sender ID and
   Sequence Number.  The following are only examples.

2.1.  DTLS 1.2

2.1.1.  DTLS 1.2

   This section analyzes the overhead of DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347].  The nonce
   follow the strict profiling given in [RFC7925].  This example is
   taken directly from [RFC7400], Figure 16.

   DTLS 1.2 record layer (35 bytes, 29 bytes overhead):
   17 fe fd 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 16 00 01 00
   00 00 00 00 05 ae a0 15 56 67 92 4d ff 8a 24 e4

   Ciphertext:
   ae a0 15 56 67 92
   ICV:
   4d ff 8a 24 e4 cb 35 b9

   DTLS 1.2 gives 29 bytes overhead.

2.1.2.  DTLS 1.2 with 6LoWPAN-GHC

   This section analyzes the overhead of DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] when
   compressed with 6LoWPAN-GHC [RFC7400].  The compression was done with
   [OlegHahm-ghc].

   Note that the sequence number '01' used in [RFC7400], Figure 15 gives
   an exceptionally small overhead that is not representative.

   Note that this header compression is not available when DTLS is used
   over transports that do not use 6LoWPAN together with 6LoWPAN-GHC.

   Compressed DTLS 1.2 record layer (22 bytes, 16 bytes overhead):

   When compressed with 6LoWPAN-GHC, DTLS 1.2 with the above parameters
   (epoch, sequence number, length) gives 16 bytes overhead.

2.1.3.  DTLS 1.2 with Connection ID

   This section analyzes the overhead of DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] with
   Connection ID [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id].  The overhead
   calculations in this section uses Connection ID = '42'.  DTLS recored
   layer with a Connection ID = '' (the empty string) is equal to DTLS
   without Connection ID.

   DTLS 1.2 record layer (36 bytes, 30 bytes overhead):
   17 fe fd 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 05 42 00 16 00 01

   Note that this header compression is not available when DTLS is used
   over transports that do not use 6LoWPAN together with 6LoWPAN-GHC.

   When compressed with 6LoWPAN-GHC, DTLS 1.2 with the above parameters
   (epoch, sequence number, Connection ID, length) gives 17 bytes
   overhead.

2.2.  DTLS 1.3

2.2.1.  DTLS 1.3

   This section analyzes the overhead of DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].
   The changes compared to DTLS 1.2 are: omission of version number,
   merging of epoch into the first byte containing signalling bits,
   optional omission of length, reduction of sequence number into a 1 or
   2-bytes field.

   In this example, the length field is omitted, and the 1-byte field is
   used for the sequence number.  The minimal DTLSCiphertext structure
   is used (see Figure 4 of [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13]).

Internet-Draft           CoAP Security Overhead             January 2019


   OSCORE response (17 bytes, 11 bytes overhead):
   90
   ff ec ae a0 15 56 67 92 4d ff 8a 24 e4 cb 35 b9

   CoAP delta and option length:
   90
   Option value:
   -
   Payload marker:
   ff
   Ciphertext (including encrypted code):
   ec ae a0 15 56 67 92
   ICV:
   4d ff 8a 24 e4 cb 35 b9

   OSCORE with the above parameters gives 13-14 bytes overhead for
   requests and 11 bytes overhead for responses.

   Unlike DTLS and TLS, OSCORE has much smaller overhead for responses
   than requests.

3.  Overhead with Different Parameters

   The DTLS overhead is dependent on the parameter Connection ID.  The
   following overheads apply for all Connection IDs with the same
   length.

   The compression overhead (GHC) is dependent on the parameters epoch,
   sequence number, Connection ID, and length (where applicable).  The
   following overheads should be representative for sequence numbers and
   Connection IDs with the same length.

   The OSCORE overhead is dependent on the included CoAP Option numbers
   as well as the length of the OSCORE parameters Sender ID and sequence
   number.  The following overheads apply for all sequence numbers and
   Sender IDs with the same length.

Internet-Draft           CoAP Security Overhead             January 2019


4.  Summary

   DTLS 1.2 has quite a large overhead as it uses an explicit sequence
   number and an explicit nonce.  TLS 1.2 has significantly less (but
   not small) overhead.  TLS 1.3 has quite a small overhead.  OSCORE and
   DTLS 1.3 (using the minimal structure) format have very small
   overhead.

   The Generic Header Compression (6LoWPAN-GHC) can in addition to DTLS
   1.2 handle TLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.2 with Connection ID.  The Generic
   Header Compression (6LoWPAN-GHC) works very well for Connection ID
   and the overhead seems to increase exactly with the length of the
   Connection ID (which is optimal).  The compression of TLS 1.2 is not
   as good as the compression of DTLS 1.2 (as the static dictionary only
   contains the DTLS 1.2 version number).  Similar compression levels as
   for DTLS could be achieved also for TLS 1.2, but this would require
   different static dictionaries.  For TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3, GHC
   increases the overhead.  The 6LoWPAN-GHC header compression is not
   available when (D)TLS is used over transports that do not use 6LoWPAN
   together with 6LoWPAN-GHC.

   Only the minimal header format for DTLS 1.3 was considered, which
   reduces the header of 3 bytes compared to the full header, by
   omitting the 2-byte-long length value and sending 1 byte of sequence
   number instead of 2.  This may create problems reconstructing the
   full sequence number, if ~2000 datagrams in sequence are lost.

   OSCORE has much lower overhead than DTLS 1.2 and TLS 1.2.  The
   overhead of OSCORE is smaller than DTLS 1.2 and TLS 1.2 over 6LoWPAN
   with compression, and this small overhead is achieved even on
   deployments without 6LoWPAN or 6LoWPAN without DTLS compression.
   OSCORE is lightweight because it makes use of CoAP, CBOR, and COSE,
   which were designed to have as low overhead as possible.
