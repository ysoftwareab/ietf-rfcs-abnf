Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification            November 2007


1.  Introduction

   When delegating zones from a TLD or other DNS zone, some additional
   information is needed when resolving a name server's (as per an NS
   RR) address would involve the particular name server itself.  Such a
   dependency on itself, direct or indirect, may effectively shadow a
   part of a zone's NS RRSet, reducing redundancy, or even render the
   zone completely unresolvable.  This additional information is an
   amendment to the delegation in the form of glue address records.  In
   the real life DNS multiple strategies to determine necessity or
   acceptance of glue records co-exist.  This document lists a subset of
   those approaches.

   This document also tries to clarify when and where to call an address
   record "glue record".

   Comments should be directed at the author.

   Domain names and IP addresses herein are for explanatory purposes
   only and should not be expected to lead to useful information in real
   life [RFC2606],[RFC3330]).


2.  RFC Survey

   To find out more about early motivations and strategies for DNS glue
   records, all existing RFCs were automatically searched for the term
   "glue" (case insensitive, no word boundaries) and those matching were
   inspected on a case by case basis.  Whenever the term was used in a
   DNS context, the RFC was added to the list which can be found in the
   References section.  It turned out that, while all early RFCs are
   consistent in using "glue" only for type A address records for NS RR
   targets, they apply slightly different logic as to when a glue A RR
   should be present.


3.  Terms

   When the term "glue record" was introduced in [RFC0973], it was meant
   to denominate both data origin and purpose.  Data origin is related
   to the zone, although the glue records do not belong to the
   authoritative zone data.  The purpose is constrained to providing
   address information for name servers mentioned in NS RRs, which would
   otherwise not be resolvable.  Glue records are address information
   accompanying a delegation (in the delegating zone).

   There is sometimes confusion when data in a DNS response is also
   called "glue" data, e.g.  [RFC2010] starts speaking of "fetching"



Koch                      Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification            November 2007


   glue.  In a DNS response packet (answer or referral) the address
   information for name servers is carried in the additional section.
   This address information might have originated from glue records but
   might also come from cached or authoritative data.  DNS data in
   response packets should only be called "glue data" when it is certain
   and needs to be emphasized that it originates from glue records.

   [RFC4472] introduces the concept of 'critical' and 'courtesy'
   additional data.


4.  Name Server Naming Strategies

   The DNS refers to name servers by their name in NS resource records.
   The servers' names can have different relations to the zone delegated
   to them.  The following categories will use the example of the zone
   "del.example" being delegated from the "example" TLD zone.

   in domain  A name server can be within the delegated domain, which
      includes the name of the delegated domain itself, e.g.,
      "del.example", "dns.del.example", or "dns.sub.del.example".  In
      all but the first case the name might be part of a subzone of
      "del.example".  This naming scheme is sometimes also called "in-
      bailiwick".

   sibling domain  A name server's name can be within the delegating but
      outside the delegated domain, e.g., "dns.other.example".  There
      are two sub-cases here, depending on the treatment of the
      "other.example" domain:

      authoritative in sibling  When the name server's name is within
         the parent domain, but in a separate zone, this is a sibling
         zone of the delegated zone.

      authoritative in parent  A name server's name may also appear
         authoritative in the parent zone.

   unrelated  A name server's name may not share its parent with the
      delegated domain, e.g., "dns.example.org".

   {To be elaborated further.}


5.  Glue Policies

   In the DNS tree different policies are applied with respect to
   registering glue with the delegating zone.  "Registering" in this
   case means that the respective glue information is accepted,



Koch                      Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification            November 2007


   requested or required and then attached to the zone data so that it
   is available at all authoritative servers, i.e. the glue travels with
   the zone data by AXFR, IXFR or other means.  However, it does not
   make the glue data part of the zone's authoritative data.

   This is a list of existing glue policies:

   "never" or "null":  Glue RRs are never registered.  This currently
      applies to larger parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse tree.

   "narrow":  Glue RRs are registered if and only if the name server
      resides within or below the delegated (child) zone (that is,
      within the delegated domain).  This was suggested by [RFC1034].

   "wide":  Glue RRs are registered if and only if the name server
      resides below the delegating (parent) zone.  There is no need to
      register glue RRs if the name server's name belongs into the
      parent zone.  This was suggested by [RFC1033].  It is used for the
      root zone.

   "case by case":  Glue RRs are registered following the "narrow"
      policy except where there are (circular) dependencies that demand
      additional glue RRs.

   "mandatory":  Glue RRs are always registered for all name servers.
      This was suggested by [RFC0973].

   "other":  Combinations of the above may exist, e.g. if a registry
      runs multiple sibling domains and decides to register glue RRs
      whenever a name server resides in or below one of the siblings.
      This category would also include other policies like "random" or
      "arbitrary".

   Glue RRs are needed only in the delegating zone, regardless of glue
   policy.  See Section 6.1 for a discussion of root zone issues.

   Various RFCs have identified extraneous glue RRs as sources of error
   and confusion ([RFC1713], [RFC1912]).


6.  Open Issues

   Future versions of this document will expand on these topics:

   o  Software issues when following NS RRs
      [I-D.minda-dnsop-using-in-bailiwick-nameservers]





Koch                      Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification            November 2007


   o  Mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments, following the example of
      [RFC4472].

   o  TTL considerations: glue data vs. authoritative data as well as NS
      RRSet TTLs vs A RRSet TTLs

6.1.  Root Server "Glue" in the Root Zone File

   As said before, Glue is meant to be present in the delegating zone
   only.  The only exception seems to be root zone which also contains
   the address records for its authoritative name servers.  However,
   with the current setup the root servers also serve the ARPA domain
   and with the root zone's "wide" glue policy this means that there
   should be glue RRs for this particular set of nameservers, but only
   in their capacity as ARPA TLD servers.  [The position of the A RRs in
   the root zone file (which has just editorial value) as well as their
   TTLs suggest that historically there will have been a different
   reason].

   Also, per operational practice, almost all root servers are
   authoritative for the zone they reside in (even if that is not
   officially delegated to all the 13 servers).  So, they have the
   authoritative data present and do not need to rely upon the data
   transported with the root zone.

   [To have a complete trust chain available at the root servers leading
   to their own names, it would be useful to have them configured
   authoritative for all intermediate zones.  It has been suggested
   before to move the root server's names to a distinct TLD.  Another
   option would be to move their names to e.g.  ROOT-SERVERS.ARPA
   instead.]

6.2.  Using Glue records in responses

   Some implementations use Glue information not only during additional
   section processing, but also in the answer section of responses.

   Given an excerpt of the "example" TLD zone file,

     one.example.       NS dns.one.example.
                        NS dns.two.example.
     dns.one.example.   A  192.0.2.53

   what should a name server authoritative for the example TLD do when
   asked for the A RR for dns.one.example?  Some implementations will
   put the A RR in the answer section of the response, others will
   respond with a referral and only copy the glue A RR into the
   additional section (the handling of dns.two.example's A RR is not

Internet-Draft           DNS Glue Clarification            November 2007


   considered here).

   Step 4 of the algorithm in 4.3.2 of [RFC1034] suggests that after
   copying the NS RRs into the authority section (in step 3b) the cache
   should be consulted and used to fill the answer section.  Depending
   on whether or not Glue data is considered to reside in the cache (it
   is definitely not authoritative), one or the other response type will
   be preferred.

   With DNSSEC an A RRSet response originating from glue data will
   always miss the appropriate signature, because neither does the
   delegating zone sign the glue RRSet nor does a glue RRSIG (child's
   signature covering the address RRSet) exist in that delegating zone.

   [discuss levels of indirection and operational reasons that lead to
   the "gluepot response"]

6.3.  Glue RRs for multihomed name servers

   Some name server names resolve to A or AAAA RRSets consisting of more
   than one record, i.e. they have multiple addresses.  It is
   recommended that these RRSets be consistent between the child and the
   parent.

   Research is needed to evaluate the effective difference between
   multiple names and multiple addresses for a name server.  These
   effects heavily depend on server selection algorithms in resolvers.

6.4.  Grandchild Glue

   When a name server resides within the delegated domain, the
   delegation needs a glue record with both the "wide" and the "narrow"
   glue policy.  However, the server does not necessarily have its name
   within the delegated zone since it may belong to a child or
   grandchild zone of the delegated one.

   This is a delegation in the example TLD:

     one.example.       NS one.example.
                        NS dns.one.example.
                        NS dns.deep.one.example.

   Only the first name server is known to have its name in the delegated
   zone, where the second and third could both be in separate zones.
   NB: even dns.one.example. could be a zone delegated from one.example.

   As a consequence, it cannot be concluded that any such name server is
   able to authoritatively serve its own name, e.g., if it does not

   serve the grandchild zone.


7.  DNSSEC Considerations

   DNSSEC signatures do not cover glue records [RFC3833], [RFC4033].

   Using the gluepot to fill the answer section is discouraged with
   DNSSEC, see Section 6.2.


8.  IPv6 Considerations

   While this document makes no explicit statements about AAAA RRs,
   similar logic applies except in cases where A and AAAA glue RR
   interaction requires specific consideration (response packet size,
   TTL consistency, namespace fragmentation).

   The specification of the A6 RR [RFC2874] contains, in section 5.1.2,
   a detailed discussion of glue issues due to the variable
   representation of IPv6 addresses in A6.
