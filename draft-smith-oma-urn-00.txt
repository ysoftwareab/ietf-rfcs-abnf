Abstract 
    
   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform 
   Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by the Open Mobile 
   Alliance (OMA).  OMA defines and manages resources that utilize this 
   URN name model.  Management activities for these and other resource 
   types are provided by the Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA).

1. Introduction 
    
   OMA is a specification development body developing technologies for 
   mobile devices.  This activity is supported by a membership comprised 
   of network operators, equipment vendors, content providers and other 
   suppliers to the mobile market. 
    
   Some of the technologies being developed by OMA need XML namespaces 
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure 
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific NID 
   for use by OMA was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full and 
   complete registration will follow the namespace specification process 
   as defined in [RFC3406].

2. URN Specification for "oma" NID 
    
2.1 Namespace ID: 
    
   The NID "oma" is requested. 
    
2.2 Registration Information: 
    
   registration version number: 1 
   registration date:           2005-07-18 
    
2.3 Declared registrant of the namespace: 
    
   Registering organization 
      Name:    Open Mobile Alliance 
      Address: 4275 Executive Square 
               Suite 240s 
               La Jolla, CA 92037

2.4 Declaration of syntactic structure: 
    
   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "oma" 
   NID will have the following structure: 
    
         urn:oma:{OMAresource}:{ResourceSpecificString} 
    
   where the "OMAresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN 
   syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of 
   resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme 
   that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString" which also conforms to 
   the naming requirements of [RFC2141]. 
    
   OMA maintains a naming authority, the Open Mobile Naming Authority 
   (OMNA), that will manage the assignment of "OMAresources" and the 
   specific registration values assigned for each resource class. 
    
2.5 Relevant ancillary documentation: 
    
   The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) provides information on the 
   registered resources and the registrations for each.  More 
   information about OMNA and the registration activities and procedures 
   to be followed are available at: 
    
      http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/omna

2.6 Identifier uniqueness considerations: 
    
   The OMNA will manage resources using the "oma" NID and will be the 
   authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings 
   associated.  In the associated procedures, OMNA will ensure the 
   uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary 
   responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees. 
    
   OMA may permit use of experimental type values that will not be 
   registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the 
   same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only intended 
   for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue. 
    
2.7 Identifier persistence considerations: 
    
   OMNA will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of the 
   "oma" NID.  This will be structured such that each OMAresource will 
   have a separate description and registration table. 
    
   The registration tables and information will be published and 
   maintained by OMNA on its web site. 
    
2.8 Process of identifier assignment: 
    
   OMNA will provide procedures for registration of each type of 
   resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three types 
   of registration activities: 
    
     1) Registered values associated with OMA specs or services 
     2) Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities 
     3) Name models for use in experimental purposes 
    
2.9 Process for identifier resolution: 
    
   The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant. 
    
2.10 Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 
    
   No special considerations, the rules for lexical equivalence of 
   [RFC2141] apply. 
    
2.11 Conformance with URN Syntax: 
    
   No special considerations. 
    
2.12 Validation mechanism: 
    
   None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures 
   implemented in support of OMNA activities.

2.13 Scope: 
    
   Global 
    
3. Examples 
    
   The following examples are representative urns that could be assigned 
   by OMNA.  They may not be the actual strings that would be assigned. 
    
   urn:oma:ac:oma-presence 
     Defines the urn to be used for the Application Characteristic 
     object definition for providing attributes to the Presence enabler 
     defined in OMA. 
    
   urn:oma:drms:org-foobar 
     Defines the urn associated with the Digital Rights Management 
     System object definition allocated to foobar which is an external 
     organization that made request via OMNA for a drms urn. 
    
4. Namespace Considerations 
    
   The Open Mobile Alliance is developing a variety of application and 
   service enablers.  Some of these enablers depend upon supporting 
   information (e.g. data descriptions, attributes, etc.) to be fully 
   specified.  For proper operation, descriptions of the needed 
   supporting information must exist and be available in a unique, 
   reliable and persistent manner.  These dependencies provide the basis 
   of need for namespaces, in one form or another. 
    
   As the Open Mobile Alliance work is ongoing and covers many technical 
   areas, the possibility of binding to various other namespace 
   repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each object or 
   description, as defined in OMA, could possibly be related to multiple 
   different other namespaces so further conflicts of association could 
   occur.  Thus the intent is to utilize the Open Mobile Naming 
   Authority, operated by OMA, as the naming authority for OMA defined 
   objects and descriptions. 
    
5. Community Considerations 
    
   The objects and descriptions required for enablers produced by OMA 
   are generally available for use by other organizations.  The Open 
   Mobile Naming Authority will provide access and support for name 
   requests by these organizations.  This support can be enabled in 
   timely and responsive fashion as new objects and descriptions are 
   produced.  These will be enabled in a fashion similar to current OMNA 
   support.

6. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no additional security considerations other than those 
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general. 
    
7. IANA Considerations 
    
   The objective of this registration is for the requested NID to be 
   entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.  This would result in an 
   update to http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any 
   associated mirrors.
