Abstract

   This document defines a MIB module to manage the usage of SNMP
   contexts.  Specically, within for an SNMP agent which implements
   multiple copies/instances of some other MIB module, this MIB module
   provides a mapping between SNMP Contexts and the individual instances
   of that other MIB module.

1.  Introduction

   With the advent of newer technologies, an increasing number of
   technologies which used to be defined such that only one instance
   could exist within a device, are now being implemented at a
   different granularity such that multiple copies/instances can exist
   in one device at the same time.

   An excellent example for this behavior is with the 
   OSPF-MIB(RFC 1850). When it was originally designed, there was no 
   concept of multiple OSPF instances running on the same system and
   there was no built-in mechanism to handle such circumstances.

   However according to Section 4.1.1 of RFC 4577, a PE router that 
   attaches to more than one OSPF domain must run an independent 
   instance of OSPF for each domain. Each OSPF instance is associated
   to a VRF(see section 3 of RFC4364. This means that OSPF-MIB must 
   now support multiple VRF contexts and within each context the
   objects in the OSPF-MIB can be indexed by the same OID but 
   represent different data.

   One way to overcome this issue would be to update the OSPF-MIB to
   have an additional variable in the INDEX clause. This would require
   depreacting and re-defining just about all objects in the MIB; 
   in effect, a modified copy of the original MIB. This change can
   be severely disadvantageous to existing deployments.
   
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB[RFC3813], [BFD-MIB], BGP-MIB[RFC4273], [ISIS-MIB] 
   and IP-FORWARD-MIB[RFC4292] are other MIBs which are also affected 
   in the same way.
   Another example is with the BRIDGE-MIB[RFC4188] where each Bridge 
   entity in a system can contain different subsets of data indexed 
   by the same OID.

   A better way to overcome the issue is to use multiple SNMP contexts
   (see section 3.3.1 of RFC 3411).  However, as and when significant 
   usage is made of SNMP contexts (e.g., for multiple MIBs and/or 
   multiple domains), then there is a need for the contexts themselves
   to be manageable.  This document defines management information 
   for this purpose.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


2. Terminology  

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
   architecture [RFC3031] and from the document describing MPLS Layer-3
   VPNs (L3VPN) [RFC4364], as well as the SNMP architecture [RFC3411].

   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)
   and Customer Edge (CE)" or "PE/CE" will be replaced by "PE" in all
   cases except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier's
   carrier model.


3. SNMP Context mapping feature -  High-Level Picture:

   The use of SNMP contexts as a solution to the problem of 
   accessing SNMP MIBs on a per-context basis 
   requires no modifications to existing MIBs. Instead, this solution 
   requires that the Network Management Station (NMS) or any other
   manager desiring to manage an agent, be made aware that a 
   VPN Identifier or a Bridge Identifier or some other data 
   distinguishing identifier can be mapped to a SNMP Context field 
   for every request.

   The MIB presented in this draft can be used to map a vacmContextName
   into any data distinguishing identifier which can retrieve data from
   the appropriate instance.

   Every SNMPv3 operation acts within the context of an SNMP Context.
   The name of that SNMP Context is carried in the message header 
   and serves as part of the naming structure of MIB objects (see
   section 3.3.1 of RFC 3411). When all of an agent's management 
   information is in the same SNMP Context, then the name of that 
   Context need only be used implicitly. In contrast, when multiple 
   SNMP Contexts are in use, then the name of a particular Context 
   must be used explicitly to determine which items of management 
   information are referenced by which OIDs.

   For older versions of SNMP, a mapping between the SNMP community and
   the  SNMP context can be maintained using the SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB.

         instances of the same MIB module, and does so through the
         use of multiple SNMP contexts.  This typically occurs because
         the technology has evolved to have extra dimension(s), i.e.,
         one or more extra data and/or identifier values which are
         different in the different contexts, but were not defined in
         INDEX clause(s) of the original MIB module.  In such cases,
         network management applications need to know the specific
         data/identifier values in each context, and this MIB module
         provides mapping tables which contain that information.

         Within a network there can be multiple Virtual Private
         Networks (VPNs) configured using Virtual Routing and
         Forwarding Instances (VRFs). Within a VPN there can be
         multiple topologies when Multi-topology Routing (MTR) is
         used. Also, Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) can have
         multiple protocol instances running on the device.

         With MTR routing and VRFs, a router now needs to support
         multiple instances of several existing MIB modules, and
         this can be achieved if the router's SNMP agent provides
         access to each instance of the same MIB module via a
         different SNMP context (see Section 3.1.1 of RFC 3411).
         For MTR routing and VRFs, a different SNMP context is needed
         depending on one or more of the following: the VRF, the
         topology-identifier, and the routing protocol instance.
         In other words, the router's management information can be
         accessed through multiple SNMP contexts where each such
         context represents a specific VRF, a specific
         topology-identifier, and/or a specific routing protocol
         instance.  This MIB module provides a mapping of each such
         SNMP context to the corresponding VRF, the corresponding
         topology, and the corresponding routing protocol instance.
         Some SNMP contexts are independent of VRFs, independent of
         a topology, or independent of a routing protocol instance,
         and in such a case, the mapping is to the to the zero length
         string.

         We have also added the mapping to dot1dBasePort from BRIDGE-MIB
         and the vplsConfigIndex from VPLS-MIB as we feel that these
         data distinguishing identifiers will be applicable to a 
         larger subset of the MIBs that are already defined.
         Similarly a mapping from the PwIndex from PWE3-PW-TC-MIB to the 
         dot1dBasePort from BRIDGE-MIB has been defined here.

         As technology evolves more we may need additional
         identifiers to identify the context. Then we would need
         to add those additional identifiers into the mapping.
         We must caution that since there are huge number MIB modules
         defined, if even a small fraction of them needs to have 
         multiple instances in SNMP contexts, then what this

         users to judiciously choose the data distinguishing identifiers

6.  Security Considerations

   The MIB module described in this document in association with 
   SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB and SNMPv3 framework is useful for accessing 
   subsets of data based on various data distinguishing identifiers.

   There are objects in this MIB which are configurable via SNMP.
   If these are configured incorrectly, there can be potential
   data access violations.

   There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability.

7.  Example of usage:


    In snmpContextMappingTable:

            snmpContextMappingContextName      "contextA"{Index}
            snmpContextMappingVrfName          "customerA"
            snmpContextMappingTopologyName     ""
            snmpContextMappingProtoInstName    ""
            snmpContextMappingBridgePort       0
            snmpContextMappingVplsIndex        0
            snmpContextMappingStorageType      (2)volatile
            snmpContextMappingRowStatus        1(active)

            snmpContextMappingContextName      "contextB"{Index}
            snmpContextMappingVrfName          "customerB"
            snmpContextMappingTopologyName     ""
            snmpContextMappingProtoInstName    ""
            snmpContextMappingBridgePort       0
            snmpContextMappingVplsIndex        0
            snmpContextMappingStorageType      (2)volatile
            snmpContextMappingRowStatus        1(active)


    In ospfHostTable from RFC 1850:
 

       [For OSPF Instance on VRF "customerA"]

        ospfHostIpAddress                    "1.2.3.4"{Index}
        ospfHostTOS                           8       {Index}
        ospfHostMetric                        "ab"
        ospfHostStatus                        "1(enabled)"
        ospfHostAreaID                        "1.1.1.1"


       [For OSPF Instance on VRF "customerB"]

        ospfHostIpAddress                    "1.2.3.4"{Index}
        ospfHostTOS                           8       {Index}
        ospfHostMetric                        "ab"
        ospfHostStatus                        "1(enabled)"
        ospfHostAreaID                        "1.1.1.2"

In the above case, we can use the context mapping to distinguish 
data between different OSPF instances eventhough the OID indexes
are the same.
