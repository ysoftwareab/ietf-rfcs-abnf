Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of DVB interfaces in EuroModem v1.0 compliant Cable 
   Network Interface Units. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to 
   the SNMP SMIv2[RFC2578][RFC2579][RFC2580].  The set of objects is 
   consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards. 
    
   This memo is a product of the DVB/DAVIC interoperability consortium 
   which has been adopted as a work item of the IPCDN WG.  Comments are 
   solicited and should be addressed to the author. 
 
    
1. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].  
    
   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in 
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 
        1215 [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described 
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and 
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  
    
   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of 
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards 
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the 
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].  
    
   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of 
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in 
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].  
    
   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described 
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
   the MIB.

3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   Euromodem compliant DVB interfaces.  The specification is derived in 
   part from the parameters and protocols described in the Technical 
   Specification of a European Cable Modem for digital bi-directional 
   communications via cable networks [EUROM]. 
    
   3.1.  Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is structured as three main groups: 
    
   o    Management information pertinent to the MAC layer 
        (dvbNiuMacObjects).  This group is further subdivided into a  
        capabilities group (dvbNiuMacCap) and statistics group  
        (dvbNiuMacStats). 
    
   o    Management information pertinent to RF downstream 
        (dvbNiuDsRfObjects). 
    
   o    Management information pertinent to RF upstream 
        (dvbNiuUsRfObjects). 
    
   The tables contained in each group can be considered extensions to 
   the ifEntry. 
    
   3.1.1.  dvbNiuMacObjects 
    
   dvbNiuMacCapTable - This table describes which MAC capabilities are 
   supported by the NIU. 
    
   DvbNiuMacStatsTable - This table is used to monitor the status and 
   collect statistics for the MAC layer. 
     
   3.1.2.  dvbNiuDsRfObjects 
    
   dvbNiuRfDsTable - This table is used to describe the RF downstream 
   and allows configuration of downstream channel scanning. 
    
   3.1.3.  dvbNiuUsRfObjects 
    
   dvbNiuRfUsTable - This table is used to describe the RF upstream. 
    
   3.2.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the 
   Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  Several areas of correlation are 
   addressed in the following subsections.  The implementer is referred 
   to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general 
   intent of these areas. 
    
   3.2.1.  Layering Model 
    
   An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF Downstream interface, for 
   each RF Upstream interface, and for each RF MAC layer.  The 
   ifStackTable [RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify relationships 
   among sub-interfaces. 
    
   The following example illustrates a MAC interface with one 
   downstream and two upstream channels. 
    
                                  | <== to network layer 
                    +-------------+--------------+ 
                    |           RF MAC           | 
                    +----+---------+-----------+-+ 
                         |         |           | 
               +---------+---+ +---+-------+ +-+---------+ 
               | Downstream1 | | Upstream1 | | Upstream2 | 
               +-------------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ 
    
   As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on 
   top of the downstream and upstream interfaces. 
    
   In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows: 
    
         ifIndex ifType                   Description 
    
         1    dvbRccMacLayer(146)   DVB CATV MAC Layer 
         2    dvbRccDownstream(147) DVB CATV Downstream interface 
         3    dvbRccUpstream(148)   DVB CATV Upstream interface 
         4    dvbRccUpstream(148)   DVB CATV Upstream interface 
    
         The corresponding ifStack entries would then be: 
    
              | IfStackHigherLayer | ifStackLowerLayer | 
              |         0          |         1         | 
              |         1          |         2         | 
              |         1          |         3         | 
              |         1          |         4         | 
              |         2          |         0         | 
              |         3          |         0         | 
              |         4          |         0         | 
    
   3.2.2.  Virtual Circuits 
    
   The DVB MAC layer supports the concept of virtual circuits, but 
   these do not have entries in the ifTable.

5. Security Considerations 
 
   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
   internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects 
   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large 
   number of end-users. 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  In addition to those mentioned above: 
    
   o    dvbNiuRfDsBackupFreq, dvbNiuRfDsHighScanFreq, 
        dvbNiuRfDsScanStep and dvbNiuRfDsLowScanFreq can be manipulated 
        to prevent the NIU from acquiring and locking on to the 
        downstream channel, thus resulting in denial of service. 
    
   This MIB does not affect confidentiality of services on a cable 
   system.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. It is 
   recommended that the implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the User-
   based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View- based Access 
   Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.  
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.
