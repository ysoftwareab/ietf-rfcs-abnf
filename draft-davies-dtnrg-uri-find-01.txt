Internet-Draft       Adding find opname to dtn: URI         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the addition of an extra operation to the
   proposed dtn: URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme documented in
   [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme].

   The purpose of the "find" operation is to allow DTN nodes to access
   services that they do not or cannot support through exchange of DTN
   bundles.  In the spirit of DTN operation, nodes expect to be able to
   operate independently and may not know exactly where such a service
   is implemented, but has a reasonable expectation that such a service
   is provided by another node accessible using DTN.

   Apart from the usual concept of services such as requesting printing
   of a bundle payload or accessing a web proxy, the "find" operation
   can also be used to find gateways onto remote networks that use other
   forms of addressing than the Endpoint IDs (EIDs) normally used to
   identify DTN nodes and to route bundles outside the current
   "association" where the bundles was created.

   When a bundle arrives at a DTN node that implements the service
   indicated, the action taken depends on the service requested.  In the
   case of gateway services, the bundle will simply be forwarded to the
   bundle agent on the addressed node.  For other services, the bundle's
   payload will be passed to the service agent on the node together with
   any parameters derived from the service specification in the
   destination URI.

   In order for the "find" operation to work satisfactorily, the routing
   service, whether static or dynamic, would need to collect and
   propagate information about the "services" offered by the nodes to
   which it was able to route bundles.  With the help of this
   information, the DTN routing system could offer a form of "anycast"
   service that delivered appropriately addressed bundles to one or more
   nodes that offer the services requested in the "find" addressing
   format.  Especially in the dynamic case, service announcements will
   need to be propagated in the DTN network.  The mechanism to be used
   to provide these announcements requires further study.  Where
   services are provided by gateway nodes at the edge of the Internet
   static configuration in some DTN nodes may be sufficient.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft       Adding find opname to dtn: URI         October 2009


3.  Changes to "dtn" Scheme Syntax and Rules

3.1.  Syntax

   The general syntax of a dtn URI as defined in
   [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme] is unchanged except for the addition
   of "find" to opname.  The revised ABNF [RFC5234] is:

   dtnURI = "dtn:" ("none" / nontrivialSSP)

   where:

   nontrivialSSP = dtnURIelt *("!" dtnURIelt)

   dtnURIelt = [opname] ":" URI ; URI as defined in RFC 3986 [*]

   opname = "push" / "pop" / "next" / "flood" / "exec"/ "find"

3.2.  Changes to Resolution of DTN Endpoint IDs

   Section 2.2 of [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme] contains definitions
   of the various operations listed under "opname" in the ABNF.  For the
   "find" operation the following definition should be added after the
   definition of "exec":

   find:  When the operation name is "find", the bundle agent SHOULD use
      information accumulated by the DTN routing system in use to
      forward the bundle towards one or more nodes that are able to
      deliver the requested service or would be better able to forward
      the bundle towards such a node.  However, the node MAY determine
      that it is able to deliver the bundle locally to an agent that can
      provide the requested service: in this case the operation is
      equivalent to the "pop" operation.  If the node is unable to
      determine a suitable target it MAY drop the bundle.

      When the bundle is delivered to a node that provides the specified
      service then, depending on the service specified, the bundle is
      either forwarded to the bundle agent on a node using an
      alternative addressing scheme or passed to the service agent for
      the service on the current node.


4.  Examples

   Several examples of the use of the "find" operation are presented
   split between conventional services delivered by a local service
   agent, such as a SMTP mail server, and services that provide access
   to networks using alternative addressing schemes, such as IPv4.

Internet-Draft       Adding find opname to dtn: URI         October 2009


4.1.  Services Delivered by Local Service Agents

   In these cases the bundle is passed to a service agent that will
   generally be expected to decapsulate the bundle and use the payload
   in combination with any parameters passed in the service description
   in the dtn: URI to deliver the requested service.

4.1.1.  dtn:find:mailto:another@example.org,second@example.org

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle causes the bundle to
   be delivered to a node that provides an (outgoing) email server that
   can forward the payload of the bundle as an email to the specified
   address(es) in the mailto URI or local account(s) to which the email
   can be delivered.  In this case the bundle payload is expected to
   contain one or more emails in [RFC2822] format.

4.1.2.  dtn:find:service:printer?printer-color-supported=true

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle causes the bundle to
   be delivered to a node that provides a printing service.  The
   specified attribute requests that a color capable printer be used to
   print the payload carried in the bundle.  This example uses the
   service: URI template "printer.2.0.en"
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/svrloc-templates/printer.2.0.en>
   that conforms to the specification in [RFC2609].

4.1.3.  dtn:find:service:fax?destination=+4416324960123

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle is intended to cause
   the bundle to be delivered to a node that provides a telephone
   facsimile (fax) service.  Note that this would require the definition
   of a new service: URI template for a fax delivery service which
   provided the "destination" attribute that would be the telephone
   number called.  The payload of the bundle would be sent as a fax to
   the specified destination.

4.1.4.  dtn:find:service:httpproxy:http://example.com/
        somepage.html?depth=3

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle is intended to cause
   the bundle to be delivered to a node that provides a (caching) web
   proxy service.  As with the previous example, this proposes the use
   of a yet-to-be created service: URI template for a web proxy service
   that would access the specified URI using the HTTP protocol.
   Typically the HTML in the page returned from the initial request
   would require additional accesses to build up the entire displayed
   page (c.f., the GNU "wget" tool that returns content from web servers
   <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>).  The "depth" parameter controls

Internet-Draft       Adding find opname to dtn: URI         October 2009


   the depth of recursion of such accesses.  The suite of returned HTML
   documents would be combined into a single bundle that would be
   returned to the requestor.  The complete service would provide
   additional parameters to control the behavior of the service and
   possibly cause repeated operation on a timed basis.

4.1.5.  dtn:find:service:httpproxy:http:?telephone+number+example,
        &width=5,&depth=3

   This example is similar to the previous example in Section 4.1.4,
   except that the intention is to have the service access a suitable
   web search engine (to be chosen by the service provider) to look up
   information according to the query (in this case information about
   example numbers to be used when describing a telephone service) with
   parameters that control the number of returned results (&width
   parameter) to be examined in more detail by accessing the returned
   URIs recursively to the value of the &depth parameter.  Again the
   complete set of results would be returned as a single bundle and
   additional parameters could be defined.

4.2.  Services Delivered by Forwarding the Bundle Using Alternative
      Addressing

   The examples in this section show how the "find" operation could be
   used to deliver bundles to nodes that implement a bundle agent but
   that are also identified by another form of identifier or locator
   than a "universal" dtn: URI.  The means used to deliver the bundle
   will be dependent on the network technology associated with the
   addressing format used.

   In all cases the bundle is forwarded as a bundle rather than being
   decapsulated.  At the destination additional parts of the URI will be
   used to demultiplex the bundle to the appropriate application to
   which it is directed as with conventional EID addressing.

4.2.1.  dtn:find:intent#
        role(?E,coffee),location(?E,Loc),within(100,(1,3),Loc)

   The concept of intentional naming is described in
   [I-D.pbasu-dtnrg-naming].  An example of the naming scheme used with
   the GRAIN (Gradient-Based Algorithm for Intentional Naming) algorithm
   to locate nodes that satisfy the intentional naming specification is
   given at the end of Section 5.5 of the Intentional Naming draft.  The
   mechanism needs additional support from the dtn: URI scheme to be
   usable in a DTN network.  We suggest that the "find" operation could
   be used in the way illustrated in this example to direct bundles to
   appropriate nodes using an intentional naming scheme.  We also note
   that it would also be possible to specify the intentional naming

   mechanism through a service: URI service template which would allow
   it to be used in the wider Internet instead of defined a separate
   "intent" URI scheme restricted to DTN.

4.2.2.  dtn:find:assoc:wanderer3.base1.example.dtn

   The basic naming scheme for DTN nodes (EIDs) anticipates that names
   would be globally valid.  In order to improve the scaling of DTN
   networks, the concept of "associations" has been discussed.  This
   usage of the "find" operation would allow a node to be located via a
   name which was applicable only within a given association.  Routing
   would endeavour to locate a node which was a member of the
   association or find a suitable gateway that might have such
   information.

4.2.3.  dtn:find:dns:foo.bar.example.net

   In this case the bundle is destined for a node in the IP-addressed
   Internet that has an entry in the DNS (Domain Name System), which can
   be looked up to provide an IP address where the bundle can be
   delivered.  The bundle agent "service" could either be accessed
   through a well-known TCP or UDP port or looked up in a DNS service
   record.  The bundle would be delivered using the TCP or (possibly)
   the UDP convergence layer.  The bundle agent can use IPv4 or IPv6
   according to what addresses are provided by DNS, the capabilities of
   the local node and a policy choice if both are available.

4.2.4.  dtn:find:ipv4:192.0.2.27

   This example is equivalent to the previous example except that "find"
   needs to locate a gateway that provides IPv4 connectivity onto the
   Internet.  The forward DNS lookup is not required but it may be
   necessary to perform a reverse lookup to check that the bundle agent
   service is available and determine the protocol and port to use.

4.2.5.  dtn:find:ipv6:[2001:db8::27:ef12]

   A similar example to Section 4.2.4 but using an IPv6 address.  The
   "find" operation needs to locate a gateway providing IPv6
   connectivity onto the Internet.


5.  Security Considerations

   The addition of the "find" operation does not appear to introduce any
   extra security issues beyond the considerable challenges already
   facing DTN security.

6.  IANA Considerations

   It is intended that the "find" operation will be folded into the dtn:
   URI scheme being defined in [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme] which
   will be registered in the URI registry defined in [RFC4395].

   The "find" operation expects to use URIs following the service: URI
   scheme ([RFC2609]) and possibly other existing schemes.  It may
   require the definition of new service templates according to the
   service: URI definition.
