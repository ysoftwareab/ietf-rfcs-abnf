   (twisted) Edwards curves as curves in short-Weierstrass form and
   illustrates how this can be used to implement elliptic curve
   computations using existing implementations that already implement,
   e.g., ECDSA and ECDH using NIST prime curves.

1.  Fostering Code Reuse with New Elliptic Curves

   It is well-known that elliptic curves can be represented using
   different curve models.  Recently, IETF has standardized elliptic
   curves that are claimed to have better performance and improved
   robustness against "real world" attacks than curves represented in
   the traditional "short" Weierstrass model.  This draft specifies an
   alternative representation of points on Curve25519, as specified in
   RFC 7748, and of points on Ed25519, as specified in RFC 8032, as
   points on a specific "short" Weierstrass curve, called Wei25519.

   Use of Wei25519 allows easy definition of signature schemes and key
   agreement schemes already specified for traditional NIST prime
   curves, thereby allowing easy integration with existing

   specifications, such as NIST SP 800-56a and FIPS Pub 186-4, and ANSI
   X9.63-2005, and fostering code reuse on platforms that already
   implement some of these schemes.

   For details, we refer to the appendices.

2.  Security Considerations

   The different representations of elliptic curve points discussed in
   this draft are all obtained using a publicly known transformation.
   Since this transformation is an isomorphism, this transformation maps
   elliptic curve points to equivalent mathematical objects.

3.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA action required for this document.

Appendix A.  Some (non-Binary) Elliptic Curves

A.1.  Curves in short-Weierstrass Form

   Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd
   prime power and where q is not divisible by three.  Let W_{a,b} be
   the Weierstrass curve with defining equation y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b,
   where a and b are elements of GF(q) and where 4*a^3 + 27*b^2 is
   nonzero.  The points of W_{a,b} are the ordered pairs (x, y) whose
   coordinates are elements of GF(q) and which satisfy the defining
   equation (the so-called affine points), together with the special
   point O (the so-called "point at infinity").This set forms a group
   under addition, via the so-called "chord-and-tangent" rule, where the
   point at infinity serves as the identity element.  See Appendix B.1
   for details of the group operation.

A.2.  Montgomery Curves

   Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd
   prime power.  Let M_{A,B} be the Montgomery curve with defining
   equation B*v^2 = u^3 + A*u^2 + u, where A and B are elements of GF(q)
   with A unequal to (+/-)2 and with B nonzero.  The points of M_{A,B}
   are the ordered pairs (u, v) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q)
   and which satisfy the defining equation (the so-called affine
   points), together with the special point O (the so-called "point at
   infinity").This set forms a group under addition, via the so-called
   "chord-and-tangent" rule, where the point at infinity serves as the
   identity element.  See Appendix B.2 for details of the group
   operation.

A.3.  Twisted Edwards Curves

   Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd
   prime power.  Let E_{a,d} be the twisted Edwards curve with defining
   equation a*x^2 + y^2 = 1+ d*x2*y2, where a and d are distinct nonzero
   elements of GF(q).  The points of E_{a,d} are the ordered pairs (x,
   y) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q) and which satisfy the

   defining equation (the so-called affine points).  It can be shown
   that this set forms a group under addition if a is a square in GF(q),
   whereas d is not, where the point (0, 1) serves as the identity
   element.  (Note that the identity element satisfies the defining
   equation.)  See Appendix B.3 for details of the group operation.  An
   Edwards curve is a twisted Edwards curve with a=1.

Appendix B.  Elliptic Curve Group Operations

B.1.  Group Law for Weierstrass Curves

   For each point P on the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, the point at
   infinity O serves as identity element, i.e., P + O = O + P = P.

   For each point P:=(x, y) on the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, the point
   -P is the point (x, -y) and one has P + (-P) = O.

   Let P1:=(x1, y1) and P2:=(x2, y2) be distinct points on the
   Weierstrass curve W{a,b} and let Q:=P1 + P2, where Q is not the
   identity element.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x + x1 + x2 = lambda^2 and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where lambda
       = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).

   Let P:= (x1, y1) be a point on the Weierstrass curve W{a,b} and let
   Q:=2P, where Q is not the identity element.  Then Q:= (x, y), where

       x + 2*x_1 = lambda^2 and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where
       lambda=(3*x1^2 + a)/(2*y1).

B.2.  Group Law for Montgomery Curves

   For each point P on the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, the point at
   infinity O serves as identity element, i.e., P + O = O + P = P.

   For each point P:=(x, y) on the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, the point
   -P is the point (x, -y) and one has P + (-P) = O.

   Let P1:=(x1, y1) and P2:=(x2, y2) be distinct points on the
   Montgomery curve M_{A,B} and let Q:=P1 + P2, where Q is not the
   identity element.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x + x1 + x2 = B*lambda^2 - A and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where
       lambda=(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).

   Let P:= (x1, y1) be a point on the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} and let
   Q:=2P, where Q is not the identity element.  Then Q:= (x, y), where

       x + 2*x_1 = B*lambda^2 - A and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where
       lambda=(3*x1^2 + 2*A*x_1+1)/(2*y1).

B.3.  Group Law for Twisted Edwards Curves

   Note: The group laws below hold for twisted Edwards curves E_{a,d}
   where a is a square in GF(q), whereas d is not.  In this case, the
   addition formula below are defined for each pair of points, without
   exceptions.  Generalizations of this group law to other twisted
   Edwards curves are out of scope.

   For each point P on the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d}, the point
   O=(0,1) serves as identity element, i.e., P + O = O + P = P.

   For each point P:=(x, y) on the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d}, the
   point -P is the point (-x, y) and one has P + (-P) = O.

   Let P1:=(x1, y1) and P2:=(x2, y2) be points on the twisted Edwards
   curve E_{a,d} and let Q:=P1 + P2.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x = (x1*y2 + x2*y1)/(1 + d*x1*x2*y1*y2) and y = (y1*y2 -
       a*x1*x2)/(1 - d*x1*x2*y1*y2).

   Let P:=(x1, y1) be a point on the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} and
   let Q:=2P.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x = (2*x1*y1)/(1 + d*x1^2*y1^2) and y = (y1^2 - a*x1^2)/(1 -
       d*x1^2*y1^2).

Appendix C.  Relationship Between Curve Models

   The non-binary curves specified in Appendix A are expressed in
   different curve models, viz. as curves in short-Weierstrass form, as
   Montgomery curves, or as twisted Edwards curves.  These curve models
   are related, as follows.

C.1.  Mapping between twisted Edwards Curves and Montgomery Curves

   One can map points of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} to points of the
   twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d}, where a:=(A+2)/B and d:=(A-2)/B and,
   conversely, map points of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} to points
   of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, where A:=2(a+d)/(a-d) and where
   B:=4/(a-d).  For twisted Edwards curves we consider (i.e., those
   where a is a square in GF(q), whereas d is not), this defines a one-
   to-one correspondence, which - in fact - is an isomorphism between
   M_{A,B} and E_{a,d}, thereby showing that, e.g., the discrete
   logarithm problem in either curve model is equally hard.

   For the Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves we consider, the
   mapping from M_{A,B} to E_{a,d} is defined by mapping the point at
   infinity O and the point (0, 0) of order two on M_{A,B} to,
   respectively, the point (0, 1) and the point (0, -1) of order two of
   E_{a,d}, while mapping each other point (u, v) on M_{A,B} to the
   point (x, y):=(u/v, (u-1)/(u+1)) on E_{a,d}. The inverse mapping from
   E_{a,d} to M_{A,B} is defined by mapping the point (0, 1) and the
   point (0, -1) of order two of E_{a,d} to, respectively, the point at
   infinity O and the point (0, 0) of order two on M_{A,B}, while each
   other point (x, y) of E_{a,d} is mapped to the point (u,
   v):=((1+y)/(1-y), (1+y)/((1-y)x)) of M_{A,B}.

   Implementations may take advantage of this mapping to carry out
   elliptic curve group operations originally defined for a twisted
   Edwards curve on the corresponding Montgomery curve, or vice-versa,
   and translating the result back to the original curve, thereby
   potentially allowing code reuse.

C.2.  Mapping between Montgomery Curves and Weierstrass Curves

   One can map points on the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} to points on the
   Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, where a:=(3-A^2)/(3*B^2) and
   b:=(2*A^3-9*A)/(27*B^3).  This defines a one-to-one correspondence,
   which - in fact - is an isomorphism between M_{A,B} and W_{a,b},
   thereby showing that, e.g., the discrete logarithm problem in either
   curve model is equally hard.

   The mapping from M_{A,B} to W_{a,b} is defined by mapping the point
   at infinity O on M_{A,B} to the point at infinity O on W_{a,b}, while
   mapping each other point (u, v) of M_{A,B} to the point (x, y):=(u/
   B+A/3B, v/B) of W_{a,b}. Note that not all Weierstrass curves can be
   injectively mapped to Montgomery curves, since the latter have a
   point of order two and the former may not.  In particular, if a
   Weierstrass curve has prime order, such as is the case with the so-
   called "NIST curves", this inverse mapping is not defined.

   This mapping can be used to implement elliptic curve group operations
   originally defined for a twisted Edwards curve or for a Montgomery
   curve using group operations on the corresponding elliptic curve in
   short-Weierstrass form and translating the result back to the
   original curve, thereby potentially allowing code reuse.  Note that
   implementations for elliptic curves with short-Weierstrass form that
   hard-code the domain parameter a to a= -3 (which value is known to
   allow more efficient implementations) cannot always be used this way,
   since the curve W_{a,b} may not always be expressed in terms of a
   Weierstrass curve with a=-3 via a coordinate transformation.

C.3.  Mapping between twisted Edwards Curves and Weierstrass Curves

   One can map points of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} to points of
   the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, via function composition, where one
   uses the isomorphic mapping between twisted Edwards curve and
   Montgomery curves of Appendix C.1 and the one between Montgomery and
   Weierstrass curves of Appendix C.2.  Obviously, one can use function
   composition (now using the respective inverses) to realize the
   inverse of this mapping.

Appendix D.  Curve25519 and Cousins

D.1.  Curve Definition and Alternative Representations

   The elliptic curve Curve25519 is the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} defined
   over the prime field GF(p), with p:=2^{255}-19, where A:=486662 and
   B:=1.  This curve has order h*n, where h=8 and where n is a prime
   number.  For this curve, A^2-4 is not a square in GF(p), whereas A+2
   is.  The quadratic twist of this curve has order h1*n1, where h1=4
   and where n1 is a prime number.  For this curve, the base point is
   defined to be the ordered pair (Gu,Gv) of elements of GF(p), where
   Gu=9 and where Gv is an odd integer in the interval [0, p-1].

   This curve has the same group structure as (is "isomorphic" to) the
   twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} defined over GF(p), with as base point
   the ordered pair (Gx,Gy) of elements of GF(p), where parameters are
   as specified in Appendix D.3.  This curve is denoted as Ed25519.  For
   this curve, the parameter a is a square in GF(p), whereas d is not,
   so the group laws of Appendix B.3 apply.

   The curve is also isomorphic to the elliptic curve W_{a,b} in short-
   Weierstrass form defined over GF(p), with as base point the ordered
   pair (Gx',Gy') of elements, where parameters are as specified in
   Appendix D.3.  This curve is denoted as Wei25519.

D.2.  Switching between Alternative Representations

   Each point (u,v) of Curve25519 corresponds to the point (x,y):=(u +
   A/3,y) of Wei25519, while the point at infinity of Curve25519
   corresponds to the point at infinity of Wei25519.  (Here, we used the
   mapping of Appendix C.2.)  Under this mapping, the base point (Gu,Gv)
   of Curve25519 corresponds to the base point (Gx',Gy') of Wei25519.
   The inverse mapping maps the point (x,y) on Wei25519 to (u,v):=(x -
   A/3,y) on Curve25519, while mapping the point at infinity of Wei25519
   to the point at infinity on Curve25519.  Note that this mapping
   involves a simple shift of the first coordinate and can be
   implemented via integer-only arithmetic as a shift of (p+A)/3 for the

   The curve Ed25519 is isomorphic to the curve Curve25519, where the
   base point (Gu,Gv) of Curve25519 corresponds to the base point
   (Gx,Gy) of Ed25519 and where the point at infinity and the point
   (0,0) of order two of Curve25519 correspond to, respectively, the

   (Here, we used the mapping of Appendix C.1.)  The inverse mapping
   from Ed25519 to Curve25519 is defined by mapping the point (0, 1) and
   the point (0, -1) of order two of Ed25519 to, respectively, the point
   at infinity and the point (0,0) of order two of Curve25519 and having
   each other point (x, y) of Ed25519 correspond to the point ((1 +
   y)/(1 - y), c(1 + y)/((1-y)x)).

   The curve Ed25519 is isomorphic to the Weierstrass curve Wei25519,
   where the base point (Gx,Gy) of Ed25519 corresponds to the base point
   (Gx',Gy') of Wei25519 and where the identity element (0,1) and the
   point (0,-1) of order two of Ed25519 correspond to, respectively, the
   point at infinity O and the point (A/3, 0) of order two of Wei25519
   and where each other point (x, y) of Ed25519 corresponds to the point
   (x', y'):=((1+y)/(1-y)+A/3, c(1+y)/((1-y)*x)) of Wei25519, where c
   was defined before.  (Here, we used the mapping of Appendix C.3.)
   The inverse mapping from Wei25519 to Ed25519 is defined by mapping
   the point at infinity O and the point (A/3, 0) of order two of
   Wei25519 to, respectively, the identity element (0,1) and the point
   (0,-1)) of order two of Ed25519 and having each other point (x, y) of
   Wei25519 correspond to the point (c*(3*x+A)/(3*y), (x+A-3)/(x+A+3)).

   Note that these mappings can be easily realized in projective
   coordinates, using a few field multiplications only, thus allowing
   switching between alternative representations with negligible
   relative incremental cost.

D.3.  Domain Parameters

   The parameters of the Montgomery curve and the corresponding
   isomorphic curves in twisted Edwards curve and short-Weierstrass form
   are as indicated below.  Here, the domain parameters of Curve25519
   and Ed25519 are as specified in RFC 7748; the domain parameters of
   Wei25519 are "new".
