Abstract
   
   This memo describes the Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) [RFC3031] management architecture and the inter-
   relationships between the different management information
   bases (MIBs).


1. Introduction
   
   This memo describes the  Management Architecture for Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching. In particular, it describes how
   various managed objects defined in various Management
   Information Base (MIB) documents model different aspects of
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [MPLSArch].
   Furthermore, this document explains the interactions and
   dependencies between each of these documents.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list
   at mpls@uu.net.
   
   
   
   This draft does not propose any additions to the MPLS MIB
   framework, nor define any standards for the Internet
   community.  It is an informational draft.


2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture

   document [MPLSArch] and various MPLS-related MIBs such as
   the MPLS-TC-MIB [TCMIB], MPLS-LSR-MIB [LSRMIB], MPLS-TE-MIB
   [TEMIB], MPLS-LDP-MIB [LDPMIB], MPLS-FTN-MIB [FTNMIB], and
   the MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING-MIB [LBMIB].


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
      [RFC2571].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
      for the purpose of management.  The first version of
      this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is
      called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155
      [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD 16, RFC
      1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is
      described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC
      2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of
      the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in
      RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
      [RFC2574].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157
      [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
      [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
      described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.

Internet Draft          MPLS Management Overview         October 2001



   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.


4. MIBs Addressed by the MPLS Management Framework
   
   This section briefly explains what the purpose of each MPLS
   related MIB is and what it can be used for.  Each section
   contains a subsection that details the interdependencies
   between that MIB and any of the other MPLS MIBs.


4.1.  MPLS-TC-MIB
   
   The MPLS-TC-MIB [TCMIB] describes textual conventions
   [RFC2579] and object identities that may be common to MPLS-
   related MIBs. For example, the textual convention for
   representing an MPLS label should be commonly represented
   and used by all MPLS-related MIBs.


4.2.  MPLS-LSR-MIB
   
   The MPLS-LSR-MIB describes managed objects for modeling a
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] Label
   Switch Router (LSR). In particular, this MIB is used to
   model and manage the basic label switching behavior and the
   label forwarding information base (LFIB) of an MPLS LSR. In
   doing so, the MIB provides a view of the LSPs that are
   being switched by the LSR in question.
   
   This MIB is the basis for many of the MPLS MIBs, since
   basic MPLS label switching is common to all MPLS
   applications.  In general, the MPLS-LSR-MIB provides a
   model of incoming labels on MPLS-enabled interfaces being
   mapped to outgoing labels on MPLS-enabled interfaces via a
   conceptual object called an MPLS cross-connect. MPLS cross-
   connect entries and their properties are represented in the
   MPLS cross-connect table (mplsXCTable) in the LSR MIB. MPLS
   cross-connect entries are typically referred to by other
   MIBs in order to reference the underlying MPLS LSP.
   
   For example, the MPLS-TE-MIB [TEMIB] models traffic
   engineered tunnels.  These tunnels map to one more
   underlying MPLS LSPs. Thus, the MPLS-TE-MIB's tunnel table
   (mplsTunnelTable) entries refer to the underlying LSP by
   pointing to entries in mplsXCTable.

4.2.1.   Dependencies

Internet Draft          MPLS Management Overview         October 2001



   This MIB does not directly depend upon any other MPLS MIBs.
   It does represent MPLS-enabled interfaces as entries in the
   Interfaces MIB [RFC2233] Interface Table (ifTable). This
   MIB imports several textual conventions from the MPLS-TC-
   MIB [TCMIB].


4.3.  MPLS-LDP-MIB
   
   The MPLS-LDP-MIB describes managed objects used to model
   and manage the Multiprotocol Label Switching Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP).

4.3.1.   Dependencies
   
   The LDP MIB [LDPMIB] has three mapping tables -
   mplsLdpSesInLabelMapTable, mplsLdpSesOutLabelMapTable and
   mplsLdpSesXCMapTable - which map the LDP MIBÆs
   representation of LDP sessions to the underlying LSR MIBÆs
   representation of the LSPs created by these sessions by
   pointing to mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and
   mplsXCTable, respectively. The LDP MIBÆs mplsXCsFecsTable
   shows the relationship between between forwarding
   equivalence classes (FECs) and cross-connect entries by
   referring to entries in the LSR MIBÆs mplsXCTable.
   
   This MIB also imports several textual conventions from the
   MPLS-TC-MIB [TCMIB].


4.4.  MPLS-TE-MIB
   
   The MPLS-TE-MIB [TEMIB] describes managed objects that are
   used to model and manage MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE)
   Tunnels. The MIB is based around a table that represents TE
   tunnels that either originate at the LSR in question or
   traverse via or terminate on the LSR. Note that the later
   case is optional, as only tunnel "heads" are required to be
   represented. This MIB provides statistics and configuration
   objects needed for TE tunnels.

4.4.1.   Dependencies
   
   This MIB depends on the MPLS-LSR-MIB [LSRMIB] and
   Interfaces MIB [RFC2233]. Tunnel entries in the MPLS-TE-
   MIBÆs mplsTunnelTable refer to entries in mplsXCTable in
   the MPLS-LSR-MIB. When MPLS TE tunnels are represented as
   interfaces, entries for such tunnels in mplsTunnelTable
   have corresponding entries in the Interfaces MIBÆs
   [RFC2233] Interfaces Table (ifTable). This MIB also imports

Internet Draft          MPLS Management Overview         October 2001



   several textual conventions from the MPLS-TC-MIB [TCMIB].


4.5.  MPLS-FTN-MIB
   
   The MPLS-FTN-MIB [FTNMIB] describes managed objects that
   are used to model and manage the MPLS FEC-to-NHLFE mappings
   which take place at any LSR that is on the edge between an
   MPLS domain and a non-MPLS domain. On each such edge LSR,
   to map traffic from the non-MPLS domain into the MPLS
   domain, the FEC-to-NHLFE mapping objects in the MPLS-FTN-
   MIB must be supported.  In the case of an IP-to-MPLS
   mapping, the FEC objects describe IP 5-tuples representing
   IP source and destination ranges, protocol ranges etc.
   Matching IP packets can be mapped to an NHLFE which can
   either be an MPLS LSP or an MPLS TE tunnel.

4.5.1.   Dependencies
   
   This MIB relies directly on the MPLS-LSR-MIB [LSRMIB] and
   MPLS-TE-MIB [TEMIB]. FECs can be mapped to two types of
   NHLFEs by the MPLS-FTN-MIB. When the NHLFE is an LSP, the
   FEC-to-NHLFE mapping is accomplished by referring to a
   corresponding entry in mplsXCTable in the MPLS-LSR-MIB.
   When the NHLFE is an MPLS TE tunnel, this mapping is
   accomplished by referring to a corresponding entry in
   mplsTunnelTable in MPLS-TE-MIB.


4.6.  MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING-MIB
   
   The MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING-MIB [LBMIB] describes managed
   objects that are used to model and manage the MPLS TE
   interfaces, as well as the link bundling relationships that
   may exist between those interfaces.

4.6.1.   Dependencies
   
   The MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING-MIB [LBMIB] interacts directly only
   with the Interfaces MIB [RFC2233]; it references MPLS TE
   interfaces that are modeled by entries in the interfaces
   table (ifTable) in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2233].


4.7.  PPVPN-MPLS-VPN-MIB
   
   The PPVPN-MPLS-VPN-MIB [VPNMIB] describes managed objects
   that are used to model and manage RFC2277bis MPLS VPNs.
   This MIB contains tables which model virtual routing
   forwarding entries (VRFs), as well as the interfaces

Internet Draft          MPLS Management Overview         October 2001



   associated with those VRFs.

4.7.1.   Dependencies
   
   This MIB currently has no direct dependencies to any of the
   MPLS MIBs. This MIB does model MPLS VPN interfaces as
   entries in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2233].  This MIB may be
   modified in the future to import textual conventions from
   the MPLS-TC-MIB [TCMIB].


5. Dependencies on Other IETF Working Groups
   
   This section will detail the broad interactions between
   other working groups and the MPLS MIBs.


5.1.  Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge to Edge MIBs
   
   The Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge to Edge (pwe3) working group
   has produced a framework [PWE3ARCH] describes a framework
   for PWE3 MIBs. Since the PWE3 architecture includes the use
   of MPLS as an emulated service and as a PSN service, the
   MPLS MIBs described above may be leveraged.  This framework
   document describes the interactions between the MPLS MIBs
   and the PWE3 MIBs.


5.2.  Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network MIBs
   
   At present, the Provider Provisioned Virtual Private
   Network (PPVPN) working group has not included a discussion
   of how the MPLS MIBs interact with the MIBs being produced
   by that working group.  The authors of this draft hope to
   make a forthcoming addition to their framework [PPVPNFW]
   document detailing these interactions. At the moment, there
   is only a single MIB produced which interacts with the MPLS
   MIBs, as this MIB is described above in section


5.3.  Common Control and Measurement Plane (CCAMP) WG
   
   At present, there are no MIBs produced by the CCAMP working
   group that interact directly with the MPLS MIBs.  However,
   in the future, the existing MPLS MIBs will need to be
   extended and augmented to facilitate the technology being
   produced by this working group.


6. Security Considerations

   This document describes the inter-relationships amongst the
   different MIBs relevant to MPLS management and as such does
   not have any security implications beyond those imposed by
   these MIBs themselves.
