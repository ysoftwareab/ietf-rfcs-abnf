Abstract 
    
   Routing protocols have over time been extended to use cryptographic 
   mechanisms to validate data being received from a neighboring router 
   to ensure that:  
    
   o it has not been modified in transit.   
   o actually originated from an authorized neighboring router .   
    
   The cryptographic mechanisms defined to date and described in this 
   document rely on a digest produced with a hash algorithm applied to 
   the payload encapsulated in the routing protocol packet.      
    
   This document outlines some of the limitations of the current 
   mechanism, problems with manual keying of these cryptographic 
   algorithms, and possible vectors for the exploitation of these 
   limitations.

1. Problem Statement 
    
   Protocols, such as OSPF version 2 [RFC2328], version 3 [RFC5340], IS-
   IS [RFC1195], BGP-4 [RFC4271] and BFD [BFD-BASE], employ various 
   mechanisms to create a cryptographic digest of each transmitted 
   protocol packet. Traditionally, these digests are the results of a 
   one-way hash algorithm, such as MD5 [RFC1321], across the contents of 
   the packet being transmitted. A secret key is used as the hash base 
   (or seed).  The digest is then recomputed by the receiving router, 
   using the same key as the original router used to create the hash, 
   then compared with the transmitted digest to verify: 
    
   o That the router originating this packet is authorized via the      
     shared key mechanism to peer with the local router, and exchange  
     routing data.  The implicit trust of routing protocol exchange  
     protected by a shared secret is intended to protect against the  
     injection of falsely generated routing data being injected into  
     the routing system by unauthorized systems. 
    
   o That the data has not been  altered in transit between the 
     two neighboring routers. 
    
   Digest verification schemes are not intended to protect the 
   confidentiality of information being exchanged between routers. The 
   information (entries in the routing table) is potentially available 
   through other mechanisms; Moreover, access to the physical media 
   between two routers exchanging routing data, will confer the ability 
   to capture or otherwise discover the contents of the routing tables 
   in those routers. 
    
   Authentication mechanisms defined today have notable limitations: 
    
   o Manual configuration of shared secret keys, especially in large 
     networks and between networks, poses a major management problem.   
     In many cases it is challenging to replace keys without significant  
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 3]

     coordination or disruption.   
    
   o In some cases, when manual keys are configured, some forms of 
     replay protection are no longer possible , allowing the routing  
     protocol to be attacked through the replay of captured routing  
     messages. 
    
   o The MD5 digest algorithm was not designed to be used in the way  
     most routing protocols are using it which has potentially serious    
     future implications. 
    
   This document outlines some of the problems with manual keying of 
   these cryptographic algorithms.  
    
1.1 MD5 Pre-Image vs Collision Attacks  
    
   A preimage attack (An attempt to find new data with the same hash 
   value) would enable someone to find an input message that causes a 
   hash function to produce a particular output. In contrast, a 
   collision attack finds two messages with the same hash, but the 
   attacker can't pick what the message will be. Feasible collision 
   attacks against MD4, MD5, HAVAL-128, and RIPEMD were found by the 
   Chinese researcher Xiaoyun Wang with co-authors Dengguo Feng, Xuejia 
   Lai, and Hongbo Yu.  
    
   The ability to produce a collision does not currently introduce any 
   obvious or known attacks on routing protocols. Pre-image attacks have 
   the potential to cause problems in the future albeit due to the 
   message length there are serious limitations to the feasibility of 
   mounting such an attack. 
    
   Protocols themselves have some built-in protection against collision 
   attacks. This is because a lot of values for fields in a protocol 
   packet are invalid or will produce an unusable packet. For example, 
   in OSPF the LSA type can be from 1 to 11. Any other value in the 
   field will result in the packet being discarded. 
    
   Assume two packets M and M' are generated which have the same hash. 
   The above condition will further reduce the ability to produce a 
   message which is also a correct message from the protocol 
   perspective, as a lot of potential values are themselves not valid. 
    
2. Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv2) 
  
   OSPF [RFC2328] describes the use of an MD5 digest with OSPF packets. 
   MD5 keys are manually configured. The OSPF packet Header includes an   
   authentication type field as well as 64 bits of data for use by the 
   appropriate authentication scheme. OSPF also provides for a non-   
   decreasing sequence number to be included in each OSPF protocol   
   packet to protect against replay attacks. 
    
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 4] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
2.1 Management Issues with OSPF 
    
   According to the OSPF specification [RFC2328], digests are applied to 
   packets transmitted between adjacent neighbors, rather than being 
   applied to the routing information originated by a router (digests 
   are not applied at the LSA level, but rather at the packet level). 
   [RFC2328] states that any set of OSPF routers adjacent across a 
   single link may use a different key to build MD5 digests than the key 
   used to build MD5 digests on any other link.  Thus, MD5 keys may be 
   configured, and changed, on a per-link basis in an OSPF network. 
    
   OSPF does not specify a mechanism to negotiate keys, nor does it 
   specify any mechanism to negotiate the hash algorithms to be used. 
    
   With the proliferation of the number of hash algorithms, as well as 
   the need to continuously upgrade the algorithms, manually configuring 
   the information becomes very tedious. It should also be noted that 
   rekeying OSFP requires coordination among the adjacent routers. 
    
2.2 Technical Issues with OSPF 
    
   While OSPF provides relatively strong protection through the 
   inclusion of MD5 signatures, with additional data and a sequence 
   numbers in transmitted packets, there are still attacks against OSPF: 
    
   o  The sequence number is initialized to zero when forming an 
      adjacency with a newly discovered neighbor. When an adjacency is  
      brought down the sequence number is also set to zero. If the 
      cryptographically protected packets of a router that is brought 
      down (for administrative or other reasons) are replayed by a 
      malicious router, traffic could be forced through the malicious 
      router.  A malicious router might then induce routing loops,  
      intercept or blackhole the traffic. 
    
   o  OSPF allows multiple packets with the same sequence number. 
      This means that the possibility exists to replay the same packet 
      many times before the next legitimate packet is sent.  An attacker  
      may resend the  same packet repeatedly until the next hello packet  
      is transmitted and received. The Hello interval which is unknown 
      determines the attack window. 
    
   o  OSPF does not require the use of any particular hash algorithm, 
      however the use of only MD5 digests for authentication and replay  
      protection is specified in the document. Most OSPF implementations  
      only support MD5 in addition to Null and Simple Password  
      authentication. 
    
      Recently, limitations in collision-resistance properties of the  
      MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions have been discovered; [RFC4270]  
      summarizes the discoveries. Attacks on many applications of MD5  
      are practical on modern computers. For this reason the general use  
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
      of these algorithms should to be discouraged.[RFC5709] adds  
      support for using HMAC-SHA with OSPF. 
    
   o  OSPF on a broadcast network shares the same key between all  
      neighbors on that broadcast network. Some OSPF packets are sent to 
      a multicast address.  
    
      Spoofing by any malicious neighbor possessing credentials or  
      replayable packets is therefore very easy. Possession of the key  
      itself is used as an identity validation and no other identity 
      check is used. A malicious neighbor could send a packet forging  
      the identity as being from an other neighbor. There would be no  
      way in which the victim could distinguish the identity of the  
      packet sender. 
    
   o  OSPF neighbors on broadcast, NBMA and point-to-multipoint  
      networks are identified by the IP address in the IP header.  
      The IP header is not covered by the MAC in the cryptographic  
      authentication scheme as described in RFC 2328, and an attack can 
      be made to exploit this omission. 
 
      Assume the following scenario. 
 
      R1 sends an authenticated HELLO to R2. This HELLO is captured  
      and replayed back to R1. The source IP in the IP header of the 
      replayed packet is changed to that of R2. 
 
      R1, not finding itself in HELLO would deduce that the connection  
      is not bidirectional and would bring down the adjacency. 
    
3. Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv3) 
 
   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] relies on the IP Authentication Header [RFC4302]  
   and the IP Encapsulating Payload [RFC4303] to cryptographically sign 
   routing information passed between routers. 
    
   When using ESP, the null encryption algorithm [RFC2410] is used, so 
   the data carried in the OSPFv3 packets is signed, but not encrypted.  
   This provides data origin authentication for adjacent routers, and 
   data integrity which gives the assurance data transmitted by a router 
   has not changed in transit. 
    
   However it does not provide confidentiality of the information 
   transmitted. [RFC4552] mandates the use of ESP with null encryption 
   for authentication and also does encourage the use of confidentiality 
   to protect the privacy of the routing information transmitted, using 
   ESP encryption. 
    

Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
   Authentication/Confidentiality for OSPFv3 [RFC4552] mandates the use 
   of ESP with null encryption for authentication and also does 
   encourage the use of confidentiality to protect the privacy of the 
   routing information transmitted, using ESP encryption. It however 
   only specifies the use of manual keying of routing information as 
   discussed in the following section. 
    
3.1 Management Issues with OSPFv3 
    
   The OSPFv3 security document - Authentication/Confidentiality for 
   OSPFv3 [RFC4552] discusses, at length, the reasoning behind using 
   manually configured keys, rather than some automated key management 
   protocol such as IKEv2 [RFC4306]. The primary problem is that all 
   current key management mechanisms are designed for a one-to-one 
   correlation of keys, while OSPF adjacencies are formed on a one-to-
   many basis.  This forces the system administrator to use manually 
   configured SAs and cryptographic keys to provide the authentication 
   and, if desired, confidentiality services. 
    
   Regarding replay protection [RFC4552] states that: 
    
      As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide 
      complete replay protection while using manual keying, the proposed 
      solution will not provide protection against replay attacks. 
    
   The primary administrative issue with manually configured SAs and 
   keys in the OSPFv3 case is the management issues, maintaining shared 
   sets of keys on all routers within a network.  As with OSPFv2 
   rekeying is an infrequent event requiring coordination. [RFC4552] 
   does not require that all OSPFv3 routers have the same key configured 
   for every neighbor, so each set of neighbors connected to a given 
   link could have a different key configured.  While this makes it 
   easier to change the keys, by forcing the system administrator to 
   only change the keys on the routers on a single link, the process of 
   manual configuration for all the routers in a network to change the 
   keys used for OSPFv3 digests and confidentiality on a periodic basis 
   can be difficult. 
    
3.2 Technical Issues with OSPFv3 
    
   The primary technical concern with the current specifications for 
   OSPFv3 is that when manual SA and key management is used as [RFC4302] 
   specifies, in section 3.3.2, Sequence Number Generation: "The sender 
   assumes anti-replay is enabled as a default, unless otherwise 
   notified by the receiver (see 3.4.3) or if the SA was configured 
   using manual key management." Replaying OSPFv3 packets can induce 
   several failures in a network, including: 
    
   o  Replaying hello packets with an empty neighbor list can cause all 
      the neighbor adjacencies with the sending router to be reset, 
      disrupting network communications. 
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
    
   o  Replaying hello packets from early in the designated router 
      election process on broadcast links can cause all the neighbor 
      adjacencies with the sending router to be reset, disrupting 
      network communications. 
    
   o  Replaying database description (DB-Description) packets can cause 
      all FULL neighbor adjacencies with the sending router to be reset, 
      disrupting network communications. 
    
   o  Replaying link state request (LS-Request) packets can cause all 
      FULL neighbor adjacencies with the sending router to be reset, 
      disrupting network communications. 
    
   o  Capturing a full adjacency process (from two-way all the way to 
      FULL state), and then replaying this process when the router is no 
      longer attached can cause a false adjacency to be formed, allowing 
      an attacker to attract traffic. 
    
   o  OSPFv3 on a broadcast network shares the same key between all  
      neighbors on that network. Some OSPF packets are sent to a  
      multicast address.  
    
      Spoofing by a malicious neighbor is very easy. Possession of the  
      key itself is used as an identity check. There is no other  
      identity check used. A neighbor could send a packet specifying the  
      packet came from some other neighbor and there would be no way in  
      which the attacked router could figure out the identity of the  
      packet sender. 
    
4. Intermediate System to Intermediate System Routing Protocol (IS-IS) 
    
   Integrated IS-IS [RFC1195] uses HMAC-MD5 (Hashed Message 
   Authentication Code MD5) authentication with manual keying, as 
   described in [RFC5304] and has recently been extended to provide 
   support for using the HMAC construct along with the Secure Hash 
   Algorithm (SHA) [RFC5310] family of cryptographic hash functions. 
   There is no provision within IS-IS to encrypt the body of a routing 
   protocol message. 
    
4.1 Management Issues with IS-IS 
    
   [RFC5304] states that each Link State Packet (LSP) generated by an 
   intermediate system is signed with the HMAC-MD5 algorithm using a key 
   manually defined by the network administrator.  Since authentication 
   is performed on the LSPs transmitted by an intermediate system, 
   rather than on the packets transmitted to a specific neighbor, it is 
   implied that all the intermediate systems within a single flooding 
   domain must be configured with the same key for authentication to 
   work correctly.  
    
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 8] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
   The initial configuration of manual keys for authentication within an 
   IS-IS network is simplified by a state where LSPs containing HMAC-
   MD5/HMAC-SHA authentication TLVs are accepted by intermediate systems 
   without the keys, but the digest is not validated. Once keys are 
   configured on all routers, changing those keys becomes much more 
   difficult. 
    
   IS-IS [RFC1195] does not specify a mechanism to negotiate keys, nor 
   does it specify any mechanism to negotiate the hash algorithms to be 
   used. 
    
   With the proliferation of available hash algorithms, as well as the 
   need to upgrade the algorithms, manually configuration requires 
   coordination among intermediate systems which can become tedious. 
    
4.2 Technical Issues with IS-IS 
    
   [RFC5304] states: "This mechanism does not prevent replay attacks, 
   however, in most cases, such attacks would trigger existing 
   mechanisms in the IS-IS protocol that would effectively reject old 
   information." 
    
   The few cases where existing mechanisms in the IS-IS protocol would 
   not effectively reject old information is the case of Hello packets 
   or the Intermediate System to Intermediate System Hellos (IIHs) that 
   are used to discover neighbors, and the Sequence Number 
   Packets(SNPs). 
    
   As described in IS-IS [RFC1195], a list of known neighbors is 
   included in each Hello transmitted by an intermediate system, to 
   ensure two-way communications with any specific neighbor before 
   exchanging link state databases.   
    
   IS-IS does not provide a sequence number. IS-IS packets are 
   vulnerable to replay attacks; any packet can be replayed at any point 
   of time. So long as the keys used are the same, protocol elements 
   that would not be rejected will affect existing sessions. 
    
   A hello packet containing a digest within a TLV, and an empty 
   neighbor list, could be replayed, resulting in all adjacencies with 
   the original transmitting intermediate system to be restarted. 
    
   A replay of an old Complete Sequence Number Packet (CSNP) could cause 
   LSPs to be flooded, resulting  in an LSP storm. 
    
   IS-IS specifies the use of the HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA-1 to protect  
   IS-IS packets. 
    
   IS-IS does not have a notion of Key ID. During key rollover, each 
   message received has to be checked for integrity against all keys 
   that are valid. A Denial of Service (DoS) attack may be induced by 
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 9] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
   sending IS-IS packets with random hashes. This will cause the IS-IS 
   packet to be checked for authentication with all possible keys, 
   increasing the amount of processing required. This issue however has 
   been fixed in the recent [RFC5310] which introduces the concept of 
   Key IDs in IS-IS. 
    
   Recently, attacks on the collision-resistance property of the MD5 and 
   SHA-1 hash functions have been discovered; [RFC4270] summarizes the 
   discoveries. The attacks on MD5 are practical on any modern computer. 
   For this reason, the use of these algorithms should be deprecated. 
    
   HMACs are not susceptible to known collision-reduction attacks. IS-IS 
   implementations should provide a way to upgrade to other algorithms 
   should the need arise. 
    
   IS-IS on a broadcast network shares the same key between all 
   neighbors on that network.  
    
   This makes spoofing by a malicious neighbor easy since IS-IS packets 
   are sent to a link layer multicast address. Possession of the Key 
   itself is used as an authorization check. A neighbor could send a 
   packet spoofing the identity of a neighbor and there would be no way 
   in which the attacked router could discern the identity of the 
   malicious packet sender.  
    
   The Remaining Lifetime field in the LSP is not covered by the 
   authentication. An IS-IS router can receive its own self generated 
   LSP segment with zero lifetime remaining. In that case, if it has a 
   copy with non-zero lifetime, it purges that LSP i.e., it increments 
   the current sequence number and floods all the segments again. This 
   is much worse in IS-IS compared to OSPF, because there is only one 
   LSP other than the pseudonode LSPs for the LANs on which it is the 
   Designated Intermediate System (DIS). 
    
   This way an attacker can force the router to flood all segments, 
   potentially a large number if the number of routes is large. It also 
   causes the sequence number of all the LSPs to increase fast. If the 
   sequence number increases to the maximum (0xFFFFFFFF), the IS-IS 
   process must shut down for around 20+ minutes (the product of MaxAge 
   + ZeroAgeLifetime) to allow the old LSPs to age out of all the router 
   databases. 
    
5. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) 
 
   BGP-4 [RFC4271] uses TCP [RFC0793] for transporting routing 
   information between BGP speakers which have formed an adjacency. 
    
   [RFC2385] describes the use of TCP MD5 signature option for providing 
   packet origin authentication and data integrity protection of BGP 
   packets. [RFC3562] provides suggestions for choosing the key length 

Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 10] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
   of the ad-hoc keyed-MD5 mechanism specified in [RFC2385]. There is no 
   provision for confidentiality for any of these BGP messages. 
    
   BGP relative to previously described IGP protocols has additional 
   exposure due to the nature of the environment where it is typically 
   used, namely between autonomous networks (under different 
   administrative control). While routers running interior gateway 
   protocols may all be configured with the same administrative 
   authority, two BGP peers may be in different administrative domains, 
   having different policies for key strength, rollover frequency, etc. 
   An autonomous system must often support a large number of keys at 
   different BGP boundaries, as each connecting AS represents a 
   different administrative entity. In practice once set, shared secrets 
   between BGP peers are rarely if ever changed. 
    
5.1 Management Issues with BGP-4 
    
   Each pair of BGP speakers forming a peering may have a different 
   MD5 shared key facilitating the independent configuration and 
   changing of keys across a large scale network.  Manual configuration 
   and maintenance of cryptographic keys across all BGP sessions is a 
   challenge in any large scale environment.   
    
   Most BGP implementations will accept BGP packets with a bad digest up 
   to the hold interval negotiated between BGP peers at peering startup, 
   in order to allow for MD5 keys to be changed with minimal impact on 
   operation of the network.  This technique does, however, allow some 
   short period of time, during which an attacker may inject BGP packets 
   with false MD5 digests into the network and can expect those packets 
   to be accepted, even though the MD5 digest is not valid. 
    
5.2 Technical Issues with BGP-4 
    
   BGP relies on TCP [RFC0793] for transporting data between BGP 
   speakers. BGP can rely on TCP's protection against data corruption 
   and replay to preclude replay attacks against BGP sessions.  A great 
   deal of research has gone into the feasibility of an attacker 
   overcoming these protections, including [TCP-WINDOW] and [BGP-
   ATTACK].  Most router and Operating System (OS) vendors have modified 
   their TCP implementations to resolve the security vulnerabilities 
   described in these references, where possible. 
    
   As mentioned earlier, MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, and can 
   be attacked through several means, such as those explored in [MD5-
   ATTACK]. 
    
   Though it can be argued that the collision attacks do not have a 
   practical application in this scenario, the use of MD5 should be 
   discouraged.  
    

Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 11] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
   Routers performing cryptographic processing of packets in software 
   may be exposed to additional opportunities for DoS attacks. An 
   attacker may be able to transmit enough spoofed traffic with false 
   digests that the router's processor and memory resources are 
   consumed, causing the router to be unable to perform normal 
   processing. This exposure is particularly problematic between routers 
   not under unified administrative control. 
    
6. The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
 
   The initial version of RIP was specified in STD34 [RFC1058]. This 
   version did not provide for any authentication or authorization of 
   routing data, and thus was vulnerable to any of a number of attacks 
   against routing protocols. This limitation was one reason why this 
   protocol was moved to Historic status [RFC1923]. 
    
   RIPv2, originally specified in [RFC1388], then [RFC1723], was 
   finalized in STD56 [RFC2453]. This version of the protocol provides 
   for authenticating packets with a digest. The details thereof 
   have initially been provided in "RIP-2 MD5 Authentication" [RFC2082]; 
   "RIPv2 Cryptographic Authentication" [RFC4822] obsoletes [RFC2082] 
   and adds details of how the SHA family of hash algorithms can be used 
   to protect RIPv2. [RFC2082] only specified the use of Keyed MD5. 
    
6.1 Technical Issues with RIP 
    
   o  The sequence number used by a router is initialized to zero, at 
      startup, and is also set to zero whenever the neighbor is brought  
      down. If the cryptographically protected packets of a router that  
      is brought down (for administrative or other reasons) are stored  
      by a malicious router, the new router could replay the packets  
      from the previous session thus forcing traffic through the  
      malicious router.  Dropping of such packets by the router could  
      result in blackholes.  Also forwarding wrong packets could      
      result in routing loops. 
    
   o  RIPv2 allows multiple packets with the same sequence number. 
      This could mean the same packet may be replayed many times before 
      the next legitimate packet is sent.  An attacker may resend the 
      same packet repeatedly until the next hello packet is transmitted 
      and received, which means the hello interval therefore determines  
      the attack window. 
    
   o  RIPv2 [RFC2453] does not specify the use of any particular hash  
      algorithm. Currently, RIP implementations support keyed MD5  
      [RFC2082] and [RFC4822] adds support for using HMAC-SHA for RIP. 
     
   o  RIPv2 Cryptographic Authentication [RFC4822] does not cover the 
      UDP and the IP headers. It is therefore possible for an attacker  
      to modify some fields in the above headers without routers  
      becoming aware of it. 
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 12] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
    
      There is limited exposure to modification of the UDP header as 
      the RIP protocol  uses only it to compute the length of the RIP  
      packet. Changes introduced in the UDP header would cause RIP  
      authentication to fail the RIP authentication,  limiting exposure. 
    
      RIP uses the source IP address from the IP header to determine  
      which RIP neighbor it has learnt the RIP Update from.  Changing  
      the source IP address can be used by an attacker to disrupt the  
      RIP routing sessions between two routers R1 and R2, as shown in  
      the following examples: 
    
      Scenario 1: 
      
      R1 sends an authenticated RIP message to R2 with a cryptographic  
      sequence num X. 
    
      The attacker then needs a higher sequence number packet from the  
      LAN. It could also be a packet originated by R2 either from this  
      session, or from some earlier session. 
    
      The attacker can then replay this packet to R2 by changing the  
      source IP to that of R1. 
    
      R2 would then no longer accept any more RIP Updates from R1 as  
      those would have a lower cryptographic sequence number. After 180  
      seconds (or less), R2 would consider R1 timed out and bring down  
      the RIP session. 
    
      Scenario 2: 
    
      R1 announces a route with cost C1 to R2. This packet can be  
      captured by an attacker. Later, if this cost changes and R1  
      announces this with a different cost C2, the attacker can replay  
      the captured packet, modifying the source IP to a new  
      arbitrary IP address thereby masquerading as a different router.  
    
      R2 will accept this route and the router as a new gateway, and  
      R2 would then use the non existent router as a next hop for that  
      network. This would only be effective if the cost C1 is less than  
      C2. 
    
7. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) 
                 
   BFD is specified in the document [BFD-BASE]. Extensions to BFD for 
   Multi-hop [BFD-MULTI] and single hop [BFD-1HOP] are defined for IPv4 
   and IPv6. It is designed to detect failure with the forwarding plane 
   nexthop. 
    
   BFD base specifies an optional authentication mechanism which can be 
   used by receiver of a packet to be able to authenticate the source of 
Manral, et. al.                                                [Page 13] 
Internet-Draft      Routing Protocol Protection Issues    January 2010 
 
 
   the packet. It relies on the fact that the keys are shared between 
   the peers and no mechanism is defined for the actual Key generation. 
    
7.1 Technical Issues with BFD 
    
   o The level of security provided is based on the Authentication Type   
     used. However the authentication algorithms defined are MD5 or  
     SHA-1 based. As mentioned earlier MD5 and SHA-1 are both known to  
     be vulnerable to collision attacks. 
    
   o BFD spec mentions mechanisms to allow for the change of 
     authentication state based on the state of a received packet. This 
     can cause a denial of service attack where a malicious 
     authenticated packet (stored from a past session) can be relayed 
     over a session which does not use authentication. This causes one 
     end to assume that authentication is enabled at the other end and 
     hence the BFD adjacency is dropped. This would be a harder attack 
     to put forth when meticulously keyed authentication is in use. 
    
   o BFD works on microsecond timers. When malicious packets are sent 
     at very small duration of time, with the authentication bit set, 
     it can cause a DoS attack. 
 
   o BFD allows a mode called the echo mode. Echo packets are not 
     defined in the BFD specification, though they can keep the BFD 
     session UP. There are no guidelines on the properties of the echo 
     packets. Any security issues in the echo mode or packets will 
     directly effect the BFD protocol and session states and hence the 
     network stability. 
 
   o BFD packets can be sent at millisecond intervals (the protocol 
     uses timers at microsecond intervals). When using authentication 
     this can cause frequent Sequence Number wrap-around as a 32-bit 
     sequence number is used, thus considerably reducing the security 
     of the authentication algorithms. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations  
    
   This draft outlines security issues arising from the current 
   methodology for manual keying of various routing protocols.  No 
   specific changes to routing protocols are proposed in this draft, 
   likewise no new security requirements result.
