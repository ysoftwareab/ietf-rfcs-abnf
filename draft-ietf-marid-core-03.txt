Abstract

   Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent
   using spoofed addresses -- "spoofed" in this case means the address
   is used without the permission of the domain owner.  This document
   describes the following:  mechanisms by which a domain owner can
   publish its set of outgoing MTAs, mechanisms by which SMTP servers
   can determine what email address is allegedly responsible for most
   proximately introducing a message into the Internet mail system, and
   whether that introduction is authorized by the owner of the domain
   contained in that email address.

   The specification is carefully tailored to ensure that the
   overwhelming majority of legitimate emailers, remailers and mailing
   list operators are already compliant.

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


1. Introduction

   Today, a huge majority of unwanted email contains headers that lie
   about the origin of the mail.  This is true of most spam and
   substantially all of the virus email that is sent.

   This document describes a mechanism such that receiving MTAs, MDAs
   and/or MUAs can recognize mail in the above category and take
   appropriate action.  For example, an MTA might refuse to accept a
   message, an MDA might discard a message rather than placing it into a
   mailbox, and an MUA might render that message in some distinctive
   fashion.

   In order to avoid further fragmentation of the Internet email system,
   it is necessary that the Internet community as a whole come to a
   consensus as to what mail senders should do to make their mail appear
   non-spoofed, and how mail receivers should determine whether mail is
   spoofed.  On the other hand, it is not necessary to reach a consensus
   regarding the actions that various parties take once a message has
   been determined to be spoofed.  This can be done unilaterally -- one
   agent might decide to discard a spoofed message while another decides
   to add a disclaimer.


2. Problem Statement

2.1 Positive Problem Statement

   Briefly stated, the mechanisms of this document allow one to answer
   the following question:

   When a message is transferred via SMTP between two UNRELATED parties,
   does the SMTP client host have permission to send mail on behalf of
   the mailbox that allegedly caused the most recent introduction of the
   message into the mail delivery system?

   As seen from the question, this mechanism applies to unrelated
   parties:  it is useful at the point where a message passes across the
   Internet from one organization to another.  It is beyond the scope of
   this document to describe authentication mechanisms that can be
   deployed within an organization.

   The mechanism of this document also seeks to authenticate the mailbox
   associated with the MOST RECENT introduction of a message into the
   mail delivery system.  In simple cases, this is who the mail is from.
   However, in the case of a third-party mailer, a forwarder or a
   mailing list server, the address being authenticated is that of the
   third party, the forwarder or the mailing list.

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


   This document provides means to authenticate the DOMAIN of the
   appropriate email address; it is not directed at the local-part.  A
   domain owner gets to determine which SMTP clients speak on behalf of
   addresses within the domain; a responsible domain owner should not
   authorize SMTP clients that will lie about local parts.

   In the long run, once the domain of the sender is authenticated, it
   will be possible to use that domain as part of a mechanism to
   determine the likelihood that a given message is spam, using, for
   example, reputation and accreditation services. (These services are
   not the subject of the present mechanism, but it should enable them.)


2.2 Negative Problem Statement

   Following are several alternate questions, which this specification
   makes no attempt to answer:

   1. Is the host at a particular IP address authorized to act as an
      SMTP client?

   2. Is an SMTP client authorized to use a particular domain name in
      its SMTP EHLO command?

   3. Is an SMTP client authorized to use a particular email address in
      an SMTP "MAIL FROM:" command?

   4. Was a message really authored by who it claims to be authored by?


3. Decision Model

   The essence of this specification is:

   Given an email message, and given an IP address from which it has
   been (or will be) received, is the SMTP client at that IP address
   authorized to send that email message?

   This question will usually be asked by an SMTP server as part of
   deciding whether to accept an incoming mail message.  However, this
   question could also be asked later by a different party.  An MUA, for
   example, could use the result of this question to determine how to
   file or present a message.

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


   There are four steps to answering this question:

   (1)  From the headers of the email message, extract the "purported
       responsible address".  This is the mailbox that the message
       claims is responsible for the most recent introduction of the
       message into the delivery system.  This step is described in
       detail in section 4 below.  A separate specification,
       [Submitter], describes an SMTP extension that allows an SMTP
       server to perform this check at the time of the SMTP MAIL
       command instead of the SMTP DATA command.

   (2)  Extract the domain part of the purported responsible address.
       Call this the "purported responsible domain".

   (3)  Call the check_host function defined in [Protocol], passing the
       following parameters:
         a. The IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) from which the message
       is being or has been received.
         b. The purported responsible domain from step (2) above.
         c. The purported responsible address from step (1) above.

   The result of the check_host function is one of the values "Neutral",
   "Pass", "Fail", "SoftFail", "None", "TempError" or "PermError".
   Section 5 describes how these results are used by MTAs receiving
   messages.  This specification imposes no requirements on parties
   performing this test in other environments.


4. Determining the Purported Responsible Address

   The purported responsible address (PRA) of a message MUST be
   determined using the algorithm described in [PRA].

   If the Sender ID check is being performed by an MTA as part of
   receiving an e-mail message, and the PRA algorithm cannot determine a
   PRA, then the message SHOULD be rejected with error "550 5.1.7
   Missing purported Responsible Address".


5. Actions Based on the Decision

   When the Sender ID test is used by an SMTP server as part of
   receiving a message, the server should take the actions described by
   this section.

   The check_host function returns one of the following results. See
   [Protocol] for the meaning of these results.

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


5.1 Neutral or None or PermError

   An SMTP server receiving one of these results SHOULD NOT reject the
   message for this reason alone, but MAY subject the message to
   heightened scrutiny by other anti-spam measures, and MAY reject the
   message as a result of this heightened scrutiny.

5.2 Pass

   An SMTP server receiving this result SHOULD treat the message as
   authentic.  It may accept or reject the message depending on other
   policies.

5.3 Fail

   An SMTP server receiving this result SHOULD reject the message with a
   "550 5.7.1 Sender ID xxx - yyy" SMTP error, where "xxx" is replaced
   with the additional reason returned by the check_host function and
   "yyy" is replaced with the explanation string returned by the
   check_host function.

5.4 SoftFail

   An SMTP server receiving this result SHOULD NOT reject the message
   for this reason alone, but MAY subject the message to heightened
   scrutiny by other anti-spam measures, and MAY reject the message as a
   result of this heightened scrutiny.  A message for which the result
   is "SoftFail" is less likely to be authentic than a message for which
   the result is "Neutral".

5.5 TempError

   An SMTP server receiving this result MAY reject the message with a
   "450 4.4.3 Sender ID check is temporarily unavailable" error code.
   Alternatively, an SMTP server receiving this result MAY accept a
   message and optionally subject it to heightened scrutiny by other
   anti-spam measures.


6. Security Considerations

   This entire document describes a new mechanism for mitigating spoofed
   email, which is today a pervasive security problem in the Internet.

   Assuming that this mechanism is widely deployed, the following
   sections describe counter-attacks that could be used to defeat this
   mechanism.

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


6.1 DNS Attacks

   The new mechanism is entirely dependent on DNS lookups, and is
   therefore only as secure as DNS.  An attacker bent on spoofing
   messages could attempt to get his messages accepted by sending forged
   answers to DNS queries.

   An MTA could largely defeat such an attack by using a properly
   paranoid DNS resolver.  DNSSEC may ultimately provide a way to
   completely neutralize this class of attacks.


6.2 TCP Attacks

   This mechanism is designed to be used in conjunction with SMTP over
   TCP.  A sufficiently resourceful attacker might be able to send TCP
   packets with forged from-addresses, and thus execute an entire SMTP
   session that appears to come from somewhere other than its true
   origin.

   Such an attack requires guessing what TCP sequence numbers an SMTP
   server will use. It also requires transmitting completely in the
   blind - the attack will be unable hear any of the server's side of
   the conversation.

   Attacks of this sort can be ameliorated if IP gateways refuse to
   forward packets when the source address is clearly bogus.


6.3 Forged Sender Attacks

   This mechanism chooses a purported responsible address from one of a
   number of message headers, and then uses that address for validation.
   A message with a true Resent-From header (for example), but a forged
   From header will be accepted.  Since many MUAs do not display all of
   the headers of received messages, the message will appear to be
   forged when displayed.

   In order to neutralize this attack, MUAs will need to start
   displaying at least the header that was verified.


6.4 Address Space Hijacking

   This mechanism assumes the integrity of IP address space for
   determining whether a given client is authorized to send messages
   from a given PRA.  In addition to the TCP attack given in section
   6.2, a sufficiently resourceful attacker might be able to alter the
   IP routing structure to permit two-way communication using a

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


   specified IP address.  It would then be possible to execute an SMTP
   session that appears to come from an authorized address, without the
   need to guess TCP sequence numbers or transmit in the blind.

   Such an attack might occur if the attacker obtained access to a
   router which participates in external BGP routing.  Such a router
   could advertise a more specific route to a rogue SMTP client,
   temporarily overriding the legitimate owner of the address.


7. Implementation Guidance

   This section describes the actions that certain members of the
   Internet email ecosystem must take to be compliant with this
   specification.


7.1 Simple E-mailers

   A domain that injects original email into the Internet, using its own
   name in From headers, need do nothing to be compliant.  However, such
   domains SHOULD publish e-mail policy records in DNS.


7.2 E-Mail Forwarders

   A program that forwards received mail to other addresses MUST add an
   appropriate header that contains an email address that it is
   authorized to use.  Such programs SHOULD use the Resent-From header
   for this purpose.

   Additionally, e-mail forwarders SHOULD publish Sender ID records for
   their domains, and SHOULD use MTAs for which the Sender ID check
   yields a "pass" result.

   Some of today's forwarders already add an appropriate header
   (although many of them use Sender rather than Resent-From.)


7.3 Mailing List Servers

   A mailing list server MUST add an appropriate header that contains an
   email address that it is authorized to use.  Such programs SHOULD use
   the Resent-From header for this purpose.

   Additionally, mailing list servers SHOULD publish Sender ID records
   for their domains, and SHOULD use MTAs for which the Sender ID check
   yields a "pass" result.

                   Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail        August 2004


   Most of today's mailing list software already adds an appropriate
   header (although most of them use Sender rather than Resent-From).


7.4 Third-Party Mailers

   A program that sends mail on behalf of another user MUST add an
   appropriate header that contains an email address that it is
   authorized to use.  Such programs SHOULD use the Sender header for
   this purpose.

   Additionally, third-part mailers servers SHOULD publish Sender ID
   records for their domains, and SHOULD use MTAs for which the Sender
   ID check yields a "pass" result.

   Many, but not all, of today's third-party mailers are already
   compliant.


7.5 MUA Implementers

   When displaying a received message, an MUA SHOULD display the
   purported responsible address as defined by this document whenever
   that address differs from the RFC 2822 From address.  This display
   SHOULD be in addition to the RFC 2822 From address.

   When a received message contains multiple headers that might be used
   for the purported responsible address determination, an MUA should
   consider displaying all of them. That is, if a message contains
   several Resent-From's, a Sender and a From, an MUA should consider
   displaying all of them.


8. IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA.
