                   draft-yusef-httpauth-srp-scheme-02

Abstract

   This document defines an HTTP Authentication Scheme that is based on
   the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.  The SRP protocol is an
   Augmented Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol
   suitable for authenticating users and exchanging keys over an
   untrusted network.

1.  Introduction

   Some protocols (e.g.  HTTP [HTTP-P7], SIP [RFC3261], OAUTH 2.0
   [RFC6749], and STUN [RFC5389]) use a general framework for access
   control and authentication, via a set of challenge-response
   authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a
   client request and by a client to provide authentication information.

   Many of these systems that use the challenge-response framework rely
   on passwords chosen by users which usually have low entropy and weak
   randomness, and as a result cannot be used as cryptographic keys.
   While cannot be used directly as cryptographic keys, the passwords
   can still be used to derive cryptographic keys.

Internet-Draft       HTTP SRP Authentication Scheme         January 2016


   This document defines an HTTP Authentication Scheme that is based on
   the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.  The SRP protocol is an
   Augmented Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol
   suitable for authenticating users and exchanging keys over an
   untrusted network, based on a shared password, without requiring a
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or any trusted third party.

   The SRP protocol provides many security benefits: it resists
   dictionary attacks mounted by either passive or active network
   intruders.  It also offers perfect forward secrecy, which protects
   past sessions and passwords against future compromises.  Finally,
   user passwords are stored in a form that is not plaintext-equivalent
   to the password itself, so an attacker who captures the password
   database cannot use it directly to compromise security and gain
   immediate access to the host.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Operations Overview

   The SRP protocol relies on finite field GF(large-prime), which means
   that during its setup, the server must choose a large prime number
   (large-prime), for the integers from 1 to (large-prime - 1) to form a
   group under multiplication modulo large-prime.  The server must also
   choose a primitive root modulo large-prime (generator) for this
   group.

   All values in this document are computed modulo large-prime.

   When a user account is created, the server selects a hash function
   and a user salt, and uses a realm and the user password to create a
   password-verifier as follows:

      derived-private-key = H(username:realm:password:salt)

      password-verifier = generator ^ derived-private-key


   The server then discards the derived-private-key and stores the
   following information in the database: username, hash-algorithm,
   salt, and password-verifier.

   If the client is not aware of the realm associated with the resources
   it is trying to access, then the initial request will include the SRP
   scheme with no parameters.  This will allow the server to discover
   the client's capabilities and to challenge the request and provide
   the client with the realm associated with the resource.  The client
   is then expected to retry the request with the username parameter.

   The client then initiates the authentication process with the server
   by sending an initial request with an Authorization header with SRP
   scheme which includes the username parameter associated with that
   protection space.

   The server generates its private key and calculates its associated
   public key, then challenges the request and includes the WWW-
   Authenticate with the large-prime, generator, hash-algorithm, salt,
   and server-public-key.

   The client calculates the session-key and re-tries the request and
   includes an Authorization header with client-pop to prove to the
   server that it is in possession of the session-key.

   The server verifies the client-pop and calculates the server-pop to
   prove to the client that it is in possession of the same session-key.

   At the end of the above process, the client and the server would have
   established a communication channel after completing a mutual
   authentication, and each side would be in possession of the same
   session-key.


3.  Protection Space

   The HTTP Authentication Framework [RFC7235] defines "protection
   space" as a combination of the canonical root URI of the server being
   accessed and the "realm" value.  The "realm" values allow the
   partitioning of the server resources into a set of protection spaces,
   each with its own authentication scheme and/or authorization
   database.

   A protection space determines the scope of protection covered by a
   set of credentials that can be applied automatically.  If a prior
   request has been authorized, then the client may reuse the same
   credentials for all other requests within that protection space, for
   a period of time determined by the server.

4.  Discovery Request

   If the client is not aware of the realm associated with the resource
   it needs to access, then the discovery request MUST be sent without
   any parameters, to allow the server to challenge the request and send
   the realm to the client.  The client is then expected to retry the
   request with the username associated with the realm of the resource
   being accessed to initiate the authentication process.


5.  Initial Request

   The initial request from the client, that starts the authentication
   process, MUST include an Authorization header field with the SRP
   scheme.

   The request MUST include the following parameter:

      username

         The user's name in a specific realm.


6.  Challenge

   If a discovery request is received from the client, then the server
   MUST challenge the request by responding with 401 and MUST include
   the realm parameter.  The client is expected to retry the request and
   include the username parameter to start the authentication process.

   When the server receives the request with the username parameter, the
   server looks up the hash-algorithm, salt, and password-verifier
   associated with the username provided by the client in the initial
   request.

   OPEN ISSUE:

   { To prevent an attacker from identifying the usernames in the DB, if
   a username does not exist in the DB, the server should still go
   through the motion of attempting to authenticate the user and fail it
   only during the last step, to prevent the attacker from recognizing
   the username existence by analyzing how fast the server responds to
   the initial request.  }

   The server generates a random number, [1, large-prime - 1], as a
   server ephemeral private key (server-private-key), and computes the
   associated server ephemeral public key.  The server MUST generate a

   fresh ephemeral private key for each authentication session, even if
   the request is coming from the same user.


   The server calculates the server-public-key as follows:

      server-public-key = H( 3 * password-verifier + generator ^ server-
      private-key )


   The server then challenges the initial request from the client by
   responding with a "401 Unauthorized" status code and a WWW-
   Authenticate header field with and SRP scheme.  The header field MUST
   include the following parameters:

      large-prime

         The large prime used to form the finite field GF(n) group,
         selected by the server during setup, formatted as a decimal
         integer.

      generator

         A finite field GF(n) group generator selected by the server
         during setup, formatted as a decimal integer.

      hash-algorithm

         The hash algorithm used to create the session-key, e.g SHA256.

      salt

         A random string used as user's salt.

      server-public-key

         The server ephemeral public key associated with the server
         ephemeral private key.

7.  Response

   The client generates a random number, [1, large-prime - 1], as a
   client ephemeral private key (client-private-key), and computes the
   associated client ephemeral public key as follows:

      client-public-key = generator ^ client-private-key

   The client calculates the derived-private-key, random nonce, session-
   tag, session-key, and client-pop as follows:

      derived-private-key = H( username:realm:password:salt )

      nonce = H( client-public-key : server-public-key )

      session-tag = ( server-public-key - 3 * generator ^ derived-
      private-key) ^ (client-private-key + nonce * derived-private-key )

      session-key = H ( session-tag )

      client-pop = H( client-public-key : server-public-key : session-
      tag )


   The client is expected to retry the request passing an Authorization
   header field with SRP scheme.  The header field MUST include the
   following parameters:

      server-public-key

         The server ephemeral public key that the client received from
         the server with the challenge request.

      client-public-key

         The client ephemeral public key associated with the client
         ephemeral private key.

      client-pop

         A client proof-of-possession to prove to the server that the
         client is possession of the session-key.

8.  Confirmation

   The server MAY use the server-public-key received from the client to
   correlate this request with the previous response it sent to the
   client.  This especially important in the case that this request is
   received on a different connection than the one that delivered the
   initial request.

   The server calculates a random nonce and the session-tag as follows:

      nonce = H( client-public-key : server-public-key )

      session-tag = ( client-public-key * password-verifier ^ nonce ) ^
      server-private-key


   At this stage, the server has enough information to verify the
   client-pop by locally calculating the expected-client-pop and
   comparing it to the one received from the client.  The server
   calculates the expected-client-pop as follows:

      expected-client-pop = H( client-public-key : server-public-key :
      session-tag )

   The server then compares the expected-client-pop to the client-pop.
   If they are different, then the server MUST fail the request by
   responding with a "401 Unauthorized" status code and follow the same
   procedure used with the initial request.


   If the expected-client-pop is the same as the client-pop received
   from the client, the server continues the process and calculates its
   server-pop and session-key as follows:

      server-pop = H( client-public-key : client-pop : session-tag )

      session-key = H ( session-tag )


   The server then confirms the client's request by responding with 200
   OK request.  The 200 OK message MUST include an Authentication-Info
   header field with the SRP scheme.  The header field MUST include the
   following parameter:

      server-pop

         A server proof-of-possession to prove to the client that the
         server is possession of the session-key.

Internet-Draft       HTTP SRP Authentication Scheme         January 2016


   When the client receives the confirmation from the server it verifies
   the server-pop by calculating the expected-server-pop and comparing
   it to the server-pop.  If these values are different, then the client
   MUST consider the authentication process to have failed; otherwise,
   the authentication process is complete, and both sides would be in
   possession of the same session-key.
