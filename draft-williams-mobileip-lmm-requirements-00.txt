Abstract


   Mobile IP is required for hosts moving within the Internet topology.
   Mobile IP manages IP mobility resulting from the change in 
   Care-of-Address when a host moves within the Internet topology. 
   When a Mobile Node moves from one point of attachment to another,
   a mobility binding update to the respective home agent and/or
   correspondent node(s) occurs. Localized Mobility Management (LMM) 
   refers to a method of handling mobility locally, restricting the
   resultant signaling to a specific area, and possibly reducing the
   amount of signaling. This document describes requirements which are
   designed to guide development of optional extensions to the Mobile IPv6 
   protocol in providing for Localized Mobility Management functionality.

1.0 Introduction

   The emergence of Mobile IPv6 as the dominant protocol for 
   supporting mobile data networking provides a productive springboard 
   from which to explore and develop wireless mobile networking.

   The overall goals of LMM are:

	-	reducing the signaling induced by changes in the 
	        point of attachment due to the movement of a host;
	         
	-	reducing the usage of air-interface resources for
	        mobility;
	        
	- 	avoid changes to the mobile node, home agent or 
	        the correspondent node;
	        
	- 	avoid creating single points of failure;
	
	- 	simplify the network design and provisioning 
	        for enabling LMM capability in a network;
	        
	-       allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities. 
	
   Latency costs can be high due to mobility binding 
   updates and registration processing.  In addition, radio
   interface resources are scarce, when compared to wired interfaces, 
   and thus expensive, which calls for special measures from
   IP mobility management protocols in providing a highly
   efficient data transport to and from a mobile device where 
   the routable IP address of the node changes during movement
   to a new point of attachment [1].
   
   Increasing the efficiency of the registration process of mobile hosts 
   is an approach that addresses the goals of reducing latency costs 
   and the conservation of radio resources.  One class of solutions 
   in this regard focuses on extensions to the IP layer mobility
   protocol in order to restrict the region of  signaling, 
   thus possibly reducing the amount of signaling.  This functionality 
   is commonly referred to as Localized Mobility Management (LMM).

   Through LMM, the user can gain the benefit of smoother 
   hand-offs as well as reducing the signaling initiated from the 
   mobile node and thus minimizing radio resources usage. 
   Inherently, this allows for increased scalability and 
   reduces the need for additional route optimization.
   
   This document lays out requirements in order to guide development
   of LMM in order that the resulting solution will best preserve
   the the fundamental philosophies and architectural principles 
   of the Internet in practice today.
   
   
2.0 Terminology

   See [2] for additional terminology.
      
   Administrative Domain A collection of networks under the same
                         administrative control and grouped together
                         for administrative purposes. [3]

   Local Mobility        The movement of an IP device without requiring
                         a change to its routable IP address seen by
                         the CN or HA. Althoughits point of attachment
                         may change during themove, the IP addresses used
                         to reach the device(both its home and IP subnet
                         routable IPaddress) do not change.

   Local Mobility Domain A Local Mobility Domain contains one or more
                         IP subnets, networks, or Administrative
                         Domains.  Within the Local Mobility Domain,
                         the globally visible routable IP address assigned 
                         to a MobileHost or Mobile Router serving a Mobile
                         Networkdoes not change.

   Localized Mobility    A method of handling mobility locally, in order
   Management (LMM)      to restrict the signaling area,thus possibly
                         reducing the amount of signaling. 


3.0 LMM Requirements

   This section describes the requirements of a LMM solution for
   Mobile IPv6.  Only Mobile IPv6 based requirements are described here.

3.1 Intra-domain mobility

   LMM is introduced to minimize the signaling trafficto the home agent 
   and/or correspondent node(s) for intra-domain mobility.
   
   In the LMM infrastructure a correspondent node or home agent outside
   the administration domainMUST always be able to address the mobile
   host by the same IP address, sothat from the point of view of hosts
   outside the administration domain, the IP address of the mobile host
   remains fixed.

   It is not the intent or goal for LMM to enter the intra-subnet 
   (intra AR) mobility problem space.   See [SubnetMobPro] for
   more information on this specific problem space.

INTERNET DRAFT    Localized Mobility Management Requirements   July 2001

3.2 Security

3.2.1 LMM protocol MUST provide for "security provisioning" within the 
      respective administration domain.

   The security of exchanging LMM specific information and signaling MUST
   be ensured.  Security provisioning includes protecting the integrity, 
   confidentiality, and authenticity of the transfer of LMM specific 
   information within the administration domain.  If applicable, replay
   protection MUST exist between the LMM agents.

3.2.2 LMM protocol MUST provide for the security provisioning to be
      disabled.
      
   In certain environments the security within the administration domain
   may not be necessary, or it may be preferred to minimize the LMM protocol
   overhead.This feature would be used at the network operator's own risk.
   
3.2.3 LMM protocol MUST NOT interfere with the security provisioning that
      exists between the home agent and the mobile host.
      
3.2.4 LMM protocol MUST NOT interfere with the security provisioning that
      exists between the correspondent node and the mobile host.

3.2.5 LMM protocol MUST NOT introduce new security holes or the possibility
      for DOS-style attacks.

3.3 Scope of LMM effect

3.3.1 The LMM framework MUST NOT add any modifications or extensions
      to the correspondent node(s) and home agent.

3.3.2 Non-LMM-aware routers, hosts, home agents, and mobile nodes
      MUST be able to interoperate with LMM-aware agents.

3.3.3 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the number of messages between
      the mobile host and the respective correspondent node(s) and home 
      agent.

3.3.4 Connectivity to the mobile host MUST always be maintained in the
      presence of failure of LMM agents (infrastructure).
 
3.4 Scalability and Performance

3.4.1 The LMM framework MUST be able to support a large number of mobile 
      hosts.
      
3.4.2 The LMM framework MUST NOT interfere with the Mobile IPv6 performance 
      of a mobile host communications with a correspondent node(s).
      
3.4.3 Scalable expansion of the network

   The LMM framework MUST allow scalable expansion of the network
   and provide for reasonable network configuration with regard
   to peering, interadministrative domain connectivity,  and other
   interadministrative domain interoperability characteristics of
   interest to wireless ISPs. The LMM framework MUST NOT introduce 
   any additional restrictions in how wireless ISPs configure their
   network, nor how they interconnect with other networks beyond 
   those introduced by standard IP routing.

3.4.3 Header overhead

   Any additional header overhead caused by LMM MUST be reduced 
   by compression and transfer of compressor state on movement SHOULD
   be possible so as not to introduce any perceived service disruption.
      
   Candidate LMM designs that require additional header overhead for 
   tunnels MUST be reviewed by the ROHC working group to determine
   if the header compressor can be restarted from transferred compressor 
   context when handover occurs without requiring any full header packet
   exchange on the new link.
      
3.4.4 Optimized signaling within the administrative domain
 
   By its very nature, LMM reintroduces triangle routing into Mobile IPv6
   in that all traffic must go through the LMM agent. There is no way
   to avoid this. The LMM framework SHOULD be designed in such a way 
   that as to reduce the length of the unwanted triangle leg.  
      
   The LMM framework SHOULD support optimal placement of LMM agents to
   reduce or eliminate additional triangle routing introduced by LMM. 

3.5 Mobility Management Support

   The following LMM requirements pertain to both inter-domain hand-off
   and between administrative domains as well.

3.5.1 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the amount of latency or amount of
      packet loss that exists with the core Mobile IPv6 specification [6].
      
3.5.2 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the amount of service disruption
      that already exists with the core Mobile IPv6 specification.
      
3.5.3 The LMM framework MUST NOT increase the number of messages between
      the mobile host and the respective correspondent node(s) and home 
      agent as is in the core Mobile IPv6 specification.

3.5.4 The LMM framework SHOULD support the auto-configuration capabilities for
      mobility agents/FAs, access routers.

3.6 Sparse routing element population requirement

   The LMM framework SHOULD be supported, at the very minimum, by a sparse
   (proper subset) routing element population within a single
   administration domain.
    
3.7 Interworking with hand-off mechanisms

3.7.1 The LMM framework MAY include methods for interworking with
      Mobile IPv6 fast hand-off solutions [7].
      
3.7.2 The LMM framework MAY provide input to the hand-off process.

INTERNET DRAFT    Localized Mobility Management Requirements   July 2001

3.8 Simple Network design requirement

   LMM SHOULD simplify the network design and provisioning for enabling LMM 
   capability in a network and allow progressive LMM deployment capabilities. 

3.9 Location privacy support

   The LMM framework MUST allow for location privacy.
   
3.10 Reliablity

3.10.1 LMM framework MAY include recovery from failure of LMM agents.

3.10.2 LMM framework MAY include mechanisims for inclusion of the indication of 
       Failure of LMM agents.
