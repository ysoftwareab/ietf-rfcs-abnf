Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto         July 2007


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The [Notify] extension to the [Sieve] mail filtering language is a
   framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify
   the notification mechanism.  This document defines how [mailto] URIs
   are used to generate notifications by e-mail.

1.2.  Conventions used in this document

   Conventions for notations are as in [Sieve] section 1.1, including
   the use of [Kwds].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [Kwds].

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto         July 2007


2.  Definition

   The mailto mechanism results in the sending of a new email message (a
   "notification message") to notify a recipient about a "triggering
   message".

2.1.  Notify parameter "method"

   The mailto notification mechanism uses standard mailto URIs as
   specified in [mailto].

2.2.  Notify tag ":from"

   The :from tag overrides the default sender of the notification
   message.

2.3.  Notify tag ":importance"

   The :importance tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.
   Implementations MAY use the value of :importance to set a priority or
   importance indication on the notification message.

2.4.  Notify tag ":options"

   This tag is not used by the mailto method.

2.5.  Notify tag ":message"

   o  Unless overridden by ":from", the "From:" header field and the
      envelope sender of the notification message are set either to the
      envelope "to" field from the triggering message, as used by Sieve,
      or to a fixed address (so it "comes from the notification
      system"), at the discretion of the implementation.

   o  The "To:" header field and the envelope recipient(s) of the
      notification message are set to the address(es) specified in URI
      (including any URI headers where the hname is "to").

   o  The "Received:" field from the triggering message are retained in
      the notification message, as these may help detect and prevent
      mail loops.

   o  The "Subject:" field of the notification message contains the
      value defined by the :message notify tag, as described in
      [Notify].  If there is no :message tag, the subject is retained
      from the triggering message.  Note that Sieve [Variables] can be
      used to advantage here, as shown in the example in Section 3.

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto         July 2007


   o  If the mailto URI contains a "body" header, the value of that
      header is used as the body of the notification message.  If there
      is no "body" header, it is up to the implementation to leave the
      body empty or use an excerpt of the original message.

   o  URI headers with hname "received" are considered unsafe and are
      ignored if specified.  URI headers with hname "from" and "subject"
      conflict with the implictly set values from and are ignored if
      specified.

   o  All other header fields of the notification message either are as
      specified by URI headers, or have implementation-specific values;
      their values are not defined here.  It is suggested that the
      implementation capitalizes the first letter of URI headers and
      adds a space character after the colon between the mail header
      name and value when adding URI headers to the message.

2.6.  Other Definitions

   Because the receipt of an email message is generating another email
   message, implementations MUST take steps to avoid mail loops.  The
   notification message contains the "Received:" fields from the
   triggering message to allow loop detection as described in [RFC2821],
   section 6.2.  The implementation MUST allow messages with empty
   envelope senders to trigger notifications.

3.  Examples


   Triggering message (received by recipient@example.org):

      Return-Path: <knitting-bounces@example.com>
      Received: from mail.example.com by mail.example.org
        for <recipient@example.org>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 05:08:02 -0500
      Received: from hobbies.example.com by mail.example.com
        for <knitting@example.com>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 02:00:26 -0800
      Message-ID: <1234567.89ABCDEF@example.com>
      Date: Wed, 07 Dec 2005 10:59:19 +0100
      Precedence: list
      List-Id: Knitting Mailing List <knitting.example.com>
      Sender: knitting-bounces@example.com
      Errors-To: knitting-bounces@example.com
      From: "Jeff Smith" <jeff@hobbies.example.com>
      To: "Knitting Mailing List" <knitting@example.com>
      Subject: [Knitting] A new sweater

      I just finished a great new sweater!


   Sieve script (run on behalf of recipient@example.org):

      require ["notify", "variables"];

      if header :contains "list-id" "knitting.example.com" {
        if header :matches "Subject" "[*] *" {
          notify :message "From ${1} list: ${2}"
                 :importance "3"
                 "mailto:0123456789@sms.example.net";
        }
      }


   Notification message:

      Received: from mail.example.com by mail.example.org
        for <recipient@example.org>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 05:08:02 -0500
      Received: from hobbies.example.com by mail.example.com
        for <knitting@example.com>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 02:00:26 -0800
      Date: Wed, 7 Dec 2005 05:08:55 -0500
      Message-ID: <A2299BB.FF7788@example.org>
      From: <recipient@example.org>
      To: <0123456789@sms.example.net>
      Subject: From Knitting list: A new sweater

   Note that:

   o  Fields such as "Message-ID:" and "Date:" were generated afresh for
      the notification message, and do not relate to the triggering
      message.

   o  Additional "Received:" fields will be added to the notification
      message in transit; the ones shown were copied from the triggering
      message.

   o  If this message should appear at the mail.example.org server
      again, the server can use the presence of a "mail.example.org"
      received line to avoid sending another notification.

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This specification introduces no specific internationalization issues
   that are not already addressed in [Sieve] and in [Notify].

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto         July 2007


5.  Security Considerations

   Sending a notification is comparable with forwarding mail to the
   notification recipient.  Care must be taken when forwarding mail
   automatically, to ensure that confidential information is not sent
   into an insecure environment.

   The automated sending of email messages exposes the system to mail
   loops, which can cause operational problems.  Implementations of this
   specification MUST protect themselves against mail loops.

   Additional security considerations are discussed in [Sieve] and in
   [Notify].
