Abstract

   Currently, RSVP-TE signalling over unnumbered links identifies 
   routers using 32-bit Router IDs [RFC3477].  Traffic engineering 
   extensions to IGP protocols for use in IPv6 networks use 128-bit IPv6 
   addresses to identify routers [OSPFv3-TE], [ISIS-TE].  This document 
   specifies extensions for RSVP-TE signalling over unnumbered links to 
   use 128-bit Router IDs in an IPv6 network.

Internet Draft      Signalling Unnumbered Links in IPv6    February 2005


1.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Overview

   Supporting RSVP-TE over unnumbered links in an IPv6 network (that is, 
   links that do not have global-scope IPv6 addresses) involves two 
   components: (a) the ability to carry (TE) information about 
   unnumbered links in IGP TE extensions (ISIS or OSPFv3), and (b) the 
   ability to specify unnumbered links in RSVP-TE signalling.  The 
   former is covered in [OSPFv3-TE] and [ISIS-TE].  The focus of this 
   document is on the latter.  

   Currently, RSVP-TE signalling for unnumbered links does not support 
   unnumbered links in an IPv6 network because it does not provide a way 
   to identify a router using a 128-bit IPv6 address in its 
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID, Explicit Route and Record Route Objects.  
   This document proposes simple extensions that allow RSVP-TE 
   signalling over unnumbered links [RFC3477] to be used in an IPv6 
   network.  

3.  Definition of Terms

3.1  IPv6 Router IDs

   In the context of this document, the term "IPv6 Router ID" means a 
   stable IPv6 address of an LSR that is always reachable if there is 
   any connectivity to the LSR.  If OSPFv3 is being used as the IGP then 
   the IPv6 Router ID SHOULD be set to the "Router IPv6 Address" as 
   defined in [OSPFv3-TE].  If IS-IS is being used as the IGP then the 
   IPv6 Router ID SHOULD be set to the "IPv6 TE Router ID" as defined in 
   [ISIS-TE].  

3.2  Interface IDs

   In this document, Interface IDs are as defined in [RFC3477].

4.  Definition of Objects and Subobjects

4.1 LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object

   [RFC3477] states that if an LSR that originates an LSP advertises 
   this LSP as an unnumbered Forwarding Adjacency in IS-IS or OSPF (see 
   [LSP-HIER]), or the LSR uses the Forwarding Adjacency formed by this 
   LSP as an unnumbered component link of a bundled link (see 
   [LINK-BUNDLE]), the LSR MUST allocate an identifier to that 
   Forwarding Adjacency (just like for any other unnumbered link).  
   Moreover, the path message used for establishing the LSP that forms a 
   Forwarding Adjacency MUST contain the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object, 
   as described in [RFC3477].  

   For IPv6 networks, the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object has a class 
   number of 193, C-Type of 2 (suggested value; to be assigned by 
   IANA) and length of 24. The format is given below.

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.2  Explicit Route Object

   A new subobject of the Explicit Route Object (ERO) is used to specify
   unnumbered links in an IPv6 network.  This subobject has the 
   following format.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+




   The Type is 5, Unnumbered Interface ID for IPv6 network (suggested 
   value; to be assigned by IANA). The Length is 24.

   The Interface ID is the identifier assigned to the link by the LSR
   specified by the IPv6 Router ID.

4.3  Record Router Object

   A new subobject of the Record Route Object (RRO) is used to record
   that the LSP path traversed an unnumbered link in an IPv6 network.  
   This subobject has the following format.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |                   IPv6 Router ID (continued)                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                   IPv6 Router ID (continued)                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Interface ID (32 bits)                    |

   The Type is 5, Unnumbered Interface ID for IPv6 network (suggested 
   value; to be assigned by IANA); the Length is 24. Flags are as 
   defined in [RFC3477].


5.  Processing of objects

   same as the processing for the equivalent objects and subobjects 
   defined in [RFC3477].
   

6.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security considerations.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new C-type of 2, forward/reverse interface ID 
   for IPv6 networks, for the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object.

   This document also defines the new subobject type of 5, unnumbered 
   interface ID for IPv6 network, for the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object and the 
   ROUTE_RECORD object.
