Abstract

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
    protocol 1.0 to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as a bulk
    cipher algorithm.


1. Introduction

    The demands placed on cryptographic primitives are changing: the
    required level of security is increasing to match the progress made
    in computational power and cryptanalytic techniques, and more
    efficiency on a wide variety of platforms is required as they are
    being implemented in a wide variety of applications.  However, the
    TLS Protocol Version 1.0 [4] currently does not support cipher
    suites including 128-bit block ciphers that offer a high level of
    security and performance.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Addition of Camellia to TLS          October 2000


    Camellia is a block cipher with 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-,
    and 256-bit key sizes, i.e. the same interface specifications as the
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  The algorithm description is in
    [1] or [3].  Efficiency on both software and hardware platforms is a
    remarkable characteristic of Camellia in addition to its high level
    of security.  It is confirmed that Camellia provides strong security
    against differential and linear cryptanalysis.  An optimized
    implementation of Camellia in assembly language can encrypt on a
    Pentium III (800MHz) at the rate of more than 276 Mbits per second,
    which is much faster than the speed of an optimized DES
    implementation.  In addition, a distinguishing feature is its small
    hardware design.  The hardware design, which includes the parts for
    key scheduling, encryption and decryption, occupies approximately
    11K gates, which is the smallest among all existing 128-bit block
    ciphers as far as we know [2].

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
    protocol 1.0 [4] to support Camellia as a bulk cipher algorithm.
    The proposed change is minimal, just the addition of a new option
    for bulk cipher algorithms.


2. The CipherSuites

    We propose the following new cipher suites.

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_128_SHA      = { 0x00,0x2F };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_128_SHA   = { 0x00,0x30 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_128_SHA   = { 0x00,0x31 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_128_SHA  = { 0x00,0x32 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_128_SHA  = { 0x00,0x33 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_128_SHA  = { 0x00,0x34 };

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_192_SHA      = { 0x00,0x35 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_192_SHA   = { 0x00,0x36 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_192_SHA   = { 0x00,0x37 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_192_SHA  = { 0x00,0x38 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_192_SHA  = { 0x00,0x39 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_192_SHA  = { 0x00,0x3A };

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_256_SHA      = { 0x00,0x3B };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_256_SHA   = { 0x00,0x3C };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_256_SHA   = { 0x00,0x3D };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_256_SHA  = { 0x00,0x3E };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_256_SHA  = { 0x00,0x3F };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_CBC_256_SHA  = { 0x00,0x40 };

    Note: The above numeric definitions for CipherSuites have not yet
    been registered.  The numeric definitions follow the numbers given
    in the CipherSuite of TLS standard [4].

4. Security Considerations

    The security of Camellia was evaluated by utilizing state-of-the-art
    cryptanalytic techniques.  We confirmed that Camellia has no
    differential and linear characteristics that hold with probability
    more than 2^(-128), which means that it is extremely unlikely that
    differential and linear attacks will succeed against Camellia.
    Moreover, Camellia was designed to offer security against other
    advanced cryptanalytic attacks including higher order differential
    attacks, interpolation attacks, related-key attacks, truncated
    differential attacks, and so on [3].


5. Intellectual Property Statement

    Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (Mitsubishi Electric) and Nippon
    Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) have filed patent
    applications on the techniques used in the block cipher Camellia.
