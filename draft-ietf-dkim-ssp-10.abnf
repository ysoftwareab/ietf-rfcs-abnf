dkim=   Outbound signing practices for the domain (plain-text;
      REQUIRED).  Possible values are as follows:

      unknown   The domain might sign some or all email.

      all    All mail from the domain is signed with an Author Domain
         Signature.

      discardable   All mail from the domain is signed with an Author
         Domain Signature.  Furthermore, if a message arrives without a
         valid Author Domain Signature due to modification in transit,
         submission via a path without access to a signing key, or any
         other reason, the domain encourages the recipient(s) to discard
         it.

      Any other values are treated as "unknown".
