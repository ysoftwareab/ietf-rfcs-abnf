2.  Abstract

This specification defines an extension to the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management.  In particular,
it defines objects for managing the configuration, monitoring and con-
trol of data link controls in an SNA environment. This draft identifies
managed objects for SNA Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) links only.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major com-
ponents.  They are:

     o    RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
          describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

     o    RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects for
          the Internet suite of protocols.

     o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architec-
          tural aspects of the framework.

     o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to
          managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.

3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDEN-
TIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object type together
with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instan-
tiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

4.  Overview

This draft identifies the proposed set of objects for configuring, moni-
toring, and controlling SDLC ports and link stations.

4.1.  Tables Defined in the SNADLC SDLC MIB

The SNADLC MIB is composed of two managed entities with three tables
each.  The two managed entities for SDLC are:

     o    Ports: the physical connection, and

     o    Link Stations: the logical connections on the Port.

The three management tables are:

     o    Adminstration: objects used for configuring and controlling
          the operation of a Port or Link Station,

     o    Operational: objects that reflect the run-time state of the
          Port or Link Station, and

     o    Statistics: objects that reflect the operating metrics of the
          Port or Link Station.

Considering the above combinations, the following are the actual tables
found in this MIB:

     1)   Port Administration Table,

     2)   Port Operation Table,

     3)   Port Statistics Table,

     4)   Link Station Administration Table,

     5)   Link Station Operation Table,

     6)   Link Station Statistics Table.

All variables in this MIB relate to SDLC ports and link stations only.
Any variable relating to higher-layer entities in SNA such as Physical
Units (PU) and Logical Units (LU) are found in the SNA NAU MIB [4].

4.2.  Row Creation Mechanism

Row creation mechanism for the sdlcLSAdminTable is based on the use of
the RowStatus object.  It follows the rules for the use in SNMPv1

context proposed in the memo "Row creation with SNMPv1" [5].  Before
accepting the destroy value for an entry, an agent has to verify the
operational state of the corresponding entry in the sdlcLSOperTable
entry.

4.3.  Relationship to the Interfaces Group

This memo shall conform to the recommendations of RFC 1573, "Interfaces
Group Evolution".

Each SDLC Port shall be modeled by a row in the ifTable with an ifType
using th e IANA assigned number for SDLC (17).  Each SDLC port interface
must comply with the following conformance groups in RFC 1573:

     - ifGeneralGroup
     - ifStackGroup
     - ifPacketGroup

An implementation may optionally comply with the ifTestGroup defined in
that memo to execute vendor specific tests.  An example of this would be
to perform LPDA test functions.

The SDLC port's relation with its physical, or lower-layer interface
(i.e. RS-232, V.35, etc.) shall be modeled by a row in the ifStackTable
with the ifStackHigherLayer pointing to the SDLC port ifTable instance
and the ifStackLowerLayer pointing to the physical media-specific ifT-
able instance.  The media-specific objects of these lower-layer inter-
faces will, of course, be described in their respective MIBs (i.e.
RFC1317, The RS-232-like MIB).

The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for all
the interface group objects listed in the conformance tables above.

Object              Use for an SDLC Port

ifIndex             Each SDLC port is represented by an ifEntry. All
                    SDLC port tables shall be indexed by ifIndex.

ifDescr             Description of the SDLC port.

ifType              The IANA value reserved for SDLC - 17.

ifMtu               See RFC 1573.

ifSpeed             This object shall reflect the value of the
                    corresponding object in the ifEntry of the associ-
                    ated lower-layer interface.

ifPhysAddress       A string denoting the physical location of the SDLC
                    port within its node.  This shall have unique signi-
                    ficance within each implementing node.

ifAdminStatus       This object shall reflect the value of the
                    corresponding object in the ifEntry of the associ-
                    ated lower-layer interface.

ifOperStatus        This object shall reflect the value of the
                    corresponding object in the ifEntry of the associ-
                    ated lower-layer interface.

ifInOctets          Refer to RFC 1573.

ifInUcastPkts       This object shall count packets received from a
                    specific SDLC poll address.  Packets for the SDLC
                    broadcast address of x'FF' are not counted.

                    media specific MIB for the associated lower-layer
                    interface.

ifInUnknownProtos   This counter shall return zero for SDLC ports.

ifOutOctets         Refer to RFC 1573.

ifOutUcastPkts      This object shall count packets transmitted to a
                    specific SDLC poll address (not x'FF').

ifOutNUcastPkts     Deprecated.  Return noSuch.  Support ifOutBroad-
                    castPkts.

ifOutDiscards       Refer to RFC 1573.

ifOutErrors         Refer to RFC 1573.  Specific counters for these

ifInBroadcastPkts   This object shall count packets received on this
                    interface addressed to the SDLC broadcast address
                    (x'FF').  Only point-to-point ports supporting a
                    secondary switched station should return non-zero
                    values.

ifOutMulticastPkts  Not relevant. Return zero.

ifOutBroadcastPkts  This object shall count packets transmitted on this
                    interface which were addressed to the SDLC broadcast
                    address (x'FF').  Only point-to-point ports support-
                    ing a primary switched station should return non-
                    zero values.

ifHC*               Not part of the conformance group.

ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable
                    Refer to RFC 1573.  Default is disabled (2).

ifHighSpeed         Not part of the conformance group.

ifPromiscuousMode   Should return false if this interface receives only
                    packets addressed to its SDLC poll address(es).
                    However, in certain implementations, the lower-layer
                    interface shall present all frames to the SDLC port
                    regardless of the poll address.  Such frames may be
                    the result of a misconfigured peer or the secondary
                    end of a multipoint connection.  Such implementa-
                    tions should return true for this object.

ifConnectorPresent  Refer to RFC 1573.

ifStackHigherLayer  For each SDLC port there will be an ifStackEntry
                    with this object's value referring to the ifIndex of
                    the SDLC port's ifEntry.

ifStackLowerLayer   For each SDLC port there will be an ifStackEntry
                    with this object's value referring to the ifIndex of
                    the lower layer interface's ifEntry for that SDLC
                    port.

8.  Glossary

     link station
         A link station comprises procedures and control information
         that coordinate the transfer of data between two nodes joined
         by a link connection.  All traffic over the link connection is
         from the primary link station to one or more secondary link
         stations, or from a secondary link station to the primary link
         station.

     primary link station
         The link station instance on a link connection that is respon-
         sible for the control of the data link.  There must be only one
         primary link station on a link connection.  The primary link
         station issues commands to one or more secondary link stations.

     secondary link station
         The link station instance on a link connection that receives
         commands from the primary link station and issues responses to
         it.

     switched line
         A telecommunications line in which the connection is esta-
         blished by dialing.  For switched lines, the SDLC startup
         sequence typically begins with a null exchange identifier (null
         XID).

     leased line
         A telecommunications line on which connections do not have to
         be established by dialing.  For leased lines, the SDLC startup
         sequence may or may not begin with an exchange identifer (XID).
         While there are interface (e.g. RS.232) differences between
         leased and switched lines, those interface differences do not
         map one-to-one with differences in the SDLC startup protocol
         (i.e. the interface and the SDLC protocol are independent from
         one another).

     point-to-point link
         A link that connects the single primary link station to single
         secondary link station.  A point-to-point link may be either
         switched or leased.

     multipoint link
         A link that connects the single primary link station to several
         secondary link stations.  A multipoint link may be either
         switched or leased.  Note: The physical interface signals for a
         multipoint link are different than for a point-to-point link.
         Synonymous with multidrop line.
