NAME=VALUE
     Required.  The name of the state information (``cookie'') is NAME,
     and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are reserved and
     must not be used by applications.

     The VALUE is opaque to the user agent and may be anything the
     origin server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected
     printable ASCII encoding.  ``Opaque'' implies that the content is
     of interest and relevance only to the origin server.  The content
     may, in fact, be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie2
     header.

Comment=value
     Optional.  Because cookies can be used to derive or store private
     information about a user, the value of the Comment attribute allows
     an origin server to document how it intends to use the cookie.  The
     user can inspect the information to decide whether to initiate or
     continue a session with this cookie.

CommentURL="http_URL"
     Optional.  Because cookies can be used to derive or store private
     information about a user, the CommentURL attribute allows an origin
     server to document how it intends to use the cookie.  The user can
     inspect the information identified by the URL to decide whether to
     initiate or continue a session with this cookie.

Domain=value
     Optional.  The value of the Domain attribute specifies the domain
     for which the cookie is valid.  If an explicitly specified value
     does not start with a dot, the user agent supplies a leading dot.

Max-Age=value
     Optional.  The value of the Max-Age attribute defines the lifetime
     of the cookie, in seconds.  The delta-seconds value is a decimal
     non-negative integer.  After delta-seconds seconds elapse, the
     client should discard the cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie
     should be discarded immediately.
Path=value
     Optional.  The value of the Path attribute specifies the subset of
     URLs on the origin server to which this cookie applies.

Version=value
     Required.  The value of the Version attribute, a decimal integer,
     identifies the version of the state management specification to
     which the cookie conforms.  For this specification, Version=1
     applies.
