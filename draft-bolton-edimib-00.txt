Abstract

   This memo defines a MIB for use with managing EDI systems.  The term
   EDI systems includes large scale systems providing translator functions
   such as the US federal government's Electronic Commerce Processing Node
   (ECPN) for which this MIB was specifically designed, as well as smaller
   Value Added Network (VAN) systems.  Because of the desire for scalability
   variable names are deliberately vague, so that a channel may represent a
   single user, a group of users that use the same network entry point or
   that are defined by the implementor as functionally similar, or (as in
   the case of the ECPN) a connection to a third party network.  This MIB
   does not address management of client systems which connect to the 
   various EDI systems.

1 The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three 
   components.  They are:

      RFC 1155 [1] which defines the Structure of Management Information
      (SMI), the mechanisms for describing and naming objects for the 
      purpose of management.  RFC 1212 [2] defines a more concise description
      mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      RFC 1213 [3] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
      for the Internet suite of protocols.

      RFC 1157 [4] which defines the Simple Network Management Protocol
      (SNMP), the protocol used for network access to managed objects.

   The Network Management Framework permits new objects to be defined
   for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

2 Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base (MIB).  Within a given MIB module,
   objects are defined using RFC 1212's OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a 
   minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level, and an
   implementation status.

   The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name,
   which specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
   termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure 
   corresponding to that object type.  The Abstract Syntax Notation 1 
   (ASN.1)[5] language is used for this purpose.  However, RFC 1155
   purposefully restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
   These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

   The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes
   "protocol sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance
   of the object type.  (This access-level is independent of any 
   administrative authorization policy.)

   The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether the
   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object is 
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to
   the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the
   object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules (BER) of
   ASN.1, subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

3 Format of Definitions

   Section 4 contains the specification of all object types contained 
   in this MIB module.  These object types are defined using the 
   conventions defined in [1] and [2].
