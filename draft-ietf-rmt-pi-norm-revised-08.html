<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document discusses the creation of reliable multicast protocols
      utilizing negative-acknowledgment (NACK) feedback. The rationale for
      protocol design goals and assumptions are presented. Technical
      challenges for NACK-based (and in some cases general) reliable multicast
      protocol operation are identified. These goals and challenges are
      resolved into a set of functional "building blocks" that address
      different aspects of reliable multicast protocol operation. It is
      anticipated that these building blocks will be useful in generating
      different instantiations of reliable multicast protocols. This document
      obsoletes RFC 3941.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Reliable multicast transport is a desirable technology for efficient
      and reliable distribution of data to a group on the Internet. The
      complexities of group communication paradigms necessitate different
      protocol types and instantiations to meet the range of performance and
      scalability requirements of different potential reliable multicast
      applications and users (See <a class='info' href='#RFC2357'>[RFC2357]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mankin, A., Romanov, A., Bradner, S., and V. Paxson, &ldquo;IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast Transport and Application Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>). This
      document addresses the creation of reliable multicast protocols
      utilizing negative-acknowledgment (NACK) feedback. NACK-based protocols
      generally entail less frequent feedback messaging than reliability
      protocols based on positive acknowledgment (ACK). The less frequent
      feedback messaging helps simplify the problem of feedback implosion as
      group size grows large. While different protocol instantiations may be
      required to meet specific application and network architecture
      demands<a class='info' href='#ArchConsiderations'>[ArchConsiderations]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark,  D. and D. Tennenhouse, &ldquo;Architectural Considerations for a New Generation of           Protocols,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1990.</span><span>)</span></a>, there are a number of
      fundamental components that may be common to these different
      instantiations. This document describes the framework and common
      "building block" components relevant to multicast protocols based
      primarily on NACK operation for reliable transport. While this document
      discusses a large set of reliable multicast components and issues
      relevant to NACK-based reliable multicast protocol design, it
      specifically addresses in detail the following building blocks which are
      not addressed in other IETF documents:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>NACK-based Multicast sender transmission strategies,
</li>
<li>NACK repair process with timer-based feedback suppression,
          and
</li>
<li>Round-trip timing for adapting NACK and other timers.
</li>
</ol>

<p>NACK-based reliable multicast implementations SHOULD make use of
      Forward Error Correction (FEC) erasure coding techniques as described in
      the <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>FEC Building Block<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5052] document.
      Packet-level erasure coding allows missing packets from a given FEC
      block to be recovered using the parity packets instead of classical,
      individualized re-transmission of original source data content. For this
      reason, this document refers to the protocol mechanisms for reliability
      as a "repair process." Note that NACK-based protocols can reactively
      provide the parity packets in response to receiver requests for repair
      rather than just proactively sending added FEC parity content as part of
      the original transmission. Hybrid proactive/reactive use of FEC content
      is also possible with the mechanisms described in this document. Some
      classes of FEC coding such as Maximal Separable Distance (MDS) codes
      allow senders to dynamically implement deterministic, highly efficient
      receiver group repair strategies as part of a NACK-based, selective
      automated repeat-request (ARQ) scheme.
</p>
<p>The potential relationships to other reliable multicast transport
      building blocks (e.g., FEC, congestion control) and general issues with
      NACK-based reliable multicast protocols are also discussed. This
      document follows the guidelines provided in <a class='info' href='#RFC3269'>[RFC3269]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kermode, R. and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Author Guidelines for Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Building Blocks and Protocol Instantiation documents,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Intent</strong>
</p>
<p>This memo contains descriptions of building blocks that can be
      applied in the design of Reliable Multicast protocols utilizing
      Negative-Acknowledgement (NACK) feedback. <a class='info' href='#RFC3941'>[RFC3941]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Adamson, B., Bormann, C., Handley, M., and J.

      contained a previous description of this specification. RFC3941 was
      published in the "Experimental" category. It was the stated intent of
      the RMT working group to re-submit this specifications as an IETF
      Proposed Standard in due course.
</p>
<p>This Proposed Standard specification is thus based on <a class='info' href='#RFC3941'>[RFC3941]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Adamson, B., Bormann, C., Handley, M., and J.

      experience and growing protocol maturity since the publication of
      RFC3941. Said experience applies both to this specification itself and
      to congestion control strategies related to the use of this
      specification.

Rationale</h3>

<p>Each potential protocol instantiation using the building blocks
      presented here (and in other applicable building block documents) will
      have specific criteria that may influence individual protocol design. To
      support the development of applicable building blocks, it is useful to
      identify and summarize driving general protocol design goals and
      assumptions. These are areas that each protocol instantiation will need
      to address in detail. Each building block description in this document
      will include a discussion of the impact of these design criteria. The
      categories of design criteria considered here include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Delivery Service Model,
</li>
<li>Group Membership Dynamics,
</li>
<li>Sender/receiver relationships,
</li>
<li>Group Size Scalability,
</li>
<li>Data Delivery Performance, and
</li>
<li>Network Environments,
</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these areas are at least briefly discussed. Additionally,
      other reliable multicast transport building block documents such as
      <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> have been created to address areas
      outside of the scope of this document. NACK-based reliable multicast
      protocol instantiations may depend upon these other building blocks as
      well as the ones presented here. This document focuses on areas that are
      unique to NACK-based reliable multicast but may be used in concert with
      the other building block areas. In some cases, a building block may be
      able address a wide range of assumptions, while in other cases there
      will be trade-offs required to meet different application needs or
      operating environments. Where necessary, building block features are
      designed to be parametric to meet different requirements. Of course, an
      underlying goal will be to minimize design complexity and to at least
      recommend default values for any such parameters that meet a general
      purpose "bulk data transfer" requirement in a typical Internet
      environment. The forms of "bulk data transfer" covered here include
      reliable transport of bulky, but fixed-length, a priori static content
      and also transmission of non-predetermined, perhaps streamed content of
      indefinite length. <a class='info' href='#contentId'>Section&nbsp;3.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data Content Identification</span><span>)</span></a> discusses these
      different forms of bulk data content in further detail.

Delivery Service Model</h3>

<p>The implicit goal of a reliable multicast transport protocol is the
        reliable delivery of data among a group of members communicating using
        IP multicast datagram service. However, the specific service the
        application is attempting to provide can impact design decisions. A
        most basic service model for reliable multicast transport is that of
        "bulk transfer" which is a primary focus of this and other related RMT
        working group documents. However, the same principles in protocol
        design may also be applied to other service models, e.g., more
        interactive exchanges of small messages such as with white-boarding or
        text chat. Within these different models there are issues such as the
        sender's ability to cache transmitted data (or state referencing it)
        for retransmission or repair. The needs for ordering and/or causality
        in the sequence of transmissions and receptions among members in the
        group may be different depending upon data content. The group
        communication paradigm differs significantly from the point-to-point
        model in that, depending upon the data content type, some receivers
        may complete reception of a portion of data content and be able to act
        upon it before other members have received the content. This may be
        acceptable (or even desirable) for some applications but not for
        others. These varying requirements drive the need for a number of
        different protocol instantiation designs. A significant challenge in
        developing generally useful building block mechanisms is accommodating
        even a limited range of these capabilities without defining specific
        application-level details.
</p>
<p>Another factor impacting the delivery service model is the
        potential for different receivers in the multicast group to have
        significantly differing quality of network connectivity. This may
        involve receivers with very limited goodput due to connection rate or
        substantial packet loss. NACK-based protocol implementations may wish
        to provide policies by which extremely poor-performing receivers are
        excluded from the main group or migrated to a separate delivery group.
        Note that some application models may require that the entire group be
        constrained to the performance of the "weakest member" to satisfy
        operational requirements. In either case, protocol designs should
        consider this aspect of the reliable multicast delivery service
        model.

Group Membership Dynamics</h3>

<p>One area where group communication can differ from point-to-point
        communications is that even if the composition of the group changes,
        the "thread" of communication can still exist. This contrasts with the
        point-to-point communication model where, if either of the two parties
        leave, the communication process (exchange of data) is terminated (or
        at least paused). Depending upon application goals, senders and
        receivers participating in a reliable multicast transport "session"
        may be able to join late, leave, and/or potentially rejoin while the
        ongoing group communication "thread" still remains functional and
        useful. Also note that this can impact protocol message content. If
        "late joiners" are supported, some amount of additional information
        may be placed in message headers to accommodate this functionality.
        Alternatively, the information may be sent in its own message (on
        demand or intermittently) if the impact to the overhead of typical
        message transmissions is deemed too great. Group dynamics can also
        impact other protocol mechanisms such as NACK timing, congestion
        control operation, etc.

Sender/Receiver Relationships</h3>

<p>The relationship of senders and receivers among group members
        requires consideration. In some applications, there may be a single
        sender multicasting to a group of receivers. In other cases, there may
        be more than one sender or the potential for everyone in the group to
        be a sender <strong>and</strong> receiver of data may
        exist.

Group Size Scalability</h3>

<p>Native IP multicast <a class='info' href='#RFC1112'>[RFC1112]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S., &ldquo;Host extensions for IP multicasting,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> may scale to
        extremely large group sizes. It may be desirable for some applications
        to scale along with the multicast infrastructure's ability to scale.
        In its simplest form, there are limits to the group size to which a
        NACK-based protocol can be applied without the potential for the
        volume of NACK feedback messages to overwhelm network capacity. This
        is often referred to as "feedback implosion". Research suggests that
        NACK-based reliable multicast group sizes on the order of tens of
        thousands of receivers may operate with acceptable levels of feedback
        to the sender using probabilistic, timer-based suppression techniques
        <a class='info' href='#NormFeedback'>[NormFeedback]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Adamson, B. and J. Macker, &ldquo;Quantitative Prediction of NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast           (NORM) Feedback,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. Instead of receivers immediately
        transmitting feedback messages when loss is detected, these techniques
        specify use of purposefully-scaled, random back-off timeouts such that
        some potential NACKing receivers can self-suppress their feedback upon
        hearing messages from other receivers that have selected shorter
        random timeout intervals. However, there may be additional NACK
        suppression heuristics that can be applied to enable these protocols
        to scale to even larger group sizes. In large scale cases, it may be
        prohibitive for members to maintain state on all other members (in
        particular, other receivers) in the group. The impact of group size
        needs to be considered in the development of applicable building
        blocks.
</p>
<p>Intermediate assistance from devices/systems with direct knowledge
        of the underlying network topology may be used to increase the
        performance and scalability of NACK-based reliable multicast
        protocols. Feedback aggregation and filtering of sender repair data
        may be possible with NACK-based protocols using FEC-based repair
        strategies as described in the and other reliable multicast transport
        building block documents. However, there will continue to be a number
        of instances where intermediate system assistance is not available or
        practical. Thus, building block components for based reliable
        multicast should be capable of operating without such assistance.

Data Delivery Performance</h3>

<p>There is a trade-off between scalability and data delivery latency
        when designing NACK-oriented protocols. If probabilistic, timer-based
        NACK suppression is to be used, there will be some delays built into
        the NACK process to allow suppression to occur and for the sender of
        data to identify appropriate content for efficient repair
        transmission. For example, back-off timeouts can be used to ensure
        efficient NACK suppression and repair transmission, but this comes at
        a cost of increased delivery latency and increased buffering
        requirements for both senders and receivers. The building blocks
        SHOULD allow applications to establish bounds for data delivery
        performance. Note that application designers must be aware of the
        scalability trade-off that is made when such bounds are applied.

Network Environments</h3>

<p>The Internet Protocol has historically assumed a role of providing
        service across heterogeneous network topologies. It is desirable that
        a reliable multicast protocol be capable of effectively operating
        across a wide range of the networks to which general purpose IP
        service applies. The bandwidth available on the links between the
        members of a single group today may vary between low numbers of kbit/s
        for wireless links and multiple Gbit/s for high speed LAN connections,
        with varying degrees of contention from other flows. Recently, a
        number of asymmetric network services including 56K/ADSL modems, CATV
        Internet service, satellite and other wireless communication services
        have begun to proliferate. Many of these are inherently broadcast
        media with potentially large "fan-out" to which IP multicast service
        is highly applicable. Additionally, policy and/or technical issues may
        result in topologies where multicast connectivity is limited to a
        Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) model from a specific source <a class='info' href='#RFC4607'>[RFC4607]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Holbrook, H. and B. Cain, &ldquo;Source-Specific Multicast for IP,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Receivers in the group may be restricted to
        unicast feedback for NACKs and other messages. Consideration must be
        given, in building block development and protocol design, to the
        nature of the underlying networks.

Functionality</h3>

<p>The previous section has presented the role of protocol building
      blocks and some of the criteria that may affect NACK-based reliable
      multicast building block identification/design. This section describes
      different building block areas applicable to NACK-based reliable
      multicast protocols. Some of these areas are specific to NACK-based
      protocols. Detailed descriptions of such areas are provided. In other
      cases, the areas (e.g., node identifiers, forward error correction
      (FEC), etc.) may be applicable to other forms of reliable multicast. In
      those cases, the discussion below describes requirements placed on those
      other general building block areas from the standpoint of NACK-based
      reliable multicast. Where applicable, other building block documents are
      referenced for possible contribution to NACK-based reliable multicast
      protocols.
</p>
<p>For each building block, a notional "interface description" is
      provided to illustrate any dependencies of one building block component
      upon another or upon other protocol parameters. A building block
      component may require some form of "input" from another building block
      component or other source to perform its function. Any "inputs" required
      by a building block component and/or any resultant "output" provided
      will be defined and described in each building block component's
      interface description. Note that the set of building blocks presented
      here do not fully satisfy each other's "input" and "output" needs. In
      some cases, "inputs" for the building blocks here must come from other
      building blocks external to this document (e.g., congestion control or
      FEC). In other cases NACK-based reliable multicast building block
      "inputs" must be satisfied by the specific protocol instantiation or
      implementation (e.g., application data and control).

      reliable multicast are identified:

<p><a class='info' href='#NackBBFramework'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>NACK-based Reliable Multicast Building Block Framework</span><span>)</span></a> provides a pictorial overview
      of these building block areas and some of their relationships. For
      example, the content of the data messages that a sender initially
      transmits depends upon the "Node Identification", "Data Content
      Identification", and "FEC" components while the rate of message
      transmission will generally depend upon the "Congestion Control"
      component. Subsequently, the receivers' response to these transmissions
      (e.g., NACKing for repair) will depend upon the data message content and
      inputs from other building block components. Finally, the sender's
      processing of receiver responses will feed back into its transmission
      strategy.
</p>
<p>The components on the left side of this figure are areas that may be
      applicable beyond NACK-based reliable multicast. The most significant of
      these components are discussed in other building block documents, such
      as the <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>FEC Building Block<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5052]. Brief
      descriptions of these areas and their roles in NACK-based reliable
      multicast protocols are given below, and "RTT Collection" is discussed
      in detail in <a class='info' href='#RttCollection'>Section&nbsp;3.7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Round-trip Timing (RTT) Collection</span><span>)</span></a> of this document.
</p>
<p>The components on the right are seen as specific to NACK-based
      reliable multicast protocols, most notably the NACK repair process.
      These areas are discussed in detail below (most notably "Multicast
      Sender Transmission", "NACK Repair Process" in <a class='info' href='#SenderTransmission'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Multicast Sender Transmission</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RepairProcess'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>NACK Repair Process</span><span>)</span></a>, respectively). Some other components
      (e.g., "Security") impact many aspects of the protocol, and others may
      be more transparent to the core protocol processing. Where applicable,
      specific technical recommendations are made for mechanisms that will
      properly satisfy the goals of NACK-based reliable multicast transport
      for the Internet.

Multicast Sender Transmission</h3>

<p>Reliable multicast senders will transmit data content to the
        multicast session. The data content will be application dependent. The
        sender will transmit data content at a rate, and with message sizes,
        determined by application and/or network architecture requirements.
        Any FEC encoding of sender transmissions SHOULD conform with the
        guidelines of the <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>FEC Building Block<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5052].
        When congestion control mechanisms are needed (REQUIRED for general
        Internet operation), the sender transmission rate SHALL be controlled
        by the congestion control mechanism. In any case, it is RECOMMENDED
        that all data transmissions from multicast senders be subject to rate
        limitations determined by the application or congestion control
        algorithm. The sender's transmissions SHOULD make good utilization of
        the available capacity (which may be limited by the application and/or
        by congestion control). As a result, it is expected there will be
        overlap and multiplexing of new data content transmission with repair
        content. Other factors related to application operation may determine
        sender transmission formats and methods. For example, some
        consideration needs to be given to the sender's behavior during
        intermittent idle periods when it has no data to transmit.
</p>
<p>In addition to data content, other sender messages or commands may
        be employed as part of protocol operation. These messages may occur
        outside of the scope of application data transfer. In NACK-based
        reliable multicast protocols, reliability of such protocol messages
        may be attempted by redundant transmission when positive
        acknowledgement is prohibitive due to group size scalability concerns.
        Note that protocol design SHOULD provide mechanisms for dealing with
        cases where such messages are not received by the group. As an
        example, a command message might be redundantly transmitted by a
        sender to indicate that it is temporarily (or permanently) halting
        transmission. At this time, it may be appropriate for receivers to
        respond with NACKs for any outstanding repairs they require following
        the rules of the NACK procedure. For efficiency, the sender should
        allow sufficient time between the redundant transmissions to receive
        any NACK responses from the receivers to this command.
</p>
<p>In general, when there is any resultant NACK or other feedback
        operation, the timing of redundant transmission of control messages
        issued by a sender and other NACK-based reliable multicast protocol
        timeouts should be dependent upon the group greatest round trip timing
        (GRTT) estimate and any expected resultant NACK or other feedback
        operation. The sender GRTT is an estimate of the worst-case round-trip
        timing from a given sender to any receivers in the group. It is
        assumed that the GRTT interval is a conservative estimate of the
        maximum span (with respect to delay) of the multicast group across a
        network topology with respect to given sender. NACK-based reliable
        multicast instantiations SHOULD be able to dynamically adapt to a wide
        range of multicast network topologies.

Receiver NACK Process Initiation</h3>

<p>The NACK process (cycle) will be initiated by receivers that
          detect a need for repair transmissions from a specific sender to
          achieve reliable reception. When FEC is applied, a receiver should
          initiate the NACK process only when it is known its repair
          requirements exceed the amount of pending FEC transmission for a
          given coding block of data content. This can be determined at the
          end of the current transmission block (if it is indicated) or upon
          the start of reception of a subsequent coding block or transmission
          object. This implies the sender data content is marked to identify
          its FEC block number and that ordinal relationship is preserved in
          order of transmission.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the sender's transmission advertises the
          quantity of repair packets it is already planning to send for a
          block, the receiver may be able to initiate the NACK process
          earlier. Allowing receivers to initiate NACK cycles at any time they
          detect their repair needs have exceeded pending repair transmissions
          may result in slightly quicker repair cycles. However, it may be
          useful to limit NACK process initiation to specific events such as
          at the end-of-transmission of an FEC coding block or upon detection
          of subsequent coding blocks. This can allow receivers to aggregate
          NACK content into a smaller number of NACK messages and provide some
          implicit loose synchronization among the receiver set to help
          facilitate effective probabilistic suppression of NACK feedback. The
          receiver MUST maintain a history of data content received from the
          sender to determine its current repair needs. When FEC is employed,
          it is expected that the history will correspond to a record of
          pending or partially-received coding blocks.
</p>
<p>For probabilistic, timer-based suppression of feedback, the NACK
          cycle should begin with receivers observing backoff timeouts. In
          conjunction with initiating this backoff timeout, it is important
          that the receivers record the current position in the sender's
          transmission sequence at which they initiate the NACK cycle. When
          the suppression backoff timeout expires, the receivers should only
          consider their repair needs up to this recorded transmission
          position in making the decision to transmit or suppress a NACK.
          Without this restriction, suppression is greatly reduced as
          additional content is received from the sender during the time a
          NACK message propagates across the network to the sender and other
          receivers.

NACK Suppression</h3>

<p>An effective feedback suppression mechanism is the use of random
          backoff timeouts prior to NACK transmission by receivers requiring
          repairs<a class='info' href='#SrmFramework'>[SrmFramework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd,  S., Jacobson, V., McCanne, S., Liu, C., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and           Application Level Framing,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>. Upon expiration of the
          backoff timeout, a receiver will request repairs unless its pending
          repair needs have been completely superseded by NACK messages heard
          from other receivers (when receivers are multicasting NACKs) or from
          some indicator from the sender. When receivers are unicasting NACK
          messages, the sender may facilitate NACK suppression by forwarding a
          representation of NACK content it has received to the group at large
          or provide some other indicator of the repair information it will be
          subsequently transmitting.
</p>
<p>For effective and scalable suppression performance, the backoff
          timeout periods used by receivers should be independently, randomly
          picked by receivers with a truncated exponential distribution<a class='info' href='#McastFeedback'>[McastFeedback]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nonnenmacher,  J. and E. Biersack, &ldquo;Optimal Multicast Feedback,&rdquo; March/April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. This results in the majority of the
          receiver set holding off transmission of NACK messages under the
          assumption that the smaller number of "early NACKers" will supersede
          the repair needs of the remainder of the group. The mean of the
          distribution should be determined as a function of the current
          estimate of sender's GRTT assessment and a group size estimate that
          is determined by other mechanisms within the protocol or preset by
          the multicast application.
</p>
<p>A simple algorithm can be constructed to generate random backoff
          timeouts with the appropriate distribution. Additionally, the
          algorithm may be designed to optimize the backoff distribution given
          the number of receivers (<tt>R</tt>) potentially
          generating feedback. This "optimization" minimizes the number of
          feedback messages (e.g., NACK) in the worst-case situation where all
          receivers generate a NACK. The maximum backoff timeout (<tt>T_maxBackoff</tt>) can be set to control reliable
          delivery latency versus volume of feedback traffic. A larger value
          of <tt>T_maxBackoff</tt> will result in a lower
          density of feedback traffic for a given repair cycle. A smaller
          value of <tt>T_maxBackoff</tt> results in shorter
          latency which also reduces the buffering requirements of senders and
          receivers for reliable transport.
</p>
<p>In the functions below, the <tt>log()</tt>
          function specified refers to the "natural logarithm" and the <tt>exp()</tt> function is similarly based upon the
          mathematical constant 'e' (a.k.a. Euler's number) where <tt>exp(x)</tt> corresponds to '<tt>e</tt>' raised to the power of '<tt>x</tt>'. Given the receiver group size (<tt>groupSize</tt>), and maximum allowed backoff timeout
          (<tt>T_maxBackoff</tt>), random backoff timeouts
          (<tt>t'</tt>) with a truncated exponential
          distribution can be picked with the following algorithm:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Establish an optimal mean (<tt>L</tt>) for
              the exponential backoff based on the <tt>groupSize</tt>:<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
L = log(groupSize) + 1</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Pick a random number (<tt>x</tt>) from a
              uniform distribution over a range of:<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         L                          L                   L
 --------------------  to --------------------  +  ----------
T_maxBackoff*(exp(L)-1)  T_maxBackoff*(exp(L)-1)  T_maxBackoff</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Transform this random variate to generate the desired random
              backoff time (<tt>t'</tt>) with the following
              equation:<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
t' = T_maxBackoff/L * log(x * (exp(L) - 1) * (T_maxBackoff/L))</pre></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This <tt>C</tt> language function can be used
          to generate an appropriate random backoff time interval:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
double RandomBackoff(double T_maxBackoff, double groupSize)
{
    double lambda = log(groupSize) + 1;
    double x = UniformRand(lambda/T_maxBackoff) +
               lambda / (T_maxBackoff*(exp(lambda)-1));
    return ((T_maxBackoff/lambda) *
            log(x*(exp(lambda)-1)*(T_maxBackoff/lambda)));
}  // end RandomBackoff()
</pre></div>
<p>where <tt>UniformRand(double max)</tt> returns
          random numbers with a uniform distribution from the range of <tt>0..max</tt>. For example, based on the POSIX "<tt>rand()</tt>" function, the following <tt>C</tt> code can be used:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
double UniformRand(double max)
{
    return (max * ((double)rand()/(double)RAND_MAX));
}</pre></div>
<p>The number of expected NACK messages generated (<tt>N</tt>) within the first round trip time for a
          single feedback event is approximately:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
N = exp(1.2 * L / (2*T_maxBackoff/GRTT))</pre></div>
<p>Thus the maximum backoff time can be adjusted to trade-off
          worst-case NACK feedback volume versus latency. This is derived from
          the equations given in <a class='info' href='#McastFeedback'>[McastFeedback]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nonnenmacher,  J. and E. Biersack, &ldquo;Optimal Multicast Feedback,&rdquo; March/April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and
          assumes <tt>T_maxBackoff &gt;= GRTT</tt>, and
          <tt>L</tt> is the mean of the distribution
          optimized for the given group size as shown in the algorithm above.
          Note that other mechanisms within the protocol may work to reduce
          redundant NACK generation further. It is suggested that <tt>T_maxBackoff</tt> be selected as an integer multiple
          of the sender's current advertised GRTT estimate such that:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>T_maxBackoff = K * GRTT; where K &gt;= 1</pre></div>
<p>For general Internet operation, a default value of <tt>K=4</tt> is RECOMMENDED for operation with multicast
          (to the group at large) NACK delivery and a value of <tt>K=6</tt> for unicast NACK delivery. Alternate values
          may be used to achieve desired buffer utilization, reliable delivery
          latency and group size scalability trade-offs.
</p>
<p>Given that (<tt>K*GRTT</tt>) is the maximum
          backoff time used by the receivers to initiate NACK transmission,
          other timeout periods related to the NACK repair process can be
          scaled accordingly. One of those timeouts is the amount of time a
          receiver should wait after generating a NACK message before allowing
          itself to initiate another NACK backoff/transmission cycle (<tt>T_rcvrHoldoff</tt>). This delay should be sufficient
          for the sender to respond to the received NACK with repair messages.
          An appropriate value depends upon the amount of time for the NACK to
          reach the sender and the sender to provide a repair response. This
          MUST include any amount of sender NACK aggregation period during
          which possible multiple NACKs are accumulated to determine an
          efficient repair response. These timeouts are further discussed in
          <a class='info' href='#SenderResponse'>Section&nbsp;3.2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sender NACK Processing and Repair Response</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>There are also secondary measures that can be applied to improve
          the performance of feedback suppression. For example, the sender's
          data content transmissions can follow an ordinal sequence of
          transmission. When repairs for data content occur, the receiver can
          note that the sender has "rewound" its data content transmission
          position by observing the data object, FEC block number, and FEC
          symbol identifiers. Receivers SHOULD limit transmission of NACKs to
          only when the sender's current transmission position exceeds the
          point to which the receiver has incomplete reception. This reduces
          premature requests for repair of data the sender may be planning to
          provide in response to other receiver requests. This mechanism can
          be very effective for protocol convergence in high loss conditions
          when transmissions of NACKs from other receivers (or indicators from
          the sender) are lost. Another mechanism (particularly applicable
          when FEC is used) is for the sender to embed an indication of
          impending repair transmissions in current packets sent. For example,
          the indication may be as simple as an advertisement of the number of
          FEC packets to be sent for the current applicable coding block.
</p>
<p>Finally, some consideration might be given to using the NACKing
          history of receivers to weight their selection of NACK backoff
          timeout intervals. For example, if a receiver has historically been
          experiencing the greatest degree of loss, it may promote itself to
          statistically NACK sooner than other receivers. Note this requires
          there is correlation over successive intervals of time in the loss
          experienced by a receiver. Such correlation MAY not always be
          present in multicast networks. This adjustment of backoff timeout
          selection may require the creation of an "early NACK" slot for these
          historical NACKers. This additional slot in the NACK backoff window
          will result in a longer repair cycle process that may not be
          desirable for some applications. The resolution of these trade-offs
          may be dependent upon the protocol's target application set or
          network.
</p>
<p>After the random backoff timeout has expired, the receiver will
          make a decision on whether to generate a NACK repair request or not
          (i.e., it has been suppressed). The NACK will be suppressed when any
          of the following conditions has occurred:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The accumulated state of NACKs heard from other receivers (or
              forwarding of this state by the sender) is equal to or
              supersedes the repair needs of the local receiver. Note that the
              local receiver should consider its repair needs only up to the
              sender transmission position recorded at the NACK cycle
              initiation (when the backoff timer was activated).
</li>
<li>The sender's data content transmission position "rewinds" to
              a point ordinally less than that of the lowest sequence position
              of the local receiver's repair needs. (This detection of sender
              "rewind" indicates the sender has already responded to other
              receiver repair needs of which the local receiver may not have
              been aware). This "rewind" event can occur any time between 1)
              when the NACK cycle was initiated with the backoff timeout
              activation and 2) the current moment when the backoff timeout
              has expired to suppress the NACK. Another NACK cycle must be
              initiated by the receiver when the sender's transmission
              sequence position exceeds the receiver's lowest ordinal repair
              point. Note it is possible that the local receiver may have had
              its repair needs satisfied as a result of the sender's response
              to the repair needs of other receivers and no further NACKing is
              required.
</li>
</ol>

<p>If these conditions have not occurred and the receiver still has
          pending repair needs, a NACK message is generated and transmitted.
          The NACK should consist of an accumulation of repair needs from the
          receiver's lowest ordinal repair point up to the current sender
          transmission sequence position. A single NACK message should be
          generated and the NACK message content should be truncated if it
          exceeds the payload size of single protocol message. When such NACK
          payload limits occur, the NACK content SHOULD contain requests for
          the ordinally lowest repair content needed from the sender.

NACK Content</h3>

<p>The content of NACK messages generated by reliable multicast
          receivers will include information detailing their current repair
          needs. The specific information depends on the use and type of FEC
          in the NACK repair process. The identification of repair needs is
          dependent upon the data content identification (See Section 3.5
          below). At the highest level the NACK content will identify the
          sender to which the NACK is addressed and the data transport object
          (or stream) within the sender's transmission that needs repair. For
          the indicated transport entity, the NACK content will then identify
          the specific FEC coding blocks and/or symbols it requires to
          reconstruct the complete transmitted data. This content may consist
          of FEC block erasure counts and/or explicit indication of missing
          blocks or symbols (segments) of data and FEC content. It should also
          be noted that NACK-based reliable multicast can be effectively
          instantiated without a requirement for reliable NACK delivery using
          the techniques discussed here.

NACK and FEC Repair Strategies</h3>

<p>Where FEC-based repair is used, the NACK message content will
            minimally need to identify the coding block(s) for which repair is
            needed and a count of erasures (missing packets) for the coding
            block. An exact count of erasures implies the FEC algorithm is
            capable of repairing <em>any</em> loss
            combination within the coding block. This count may need to be
            adjusted for some FEC algorithms. Considering that multiple repair
            rounds may be required to successfully complete repair, an erasure
            count also implies that the quantity of unique FEC parity packets
            the server has available to transmit is essentially unlimited
            (i.e., the server will always be able to provide new, unique,
            previously unsent parity packets in response to any subsequent
            repair requests for the same coding block). Alternatively, the
            sender may "round-robin" transmit through its available set of FEC
            symbols for a given coding block, and eventually effect repair.
            For a most efficient repair strategy, the NACK content will need
            to also <em>explicitly</em> identify which
            symbols (information and/or parity) the receiver requires to
            successfully reconstruct the content of the coding block. This
            will be particularly true of small to medium size block FEC codes
            (e.g., Reed Solomon) that are capable of providing a limited
            number of parity symbols per FEC coding block.
</p>
<p>When FEC is not used as part of the repair process, or the
            protocol instantiation is required to provide reliability even
            when the sender has transmitted all available parity for a given
            coding block (or the sender's ability to buffer transmission
            history is exceeded by the <tt>(delay*bandwidth*loss)</tt> characteristics of the
            network topology), the NACK content will need to contain <em>explicit</em> coding block and/or segment loss
            information so that the sender can provide appropriate repair
            packets and/or data retransmissions. Explicit loss information in
            NACK content may also potentially serve other purposes. For
            example, it may be useful for decorrelating loss characteristics
            among a group of receivers to help differentiate candidate
            congestion control bottlenecks among the receiver set.
</p>
<p>When FEC is used and NACK content is designed to contain
            explicit repair requests, there is a strategy where the receivers
            can NACK for specific content that will help facilitate NACK
            suppression and repair efficiency. The assumptions for this
            strategy are that sender may potentially exhaust its supply of
            new, unique parity packets available for a given coding block and
            be required to explicitly retransmit some data or parity symbols
            to complete reliable transfer. Another assumption is that an FEC
            algorithm where any parity packet can fill any erasure within the
            coding block (e.g., Reed Solomon) is used. The goal of this
            strategy is to make maximum use of the available parity and
            provide the minimal amount of data and repair transmissions during
            reliable transfer of data content to the group.
</p>
<p>When systematic FEC codes are used, the sender transmits the
            data content of the coding block (and optionally some quantity of
            parity packets) in its initial transmission. Note that a
            systematic FEC coding block is considered to be logically made up
            of the contiguous set of source data vectors plus parity vectors
            for the given FEC algorithm used. For example, a systematic coding
            scheme that provides for 64 data symbols and 32 parity symbols per
            coding block would contain FEC symbol identifiers in the range of
            0 to 95.
</p>
<p>Receivers then can construct NACK messages requesting
            sufficient content to satisfy their repair needs. For example, if
            the receiver has three erasures in a given received coding block,
            it will request transmission of the three lowest ordinal parity
            vectors in the coding block. In our example coding scheme from the
            previous paragraph, the receiver would explicitly request parity
            symbols 64 to 66 to fill its three erasures for the coding block.
            Note that if the receiver's loss for the coding block exceeds the
            available parity quantity (i.e., greater than 32 missing symbols
            in our example), the receiver will be required to construct a NACK
            requesting all (32) of the available parity symbols plus some
            additional portions of its missing data symbols in order to
            reconstruct the block. If this is done consistently across the
            receiver group, the resulting NACKs will comprise a minimal set of
            sender transmissions to satisfy their repair needs.
</p>
<p>In summary, the rule is to request the lower ordinal portion of
            the parity content for the FEC coding block to satisfy the erasure
            repair needs on the first NACK cycle. If the available number of
            parity symbols is insufficient, the receiver will also request the
            subset of ordinally highest missing data symbols to cover what the
            parity symbols will not fill. Note this strategy assumes FEC codes
            such as Reed-Solomon for which a single parity symbol can repair
            any erased symbol. This strategy would need minor modification to
            take into account the possibly limited repair capability of other
            FEC types. On subsequent NACK repair cycles where the receiver may
            have received some portion of its previously requested repair
            content, the receiver will use the same strategy, but only NACK
            for the set of parity and/or data symbols it has not yet received.
            Optionally, the receivers could also provide a count of erasures
            as a convenience to the sender.
</p>
<p>Other types of FEC schemes may require alteration to the NACK
            and repair strategy described here. For example, some of the large
            block or expandable FEC codes described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3453'>[RFC3453]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Luby, M., Vicisano, L., Gemmell, J., Rizzo, L., Handley, M., and J. Crowcroft, &ldquo;The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> may be less deterministic with respect to
            defining optimal repair requests by receivers or repair
            transmission strategies by senders. For these types of codes, it
            may be sufficient for receivers to NACK with an estimate of the
            quantity of additional FEC symbols required to complete reliable
            reception and for the sender to respond accordingly. This apparent
            disadvantage as compared to codes such as Reed Solomon may be
            offset by reduced computational requirements and/or ability to
            support large coding blocks for increased repair efficiency that
            these codes can offer.
</p>
<p>After receipt and accumulation of NACK messages during the
            aggregation period, the sender can begin transmission of fresh
            (previously untransmitted) parity symbols for the coding block
            based on the highest receiver erasure count <em>if</em> it has a sufficient quantity of parity
            symbols that were <em>not</em> previously
            transmitted. Otherwise, the sender MUST resort to transmitting the
            explicit set of repair vectors requested. With this approach, the
            sender needs to maintain very little state on requests it has
            received from the group without need for synchronization of repair
            requests from the group. Since all receivers use the same
            consistent algorithm to express their explicit repair needs, NACK
            suppression among receivers is simplified over the course of
            multiple repair cycles. The receivers can simply compare NACKs
            heard from other receivers against their own calculated repair
            needs to determine whether they should transmit or suppress their
            pending NACK messages.

NACK Content Format</h3>

<p>The format of NACK content will depend on the protocol's data
            service model and the format of data content identification the
            protocol uses. This NACK format also depends upon the type of FEC

            instantiation's discretion. Note that the identification of
            objects is with respect to a given sender. It is recommended that
            transport data content identification is done within the context
            of a sender in a given session. Since the notion of session
            "streams" and "blocks" is optional, the framework degenerates to
            that of typical transport data segmentation and reassembly in its

            lists and/or ranges of these TPDU identifiers to build up NACK
            messages to describe the receivers repair needs. If no

            is a simple linear representation of the data symbols transmitted

Sender NACK Processing and Repair Response</h3>

<p>Upon reception of a repair request from a receiver in the group,
          the sender will initiate a repair response procedure. The sender may
          wish to delay transmission of repair content until it has had
          sufficient time to accumulate potentially multiple NACKs from the
          receiver set. This allows the sender to determine the most efficient
          repair strategy for a given transport stream/object or FEC coding
          block. Depending upon the approach used, some protocols may find it
          beneficial for the sender to provide an indicator of pending repair
          transmissions as part of its current transmitted message content.
          This can aid some NACK suppression mechanisms. The amount of time to
          perform this NACK aggregation should be sufficient to allow for the
          maximum receiver NACK backoff window ("<tt>T_maxBackoff</tt>" from Section 3.2.2) and
          propagation of NACK messages from the receivers to the sender. Note
          the maximum transmission delay of a message from a receiver to the
          sender may be approximately <tt>(1*GRTT)</tt> in
          the case of very asymmetric network topology with respect to
          transmission delay. Thus, if the maximum receiver NACK backoff time
          is <tt>T_maxBackoff = K*GRTT</tt>, the sender
          NACK aggregation period should be equal to at least:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
T_sndrAggregate = T_maxBackoff + 1*GRTT = (K+1)*GRTT</pre></div>
<p>Immediately after the sender NACK aggregation period, the sender
          will begin transmitting repair content determined from the aggregate
          NACK state and continue with any new transmission. Also, at this
          time, the sender should observe a "hold-off" period where it
          constrains itself from initiating a new NACK aggregation period to
          allow propagation of the new transmission sequence position due to
          the repair response to the receiver group. To allow for worst case
          asymmetry, this "hold-off" time should be:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
T_sndrHoldoff = 1*GRTT</pre></div>
<p>Recall that the receivers will also employ a "hold-off" timeout
          after generating a NACK message to allow time for the sender's
          response. Given a sender <tt>&lt;T_sndrAggregate&gt;</tt> plus <tt>&lt;T_sndrHoldoff&gt;</tt> time of <tt>(K+1)*GRTT</tt>, the receivers should use hold-off
          timeouts of:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
T_rcvrHoldoff = T_sndrAggregate + T_sndrHoldoff = (K+2)*GRTT</pre></div>
<p>This allows for a worst-case propagation time of the receiver's
          NACK to the sender, the sender's aggregation time and propagation of
          the sender's response back to the receiver. Additionally, in the
          case of unicast feedback from the receiver set, it may be useful for
          the sender to forward (via multicast) a representation of its
          aggregated NACK content to the group to allow for NACK suppression
          when there is not multicast connectivity among the receiver set.
</p>
<p>At the expiration of the <tt>&lt;T_sndrAggregate&gt;</tt> timeout, the sender
          will begin transmitting repair messages according to the accumulated
          content of NACKs received. There are some guidelines with regards to
          FEC-based repair and the ordering of the repair response from the
          sender that can improve reliable multicast efficiency:
</p>
<p>When FEC is used, it is beneficial that the sender transmit
          previously untransmitted parity content as repair messages whenever
          possible. This maximizes the receiving nodes' ability to reconstruct
          the entire transmitted content from their individual subsets of
          received messages.
</p>
<p>The transmitted object and/or stream data and repair content
          should be indexed with monotonically increasing sequence numbers
          (within a reasonably large ordinal space). If the sender observes
          the discipline of transmitting repair for the earliest content
          (e.g., ordinally lowest FEC blocks) first, the receivers can use a
          strategy of withholding repair requests for later content until the
          sender once again returns to that point in the object/stream
          transmission sequence. This can increase overall message efficiency
          among the group and help work to keep repair cycles relatively
          synchronized without dependence upon strict time synchronization
          among the sender and receivers. This also helps minimize the
          buffering requirements of receivers and senders and reduces
          redundant transmission of data to the group at large.

Multicast Receiver Join Policies and Procedures</h3>

<p>Consideration should be given to the policies and procedures by
        which new receivers join a group (perhaps where reliable transmission
        is already in progress) and begin requesting repair. If receiver joins
        are unconstrained, the dynamics of group membership may impede the
        application's ability to meet its goals for forward progression of
        data transmission. Policies limiting the opportunities when receivers
        begin participating in the NACK process may be used to achieve the
        desired behavior. For example, it may be beneficial for receivers to
        attempt reliable reception from a newly-heard sender only upon
        non-repair transmissions of data in the first FEC block of an object
        or logical portion of a stream. The sender may also implement policies
        limiting the receivers from which it will accept NACK requests, but
        this may be prohibitive for scalability reasons in some situations.
        Alternatively, it may be desirable to have a looser transport
        synchronization policy and rely upon session management mechanisms to
        limit group dynamics that can cause poor performance, in some types of
        bulk transfer applications (or for potential interactive reliable
        multicast applications).

Reliable Multicast Member Identification</h3>

<p>In a NACK-based reliable multicast protocol (or other multicast
        protocols) where there is the potential for multiple sources of data,
        it is necessary to provide some mechanism to uniquely identify the
        sources (and possibly some or all receivers in some cases) within the
        group. Receivers that send NACK messages to the group will need to
        identify the sender to which the NACK is intended. Identity based on
        arriving packet source addresses is insufficient for several reasons.
        These reasons include routing changes for hosts with multiple
        interfaces that result in different packet source addresses for a
        given host over time, network address translation (NAT) or firewall
        devices, or other transport/network bridging approaches. As a result,
        some type of unique source identifier <em>&lt;sourceId&gt;</em> field SHOULD be present in
        packets transmitted by reliable multicast session members.

<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h3>3.5.&nbsp;
Data Content Identification</h3>

<p>The data and repair content transmitted by a NACK-based reliable
        multicast sender requires some form of identification in the protocol
        header fields. This identification is required to facilitate the
        reliable NACK-oriented repair process. These identifiers will also be
        used in NACK messages generated. This building block document assumes
        two very general types of data that may comprise bulk transfer session
        content. One type is static, discrete objects of finite size and the
        other is continuous non-finite streams. A given application may wish
        to reliably multicast data content using either one or both of these
        paradigms. While it may be possible for some applications to further
        generalize this model and provide mechanisms to encapsulate static
        objects as content embedded within a stream, there are advantages in
        many applications to provide distinct support for static bulk objects
        and messages with the context of a reliable multicast session. These
        applications may include content caching servers, file transfer, or
        collaborative tools with bulk content. Applications with requirements
        for these static object types can then take advantage of transport
        layer mechanisms (i.e., segmentation/reassembly, caching, integrated
        forward error correction coding, etc.) rather than being required to
        provide their own mechanisms for these functions at the application
        layer.
</p>
<p>As noted, some applications may alternatively desire to transmit
        bulk content in the form of one or more streams of non-finite size.
        Example streams include continuous quasi-real-time message broadcasts
        (e.g., stock ticker) or some content types that are part of
        collaborative tools or other applications. And, as indicated above,
        some applications may wish to encapsulate other bulk content (e.g.,
        files) into one or more streams within a multicast session.
</p>
<p>The components described within this building block document are
        envisioned to be applicable to both of these models with the potential
        for a mix of both types within a single multicast session. To support
        this requirement, the normal data content identification should
        include a field to uniquely identify the object or stream (e.g.,
        <em>&lt;objectId&gt;</em>) within some reasonable
        temporal or ordinal interval. Note that it is <em>not</em> expected that this data content
        identification will be globally unique. It is expected that the
        object/stream identifier will be unique with respect to a given sender
        within the reliable multicast session and during the time that sender
        is supporting a specific transport instance of that object or
        stream.
</p>
<p>Since "bulk" object/stream content usually requires segmentation,
        some form of segment identification must also be provided. This
        segment identifier will be relative to any object or stream identifier
        that has been provided. Thus, in some cases, NACK-based reliable
        multicast protocol instantiations may be able to receive transmissions
        and request repair for multiple streams and one or more sets of static
        objects in parallel. For protocol instantiations employing FEC the
        segment identification portion of the data content identifier may
        consist of a logical concatenation of a coding block identifier <em>&lt;sourceBlockNumber&gt;</em> and an identifier for
        the specific data or parity symbol <em>&lt;encodingSymbolId&gt;</em> of the code block. The
        <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rmt-bb-fec-basic-schemes-revised'>FEC Basic
        Schemes building block<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., &ldquo;Basic Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rmt&#8209;bb&#8209;fec&#8209;basic&#8209;schemes&#8209;revised] and descriptions of additional FEC
        schemes that may be documented later provide a standard message format
        for identifying FEC transmission content. NACK-based reliable
        multicast protocol instantiations using FEC SHOULD follow such
        guidelines.
</p>
<p>Additionally, flags to determine the usage of the content
        identifier fields (e.g., stream vs. object) may be applicable. Flags
        may also serve other purposes in data content identification. It is
        expected that any flags defined will be dependent upon individual
        protocol instantiations.
</p>
<p>In summary, the following data content identification fields may be
        required for NACK-based reliable multicast protocol data content
        messages:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Source node identifier (<em>&lt;sourceId&gt;</em>)

<li>FEC Symbol identifier (<em>&lt;encodingSymbolId&gt;</em>)

<li>Flags to differentiate interpretation of identifier fields or

        reap additional benefits since FEC-based repair does not generally
        require explicit knowledge of repair content within the bounds of its
        coding block size (in symbols). In NACK-based reliable multicast,
        parity repair packets generated will generally be transmitted only in
        response to NACK repair requests from receiving nodes. However, there
        are benefits in some network environments for transmitting some
        predetermined quantity of FEC repair packets multiplexed with the
        regular data symbol transmissions <a class='info' href='#FecHybrid'>[FecHybrid]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gossink,  D. and J. Macker, &ldquo;Reliable Multicast and Integrated Parity Retransmission with           Channel Estimation,&rdquo; 1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.
        This can reduce the amount of NACK traffic generated with relatively
        little overhead cost when group sizes are very large or the network
        connectivity has a large <tt>delay*bandwidth</tt>
        product with some nominal level of expected packet loss. While the
        application of FEC is not unique to NACK-based reliable multicast,
        these sorts of requirements may dictate the types of algorithms and
        protocol approaches that are applicable.
</p>
<p>A specific issue related to the use of FEC with NACK-based reliable
        multicast is the mechanism used to identify the portion(s) of
        transmitted data content to which specific FEC packets are applicable.
        It is expected that FEC algorithms will be based on generating a set
        of parity repair packets for a corresponding block of transmitted data
        packets. Since data content packets are uniquely identified by the
        concatenation of <em>&lt;sourceId::objectId::sourceBlockNumber::encodingSymbolId&gt;</em>
        during transport, it is expected that FEC packets will be identified
        in a similar manner. The FEC Building Block document <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L.

Round-trip Timing (RTT) Collection</h3>

<p>The measurement of packet propagation round-trip time (RTT) among
        members of the group is required to support timer-based NACK
        suppression algorithms, timing of sender commands or certain repair
        functions, and congestion control operation. The nature of the
        round-trip information collected is dependent upon the type of
        interaction among the members of the group. In the case of
        "one-to-many" transmission, it may be that only the sender requires
        RTT knowledge of the GRTT and/or RTT knowledge of only a portion of
        the group. Here, the GRTT information might be collected in a
        reasonably scalable manner. For congestion control operation, it is
        possible that each receiver in the group may need knowledge of its
        individual RTT. In this case, an alternative RTT collection scheme may
        be utilized where receivers collect individual RTT measurements with
        respect to the sender(s) and advertise them to the group or sender(s).
        Where it is likely that exchange of reliable multicast data will occur
        among the group on a "many-to-many" basis, there are alternative
        measurement techniques that might be employed for increased

        participating hosts that may simplify RTT measurement. There are
        trade-offs in multicast congestion control design that require further
        consideration before a universal recommendation on RTT (or GRTT)
        measurement can be specified. Regardless of how the RTT information is
        collected (and more specifically GRTT) with respect to congestion
        control or other requirements, the sender will need to advertise its
        current GRTT estimate to the group for various NACK timeouts used by

<a name="rfc.section.3.7.1"></a><h3>3.7.1.&nbsp;
One-to-Many Sender GRTT Measurement</h3>

<p>The goal of this form of RTT measurement is for the sender to
          estimate the GRTT among the receivers who are actively participating
          in NACK-based reliable multicast operation. The set of receivers
          participating in this process may be the entire group or some subset
          of the group determined from another mechanism within the protocol
          instantiation. An approach to collect this GRTT information
          follows.
</p>
<p>The sender periodically polls the group with a message
          (independent or "piggy-backed" with other transmissions) containing
          a <tt>&lt;sendTime&gt;</tt> timestamp relative to
          an internal clock at the sender. Upon reception of this message, the
          receivers will record this <tt>&lt;sendTime&gt;</tt> timestamp and the time
          (referenced to their own clocks) at which it was received <tt>&lt;recvTime&gt;</tt>. When the receiver provides
          feedback to the sender (either explicitly or as part of other
          feedback messages depending upon protocol instantiation
          specification), it will construct a "response" using the
          formula:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
grttResponse = sendTime + (currentTime - recvTime)
</pre></div>
<p>where the <tt>&lt;sendTime&gt;</tt> is the
          timestamp from the last probe message received from the source and
          the (<tt>&lt;currentTime&gt; -
          &lt;recvTime&gt;</tt>) is the amount of time differential since
          that request was received until the receiver generated the
          response.
</p>
<p>The sender processes each receiver response by calculating a
          current RTT measurement for the receiver from whom the response was
          received using the following formula:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
RTT_rcvr = currentTime - grttResponse
</pre></div>
<p>During the each periodic <tt>GRTT</tt> probing
          interval, the source keeps the peak round trip timing measurement
          (<tt>RTT_peak</tt>) from the set of responses it
          has received. A conservative estimate of <tt>GRTT</tt> is kept to maximize the efficiency of
          redundant NACK suppression and repair aggregation. The update to the
          source's ongoing estimate of <tt>GRTT</tt> is
          done observing the following rules:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>If a receiver's response round trip time (<tt>RTT_rcvr</tt>) is greater than the current
              <tt>GRTT</tt> estimate, the <tt>GRTT</tt> is immediately updated to this new
              peak value:<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
GRTT = RTT_rcvr</pre></div>
</li>
<li>At the end of the response collection period (i.e., the GRTT
              probe interval), if the recorded "peak" response <tt>RTT_peak</tt>) is less than the current GRTT
              estimate, the GRTT is updated to:<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
GRTT = MAX(0.9*GRTT, RTT_peak)</pre></div>
</li>
<li>If no feedback is received, the sender <tt>GRTT</tt> estimate remains unchanged.
</li>
<li>At the end of the response collection period, the peak
              tracking value (<tt>RTT_peak</tt>) is reset
              to ZERO for subsequent peak detection.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The GRTT collection period (i.e., period of probe transmission)
          could be fixed at a value on the order of that expected for group
          membership and/or network topology dynamics. For robustness, more
          rapid probing could be used at protocol startup before settling to a
          less frequent, steady-state interval. Optionally, an algorithm may
          be developed to adjust the GRTT collection period dynamically in
          response to the current estimate of GRTT (or variations in it) and
          to an estimation of packet loss. The overhead of probing messages
          could then be reduced when the GRTT estimate is stable and
          unchanging, but be adjusted to track more dynamically during periods
          of variation with correspondingly shorter GRTT collection periods.
          GRTT collection MAY also be coupled with collection of other
          information for congestion control purposes.
</p>
<p>In summary, although NACK repair cycle timeouts are based on
          GRTT, it should be noted that convergent operation of the protocol
          does not depend upon highly accurate GRTT estimation. The current
          mechanism has proved sufficient in simulations and in the
          environments where NACK-based reliable multicast protocols have been
          deployed to date. The estimate provided by the given algorithm
          tracks the peak envelope of actual GRTT (including operating system
          effect as well as network delays) even in relatively high loss
          connectivity. The steady-state probing/update interval may
          potentially be varied to accommodate different levels of expected
          network dynamics in different environments.

One-to-Many Receiver RTT Measurement</h3>

<p>In this approach, receivers send messages with timestamps to the
          sender. To control the volume of these receiver-generated messages,
          a suppression mechanism similar to that described for NACK
          suppression my be used. The "age" of receivers' RTT measurement
          should be kept by receivers and used as a metric in competing for
          feedback opportunities in the suppression scheme. For example,
          receiver who have not made any RTT measurement or whose RTT
          measurement has aged most should have precedence over other
          receivers. In turn the sender may have limited capacity to provide
          an "echo" of the receiver timestamps back to the group, and it could
          use this RTT "age" metric to determine which receivers get
          precedence. The sender can determine the <tt>GRTT</tt> as described in 3.7.1 if it provides
          sender timestamps to the group. Alternatively, receivers who note
          their RTT is greater than the sender GRTT can compete in the
          feedback opportunity/suppression scheme to provide the sender and
          group with this information.

Many-to-Many RTT Measurement</h3>

<p>For reliable multicast sessions that involve multiple senders, it
          may be useful to have RTT measurements occur on a true
          "many-to-many" basis rather than have each sender independently
          tracking RTT. Some protocol efficiency can be gained when receivers
          can infer an approximation of their RTT with respect to a sender
          based on RTT information they have on another sender and that other
          sender's RTT with respect to the new sender of interest. For
          example, for receiver "a" and senders "b" and "c", it is likely
          that:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
 RTT(a&lt;-&gt;b) &lt;= RTT(a&lt;-&gt;c)) + RTT(b&lt;-&gt;c)</pre></div>
<p>Further refinement of this estimate can be conducted if RTT
          information is available to a node concerning its own RTT with
          respect to a small subset of other group members and if information
          concerning RTT among those other group members is learned by the
          node during protocol operation.

Sender GRTT Advertisement</h3>

<p>To facilitate deterministic protocol operation, the sender should
          robustly advertise its current estimation of <tt>GRTT</tt> to the receiver set. Common, robust
          knowledge of the sender's current operating GRTT estimate among the
          group will allow the protocol to progress in its most efficient
          manner. The sender's GRTT estimate can be robustly advertised to the
          group by simply embedding the estimate into all pertinent messages
          transmitted by the sender. The overhead of this can be made quite
          small by quantizing (compressing) the GRTT estimate to a single byte
          of information. The following C-language functions allows this to be
          done over a wide range (<tt>RTT_MIN</tt> through
          <tt>RTT_MAX</tt>) of GRTT values while
          maintaining a greater range of precision for small values and less
          precision for large values. Values of 1.0e-06 seconds and 1000
          seconds are RECOMMENDED for <tt>RTT_MIN</tt> and
          <tt>RTT_MAX</tt> respectively. NACK-based
          reliable multicast applications may wish to place an additional,
          smaller upper limit on the GRTT advertised by senders to meet
          application data delivery latency constraints at the expense of
          greater feedback volume in some network environments.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>

<p>Note that this function is useful for quantizing GRTT times in
          the range of 1 microsecond to 1000 seconds. Of course, NACK-based
          reliable multicast protocol implementations may wish to further
          constrain advertised GRTT estimates (e.g., limit the maximum value)
          for practical reasons.

Group Size Determination/Estimation</h3>

<p>When NACK-based reliable multicast protocol operation includes
        mechanisms that excite feedback from the group at large (e.g.,
        congestion control), it may be possible to roughly estimate the group
        size based on the number of feedback messages received with respect to
        the distribution of the probabilistic suppression mechanism used. Note
        the timer-based suppression mechanism described in this document does
        not require a very accurate estimate of group size to perform
        adequately. Thus, a rough estimate, particularly if conservatively
        managed, may suffice. Group size may also be determined
        administratively. In absence of any group size determination mechanism
        a default group size value of 10,000 is RECOMMENDED for reasonable
        management of feedback given the scalability of expected NACK-based
        reliable multicast usage. This conservative estimate (over-estimate)
        of group size in the algorithms described above will result in some
        added latency to the NACK repair process if the actual group size is
        smaller but with a guarantee of feedback implosion protection. The

Intermediate System Assistance</h3>

<p>NACK-based multicast protocols may benefit from general purpose
        intermediate system assistance. In particular, additional NACK
        suppression where intermediate systems can aggregate NACK content (or
        filter duplicate NACK content) from receivers as it is relayed toward
        the sender could enhance NORM group size scalability. For NACK-based
        reliable multicast protocols using FEC, it is possible that
        intermediate systems may be able to filter FEC repair messages to
        provide an intelligent "subcast" of repair content to different legs
        of the multicast topology depending on the repair needs learned from
        previous receiver NACKs. Similarly, intermediate systems could monitor
        receiver NACKs and provide repair transmissions on-demand in response
        if sufficient state on the content being transmitted was being
        maintained. This can reduce the latency and volume of repair
        transmissions when the intermediate system is associated with a
        network link that is particularly problematic with respect to packet
        loss. These types of assist functions would require intermediate
        system interpretation of transport data unit content identifiers and
        flags. NACK-based protocol designs should consider the potential for
        intermediate system assistance in the specification of protocol
        messages and operations. It is likely that intermediate systems
        assistance will be more pragmatic if message parsing requirements are
        modest and if the amount of state an intermediate system is required
        to maintain is relatively small.

A principal limitation of NACK-based
      reliable multicast operation involves group size scalability when
      network capacity for receiver feedback is very limited. It is possible
      that, with proper protocol design, the intermediate system assistance
      techniques mentioned in <a class='info' href='#Scalability'>Section&nbsp;2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Group Size Scalability</span><span>)</span></a> and described
      further in <a class='info' href='#RouterAssist'>Section&nbsp;3.10<span> (</span><span class='info'>Intermediate System Assistance</span><span>)</span></a> can allow NACK-based
      approaches to scale to larger group sizes. NACK-based reliable multicast
      operation is also governed by implementation buffering constraints.
      Buffering greater than that required for typical point-to-point reliable
      transport (e.g., TCP) is recommended to allow for disparity in the
      receiver group connectivity and to allow for the feedback delays
      required to attain group size scalability.
</p>
<p>Prior experimental work included various protocol instantiations that
      implemented some of the concepts described in this building block
      document. This includes the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) protocol
      described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3208'>[RFC3208]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Speakman, T., Crowcroft, J., Gemmell, J., Farinacci, D., Lin, S., Leshchiner, D., Luby, M., Montgomery, T., Rizzo, L., Tweedly, A., Bhaskar, N., Edmonstone, R., Sumanasekera, R., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;PGM Reliable Transport Protocol Specification,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> among others that were
      documented or deployed outside of IETF activities. While the PGM
      protocol specification and some other approaches encompassed many of the
      goals of bulk data delivery as described here, this NACK-based building
      block provides a more generalized framework so that different
      application needs can be met by different protocol instantiation
      variants. The NACK-based building block approach described here includes
      compatiblity with the other protocol mechanisms including FEC and
      congestion control that are described in other IETF reliable multicast
      building block documents. The NACK repair process described in this
      document can provide performance advantages as compared to PGM when both
      are deployed on a pure end-to-end basis without intermediate system
      assistance. The round-trip timing estimation described here and its use
      in the NACK repair process allow protocol operation to more
      automatically adapt to different network environments or operate within
      environments where connectivity is dynamic. Use of the FEC payload
      identification techniques described in the FEC building block <a class='info' href='#RFC5052'>[RFC5052]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Watson, M., Luby, M., and L. Vicisano, &ldquo;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Building Block,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and specific FEC instantiations allow protocol
      instantiations more flexibility as FEC techniques evolve than the
      specific sequence number data identification scheme described in the PGM
      specification. Similar flexibility is expected if protocol
      instantiations are designed to modularly invoke (at design time, if not
      run-time) the appropriate congestion control building block for
      different application or deployment purposes.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>NACK-based reliable multicast protocols are expected to be subject to
      the same security vulnerabilities as other IP and IP Multicast
      protocols. However, unlike point-to-point (unicast) transport protocols,
      it is possible that one badly-behaving participant can impact the
      transport service experience of others in the group. For example, a
      malicious receiver node could intentionally transmit NACK messages to
      cause the sender(s) to unnecessarily transmit repairs instead of making
      forward progress with reliable transfer. Also, group-wise messaging to
      support congestion control or other aspects of protocol operation may be
      subject to similar vulnerabilities. Thus, it is highly RECOMMENDED that
      security techniques such as authentication and data integrity checks be
      applied for NACK-based reliable multicast deployments. Protocol
      instantiations using this building block MUST identify approaches to
      security that can be used to address these and other security
      considerations.
</p>
<p>NACK-based reliable multicast is compatible with IP security (IPsec)
      authentication mechanisms <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>[RFC4301]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> that are
      RECOMMENDED for protection against session intrusion and denial of
      service attacks. A particular threat for NACK-based protocols is that of
      NACK replay attacks that could prevent a multicast sender from making
      forward progress in transmission. Any standard IPsec mechanisms that can
      provide protection against such replay attacks are RECOMMENDED for use.
      The IETF Multicast Security (MSEC) Working Group has developed a set of
      recommendations in its <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-msec-ipsec-extensions'>Multicast Extensions to the
      Internet Protocol Security Architecture<span> (</span><span class='info'>Weis, B., Gross, G., and D. Ignjatic, &ldquo;Multicast Extensions to the Security Architecture for the Internet  Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;msec&#8209;ipsec&#8209;extensions] that can be applied to
      appropriately extend IPsec mechanisms to multicast operation. An
      appendix of this document specifically addresses the Nack-Oriented
      Reliable Multicast protocol service model. As complete support for IPsec
      multicast operation may potentially follow reliable multicast
      deployment, NACK-based reliable multicast protocol instantiations SHOULD
      consider providing support for their own NACK replay attack protection
      when network layer mechanisms are not available. This MAY be necessary
      when IPsec implementations are used that do not provide multicast replay
      attack protection when multiple sources are present.
</p>
<p>For NACK-based multicast deployments with large receiver groups using
      IPsec, approaches might be developed that use shared, common keys for
      receiver-originated protocol messages to maintain a practical number of
      IPsec Security Associations (SAs). However, such group-based
      authentication may not be sufficient unless the receiver population can
      be completely trusted. Additionally, this can make identification of
      badly-behaving (although authenticated) receiver nodes problematic as
      such nodes could potentially masquerade as other receivers in the group.
      In deployments such as this, one SHOULD consider use of Source-Specific
      Multicast (SSM) instead of Any-Source Multicast (ASM) models of
      multicast operation. SSM operation can simplify security challenges in a
      couple of ways:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A NACK-based protocol supporting SSM operation can eliminate
          direct receiver-to-receiver signaling. This dramatically reduces the
          number of security associations that need to be established.
</li>
<li>The SSM sender(s) can provide a centralized management point for
          secure group operation for its respective data flow with the sender
          alone required to conduct individual host authentication for each
          receiver when group-based authentication does not suffice or is not
          pragmatic to deploy.
</li>
</ol>

<p>When individual host authentication is required, then it is possible
      receivers could use a digital signature on the IPsec Encapsulating
      Security Protocol (ESP) payload as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC4359'>[RFC4359]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Weis, B., &ldquo;The Use of RSA/SHA-1 Signatures within Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Either an identity-based signature system or a
      group-specific public key infrastructure could avoid per-receiver state
      at the sender(s). Additionally, implementations MUST also support
      policies to limit the impact of extremely or exceptionally
      poor-performing (due to bad behavior or otherwise) receivers upon
      overall group operation if this is acceptable for the relevant
      application.
</p>
<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#memberId'>Section&nbsp;3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Reliable Multicast Member Identification</span><span>)</span></a>, deployment of
      NACK-based reliable multicast in some network environments may require
      identification of group members beyond that of IP addressing. If
      protocol-specific security mechanisms are developed, then it is
      RECOMMENDED that protocol group member identifiers are used as selectors
      (as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>[RFC4301]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>) for the applicable
      security associations. When IPsec is used, it is RECOMMENDED that the
      protocol implementation verify that the source IP address of received
      packets are valid for the given protocol source identifier in addition
      to usual IPsec authentication. This would prevent a badly-behaving
      (although authorized) member spoofing messages from other legitimate
      members, providing that individual host authentication is supported.
</p>
<p>The MSEC Working Group has also developed automated group keying
      solutions which are applicable to NACK-based reliable multicast
      security. For example, to support IPsec or other security mechanisms,
      the <a class='info' href='#RFC4535'>Group Secure Association Key Management
      Protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harney, H., Meth, U., Colegrove, A., and G. Gross, &ldquo;GSAKMP: Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4535] MAY be used for automated group key management. The
      technique it identifies for "Group Establishment for Receive-Only
      Members" may be application NACK-based reliable multicast SSM
      operation.
