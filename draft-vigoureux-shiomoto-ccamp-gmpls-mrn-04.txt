Abstract 
    
   Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been 
   related to environments of single switching capability devices e.g. 
   one data plane layer, as such, the complexity raised by the control 
   of such data planes is similar to the one expected in classical 
   IP/MPLS networks. The fundamental reason being that an IP-based 
   control plane protocol suite for Label Switch Routers (LSR) or 
   Optical Cross-Connects (OXC) has exactly the same Level (i.e. single 
   data plane layer) complexity.

   The present document analyses the various GMPLS signaling and routing 
   aspects when considering network environments consisting of multiple 
   switching data layers e.g. supporting combined Packet/Layer-2 
   Switching - OXC devices. The examples provide an overview of the 
   tradeoffs in using a GMPLS control plane for combined Ethernet MAC - 
   opaque, service transparent, and/or fully transparent data planes. 
   The intent of this memo is also to demonstrate that these aspects may 
   not be as straightforward as they may first appear.

1. Introduction 
    
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) facilitates the 
   realization of seamless control integration of IP/MPLS networks with 
   SONET/SDH (see [T1.105]/[G.707]) or G.709 (see [G.709]) optical 
   transport networks. In particular, the applicability of GMPLS to both 
   packet/frame and circuit switching technologies (i.e. unified control 
   plane architecture) provides a unified control management approach 
   for both provisioning resources and restoration techniques. 
    
   One of the additional advantages driving the construction of a 
   unified GMPLS control plane is the desire to support multi LSP- 
   region [MPLS-HIER] routing and traffic engineering capability. This 
   would enable effective network resource utilization of both the 
   Packet/Layer2 LSP regions and the Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) or 
   Lambda (Optical Channels) LSP regions in high capacity networks. 
    
1.1 Context and Motivations 
    
   Vertical integration refers (see [TE-WG]) to the definition of 
   collaborative mechanisms within a single control plane instance 
   driving multiple (but at least two) data planes (also referred in the 
   scope of GMPLS as switching layers). Horizontal integration is 
   defined when each entity constituting the network environment 
   includes at least one common (data plane) switching capability and 
   the control plane topology extends over several partitions being 
   either areas or autonomous systems (see [INTER-AREA-AS]). In this 
   latter case, the integration is thus defined between nodes hosting 
   the same switching capability. For instance, the control plane 
   interconnection between lambda switching capable routing areas 
   defines an horizontal integration. On the other hand, an environment 
   in which at least two different switching capabilities are present 
   and where these capabilities are both hosted by the same device 
   and/or hosted by different devices involves a vertical integration 
   within the GMPLS control plane. Such multi-switching layer capable 
   networks are referred to as Multi LSP-Region Networks or simply 
   Multi-Region Networks (MRN). 
    
   Note here that, the CCAMP Working Group is currently actively working 
   on extensions to this horizontal integration (the initial iteration 
   being the single area context worked out over the past few years) by 
   considering common multi-area and multi-AS traffic engineering 
   techniques and protocol extensions [INTER-AREA-AS]. As a first phase 
   vertical integration, as proposed in this document, we focus on 
   single area only environments.

   From the control plane viewpoint (as defined in [MPLS-HIER]) a data  
   plane layer is mapped to an LSP region. Following this approach, a 
   Traffic Engineering link or simply TE Link (at the control plane 
   level) maps exactly the definition proposed in the canonical layered 
   model (see [G.805]) where a link is defined as a link bundle (using 
   the IETF terminology). More generically, the TE link notion is now 
   recursively defined and accepted implying that the link bundle term 
   will be used only when referring to a set of component links or 
   ports. Therefore, the TE Link concept opens the door for a clear 
   separation between the routing adjacencies and the data plane bearer 
   links (or channels). Furthermore, TE Links have been extended to non 
   adjacent devices by introducing the Forwarding Adjacency (FA) concept 
   enabling in turn to decrease the number of control plane instances to 
   control N transport layers. Last, the bundling of FA is also defined 
   in [MPLS-BDL] allowing for additional flexibility in controlling 
   large scale backbone networks. 
    
   Using the Forwarding Adjacency, a node may (under its  local control 
   policy configuration) advertise an LSP as a TE link into the same 
   OSPF/ISIS instance as the one that induces this LSP. Such a link is 
   referred to as a "Forwarding Adjacency" (FA) and the corresponding 
   LSP to as a "Forwarding Adjacency LSP", or simply FA-LSP. Since the 
   advertised entity appears as a TE link in OSPF/ISIS, both end-point 
   nodes of the FA-LSP must belong to the same OSPF area/ISIS level 
   (intra-area improvement of scalability). Afterwards, OSPF/ISIS floods 
   the link-state information about FAs just as it floods the 
   information about any other TE Link. This allows other nodes to use 
   FAs as any other TE Links for path computation purposes. 
    
1.2 Rationales for Multi-Region Networks: 
    
   The rationales for investigating vertical integration (and thus 
   multi-region networks) in the GMPLS distributed control plane context 
   can be summarized as follows: 
    
   - The maintenance of multiple instances of the control plane on 
   devices hosting more than one switching capability not only (and 
   obviously) increases the complexity of their interactions but also 
   increases the total amount of processing individual instances would 
   handle. 
    
   - The merge of both data and control plane addressing spaces helps in 
   avoiding multiple identification for the same object (a link for 
   instance or more generally any network resource), on the other hand 
   such aggregation does not impact the separation between the control 
   and the data plane. 
    
   - The collaboration between associated control planes (packet/framed 
   data planes) and non-associated control planes (SONET/SDH, G.709, 


Vigoureux, Shiomoto et al. - Expires April 2004              [Page 4] 
draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   etc.) is facilitated due to the capability of hooking the associated 
   in-band signaling to the IP terminating interfaces of the control 
   plane. 
    
   - Resource management and policies to be applied at the edges of such 
   environment would be facilitated (less control to management 
   interactions) and more scalable (through the use of aggregated 
   information). 
    
   In this context, Hybrid Photonic Networks (HPN) can be differentiated 
   from Multi-Region Networks (MRN). The main difference between nodes 
   included in an HPN environment and nodes included in an MRN 
   environment can be expressed as follows: some of the former MUST 
   include at least for some (but at least two) of their interfaces an 
   LSC switching capability with "lambda" (photonic) encoding. 
    
1.3 Problem statement 
    
   The control by a single GMPLS instance of at least two different 
   switching capabilities rises some issues with regards to the control 
   plane scalability as well as inter-working issues between these 
   switching capabilities. Typically, devices present in an MRN will 
   have the information about all the TE-Links corresponding to the 
   different switching capabilities present in the environment. This 
   will lead, in turn, to the maintenance of large LSDB resulting in 
   CSPF computation time possibly exceeding reasonable value. 
   Scalability also concerns the maintenance of a very large number of 
   signaling sessions. Section 4 addresses these types of issues while 
   section 5 covers issues resulting from devices hosting at least two 
   different switching capabilities, or, more broadly, cross layer 
   considerations. 
    
2. Routing over Forwarding Adjacencies 
    
   In order to extend MPLS to support non-packet TE attributes within 
   the scope of an integrated (routing) model encompassing several data 
   planes, GMPLS needs to support control of several data plane layers 
   (or switching layers) using the same protocol instance. 
    
   Forwarding Adjacencies (FAs) as described in [MPLS-HIER] are a useful 
   and powerful tool for improving the scalability of Generalized MPLS 
   (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) capable networks. 
   Through the aggregation of TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) this 
   concept enables the creation of a vertical (nested) TE-LSP Hierarchy. 
   Forwarding Adjacency LSPs (FA-LSP) may be advertised as TE link (or 
   simply FA) into the same instance of OSPF/ISIS as the one that was 
   used to create, initiate or trigger this LSP, allowing other LSRs to 
   use FAs as TE links for their path computation. As such, forwarding 
   adjacency LSPs have characteristics of both TE links and LSPs. 


Vigoureux, Shiomoto et al. - Expires April 2004              [Page 5] 
draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


    
   While this definition is in perfect alignment for non-packet LSP 
   regions and boundaries, the same concept(s) can also be re-used in 
   the MPLS LSP context but with a major difference. The mapping goes in 
   the opposite direction i.e. from the control to the IP/MPLS 
   forwarding plane, since in the packet domain FA-LSPs are purely 
   abstract objects that would, if well tailored, provide additional 
   scalability within a routing plane instance (i.e. define virtual TE 
   links without increasing the number of routing adjacencies). Indeed, 
   the use of FAs provides a mechanism for improving bandwidth (or more 
   generally any resource) utilization when its dynamic allocation can 
   be performed in discrete units; it also enables aggregating 
   forwarding state, and in turn, reducing significantly the number of 
   required labels as well as the number of signaling sessions. 
   Therefore, FAs may significantly improve the scalability of GMPLS TE-
   capable control planes, and allow the creation of a TE-LSP hierarchy. 
    
   From this, and when combining multi-region environments, the 
   challenges that arise are related to the combination of both types of 
   mappings (and in particular their control) for both super-classes of 
   LSPs i.e. packet LSPs and circuit-oriented LSPs (a.k.a. non-packet 
   LSPs) from or to the same control plane instance. 
    
2.1 Scalability of Single Region Networks 
    
   The main issue arising with FAs is related to the mapping 
   directionality (from the data to the control plane). FAs allow 
   avoiding the well-known O(N^2) at the control plane level by using 
   the mechanisms defined in [MPLS-HIER] but requires a specific 
   policing at the LSP region edges (or boundaries) in order to avoid 
   full meshes both at the data plane level and control plane level. 
    
   Currently, and as specified in [MPLS-HIER], it is expected that FAs 
   will not be used for establishing OSPF/ISIS peering relation between 
   the routers at the ends of the adjacency thus clearly avoiding N 
   square problem at the control plane level. On the other hand, 
   specific policies would be required to avoid a full mesh of FAs. A 
   full mesh of FAs would lead, at the control plane level, to a full 
   mesh of signaling sessions while, at the data plane, it would lead to 
   poor resource utilization. Avoiding full meshes can be accomplished 
   by setting the default metric of the FA to max[1, (the TE metric of 
   the FA-LSP path - 1)] so that it attracts traffic in preference to 
   setting up a new LSP. Such policing clearly states that FA-LSPs are 
   driven by a most fit approach: do not create new FA-LSPs as long as 
   existing ones are not filled up. The main issue with this approach is 
   definitely related to "what to advertise and originate at LSP region 
   boundaries". For instance, fully filled FA-LSPs should not be 
   advertised (if preemption is not allowed), while, attracting traffic 
   should be provided in some coordinated manner in order to avoid sub- 


Vigoureux, Shiomoto et al. - Expires April 2004              [Page 6] 
draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   optimal FA-LSP setup. Moreover, nothing precludes the maintenance of 
   several partially filled FA-LSPs that are kept unused indefinitely 
   (even if their metric is set optimally) in particular when the 
   bandwidth of the FA-LSP can not (due to its discrete bandwidths 
   units) be exactly set to the incoming LSP request. 
    
   Note: the latter suggests filtering of the corresponding LSAs at the 
   regions' boundaries. In OSPF this can be accomplished by not 
   advertising the link as a regular LSA, but only as a TE opaque LSA 
   (see [RFC-2370]). 
    
2.2 Scalability of Multi-Region Networks 
    
   The Shortest Path First (SPF) computation complexity is, in classical 
   cases, proportional to L Log(N) where L is the number of links (here, 
   more precisely TE links) and N the number of address prefixes. As 
   such, the full mesh scalability issues can be solved in two ways 
   either by improving the computational capabilities of the (C-)SPF 
   algorithms or simply by keeping existing Log(N) complexity but then 
   by improving collaboration between data planes. 
   The former can be achieved for instance by using Fibonacci heaps with 
   Log(Log(N)) complexity for instance, which in turn, allows for a 
   number of TE links greater than 1E6 (versus 1E3 with classical 
   implementations). The latter can be achieved by considering M 
   regions, over the same control plane topology and without using any 
   heuristics, one increases this complexity to M x L (Log (M x N)). 
    
   However, since TE Links can advertise multiple Interface Switching 
   Capabilities (ISC), the number of links can be limited (by 
   combination) by using specific topological maps referred to as 
   Virtual Network Topologies (VNT). The introduction of virtual 
   topological maps leads us to consider the concept of emulation of 
   data plane overlays [MAMLTE]. Therefore, the expectation here is to 
   reduce the overall computational complexity to L Log(M+1) x Log 
   (Log(M+1) x N) (note: with M = 1 it brings L Log(N)). 
    
2.3 Emulating Data Plane Overlays using FAs 
    
   According to [MPLS-HIER] ISC ordering, we can use the following 
   terminology: FA-LSP(1) corresponds to TE Links for which the ISC is 
   equal to PSC-1, FA-LSP(2) to PSC-2, FA-LSP(3) to PSC-3, FA-LSP(4) = 
   PSC-4, FA-LSP(5) to LS2SC, FA-LSP(6) to TDM, FA-LSP(7) to LSC and FA-
   LSP(8) to FSC. 
    
   FA-LSP(i) is routed over the FA-LSP(i+j) with j >= 1. In other words 
   a set of FA-LSPs(i+j) with j fixed provides a Virtual Network 
   Topology (VNT) for routing FA-LSPs(i). The virtual network topology 
   offered by a set of FA-LSPs(i) is denoted by VNT(i) in this document. 
   The virtual network topology is changed by setting up and/or tearing 


Vigoureux, Shiomoto et al. - Expires April 2004              [Page 7] 
draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   down one (or more) FA-LSP(i). The change of the VNT(i) affects the 
   routing of FA-LSPs(i-j). It is expected that boundary LSRs of VNT(i) 
   will behave consistently with respect to any internal (LSP/link 
   recovery) or external (LSP/link provisioning) triggering event. 
    
   Routing is dependent on the network topology and associated link 
   state. Routing stability may be impaired if the Virtual Network 
   Topology frequently changes and/or if the status of links in the 
   Virtual Network Topology frequently changes. In this context, 
   robustness of the Virtual Network Topology is defined as the 
   capability to smooth changes that may occur and avoid their 
   subsequent propagation. Changes of the Virtual Network Topology may 
   be caused by the creation and/or deletion of several LSPs. Creation 
   and deletion of LSPs may be triggered by adjacent regions or through 
   operational actions to meet change of traffic demand. Routing 
   robustness should be traded with adaptability with respect to the 
   change of incoming traffic requests. 
    
2.4 FA Attributes Inheritance 
    
   Several FA-LSPs(i) between LSRs over LSP region(i+1) are already 
   established, and several FA-LSPs(i-1) have been setup over this 
   topology and are partially filled up. One of the latter LSR regions 
   sees an incoming LSP request. It can be demonstrated that the TE 
   metric (in addition to the Maximum LSP Bandwidth and Unreserved 
   Bandwidth see [GMPLS-RTG]) alone is not a sufficient metric to 
   compute the best path between these regions. This suggests that the 
   inheritance process over which the TE-Metric of the FA is not as 
   straightforward as proposed in [MPLS-HIER]. 
    
   The best example is a packet LSP (PSC-1) to be multiplexed into PSC- 
   2 region that lies over an LSC region. The metric MUST not take only 
   into account packet boundaries interface features, properties and 
   traffic engineering attributes such as delay or bit-rate but also for 
   instance the distance over the LSP region that this LSP will have to 
   travel. As such, the TE Metric for the Lambda LSP (in this example, 
   FA-LSP(i+1)) must be at least defined as a combination of the bit-
   rate and the distance, classically the bit-rate times the distance 
   with some weighting factors. The main issue from this perspective is 
   that joined Path TE Metric wouldn't in such a case tackle 
   simultaneously both packet and optical specifics. 
    
   This suggests the definition of more flexible TE Metric, at least the 
   definition of a TE Metric per ISC. Simply adjust the TE Metric to the 
   (TE Metric of the FA-LSP path - 1) is a valid approach between LSP 
   over the same region class (PSC-1, PSC-2, ... , PSC-N, for instance) 
   but not necessarily between PSC and LSC region.

draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   Other TE attributes that need a specific processing during 
   inheritance are the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG) (see for instance 
   [SRLG]) Resource Class/Color (i.e. Administrative Groups) and 
   Protection (see Section 2.5). 
    
   The next section will describe the specific TE attributes to be 
   considered for devices hosting at least two switching capabilities, 
   in particular the interface switching adaptation capabilities. 
    
2.5 FA Abstraction for Recovery 
    
   In multi switching environments the inheritance of protection and 
   restoration related TE link attributes must also be considered. 
    
   1) Considering a 1:1 end-to-end LSP recovery scheme, two FA-LSPs may 
   be set up to form a single FA. To enhance the availability of the FA, 
   the primary and the secondary LSPs are set up. The primary LSP is 
   used to carry the normal traffic (see [TERM] and [E2E-RECOVERY]). 
   Once the failure occurs affecting the primary LSP, the normal traffic 
   is carried over the secondary LSP. From the routing perspective, 
   there is no topological change to carry the traffic. These two LSPs 
   should, therefore, be advertised within the scope of a single FA TE 
   link advertisement with link protection type of 1:1. This FA will be 
   processed by an upper layer as a span protected link. 
    
   2) Considering now a single FA-LSP, span protected over each link 
   (i.e. at the underlying layer). 
   The question that arises is how should this span protected FA-LSP be 
   advertised in the IGP. A link protection type of 1:1 could also be 
   used for this advertisement but then, an upper layer would have no 
   means to differentiate the two cases. However, these two recovery 
   schemes (end-to-end and span) have major differences in terms of 
   recovery delay and robustness [RECOVERY]. 
    
   Therefore, abstraction and summarization must be performed when 
   advertising FA-LSPs as TE links (to an upper layer) but using the 
   Link Protection Type flags and applying simple attribute inheritance 
   might not be sufficient to distinguish different recovery schemes. 
    
3. Cross Region Considerations 
    
   In an MRN, as described here above, some LSR could contain, under the 
   control of a single GMPLS instance, multiple interface switching 
   capabilities such as PSC and Time-Division-Multiplexing (TDM) or PSC 
   and Lambda Switching Capability (LSC) or LSC and Waveband Switching 
   Capability WBSC). 
    
   These LSRs, hosting multiple Interface Switching Capabilities (ISC), 
   are required to hold and advertise resource information on link

   states and topology. They also may have to consider certain portions 
   of internal LSR resources to terminate hierarchical label switched 
   paths (LSPs), since circuit switch capable units such as TDMs, LSCs, 
   and FSCs require rigid resources. 
    
   For example, an LSR with PSC+LSC switching capability can switch a 
   Lambda LSP but can never terminate the Lambda LSP if there is no 
   unused adaptation capability between the LSC and the PSC layers. 
    
   Therefore, within multi-region LSR networks, the advertisement the 
   so-called adaptation capability to terminate LSPs  provides critical 
   information to take into account when performing multi-region path 
   computation. This concept enables a local LSR to discriminate remote 
   LSRs (and thus allows their selection during path computation) with 
   respect to their adaptation capability e.g. to terminate Lambda LSPs 
   at the PSC level. 
    
   Hence, here we introduce the idea of discriminating the (internal) 
   adaptation capability from the (interface) switching capability by 
   considering an interface adaptation capability descriptor. 
    
3.1 Interface adaptation capability descriptor 
    
   The interface adaptation capability descriptor can be interpreted 
   either as the adaptation capability information from an incoming 
   interface or as the adaptation capability to an outgoing interface 
   for a given interface switching capability. By introducing such an 
   additional descriptor (as a sub-object of the ISC sub-TLV, for 
   instance), the local GMPLS control plane can swiftly search which 
   LSRs can terminate a certain encoding type of LSP and successfully 
   establish an LSP tunnel between two PSCs. 
    
   As an example, consider for instance a multiple LSP-region domain 
   comprising simultaneously PSC LSRs, LSC LSRs, PSC+LSC LSRs and 
   PSC+TDM+LSC LSRs. The LSRs discriminate the type of the links 
   connecting these LSRs by interpreting the interface switching 
   capability descriptor included in the TE Link TLV of the TE opaque 
   LSAs [LSP-HIER]. 
    
   The interface switching capability at both ends of a TE link between 
   LSRs for which individual resources (lambdas) are represented by 
   wavelength labels shall be [LSC, LSC], [{TDM|PSC}, LSC], or [LSC, 
   {TDM|PSC}]. On the other hand, the interface switching capability at 
   both ends of a TE link shall be [PSC,PSC] for LSPs "carrying" a shim 
   header label, or shall be [TDM, TDM], [TDM,PSC] or [PSC,TDM] for TE 
   links whose individual resources (timeslots) are represented by TDM 
   labels. Thus, based on the interface switching capability descriptor, 
   the LSRs can impose proper constraints in order to compute the paths 
   of the LSPs. For example, LSRs can understand that a remote TDM LSR

   with [LSC,TDM] link cannot be a lambda LSP intermediate link with the 
   exception that it can initiate or terminate lambda LSPs and switch 
   "TDM timeslots". 
    
   However, LSRs cannot infer the internal LSP switching capability of 
   remote LSRs, especially if the LSRs have a multi-switching capability 
   architecture such as a PSC+TDM+LSC as shown below or more generally, 
   more than two ISC capabilities. In the LSR, LSC may have a direct 
   inner interface not only to TDM but also to PSC. The LSP can be 
   interfaced at both TDM or PSC. This kind of multi-switching 
   architecture may become very common in optical networks.

   In the above figure, the switching capabilities ISC1 and ISC2 can be 
   grouped in a single TE link, and the bandwidth information defined as 
   follows: 
   Let X be the initial Unreserved Bandwidth of the TE link then the Max 
   LSP bandwidth can be equal to X for the ISC1 (as advertised in the 
   ISC1 sub-TLV) and equal to Y12 for the ISC2 (as advertised in the 
   ISC2 sub-TLV). Y12 represents the link bandwidth between the two 
   ISCs. The bandwidth accounting/updating is then dependent of the 
   inner architecture. In this case no specific adaptation capability 
   descriptor is required.  
    
   The following cases, however, highlight the limitations of such 
   procedure and the need for an enhanced switching adaptation 
   description.

                   .......................... 
    
    
   For the above picture, two cases can be considered  regarding the 
   switching capability configuration. Note that both TE1 and TE2 belong 
   to the same physical link. 
    
   Let the triplet <TE, ISC1, ISC2> represent respectively the 
   Unreserved Bandwidth of the TE link, the Maximum LSP Bandwidth of 
   ISC1 and the Maximum LSP Bandwidth of ISC2. 
    
   In a first scheme the switching capabilities can be declared as two 
   separate TE links:  for TE link 1 (TE_1) and TE link 2 (TE_2): <X1, 
   X1, Y12> and <X2, X2, Y21> 
    
   In a second scheme, the capabilities are described as part of a 
   single TE Link: <X, X+Y12, X+Y21>. 
    
   While the first case rises some issues concerning bandwidth 
   accounting coordination between the two TE Links, the later is 
   confronted to an over-provisioning issue being, in addition, highly 
   dependent on the Minimum LSP bandwidth value. Also, these approaches 
   are limited 1) by the number of switching capabilities hosted by a 
   single system and 2) by the number of ways these switching 
   capabilities interacts (i.e. the number of ways data can be 
   encapsulated/decapsulated when passing from one switching capability 
   to another).

   Referring to this figure, the problem with the use of the interface 
   switching capability descriptor at the PSC+TDM+LSC LSR, is the 
   shortage of LSP termination capability information. The PSC+TDM+LSC 
   LSR provides only switching capability information by abstracting the 
   internal node capabilities. Therefore, remote LSRs cannot accurately 
   determine which switching capability can be switched and/or 
   terminated at the PSC+TDM+LSC LSR. For such a node supporting LSC, 
   TDM and PSC switching capability, the determination of the resource 
   made available to cross for instance the LSC to PSC region boundary 
   (LSC -> PSC) may involve one of the following region cross- over: LSC 
   -> PSC and LSC -> TDM -> PSC. This can be represented as follows: 
    
    
                              ------- 
                             |       |

   2) Number of adaptation capabilities: 
    
   In addition, the LSP Encoding Type (representing the nature of the 
   link that the LSP traverses) is "lambda". Therefore, as depicted in 
   the following figure, this issue become more complex once each 
   switching capability supports multiple framing, for instance, at PSC, 
   Ethernet-MAC framing and PPP framing. 
    
                              ------- 
                             |       | 
                 ------------|  PSC  |------------ 
                |        ----|       |----        | 
                |       |    |       |    |       | 
              -----   -----   -------   -----   ----- 
             | ETH | | PPP |           | PPP | | ETH | 
              -----   -----   -------   -----   -----

               | |     |  ---|  TDM  |---  |     | | 
               |  -----------|       |-----------  | 
               |       |     |       |     |       | 
    
    
   Another example occurs when L2SC (Ethernet) switching can be adapted 
   in LAPS X.86 and GFP for instance before reaching the TDM switching 
   matrix: 
    
                              ------- 
                             |       | 
                 ------------| L2SC  |------------ 
                |        ----|       |----        | 
                |       |    |       |    |       | 
              -----   -----   -------   -----   ----- 
             | X86 | | GFP |           | GFP | | X86 | 
              -----   -----   -------   -----   ----- 
               | |     | |   |       |   | |     | | 
               | |     |  ---|  TDM  |---  |     | | 
               |  -----------|       |-----------  | 
               |       |     |       |     |       | 
    
    
   Similar circumstances can occur, if a switching fabric that supports 
   both PSC and L2SC functionalities is assembled with LSC interfaces 
   enabling "lambda" (photonic) encoding. In the switching fabric, some 
   interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and perform frame (or cell) 
   switching whilst other interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and 
   perform packet switching.

draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   Thus, the interface switching capability descriptor provides the 
   information for the forwarding (or switching) capability only. In 
   order for remote LSRs to understand properly the termination 
   capability of the other LSRs, additional information to the existing 
   interface switching capability descriptor is essential in achieving 
   seamless multi-region routing. In turn, adequate processing of this 
   additional information will allow the signaling of packet LSP set- up 
   combined with an automated triggering of new Lambda LSPs between LSRs 
   that do not yet have a preferred Lambda LSP to carry the Packet LSP. 
   (see [MLRT]). 
   Note that in the context of Hybrid Photonic Networks, additional 
   constraints such as the regeneration capability drive even more the 
   need for an adaptation switching capability descriptor. 
    
3.2 Regeneration capability 
    
   In an HPN context, the lower LSP region provides to the upper LSP 
   region a regeneration/conversion function (using for instance opto-
   electronic interfaces). More precisely a regeneration function can 
   deliver conversion (within a given pre- determined range or not) 
   while conversion may be delivered independently of the existence of 
   any regeneration capability. 
    
   The following classification applies from the definition of the 
   regeneration function: 
    
   1. If the regeneration function is defined as an Interface Switching 
   Capability (or simply ISC see [GMPLS-RTG] and [MPLS-HIER]), then if 
   this ISC value is lower or equal to the incoming LSP switching type, 
   the request may be processed by the network. Otherwise if the LSP 
   Switching Type > ISC value of the region, the LSP request can not be 
   processed and is simply rejected (see [MPLS-HIER] for a definition of 
   the relationship between ISC values). 
    
   2. If the regeneration function is not defined as an interface 
   switching capability (pure regeneration without any connection  
   function defined) then the following alternative applies depending on 
   the encoding type defined at its entry points. If the regeneration 
   depends on the encoding type of the incoming LSP request the latter 
   must be the same as the one provided by the regeneration function. 
   Otherwise the LSP request is simply rejected or tunneled toward the 
   next hop (if feasible). Notice here that forwarding an LSP request to 
   the next hop and expecting the latter would provide enough 
   regeneration capacity for this incoming LSP is a complex problem, 
   since one can not, with the currently available GMPLS tools, 
   guarantee that this request will not itself be forwarded to the next 
   hop, and so on.

draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   Moreover, by extending the knowledge of the interface capability to 
   terminate (adapt) a given signal, it would be possible for instance 
   to characterize more precisely the interfaces (physical) distance 
   coverage. This may be achieved by considering information such as the 
   transmission distance range (Short Haul, Long Haul, Ultra Long Haul, 
   etc.) or even the signal modulation format. This would provide 
   dynamic interface resource management (versus the current Network 
   Management techniques). In turn, this would decrease the time needed 
   for selecting resources during path computation. 
    
3.3 Dedicated Traffic Parameters 
    
   This point is related to whether or not dedicated traffic parameters 
   should be defined for LSPs established in MRN environments such as 
   the ones defined for Sonet/SDH (see [SONET-SDH] and G.709 (see 
   [GMPLS-G709]). 
    
   With respect to spatial routing the LSP Encoding Type, Switching Type 
   and G-PID (see [RFC-3471] for the corresponding definitions) provides 
   the required information to pertinently setup such LSPs. It is 
   nevertheless expected here to see some additional capability allowing 
   for intermediate states, in particular when the regeneration function 
   is defined as a switching layer (see also Section 6.2). 
    
   With respect to spectral routing the main issue raises from the 
   passing of external physical constraints between conversion points. 
   In addition to the Multiplier usage that may help in establishing/ 
   deleting parallel LSPs, additional information concerning the 
   physical constraint each sub-path MUST fulfill should be considered 
   e.g. maximum distance and BER per (sub-path). A parameter equivalent 
   to the Transparency level may also help in providing a hop-by-hop 
   negotiation of the regeneration capability to be used. 
    
3.4 Applications 
    
   In multi-region environments, crossing LSP regions during 
   provisioning can occur for two main reasons: grooming or regeneration 
   (when delivered by a switching capable layer). 
    
   1. Grooming 
    
   LSP grooming deals with the optimization of network resource 
   utilization. Multi-region environments are particularly well adapted 
   for this feature as they may provide different switching 
   granularities allowing for the tunnelling of several finer grained 
   LSPs into a coarser grained LSP. In this context, it can be useful 
   from the control plane viewpoint not to terminate the multiplexed LSP 
   and simply tunnel this LSP into a lower-region LSP viewed as a common 
   segment for each incoming LSPs.

   However, this raises the problem of the representation of the newly 
   established LSP at the control plane level. In particular, concerning 
   the maintenance of the two LSPs (head-end and tail-end LSPs) that 
   forms the newly spliced LSPs. Further consideration on grooming are 
   left for further study as it includes aspects leading to the 
   definition of multipoint-to-point LSPs (beyond the scope of this 
   document). 
    
   2. Regeneration 
    
   Due to the constraints of optical transmission, the optical signal 
   may have to be regenerated along the LSP path. Some multi-region 
   network may require to cross a region boundary to access the 
   regeneration function. This rises the question of the so-called LSP 
   integrity when crossing region boundaries. 
    
   Consider for instance a Lambda LSP in a LSC+PSC multi-region network. 
   For a given reason the LSP needs to be regenerated at an intermediate 
   node. It will thus use the O/E/O interfaces present in the PSC 
   region. From the control plane viewpoint either two Lambda LSPs are 
   seen (ingress to intermediate and intermediate to egress) or a single 
   one (ingress to egress). 
    
   Keeping a single Lambda LSP would prevent from maintaining, at the 
   control plane level, several entities for a single connection. It 
   should be also noted here that one assumes that regeneration is 
   delivered between LSPs (from ingress to intermediate and intermediate 
   to egress) defined within regions of the same switching capability 
   (i.e. LSC-PSC-LSC). This would in turn facilitate the processing of 
   both the regenerated entities and the (pool of) regeneration 
   resources that would need to be marked. 
    
4. Extended Scope of Switching Capabilities 
    
   When considering multi-region environments, two common examples of 
   multi-switching combinations are: 
   - Packet(LSR)/Layer-2(Switch) with TDM (SONET/SDH) or LSC (OXC) 
   - Multi-Granularity OXC (including opaque and transparent switching 
   capabilities at different granularity levels) 
    
   The first implies some considerations with respect to Layer-2 
   Switching Capable interfaces and L2SC environments. The latter 
   implies further considerations on Waveband Switching aspects. 
    
4.1 L2SC Switching 
    
   Layer 2 Switching capable interfaces and Layer 2 LSPs are in the 
   scope of GMPLS (see [GMPLS-ARCH], [GMPLS-RTG] and [RFC-3471]). Such

   interfaces are defined as capable to recognize frame/cell boundaries 
   and can forward data based on the content of the frame/cell header. 
   They include mainly interfaces on Ethernet bridges that forward data 
   based on the content of the MAC header. This section provides an 
   overview of the issues to be considered when introducing GMPLS in 
   Ethernet MAC-based networks. 
    
   In this context, the possible development of a GMPLS signaling 
   profile for Ethernet networks, involves the definition of a label 
   space. From this perspective, two questions arise: 1) what the label 
   value space represents and is the corresponding label value space 
   semantic-full (see [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]) or semantic-less (see [RFC- 
   3471]) and 2) how is the label value space implemented (i.e. 
   associated with data plane or non-associated and therefore exchanged 
   over dedicated signaling channels or even a combination of both). A 
   contiguous problem arises that the set of potential solutions must be 
   backward compatible meaning that non-GMPLS controlled Ethernet 
   interfaces should be capable to inter-work with GMPLS controlled 
   Ethernet interfaces. 
   In addition to the label considerations, an additional problem 
   appears due to the type of environment in which these Ethernet 
   interfaces are considered. These interfaces may be either so-called 
   LAN PHY's (thus implying a broadcast capable environment) or WAN 
   PHY's (thus implying point-to-point links). On the other side, one 
   has to consider MAC-based capable interfaces over Non-Broadcast 
   Multiple Access (NBMA) technologies such as MPLS (Ethernet-over- 
   MPLS) and over circuit-oriented technologies such as SDH and OTN 
   (through different adaptation technologies such as LAPS X.86 and 
   GFP). This by taking into account that the MAC Address space is by 
   definition non-hierarchical. The latter implies the definition of an 
   identification space translating the topological location of the 
   Ethernet end-points from an IP-based perspective and this optimally 
   independently of the underlying bearer technology of the Ethernet 
   frames. 
    
   The ideal situation would be to define a "one size fits all" 
   solution. However, it is clear that inferring label value space from 
   the bearer technology implies the development of so-called snooping 
   approaches, while on the other side LAN PHY's would not scale such a 
   solution implying the transformation of Broadcast Access (BA) 
   environment into a NBMA one (using star, hub-and-spoke, or multi- 
   tree approaches). Therefore, a heuristic has to be provided to solve 
   these problems while avoiding introduction of complex address 
   resolution mechanisms for such environments. Broadcasts are mainly 
   used in LAN environments for address resolution (ARP) and 
   bootstrapping (DHCP) reasons. Thus a potential solution would be to 
   let the network operate in a BA mode for such operations and bring 
   its operational mode back to an NBMA mode for unicast/multicast frame 
   processing. The same would apply for unknown unicast frames. 


Vigoureux, Shiomoto et al. - Expires April 2004             [Page 18] 
draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


    
   Therefore, a first step towards a solution would be reached, if one 
   can guarantee a dual operational mode for these environments: 1) 
   first mode being backward compatible with the broadcast exchanges as 
   defined by the IEEE (using IEEE 802.1d and related, thus using an 
   associated control plane) and 2) the second mode being GMPLS 
   compatible (thus using a non-associated IP-based distributed control 
   plane) for the unicast operations  
    
   The next issue relates to the realization of resource reservation 
   over Ethernet interfaces using GMPLS signaling techniques and its 
   applicability. For more detailed considerations see [L2SC-LSP]. 
    
4.2 Example 
    
   The following example details the usage of the concepts presented in 
   the previous sections of this document in delivering a virtual 
   topology for L2SC-over-LSC nodes. 
    
   Consider the following network topology: 
    
              1       2 
              |       | 
      3---A---B---C---D---5 
          |   |   |   | 
          |   E---F   | 
          |   |   |   | 
      4---G---H---I---J---6 
          |       | 
          7       8 
    
   In this topology each node identified with a letter is a dual 
   switching capable node (L2SC/LSC or L2SC/WBSC) and nodes identified 
   with a number refers to L2SC capable devices. 
    
   An Lambda LSP is established covering all dual-switching nodes [A-B- 
   C-D-J-I-F-E-H-G]. 
   This FA-LSP constitutes the virtual topology for the dual switching 
   nodes. This is viewed from the L2SC level as a L2SC capable multi- 
   access link that may be accessed (upon local policy basis) from each 
   node constituting the topology. Another example, would be, for 
   instance, a Lambda LSP routed over [A-B-C-D-J] but precluding access 
   to node C. 
    
   Afterwards, each node (more precisely the L2SC region) may trigger 
   the establishment of L2SC LSPs on top of this multi-access FA-LSP 
   that would allow setting up multi-partitioning of the bandwidth 
   capacity made available by the "fat pipe" having a higher ISC value. 



Vigoureux, Shiomoto et al. - Expires April 2004             [Page 19] 
draft-vigoureux-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-04.txt            March 2004 


   These L2SC LSP's may be for instance, using the above example, [A-B- 
   C-D], [A-B-D-J-I-G] or [J-I-F-E], even if the latter wouldn't be 
   usable by any incoming LSP. Each of these L2SC LSP's are simply L2SC 
   FA-LSP's forming a L2SC-capable virtual topology. This topology can 
   be subsequently used by external devices to establish L2SC LSP's 
   using these FA's as links.  
    
   Bandwidth accounting is performed on a per FA basis, translating into 
   intermediate node bandwidth aggregation accounted on a per priority 
   basis. In turn, this accounting translates into restriction over the 
   accessibility of each of the links constituting the Lambda LSP. 
    
   The above example implies that currently defined ISCs (see [GMPLS- 
   RTG]) such as L2SC might be extended to more than one value with the 
   following relationship L2SC (=L2SC-1) < L2SC-2 < L2SC-3 < L2SC-4 < 
   TDM. The (data plane) flow aggregation mechanisms for L2SC LSPs being 
   out of scope of the present document. 
    
4.3 Waveband switching 
    
   The GMPLS protocol suite, as currently defined, supports waveband 
   switching through inverse multiplexing or switching of individual 
   (contiguous) wavelength components. It may be thus appropriate to 
   integrate wavebands in the switching hierarchy in order to reflect, 
   at the control plane level, waveband physical components 
   (multiplexer/demultiplexer) availability at the data plane [WBEXT]. 
   Also, depending on the (passive/active) components used in an optical 
   network, wavelength spacing in the optical multiplex can vary. Some 
   components like multiplexer/demultiplexer impose or depend on that 
   spacing. Therefore, it may be appropriate to detail the component 
   capability with respect to spacing, and/or to indicate the number of 
   supported wavelengths per waveband. Moreover, one may also expect in 
   case of (standardized) waveband nominal frequency values some 
   simplification during the corresponding wavelength assignment. 
    
   In the MRN context, the main issue with Waveband Switching can be 
   viewed as follows. If the LSRs support in addition to waveband 
   switching an ISC in the set {PSC, L2SC, TDM, FSC} then waveband 
   switching can be assumed (from the control plane processing 
   viewpoint) as being equivalent to Lambda Switching, if one considers 
   labels as described here above. However if the additional switching 
   capability within a single device, or even network, includes 
   interfaces with LSC capability then either links should have a 
   specific resource class assigned or dedicated values should be 
   considered for the LSP Encoding Type, Switching Type and G-PID (when 
   bands are carried over fibers). 
    
5. Conclusion

   In this draft, we address the issues when using the GMPLS protocol 
   suite as a unified control plane for MRN environments. Several 
   proposals for enhancing the current GMPLS mechanisms are presented. 
   The proposals are based on current GMPLS mechanisms and in alignment 
   with GMPLS architecture (see [GMPLS-ARCH]). This memo analyzes the 
   suitability of the GMPLS protocol suite for the MRN environment, 
   keeping a strict and full alignment with the current and preferred 
   suite of signaling and routing protocols (in particular, OSPF, IS-IS, 
   RSVP-TE and LMP). 
   By starting from a single area context, the expectations coming out 
   from the first release of this memo, are clearly intended to open the 
   field to a more detailed description of the collaborative processes 
   within the GMPLS protocol suite. 
    
   The main guideline of this work is backward compatibility with the 
   current GMPLS protocols suite. The second guideline is limiting and 
   efficiently handling the complexity introduced. This memo provides an 
   introduction to MRNs and aspects to be considered. We invite the 
   CCAMP community to collaborate on progressing this critical GMPLS 
   topic: an integrated control plane supporting multiple data layers. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   In its current version, this memo does not introduce new security 
   consideration from the ones already detailed in the GMPLS protocol 
   suite.
