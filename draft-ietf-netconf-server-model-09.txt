        NETCONF Server and RESTCONF Server Configuration Models
                   draft-ietf-netconf-server-model-09

Abstract

   This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model and a
   RESTCONF server configuration data model.  These data models enable
   configuration of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves,
   including which transports are supported, what ports the servers
   listen on, call-home parameters, client authentication, and related
   parameters.

1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a NETCONF [RFC6241] server configuration data
   model and a RESTCONF [draft-ietf-netconf-restconf] server
   configuration data model.  These data models enable configuration of
   the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves, including which
   transports are supported, what ports the servers listen on, call-home
   parameters, client authentication, and related parameters.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data models is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Braces "{" and "}" enclose feature names, and indicate that the
      named feature must be present for the subtree to be present.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Objectives

   The primary purpose of the YANG modules defined herein is to enable
   the configuration of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services on a network
   element.  This scope includes the following objectives:

2.1.  Support all NETCONF and RESTCONF transports

   The YANG module should support all current NETCONF and RESTCONF
   transports, namely NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242], NETCONF over TLS
   [RFC7589], and RESTCONF over TLS [draft-ietf-netconf-restconf], and
   to be extensible to support future transports as necessary.

   Because implementations may not support all transports, the module
   should use YANG "feature" statements so that implementations can
   accurately advertise which transports are supported.

Internet-Draft    NETCONF/RESTCONF Server Config Models       March 2016


2.2.  Enable each transport to select which keys to use

   Servers may have a multiplicity of host-keys or server-certificates
   from which subsets may be selected for specific uses.  For instance,
   a NETCONF server may want to use one set of SSH host-keys when
   listening on port 830, and a different set of SSH host-keys when
   calling home.  The data models provided herein should enable
   configuration of which keys to use on a per-use basis.

2.3.  Support authenticating NETCONF/RESTCONF clients certificates

   When a certificate is used to authenticate a NETCONF or RESTCONF
   client, there is a need to configure the server to know how to
   authenticate the certificates.  The server should be able to
   authenticate the client's certificate either by using path-validation
   to a configured trust anchor or by matching the client-certificate to
   one previously configured.

2.4.  Support mapping authenticated NETCONF/RESTCONF client certificates
      to usernames

   When a client certificate is used for TLS client authentication, the
   NETCONF/RESTCONF server must be able to derive a username from the
   authenticated certificate.  Thus the modules defined herein should
   enable this mapping to be configured.

2.5.  Support both listening for connections and call home

   The NETCONF and RESTCONF protocols were originally defined as having
   the server opening a port to listen for client connections.  More
   recently the NETCONF working group defined support for call-home
   ([draft-ietf-netconf-call-home]), enabling the server to initiate the
   connection to the client, for both the NETCONF and RESTCONF
   protocols.  Thus the modules defined herein should enable
   configuration for both listening for connections and calling home.
   Because implementations may not support both listening for
   connections and calling home, YANG "feature" statements should be
   used so that implementation can accurately advertise the connection
   types it supports.

2.6.  For Call Home connections

   The following objectives only pertain to call home connections.

Internet-Draft    NETCONF/RESTCONF Server Config Models       March 2016


2.6.1.  Support more than one NETCONF/RESTCONF client

   A NETCONF/RESTCONF server may be managed by more than one NETCONF/
   RESTCONF client.  For instance, a deployment may have one client for
   provisioning and another for fault monitoring.  Therefore, when it is
   desired for a server to initiate call home connections, it should be
   able to do so to more than one client.

2.6.2.  Support NETCONF/RESTCONF clients having more than one endpoint

   An NETCONF/RESTCONF client managing a NETCONF/RESTCONF server may
   implement a high-availability strategy employing a multiplicity of
   active and/or passive endpoint.  Therefore, when it is desired for a
   server to initiate call home connections, it should be able to
   connect to any of the client's endpoints.

2.6.3.  Support a reconnection strategy

   Assuming a NETCONF/RESTCONF client has more than one endpoint, then
   it becomes necessary to configure how a NETCONF/RESTCONF server
   should reconnect to the client should it lose its connection to one
   the client's endpoints.  For instance, the NETCONF/RESTCONF server
   may start with first endpoint defined in a user-ordered list of
   endpoints or with the last endpoints it was connected to.

2.6.4.  Support both persistent and periodic connections

   NETCONF/RESTCONF clients may vary greatly on how frequently they need
   to interact with a NETCONF/RESTCONF server, how responsive
   interactions need to be, and how many simultaneous connections they
   can support.  Some clients may need a persistent connection to
   servers to optimize real-time interactions, while others prefer
   periodic interactions in order to minimize resource requirements.
   Therefore, when it is necessary for server to initiate connections,
   it should be configurable if the connection is persistent or
   periodic.

2.6.5.  Reconnection strategy for periodic connections

   The reconnection strategy should apply to both persistent and
   periodic connections.  How it applies to periodic connections becomes
   clear when considering that a periodic "connection" is a logical
   connection to a single server.  That is, the periods of
   unconnectedness are intentional as opposed to due to external
   reasons.  A periodic "connection" should always reconnect to the same
   server until it is no longer able to, at which time the reconnection
   strategy guides how to connect to another server.

Internet-Draft    NETCONF/RESTCONF Server Config Models       March 2016


2.6.6.  Keep-alives for persistent connections

   If a persistent connection is desired, it is the responsibility of
   the connection initiator to actively test the "aliveness" of the
   connection.  The connection initiator must immediately work to
   reestablish a persistent connection as soon as the connection is
   lost.  How often the connection should be tested is driven by
   NETCONF/RESTCONF client requirements, and therefore keep-alive
   settings should be configurable on a per-client basis.

2.6.7.  Customizations for periodic connections

   If a periodic connection is desired, it is necessary for the NETCONF/
   RESTCONF server to know how often it should connect.  This frequency
   determines the maximum amount of time a NETCONF/RESTCONF client may
   have to wait to send data to a server.  A server may connect to a
   client before this interval expires if desired (e.g., to send data to
   a client).

3.  High-Level Design

   The solution presented in this document defines a configurable
   keychain object, reusable groupings for SSH and TLS based servers,
   and, finally, the configurable NETCONF and RESTCONF server objects,
   which are the primary purpose for this draft.  Each of these are
   defined in a distinct YANG module, thus a total of five YANG modules
   are defined in this document.  The relationship between these five
   YANG modules is illustrated by the tree diagram below.

4.  Solution

   Each of the following five sections relate to one of the YANG modules
   depicted by the figure above.

4.1.  The System Keychain Model

   The system keychain model defined in this section provides a
   configurable object having the following characteristics:

   o  A semi-configurable list of private keys, each with one or more
      associated certificates.  Private keys MUST be either preinstalled
      (e.g., an IDevID key), be generated by request, or be loaded by
      request.  Each private key is MAY have associated certificates,
      either preinstalled or configured after creation.

   o  A configurable list of lists of trust anchor certificates.  This
      enables the server to have use-specific trust anchors.  For
      instance, one list of trust anchors might be used to authenticate
      management connections (e.g., client certificate-based
      authentication for NETCONF or RESTCONF connections), and a
      different list of trust anchors might be used for when connecting
      to a specific Internet-based service (e.g., a zero touch bootstrap
      server).

   o  An RPC to generate a certificate signing request for an existing
      private key, a passed subject, and an optional attributes.  The
      signed certificate returned from an external certificate authority
      (CA) can be later set using a standard configuration change
      request (e.g., <edit-config>).

   o  An RPC to request the server to generate a new private key using
      the specified algorithm and key length.

   o  An RPC to request the server to load a new private key.

   The following example illustrates what a fully configured keychain
   object might look like.  The private-key shown below is consistent
   with the generate-private-key and generate-certificate-signing-
   request examples above.  This example also assumes that the resulting
   CA-signed certificate has been configured back onto the server.
   Lastly, this example shows that three lists of trusted certificates
   having been configured.

4.2.  The SSH Server Model

   The SSH Server model presented in this section presents two YANG
   groupings, one for a server that opens a socket to accept TCP
   connections on, and another for a server that has had the TCP
   connection opened for it already (e.g., inetd).

   The SSH Server model (like the TLS Server model presented below) is
   provided as a grouping so that it can be used in different contexts.
   For instance, the NETCONF Server model presented in Section 4.4 uses
   one grouping to configure a NETCONF server listening for connections
   and the other grouping to configure NETCONF call home.

   A shared characteristic between both groupings is the ability to
   configure which host key is presented to clients, the private key for
   which is held in the keychain configuration presented before.
   Another shared characteristic is the ability to configure which

   trusted CA or client certificates the server should be used to
   authenticate clients when using X.509 based client certificates
   [RFC6187].

4.2.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram represents the data model for the grouping
   used to configure an SSH server to listen for TCP connections.  The
   tree diagram for the other grouping is not provided, but it is the
   same except without the "address" and "port" fields.

   NOTE: the diagram below shows "listening-ssh-server" as a YANG
   container (not a grouping).  This temporary container was created
   only to enable the `pyang` tool to output the tree diagram, as
   groupings by themselves have no protocol accessible nodes, and hence
   `pyang` would output an empty tree diagram.

4.2.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the temporary listening-
   ssh-server container just mentioned above were populated with some
   data.  This example is consistent with the examples presented earlier
   in this document.

4.3.  The TLS Server Model

   The TLS Server model presented in this section presents two YANG
   groupings, one for a server that opens a socket to accept TCP
   connections on, and another for a server that has had the TCP
   connection opened for it already (e.g., inetd).

   The TLS Server model (like the SSH Server model presented above) is
   provided as a grouping so that it can be used in different contexts.
   For instance, the NETCONF Server model presented in Section 4.4 uses
   one grouping to configure a NETCONF server listening for connections
   and the other grouping to configure NETCONF call home.

   A shared characteristic between both groupings is the ability to
   configure which server certificate is presented to clients, the
   private key for which is held in the keychain model presented in
   Section 4.1.  Another shared characteristic is the ability to
   configure which trusted CA or client certificates the server should
   be used to authenticate clients.

4.3.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram represents the data model for the grouping
   used to configure an TLS server to listen for TCP connections.  The
   tree diagram for the other grouping is not provided, but it is the
   same except without the "address" and "port" fields.

4.4.  The NETCONF Server Model

   The NETCONF Server model presented in this section supports servers
   both listening for connections to accept as well as initiating call-
   home connections.  This model also supports both the SSH and TLS
   transport protocols, using the SSH Server and TLS Server groupings
   presented in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3 respectively.  All private
   keys and trusted certificates are held in the keychain model
   presented in Section 4.1.  YANG feature statements are used to enable
   implementations to advertise which parts of the model the NETCONF
   server supports.

4.4.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram uses line-wrapping in order to comply with
   xml2rfc validation.  This is annoying as I find that drafts (even txt
   drafts) look just fine with long lines - maybe xml2rfc should remove
   this warning? - or pyang could have an option to suppress printing
   leafref paths?

4.4.2.  Example Usage

   Configuring a NETCONF Server to listen for NETCONF client connections
   using both the SSH and TLS transport protocols, as well as
   configuring call-home to two NETCONF clients, one using SSH and the
   other using TLS.

   This example is consistent with other examples presented in this
   document.

4.5.  The RESTCONF Server Model

   The RESTCONF Server model presented in this section supports servers
   both listening for connections to accept as well as initiating call-
   home connections.  This model supports the TLS transport only, as
   RESTCONF only supports HTTPS, using the TLS Server groupings
   presented in Section 4.3.  All private keys and trusted certificates
   are held in the keychain model presented in Section 4.1.  YANG
   feature statements are used to enable implementations to advertise
   which parts of the model the RESTCONF server supports.

4.5.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram uses line-wrapping in order to comply with
   xml2rfc validation.  This is annoying as I find that drafts (even txt
   drafts) look just fine with long lines - maybe xml2rfc should remove
   this warning? - or pyang could have an option to suppress printing
   leafref paths?

4.5.2.  Example Usage

   Configuring a RESTCONF Server to listen for RESTCONF client
   connections, as well as configuring call-home to one RESTCONF client.

   This example is consistent with other examples presented in this
   document.

5.  Design Considerations

   The manner that the both local and remote endpoints have been
   specified in the ietf-netconf-server and ietf-rest-server modules
   does not directly support virtual routing and forwarding (VRF),
   though they have been specified in such a way to enable external
   modules will augment in VRF designations when needed.

   This document uses PKCS #10 [RFC2986] for the "generate-certificate-
   signing-request" action.  The use of Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF) [RFC4211] was considered, but is was unclear if there
   was market demand for it, and so support for CRMF has been left out
   of this specification.  If it is desired to support CRMF in the
   future, placing a "choice" statement in both the input and output
   statements, along with an "if-feature" statement on the CRMF option,
   would enable a backwards compatible solution.

   This document puts a limit of the number of elliptical curves
   supported.  This was done to match industry trends in IETF best
   practice (e.g., matching work being done in TLS 1.3).  In additional
   algorithms are needed, they MAY be augmented in by another module, or
   added directly in a future version of this document.

   Both this document and Key Chain YANG Data Model
   [draft-ietf-rtgwg-yang-key-chain] define keychain YANG modules.  The
   authors looked at this and agree that they two modules server
   different purposes and hence not worth merging into one document.  To

   underscore this further, this document renamed its module from "ietf-
   keychain" to "ietf-system-keychain" and that other document renamed
   its module from "ietf-key-chain" to "ietf-routing-key-chain".

   For the trusted-certificates list, Trust Anchor Format [RFC5914] was
   evaluated and deemed inappropriate due to this document's need to
   also support pinning.  That is, pinning a client-certificate to
   support NETCONF over TLS client authentication.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a keychain mechanism that is entrusted with the
   safe keeping of private keys, and the safe keeping of trusted
   certificates.  Nowhere in this API is there an ability to access
   (read out) a private key once it is known to the keychain.  Further,
   associated public keys and attributes (e.g., algorithm name, key
   length, etc.) are read-only.  That said, this document allows for the
   deletion of private keys and their certificates, as well the deletion
   of trusted certificates.  Access control mechanisms (e.g., NACM
   [RFC6536]) MUST be in place so as to authorize such client actions.
   Further, whilst the data model allows for private keys and trusted
   certificates in general to be deleted, implementations should be well
   aware that some privates keys (e.g., those in a TPM) and some trusted
   certificates, should never be deleted, regardless if the
   authorization mechanisms would generally allow for such actions.

   For the "generate-certificate-signing-request" action, it is
   RECOMMENDED that devices implement assert channel binding [RFC5056],
   so as to ensure that the application layer that sent the request is
   the same as the device authenticated in the secure transport layer
   was established.

   This document defines a data model that includes a list of private
   keys.  These private keys MAY be deleted using standard NETCONF or
   RESTCONF operations (e.g., <edit-config>).  Implementations SHOULD
   automatically (without explicit request) zeroize these keys in the
   most secure manner available, so as to prevent the remnants of their
   persisted storage locations from being analyzed in any meaningful
   way.

   The keychain module define within this document defines the "load-
   private-key" action enabling a device to load a client-supplied
   private key.  This is a private key with no shrouding to protect it.
   The strength of this private key MUST NOT be greater than the
   strength of the underlying secure transport connection over which it
   is communicated.  Devices SHOULD fail this request if ever the
   strength of the private key is greater then the strength of the
   underlying transport.

Internet-Draft    NETCONF/RESTCONF Server Config Models       March 2016


   A denial of service (DoS) attack MAY occur if the NETCONF server
   limits the maximum number of NETCONF sessions it will accept (i.e.
   the 'max-sessions' field in the ietf-netconf-server module is not
   zero) and either the "hello-timeout" or "idle-timeout" fields in
   ietf-netconf-server module have been set to indicate the NETCONF
   server should wait forever (i.e. set to zero).

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC2119].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-server
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

7.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers five YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the the
   following registrations are requested:
