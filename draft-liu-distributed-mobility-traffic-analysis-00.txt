            Distributed Mobility Management Traffic analysis
           draft-liu-distributed-mobility-traffic-analysis-00

Abstract

   There is a trend in mobile network that gateways are deployed more
   and more closer to the network edge.  The motivation of this trend
   comes from several aspects and the result is that the mobile network
   architecture is evolving toward flatten network architecture.  In
   this scenario, mobility solution needed to be studied to fit for the
   flatten network.  This document analysis the benefit of distributing
   mobility anchor to the network edge from the traffic load pespective.

1.  Introduction

   Data traffic in mobile network is increasing rapidly.  The huge
   amount of data traffic gives much impact to the operator's core
   network.  This gives much presure to the gateways in the core
   networks.  On the other hand, the gateways in mobile network are
   integrated more functions, such as content based charging, service
   control etc.  Those functions increase the complexity of the gateway
   and have much impact to the gateway's performance.  Under this
   condition, traditional hierarchical architecture is not optimal for
   the high volume traffic load.  To address this challenge, the mobile
   network is evolving towards more flatten architeture.  "Flatten"
   means less network layer in the architecture.  The main advantage of
   flat network architecture is that it enables the traffic to be
   offloaded to the network edge.  This architecture could improve the
   performance of the gateway by distributing the complexity to the
   network edge.

                       Figure 1: Traffic Load Model

   Figure 1 shows a representative traffic model.  The traffic anchor of
   the MN is deployed in the higher layer of network (e.g. in the
   backbone) and the access gateway is deployed in the metro network.

   The traffic from the MN to the correspondent node (e.g. the peer in
   the figure) consists of two parts.  One part is that the traffic from
   the MN to the PEER which connects to the backbone (e.g.  Peer locates
   in Internet).  The other part is the traffic from the MN to the PEER
   which connects to the metro network (e.g. peer is operator's metro
   service platform) and the traffic from the MN to another MN (e.g.
   P2P application).

3.2.  Centralized anchor model

   This section analysis the traffic load in centralized anchor model.
   This model is abstracted from 3GPP SAE network architeture.

                    Figure 2: Centralized anchor model

   In this scenario, mobility anchor (P-GW) is deployed in the higher
   layer of network. e.g. in the backbone level of the network.  S-GW is
   deployed in the metro network.  All the traffic need to go through
   the mobility anchor(P-GW).

   There are two possibilities regarding to the correspondent node's
   location (e.g. peer in the figure):

   (1)Peer is connected via backbone network.  The peer may be located
   in Internet.  For example, the peer may be an webserver in Internet.
   In this case, all the traffic is tunnelled between S-GW and P-GW.
   P-GW then de-capsulated the taffic from the tunnel then forward the
   traffic to the peer.

   It is assumed that the traffic to the backbone network is 60% and the
   traffic to metro network is 40% in this traffic model as described
   above.

   Based on the above traffic model, the traffic analysis result is:

                     Figure 8: Traffic Analysis result

   According to analysis result above, distributed model can save 28.6%
   traffic within metro network.  It can save 57.1% traffic between
   metro network and backbone network.  It can save 57.1% traffic within
   backbone network.


5.  Congestion analysis

   We assume that the congestion possibility within metro network is X,
   the congestion possibility between metro network and backbone network
   is Y. Based on the analysis model, we have the following result:

                   Figure 9: Congestion Analysis result

   According to the analysis result above, we can conclude that the
   congestion probability in distributed deployment is lower than in
   centralized deployment. if X=3%, Y=3%, distributed model's congestion
   probability will be lower 3.39% compared with centralized model. if
   X=Y=10%, distributed model's congestion probability will be lower
   9.76% compared with centralized model.


6.  Delay analysis

   The delay from UE to the peer is composed by three parts: the delay
   within metro network: T1; the delay between metro network to backbone
   network:T2, the delay within backbone network: T3.

   Based on the above model, we have the following analysis result:



      +--------------------------------------------------------------+
      |             |                 |               |              |
      |  Delay      | Peer in Backbone| peer in Metro |Average       |

      |             | T1+T2+T3        | 2*(T1+T2+T3)  |1.4*(T1+T2+T3)|
      |--------------------------------------------------------------+
      | Distributed |                 |               |T1+0.6*(T2+T3)|
      |             | T1+T2+T3        |          T1   |              |

                     Figure 10: Delay Analysis result

   According to the analysis result above, we conclude that the delay in
   distributed model is less than centralized model.  Specifically, the
   delay within metro network will less 28.6%; the delay between metro
   network and backbone network will less 57.1%; the delay within
   backbone will less 57.1%.
