          Harmonizing how applications specify DANE-like usage
                     draft-ogud-dane-vocabulary-02

Abstract

   There is no standard terminology as how to talk about use of DNS in
   various application contexts, this document goal is to facilitate
   creation of such a vocabulary/taxonomy.

   This document started out as proposal for specific word usage for
   specifications of adding DANE like technology by different protocols/
   services.  DANE is a method for specifying in DNS records acceptable
   keys/certificates for application servers.

   The terms defined in this document should be applicable to all uses
   of service specification that uses DNS records.

1.  Introduction

   DNS [RFC1034] is being used by many protocols to express where
   services are located on the internet, today there is no good way to
   express exactly what people have in mind when specifying a new
   service/protocol exactly and in concise manner how the service is
   looked up in the DNS.

   DANE [RFC6698] is a powerful new way to provide/amend how
   authentication/authorization/confidentiality of a connection to a
   server can be protected by leveraging DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034]
   [RFC4035] for the establishment of TLS connection [RFC5246] [RFC6347]
   which in many cases uses PKIX [RFC5280].  All of these technologies
   are complicated.  People familiar with one or two are not necessarily
   familiar with all the parts that needed to apply DANE like mechanism
   to other protocols.

   The goal of this document is three fold:

   o  To provide common vocabulary for usage of DNS records in service
      specification.

   o  To provide an overview of the non protocol specific parts needed
      to specify an DANE like addition.

   o  To provide a common framework for such specifications making it
      easy to review/compare the specifications.  An important goal is
      to allow the new specifications to avoid repeating explanations
      and/or definitions.

   Number of RFC's in the past have tried to use consistent terminology
   when specifying how to access services both in the context of
   security TLS with X.509 [RFC6125] and without security [RFC2782].
   The terminology in this document is not identical but concepts are
   similar.  The hope is that once the standard terminology is
   specified, as simple documents can provide a mapping if one is
   needed.

   This version of the document aims to hide complexity and focus on
   generalities.  This is done to make it easier for the reader to
   decide if the terms here are of use and if it is worthwhile for the
   DANE WG to adopt this document.  Descriptions of complexities can be
   added in later versions if the WG decides that is needed.

   When notation "foo/bar" is used below that is because the editor is
   not sure if both apply or which one is more appropriate, please
   advise.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Proposed Terms

   The terms below are being proposed to avoid confusion when reading
   protocol specifications related to DNS and DANE, for various
   application protocols.

   At this point all the terms below are proposals and better terms are
   welcome.

2.1.  DNS Navigation Records

   DNS Navigation refers to any records used to traverse the DNS tree to
   find the records requested.  This includes



Gudmundsson              Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Definition of Terms February 2014


   NS records:  that provide a referral to DNS servers for more specific
         part of the name being looked up.  Example: name server for
         "example." will hand out a referral to server for
         "bar.example." when asked about "foo.bar.example."

   CNAME records:  records that change the location of an record, this
         for all practical purposes a pointer that only applies to that
         specific name.

   DNAME records:  specify a rewrite rule for a name to a new name.
         Example: "bar.example."  DNAME "foo.example." means that
         "www.bar.example." is to be looked up as "www.foo.example".
         DNAME applies to names that are longer than the name it, i.e.
         "bar.example." is not rewritten but "www.bar.example." is.

   DANE specification explicitly requires all of these records to be
   validated by DNSSEC.

   See section Section 2.2

   While traversing the DNS tree other records like A and AAAA are used
   but these records do not change the "navigation", these records do
   not explicitly need to be protected as the data retrieved from the
   addresses is expected to be protected.

2.2.  DNS Integrity

   DNSSEC defines a records and procedures to provide integrity and
   authentication to data stored in DNS [RFC4034].  The records used to
   provide the keying information and chain of trust are DNSKEY, DS
   records.  NSEC/NSEC3 provide information about existence/non-
   existence of the requested information.  RRSIG provides a digital
   signature for a RRset.

   DNSSEC provides both Integrity and Authenticity i.e. it says the
   records came from the right source and have not been changed.

   Any DNS record that is DNS Integrity protected, will pass DNSSEC
   validation for all DNS Navigation records leading to the name and the
   record itself also passes DNSSEC validation.

   In the case of CNAME and DNAME that go "sideways" i.e. to a different
   branch of the DNS tree, both branches MUST be validated.

2.3.  Service Specification Records (SSR)

   Protocols have different ways to express servers.




Gudmundsson              Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Definition of Terms February 2014


   o  Web servers are frequently specified by name i.e. the "www"
      prefix, thus its service specification record is: "address record
      stored at www.<domain>".

   o  Email servers have a special RR type (MX): SRR= "MX record at
      <domain>"),

   o  Jabber uses SRV records: SSR="SRV record at _xxmp-
      server.tcp.<domain>",

   o  ENUM uses NAPTR records etc.

   o  In addition there are also protocols that use a combination like
      S-NAPTR a schema where NAPTR records are used to specify where to
      look for SRV records.  For all practical purposes NAPTR + SRV
      should combined be treated as the Service Specification.

   For a DANE like specification it has to be clear as what the service
   specification records are and these records require DNS Integrity.

   NOTE: when a client supplies a string to the server as a indicator of
   what service the the client wants, the string supplied MAY depend on
   redirection in DNS navigation as well as results of NAPTR records,
   etc.  See section Section 2.6.

   NOTE: when NAPTR records as are used they should be treated same way
   as DNS Navigation records even though strictly speaking it is the
   application that evaluates the NAPTR record.

   NOTE: When there is a CNAME at the name service is expected to be
   specified at, that can be either a DNS Navigation record or a Service
   Specification Record.  Protocol specification should provide guidance
   on interpretation.

2.4.  Service Address Records (SAR)

   These are the address records for the servers that offer the service.

   In some cases the Service Specification records reside at the same
   name or are the same as the Service Address records.  Example:
   original TLS/DANE[RFC6698], thus both SSR and SAR records are covered
   by the same DNS integrity rule.

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Definition of Terms February 2014


2.5.  Application Authentication Records (AAR)

   This term refers to the records that provide information about what
   are acceptable keys or certificates for the servers to offer.

   Application Authentication Records MUST be protected by DNS Integrity
   and each protocol specification MUST explicitly state where/how to
   look up the Authentication records.

   In some cases all the servers for a service will have the same
   authentication information, in other cases it is going to be on a
   server by server case.  In the first case it is "natural" to store
   the Authentication records "at" the Service Specification records.
   In the second case it more natural to store them "at" the Address
   Records.  In this context "at" means the authentication records are
   stored at name that is an extension of the location example:
   "_443._tcp.www.example.com" for [RFC6698].  It is possible that
   neither of these locations is the right one and in that case the
   specification MUST explicitly express rules as how to find the
   Authentication Records.

   Note: above that there is no a requirement that the Application
   Address records be covered by DNS Integrity.  This is because when
   the Application Authentication records reside "at" the address
   records, DNS Integrity is inherited.  On the other hand when when
   Application Authentication Records are stored "at" the Service
   Specification Record, DNS Integrity for the address records is
   optional, as any connection to a bogus/wrong server should fail the
   Authentication tests performed at connection time.

   Note: When a Address record search has a CNAME at or DNAME above, the
   name queried, where should the Authentication Records reside ? With
   CNAME or with final address record ?

2.6.  Offered Name: Name used when indirection records are used

   In many protocols one of the first items presented by the application
   is a <name> that is "related to"/"derived from" the original query
   name.  When DNAME is used the name queried for might be required to
   be rewritten into a new name.

   To disambiguate these cases following prefix terms are defined.
   Similar rules apply NAPTR + SRV combinations.  It is important for
   many applications to be able to express what name is presented by the
   application to the server at connection time.

   Query:  The name the application issued the query for to discover SSR
         /service.

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Definition of Terms February 2014


   Final:  The name after all the indirection records have been applied.

   SRV   The name on the SRV record used.

   NAPTR The name on the first NAPTR record used, prefix with Final if
         that is the one wanted.

   Intermediate  A particular location in the indirection chain.  The
         specification needs to handle this case if it ever occurs.
         NOTE: not sure this is needed???ogud???

3.  Example specification

   This section is an short example for a protocol that is like SSH
   [RFC4253] we will call this protocol HISS.  This is not an actual
   full specification, just here to give an idea of how to go about
   extending DANE-like to a random protocol using the terminology from
   this document.

   Location of HISS protocol DNS records:

   Service Specification Records:
         HISS uses address records as the service specification record.
         This record MUST have "DNS Integrity" as explained in RFC-to-
         be-this-document.  CNAME/DNAME are treated as a DNS Navigation
         record.

   Service Address Records:
         see: Service Specification Records.

   Application Authentication Records:
         The protocol uses the DNS HISSFP that is stored at the same
         name as the service is specified.  The HISSFP record, if
         present, takes precedence over keys stored in client cache.

   Offered Name
         Not used.

   The HISS protocol and HISSFP DNS RR do not exist

   This documents goal is to improve specifications of adding security
   via DANE technology to protocols, thus the overwriting goal is to
   decrease confusion and increase clarity, with the end goal of
   improving security.  This document does not specify a protocol.  XX
   Needs more work XX

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   When selecting terms to use in standards documents it is important to
   select works that do not confuse international readers.  This
   document goes out of its way in selecting English terms that are
   dissimilar to avoid confusions.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Number of people have commented that this is interesting work.  Peter
   Saint-Andre tried to apply the terms to one of his documents and
   provided many good suggestions.
