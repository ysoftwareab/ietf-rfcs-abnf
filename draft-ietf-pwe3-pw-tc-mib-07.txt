Abstract 
   
   
  This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module  
  Which contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used 
  Pseudo Wire (PW) management information.  The intent is that these 
  TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in PW related 
  MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

1  Introduction 
   
  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
  (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
  community. In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used for 
  Pseudo Wire (PW) technology and PWE3 MIB modules. 
      
  This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms 
  described in [RFC3985]. Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of 
  [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here. 
   
  Comments should be made directly to the PWE3 mailing list at 
  pwe3@ietf.org. 
      
  For an introduction to the concepts of Pseudo-Wires, see [PWREQ] 
  and [RFC3985]. 
   
Conventions used in this document 
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
  this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
   
 
2  Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW 
  architecture [RFC3985].

3 The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
    
  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current   
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
  of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
   
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
  generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
  (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
  in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo 
  specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is 
  described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] 
  and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

5  Security Considerations

                             PWE3 TC MIB                February 2006 



   
  This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it 
  defines a set of textual conventions that may be used by other PWE3 
  MIB modules to define management objects. 
   
  Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB 
  modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document 
  has no impact on the security of the Internet. 
   
6  IANA considerations 
   
    The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
     
          Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------        ----------------------- 
     
          pwTcStdMIB         { transmission XXXX } 
     
  Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is 
  requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'transmission' 
  subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  
  When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to 
  replace "XXXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value 
  and to remove this note.
