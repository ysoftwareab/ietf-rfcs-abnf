Abstract 

   This document specifies method for verifying the connection of an 
   MPLS Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for 
   management purpose. The proposed extension is based on MPLS 
   Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). The goal is to

1. Introduction 

      In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned on 
   multiple switches. Service Providers (SP) need to verify that the 
   circuits are provisioned correctly in both control and data plane for 
   management purpose. MPLS-TP bidirectional LSPs emulating traditional 
   transport circuits need to provide the same connection verification 
   capability. In this document, an MPLS-TP LSP as defined in [5] is 
   based on the MPLS-TE, pseudowire (PW) or Multisegment PW [8]. 

   An MPLS-OAM Connection Verification (CV) message originates at a 
   Maintenance End Point (MEP) but can be directed to by any Maintenance 
   Intermediate Point (MIP) along the path of MPLS-TP LSP as well as the 
   other MEP. Therefore, the proposed mechanism addresses the 
   verification of the full or partial path of an MPLS-TP LSP. 

   An MPLS-OAM CV message is intercepted at any MIP based on MPLS TTL 
   expiry, and at MEP simply because it is the end of the LSP (i.e., 
   regardless the value of the TTL).

   In response to the MPLS-OAM CV request, each LSR along the path of 
   the MPLS-TP LSP appends its ID using a newly defined TLV called 
   Record Route TLV. 

   A Record Route TLV appended by a given LSR contains: 

     . The LSR address which is represented by the format defined in 
        [6]. 

     . Local Labels allocated by the LSR for both directions of the 
        MPLS-TP LSP. 

   To describe the connection verification functionality, let us assume 
   an MPLS-TP LSP between LSR-1 and LSR-5 passing through LSR-2, LSR-3, 
   and LSR-4. Thus, LSR-1 and LSR-5 are MEPs whereas LSR-2, LSR-3, and 
   LSR-4 are MIPs. The objective is to verify (both in control and data 
   planes) the MPLS-TP LSP from LSR-1 to LSR-5 (end-to-end), and record 
   all the IDs of the LSRs along the path. This could be accomplished 
   using a conventional traceroute operation in which LSR-1 interrogates 
   each LSR-2 through LSR-5 (using appropriate TTL value) in turn using 
   a new message and response, and compiles the result. This approach 
   requires 8 messages; a request and a response between LSR-1 and each 
   of the other LSRs. On the other hand, the mechanism that we describe 
   below can accomplish the goal with only 5 messages. 

   It is possible that the path of an MPLS-TP LSP contains loop(s) due 
   to misconfiguration. Such mistakes are possible with manual 
   configuration. For example, assume that MPLS-TP LSP under discussion 
   is misconfigured such LSR-4 connects to LSR-2 instead of LSR-5. This 
   results in a loop. In this case, the MPLS-OAM CV packets self limit 
   when the MTU is reached, and when it happens, it is good practice to 
   silently drop those packets. 

  If a MIP does not understand the MPLS-OAM CV message, it must 
  silently drop the packet. To trap this condition as well as to trap 
  the looping condition, an ingress MEP that initiates connection 
  verification starts a timer when it sends an MPLS-OAM CV message. If 
  the timer expires before the response arrives, the MEP assumes one of 
  the following conditions: 

     . the MPLS-TP LSP is incomplete. 

     . an LSR (either MIP or MEP) does not understand the MPLS-OAM CV 
        message. 

     . there is a loop. 

 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009                [Page 3] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft     draft-boutros-mpls-tp-cv-01.txt           March 2009 
    

   The ingress MEP then examines the MPLS-TP LSP by using the classic 
   one-hop at a time, direct response traceroute. 

  In case not all hops on the path of the MPLS-TP LSP are MIPs, an 
  ingress MEP can send conventional trace route with incrementing TTL 
  1, 2, 3, ...., to all MIPs and to the egress MEP along the path. Some 
  of those requests will be sent to non MIP/MEP LSRs and will be 
  dropped silently. When the MIPs and egress MEP receive the request, 
  they will respond with an MPLS-OAM CV response message. The TTL value 
  of the response SHOULD be large to ensure the response message 
  reaches the ingress MEP without being intercepted at any MIP.  
  Optionally, the TTL value of the response MAY be set to 1 so that 
  each MIP can verify its ID included in the response message as the 
  response travels towards the ingress MEP. 

   The proposed mechanism is based on a set of new TLVs which can be 
   transported using one of the following methods:  
    

     1. Using in-band MPLS Connection Verification (CV) messages which 
        are forwarded as MPLS packets (Non-IP routing and forwarding 
        based).  

     2. Using in-band LSP-Ping extensions defined in [2] where IP/UDP 
        packets are used (IP-Based routing and forwarding). The LSP-
        Ping messages may be sent in-band using the  codepoint defined 
        in [3].  
         

   Method (1) and (2) are referred to as "in-band option" and "LSP-Ping 
   option" respectively in the rest of the document.

3. MPLS-TP Connection Verification Mechanism 

   For the in-band option, the proposed mechanism uses a new code point 
   in the Generic Associated Channel Header (G-ACH) described in [7]. 
   The LSP-Ping option will be in compliance to specifications [2] and 
   [3]. 

   Moreover, the proposed mechanism requires Record Route TLV (defined 
   in this document). Also, Authentication TLV defined in [4] is also 
   required for this mechanism. 

4. MPLS-OAM Connection Verification Message 

4.1. In-band Message Identification 

   In the in-band option, under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-TP LSP, the   
   ACH with "MPLS-TP Connection Verification (CV)" code point indicates 
   that the message is an MPLS-TP CV message.

         The Version Number is currently 1. 

      Message Type 
         The following two message types are defined: 

         Message Type        Description 
         ------------        ----------- 
            0x0              CV Request 
            0x1              CV Reply 
    

      Operation 
         The following two operations are defined: 
    
         Operation           Description 
         ---------           ------------- 
            0x0              Only verify MPLS-TP LSP  
    
            0x1              Verify MPLS-TP LSP and record route 
    
            0x2              Verify MPLS-TP LSP, record route, and    
                             verify LSR ID in the record route before 
                             forwarding response     
    

         First, all operation codes are meanigful only in the MPLS-TP CV 
         request message, and this field currently ignored in the MPLS-
         TP CV response message. 

         The operation code 0x0 is used to instruct a MIP or the      
         receiver MEP to simply verify the MPLS-TP LSP associated with 
         the MPLS-TP CV request message. In this case, after          
         successfully processing the request message, an LSR should   
         simply forward the message without appending Record Route TLV.  

         The operation code 0x1 is used to instruct a MIP or the      
         receiver MEP to not only verify the MPLS-TP but also append a 
         Record Route TLV to the request message if the message is    
         succesfully processed. Also, if the receiver needs to send a 
         positive reponse back to the sender, it MUST include all the 
         Record Route TLVs appended to the message by itself and all the 
         upstream LSRs. Note that if a negative response is to be sent, 
         Record Route TLVs are not appended to the response. 

 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009                [Page 7]

         The operation code 0x2 is used to instruct a MIP receiving an 
         MPLS-TP CV request message to verify the connection and append 
         Record Route TLV. Additionally, it also instructs the LSR    
         originating the response (MIP or MEP) to set the TTL value in 
         the response such that the response will be intercepted by each 
         upstream LSR. The intention is to let each upstream LSR to   
         verify that the Record Route TLV that it appended to the     
         request message exists in the response as well. Note that such 
         verification is required only when positive response is sent. 
         To facilitate such verification, the originator of the response 
         as well as each LSR intercepting the response MUST set the TTL 
         value to 1 in the response.

         Value   Meaning 
         -----   -------

           2     Malformed CV message received 
           3     Received unknown TLV 
           4     Authentication failed 
           5     MPLS-TP LSP not setup in downstream direction 
           6     MPLS-TP LSP not setup in upstream direction 
           7     MPLS-TP LSP not setup in both directions 
           8     LSR-ID is missing in the record route of positive    
                 response 
    
         In the case of cause code 3, the unknown TLVs can be optionally 
         sent in the response message. Use cases of the above cause   
         codes are explained in the operation section below. 
    
         When MPLS-TP CV response travels back to the sender, a MIP   
         intercepting the message could check if the Record Route TLV 
         that it appended to the request exists in the response. As   

 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009                [Page 8] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft     draft-boutros-mpls-tp-cv-01.txt           March 2009 
    

         such, the cause code 8 is meaningful only in the response    
         message.  
    
      Sender's Handle 
         The Sender's Handle is filled in by the sender, and remains in 
         tact as the CV request message travels. Also, this handle MUST 
         be returned unchanged in all CV response messages. There are no 
         semantics associated with this handle, although a sender may 
         find this useful for matching up request with replies. 

      Message Length 
         The total length of any included TLVs. 

      Message ID 
         The Message ID is set by the sender of the MPLS-TP CV request 
         message. It MUST be copied unchanged by any MEP or other MIP 
         both in the CV request and response message. A sender SHOULD 
         increment this value on each new message. A retransmitted    
         message SHOULD leave the value unchanged. 

   

      An MPLS-TP CV request message MUST contain a LSPI TLV to identify 
      the MPLS-TP LSP being verified, Source Address TLV identifying the 
      sender of the message, and Destination Address TLV identifying the 
      target receipient of the message. Note that in the successful   
      case, the MPLS-TP CV response message MUST be originated from the 
      target recipient of the request, and the target receipient can be 
      MIP or a MEP. However, in the case of negative response, the LSR 
      that fails to process the message generates the response message. 
      When sending a response, the Source Address TLV identifies the LSR 
      originating the response and the Destination Address TLV        
      identifies the intended receipient of the message (which is the 
      source of the request message). Format of these TLVs are specified 
      in [6]. Furthermore, an Authentication TLV defined in [4] can be 
      optionally included in the request message as well.

              Figure 3: MPLS-TP CV Record Route TLV format 

   
   The Record Route TLV includes the LSR address sub-TLV defined in [6] 
   as well as the upstream and downstream labels (allocated by the LSR 
   for both directions of the LSP). The upstream label is the label 
   allocated by the LSR for the direction of the connection verification 
   request message. The label value of 0 means that a label is not 
   allocated for the respective direction. 

   Note that recording route is meaningful only if the connection 
   verification operation is successful. As such, a receiver MUST 
   examine any Record Route TLV only if the return code is 0 (success) 
   in the connection verification response message. 

4.5. Network Management System 

   An operator should be able to provision any given LSR to send MPLS-
   OAM CV Request packets from a MEP and notify NMS when MPLS-OAM CV 
   Response arrives. 

   [More description is to added] 

5. Operation 

   Consider an MPLS-TP LSP LSR-1 <--> LSR-2 <--> LSR-3 <--> LSR-4 <--> 
   LSR-5. LSR-1 and LSR-5 are ingress and egress LSR for the respective 
   direction. LSR-1 and LSR-5 are MEPs, and LSR-2 through LSR-4 are 
   MIPs. 

   The proposed mechanism operates as follows:

  1. LSR-1 sends an MPLS-TP CV Request message where the Source Address 
     TLV, Destination Address TLV, and LSPI TLV represent LSR-1, LSR-5, 
     and the LSP being verified respectively. An Authentication TLV may 
     also be included. 

  2. The MPLS-TP CV Request message is intercepted at LSR-2 (MIP) 
     because of TTL expiry. LSR-2 then verifies the request and:  

       1. if the MPLS-TP LSP cannot be located, it sends a response with 
          return code 1 and cause code 1. 

       2. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with return 
          code 1 and cause code 2. 

       3. if any of the TLV is not known, it sends a response with 
          return code 1 and cause code 3. It may also include the 
          unknown TLVs. 

       4. if message authentication fails, it sends a response with 
          return code 4 and cause code 4. This step is valid only if an 
          Authentication TLV is present in the request. 

       5. if the MPLS-TP LSP is not setup in downstream direction, it 
          sends a response with return code 1 and cause code 5. 

       6. if the MPLS-TP LSP is not setup in upstream direction, it 
          sends a response with return code 1 and cause code 6. 

       7. if the MPLS-TP LSP is not setup in both directions, it sends a 
          response with return code 1 and cause code 7. 

         Note that MPLS TTL value is set to 255 in the response message. 
         In the response message, Source LSR address TLV is filled with 
         the address of LSR-2. 

         When LSR-1 receives the MPLS-TP CV Response, the Destination 
         Address TLV indicates that it is the intended recipient of the 
         message. Furthermore, it learns that connection verification 
         for the MPLS-TP LSP in question failed at LSR-2 by examining 
         the LSPI and Source Address TLVs respectively in the message.  

  3. If LSR-2 is able to successfully process the MPLS-TP CV Request 
     message, and if the MPLS-TP LSP is setup in both upstream and 
     downstream directions, and if the destination address in CV request 
     does not match LSR-2 address, it forwards the message to LSR-3 with 
     TTL equals 1. LSR-2 appends its address as well as the upstream and 

 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009               [Page 11] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft     draft-boutros-mpls-tp-cv-01.txt           March 2009 
    

     downstream labels to the message if the operation code is 1 or 2. 
     Otherwise, LSR-2 simply forwards the message to LSR-3.  

  4. LSR-3 repeats the steps (2) or (3). In the absence of error, the 
     messages progresses towards LSR-5 with each LSR adding its own ID 
     and the local labels (for operation code 1 or 2). 

  5. Upon getting the MPLS-TP CV message, LSR-5 verifies the request. If 
     an MPLS-TP LSP represented by LSPI TLV in the message is found, and 
     if that MPLS-TP LSP is fully setup, LSR-5 checks the destination 
     address in the CV request and if the destination address matches 
     it's address it sends an MPLS-TP CV response with return code 0 
     (success) back to the LSR-1. If the operation code in the request 
     message is 1 or 2, LSR-5 appends all the Record Route TLVs received 
     from upstream LSRs. Otherwise, the response does not include the 
     Record Route TLVs received from the upstream LSRs. The TTL value in 
     the response can set as follows: 

       1. If the operation code in the request is 1, the TTL value is 
          set to 255 so that the response message reaches LSR-1 without 
          further interception at any other LSR. 

       2. If the operation code in the MPLS-TP CV request message is 2, 
          LSR-5 sends the response down the return path with TTL value 
          equals 1 so that an LSR intercepting the message can verify 
          its address and labels included in the response. 

  6. In case LSR-4 receives the response message, it checks if its 
     address and labels are included in the record route. If the check 
     fails, it sends an MPLS-TP CV response with return code 1 (error) 
     with cause code 8 back to LSR-1, and in this case the address of 
     LSR-4 is included in the Source Address TLV of the response. If the 
     check succeeds, LSR-4 simply forwards the message to LSR-3. 

  7. When LSR-1 receives a response with a record route, it learns the 
     address and the distance (in terms of hop count) of each LSR on the 
     path of the MPLS-TP LSP. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further 
   study. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   To be added.
