Abstract

   This document focusses on the integration of FEC coding in the QUIC
   transport protocol, in order to recover from packet losses.  This
   document does not specify any FEC code but defines mechanisms to
   negotiate and integrate FEC Schemes in QUIC.  By using proactive loss
   recovery, it is expected to improve QUIC performance in sessions
   impacted by packet losses.  More precisely it is expected to improve
   QUIC performance with real-time sessions (since FEC coding makes
   packet loss recovery insensitive to the round trip time), with
   multicast sessions (since the same repair packet can recover several
   different losses at several receivers), and with multipath sessions
   (since repair packets add diversity).

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport that aims at improving network performance by
   enabling out of order delivery, partial reliability, and methods of
   recovery besides retransmission, while also improving security.  This
   document specifies a framework to enable FEC codes to be used to

   recover from lost packets within a single QUIC stream or across
   several QUIC streams.

   The ability to add FEC coding in QUIC may be beneficial in several
   situations:

   o  for a robust transmission of latency sensitive traffic, for
      instance real-time flows, since it enables to recover packet
      losses independently of the round trip time;

   o  for the transmission of contents to a large set of QUIC reception
      endpoints, since the same repair frame may help recovering several
      different packet losses at different receivers;

   o  for multipath communications, since repair traffic adds diversity.

   This framework does not mandate the use of any specific FEC code
   (i.e., how to encode and decode) nor FEC Scheme (i.e., that specifies
   both a FEC code and how to use it, in particular in terms of
   signaling).  Instead it allows to negotiate the FEC Scheme to use at
   session startup, assuming that more than one solution could
   potentially be offered concurrently.  Without loss of generality, we
   assume that the encoding operations compute a linear combination of
   QUIC packets, regardless of whether these codes are of block type (as
   with Reed-Solomon codes [RFC5510]) or sliding window type (as with
   RLC codes [RLC]).

   E: size of an encoding symbol (i.e., source or repair symbol),
      assumed fixed (in bytes)

3.  General Design Considerations

   This section lists a few general considerations that govern the
   framework for FEC coding support in QUIC.

3.1.  FEC Code versus FEC Scheme, Block Codes versus Sliding Window
      Codes

   A FEC code specifies the details of encoding and decoding operations.
   In addition to that, a FEC Scheme defines the additional protocol
   aspects required to use a particular FEC code [nc-taxonomy].  In
   particular the FEC Scheme defines signaling (e.g., information
   contained in Source and Repair Packet header or trailers) needed to
   synchronize encoders and decoders.

   Block coding (e.g., Reed-Solomon [RFC5510]) and sliding window coding
   (e.g., RLC [RLC]) are two broad classes of FEC codes [nc-taxonomy].
   In the first case, the input flow must be first segmented into a
   sequence of blocks, FEC encoding and decoding being performed
   independently on a per-block basis.  In the second case rely, a
   sliding encoding window continuously slides over the input flow.  It
   is envisioned that the two classes of codes could be used to bring
   FEC protection to QUIC, usually with an advantage for sliding window
   codes when it comes to low latency communications.

3.2.  FEC Scheme Negotiation

   There are multiple FEC Scheme candidates.  Therefore a negotiation
   step is needed to select one or more codes to be used over a QUIC
   session.  This will be implemented using the one step negotiation of
   the new QUIC negotiation mechanism [QUIC-transport], during the QUIC
   handshake.

   Editor's notes:

       *  It is likely that FEC Scheme negotiation requires the use of a
          new dedicated Extension Frame Type.  To Be Clarified and text
          updated.

       *  It is not clear whether negotiation is meant to select a
          **single** FEC Scheme or **multiple** FEC Schemes.  In the
          second case (multiple FEC) it is required to have a
          complementary mechanism to indicate which FEC Scheme is used
          in a given REPAIR frame (which could be done through as many

          REPAIR frame type values as potential FEC Scheme negotiated).
          Is it what we want to achieve?  Not sure.

       *  It is not clear whether negotiation is carried out at QUIC
          level (and therefore for multiple streams) or at a stream
          level (and therefore multiple streams may use multiple FEC
          Schemes).  The terminology used above should be updated to
          reflect the choice.

3.3.  FEC Protection Within an Encrypted Channel

   FEC encoding is applied before any QUIC encryption and authentication
   processing.  Source symbols, that constitute the data units used by
   the FEC codec, contain cleartext application data.

3.4.  About Middleboxes

   The coding approach described in this document does not allow on path
   elements (middleboxes) to take part in FEC protection.  The traffic
   being encrypted end-to-end, the middleboxes are not in position to
   perform FEC decoding, nor to add any redundant traffic.

3.5.  FEC Protection at the Stream Level

   Streams in QUIC provide a lightweight, ordered byte-stream
   abstraction.  FEC encoding is applied at the stream level, within a
   single stream or across two or more streams of the same QUIC session.
   This is motivated by the fact that FEC protection is not necessarily
   beneficial to all data streams, but only to a subset of them.  For
   instance FEC protection can be highly beneficial to live video
   streams to which the proactive erasure correction feature of FEC,
   independent of the RTT, should be highly beneficial.  On the
   opposite, FEC protection is probably less attractive for latency
   insensitive bulk unicast flows.

   In order to facilitate experiments, and in order to enable backward
   compatibility, the STREAM frames that carry application data are kept
   unmodified.  On the opposite, frames that carry one or more repair
   symbols use a dedicated REPAIR frame type, chosen within the type
   range dedicated to "Extension Frames".

3.6.  About Gaps in the Set of Source Symbols Considered During Encoding

   A given FEC Scheme MAY support or not the presence of gaps in the set
   of source symbols that constitute a block (for Block codes) or an
   encoding window (for Sliding Window codes).  A potential cause for
   non contiguous sets of source symbols is the acknowledgment of one of
   them.  When this happens, the QUIC sending endpoint may want to

Internet-Draft               Coding for QUIC                   June 2018


   remove this source symbol from further FEC encodings.  This is
   particularly true with Sliding Window codes because of their
   flexibility during FEC encoding (i.e., the encoding window can change
   between two consecutive FEC encodings).

   Supporting gaps can be motivated by the desire to reduce encoding and
   decoding complexity since there are fewer variables.  However this
   choice has major consequences in terms of signaling.  Indeed each
   repair symbol transmitted MUST be accompanied with enough information
   for the QUIC decoding endpoint to unambiguously identify the exact
   composition of the block or encoding window.  Without any gap, the
   identity of the first source symbol plus the number of symbols in the
   block or encoding window is sufficient.  With gaps, a more complex
   encoding needs to be used, perhaps similar to the encoding used for
   selective acknowledgments.

   Whether or not gaps are supported MUST be clarified in each FEC
   Scheme.

4.  FEC Scheme Negotiation in QUIC

   FEC Scheme negotiation has two goals:

   o  Selecting a FEC Scheme (or FEC Schemes) that can be used by the
      QUIC transmission and reception endpoints.  This process requires
      an exchange between them;

   o  Communicating a certain number of parameters, the "Configuration
      Information", that are not expected to change over the session
      lifetime.  For instance, this is the case of the symbol size
      parameter, E (in bytes), that needs either to be agreed between
      the endpoints, or chosen by the sender and communicated to the
      receiver(s);

   Editor's notes:

       *  It is likely that FEC Scheme negotiation requires the use of a
          new dedicated Extension Frame Type.  The details remain TBD.

       *  The Negotiation Frame Type format remains TBD.

       *  How to communicate the parameters remains TBD.

       *  The present document only provides high level principles, the
          details are of course the responsibility of the FEC Scheme.

       *  In case negotiation is different when protecting a single
          versus several streams, this section may be moved to the
          respective sections.

       *  How does it work in case of a multicast session?

       *  Do we negotiate here a FEC Scheme on a per-Stream basis (or
          group of Streams to be protected jointly)?  Or do we negotiate
          a FEC Scheme on a QUIC session basis, therefore to be used for
          all the Streams that need FEC protection?

4.1.  FEC Scheme Selection Process

   Let us consider the FEC Scheme selection process between the QUIC
   endpoints.  Figure 1 illustrates the principle when a QUIC reception
   endpoint initiates the exchange.

   QUIC sender                                       QUIC receiver
         < - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                  supported_fec_scheme_32b{FS1_Encoding_ID | other}
                  supported_fec_scheme_64b{FS1_Encoding_ID | other}

   choose FEC Scheme "FS1"
         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - >
     supported_fec_scheme_32b{FS1_Encoding_ID | other}

    Figure 1: Example FEC Scheme selection process, during the initial
                               negotiation.

   The supported_fec_scheme_16b and supported_fec_scheme_32b are two new
   TransportParameterId to be added to the "Table 7: Initial QUIC
   Transport Parameters Entries" Section 13.1, of [QUIC-transport].  The
   supported_fec_scheme_32b contains a 32-bit data field to carry opaque
   32-bit value, while the supported_fec_scheme_64b contains a 64-bit
   data field to carry opaque 64-bit value (see Section 4.2).

4.2.  FEC Scheme Configuration Information

   Let us now focus on the communication of configuration information
   specific to the selected FEC Scheme.  In Figure 1, the
   supported_fec_scheme_32b{FS1_Encoding_ID} contains a field meant to
   carry the FEC Encoding ID of the FEC Scheme selected plus addditional
   configuration information if any.  If a 32 bit opaque field is not
   sufficient, the supported_fec_scheme_64b can be used instead and
   proposes a 64 bit opaque field.

5.  Procedures when Protecting a Single QUIC Stream

   This section focusses on the simple case where FEC protection is
   applied to a single QUIC stream.  We consider a unidirectional data
   flow between a QUIC sending endpoint and one (or more) QUIC reception
   endpoints.

5.1.  Application data, STREAM Frame data and Source Symbols

   Application data is kept in a transmission buffer at a QUIC sending
   endpoint, and sent within STREAM frames.  Each STREAM frame that
   carries data contains an Offset field that indicates the offset
   within the stream of the first byte of the Stream Data field, as well
   as a Length field that indicates the number of bytes contained in the
   Stream Data field.  Upon receiving a STREAM frame, using the Offset
   and Length fields, a QUIC reception endpoint can easily store data in
   its reception buffer.  But since a QUIC Packet may be lost during
   transmission, the reception buffer may have gaps.

   Figure 2 illustrates how source symbols are mapped to the QUIC
   transmission or reception buffers (same principle on either side).
   Since any source (and repair) symbol is of fixed size (E bytes) for a
   given stream, since QUIC guaranties that the first byte in the stream
   has an offset of 0, the position of each source symbol is known by
   both ends.

    < -E- > < -E- > < -E- > < -E- >
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+
   |< -- Frame 1 -- >< ----- Frame |  source symbols 0, 1, 2, 3
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+
   | 2 ----- >< --- Frame 3 -- >< -|  source symbols 4, 5, 6, 7
   +-------+-------+----+--+-------+
   | Frame 4 - >< -F5- >|             source symbols 8, 9 and 10
   +-------+-------+----+             (incomplete)

      Figure 2: Example of source symbol mapping, when the E value is
                             relatively small.

   Any value for E is possible, from a single byte to several hundreds
   or thousands of bytes.  In general, the source symbols are not
   aligned with data chunks sent in the STREAM frames.  A given STREAM
   frame may carry all the bytes of a given source symbol.  But when a
   source symbol straddles two or more (e.g., if E is large compared to
   usual frame size) STREAM frames, a proper reception of these two (or
   more) STREAM frames is needed for a QUIC reception endpoint to
   consider that the source symbol is available for FEC decoding
   operations.  The choice of an appropriate value for E may depend on
   the use case (in particular on the nature of application data).  A



Swett, et al.           Expires December 23, 2018               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               Coding for QUIC                   June 2018


   reasonably small value reduces the probability that a source symbol
   straddles two or more STREAM frames, a situation that is considered
   as potentially harmful (the unit of control, the source symbol, and
   unit of transmission, the frame, are not aligned).  However an overly
   small value also increases processing complexity (FEC encoding and
   decoding are performed over a larger linear system) so there is an
   incentive to use a larger value.  An appropriate balance should be
   found, and this choice is considered as out of scope for this
   document.

5.2.  Signaling Considerations within STREAM and REPAIR Frames

   Once the initial negotiation succeeded and an appropriate FEC Scheme
   has been chosen between the QUIC endpoints, data is exchanged as
   follows.  Source data is transmitted within STREAM frames, as would
   happen without any FEC based loss recovery mechanism (in particular
   without considering source symbols boundaries).  Repair data,
   computed during FEC encoding, on the opposite, is sent within a
   dedicated REPAIR frame type, chosen within the type range dedicated
   to "Extension Frames".  In both cases, the same Stream ID is used
   since both flows relate to the same stream.

   The REPAIR frame format is FEC Scheme dependent.  The document
   specifying a FEC Scheme to be used with QUIC MUST define the REPAIR
   frame format, among other things.  The REPAIR frame MUST carry enough
   information for a QUIC reception endpoint to understand exactly how
   this repair symbol(s) has(ve) been generated.  It implies that each
   REPAIR symbol MUST communicate the block (with block codes) or
   encoding window (with Sliding Window codes) composition.  This MAY be
   achieved by communicating in case there is no gap in the source
   symbol set (see XXX):

   o  the offset of the first source symbol of the block or encoding
      window;

   o  the number of source symbols in the block or encoding window,
      which can be either a number of symbols or a number of bytes since
      symbols are of fixed size, E.

   Note that unlike FEC Schemes for FLUTE/ALC, NORM, and FECFRAME, here
   there is no notion of Encoding Symbol Id (ESI), an identifier managed
   in a sequential manner to identify source and repair symbols.  The
   use of an offset within the stream, with the guaranty that no
   wrapping to zero can occur, provides an alternative mechanism to
   identify any source symbol.

   As explained above, source data is transmitted without any
   modification, which provides backward compatibility.  This is

Internet-Draft               Coding for QUIC                   June 2018


   advantage in situations where the same QUIC stream is delivered to
   several QUIC reception endpoints (multicast): it may be appropriate
   to select a given FEC Scheme even if it is known that a subset of the
   QUIC reception endpoints do not support it.

   Editor's notes:

       *  This I-D proposes to define a single generic REPAIR frame
          type, but an alternative could be to have a one-to-one mapping
          between a REPAIR frame type and a specific FEC Scheme.

       *  The use of frame type within the Extension Frames range for
          REPAIR frames is meant to facilitate experimentations.  If the
          use of coding in QUIC is recognized as having benefits, a
          dedicated (or more, see above) frame type could be selected
          later on.

5.3.  Management of Silent Periods and End of Stream

   If an application does not submit fresh data for some time, the last
   source symbol may not be totally filled.  It follows that this last
   source symbol cannot be considered during FEC encoding and therefore
   the associated bytes of the application stream are not protected.  A
   similar problem arrives when a stream is finished, the application
   having no more data to submit to QUIC.  Here also, the bytes of the
   last incomplete source symbol are not protected by FEC encoding.

   In order to solve this problem, it is RECOMMENDED that a QUIC sending
   endpoint:

   o  Identifies when such a situation is likely to occur, for instance
      by waiting no more than a certain time during an application
      silent period;

   o  Upon time-out, the application falls back to the alternative re-
      transmission based loss recovery mechanism for the bytes of the
      last incomplete source symbol;

   Editor's notes:  Clearly, the above mechanism requires more thoughts
       as well as experimental work.  The "end of stream" situation may
       be addressed through zero padding perhaps easily.  However the
       use of zero padding for transitory silent periods may add a lot
       of specification and implementation complexity...

6.  Procedures when Protecting Several QUIC Streams

   This section focusses on the general case where FEC protection is
   globally applied across two or more QUIC streams.

   Editor's notes:  It is not clear whether this use-case is needed.  It
       adds specification and implementation complexity that need to be
       balanced with the expected benefits.

       *  Receiver: A first complexity comes from the requirement to
          identify to which stream a decoded source symbol belongs to.
          This is also one of the main difficulty for FECFRAME (both
          with block and sliding window codes) which required to
          distinguish an ADU (submitted by the application) from an ADUI
          (the same ADU plus an additional FlowID among other things).
          Do we want this level of complexity?

       *  Sender: Another complexity comes from the encoding window
          management at a sender.  With multiple streams, shifting the
          encoding window to the right needs to be done based on
          timestamps associated to source symbols of the various
          streams: the oldest source symbol across all the streams will
          be removed.

       *  When two largely different streams are protected togethers
          (e.g., a high definition 4K video flow plus the associated
          relatively low-rate audio stream), is this extra complexity
          balanced by significant performance improvements compared to
          an independent protection on each stream (intuition is yes,
          the low bitrate flow is better protected iff the encoding
          window is large enough)?  And when the various streams have a
          comparable bitrate?  More work (incl. experimental work) is
          needed to answer this question.

6.1.  Application data, STREAM Frame data and Source Symbols

   Within each stream, the source symbols MUST be defined as in the
   simple case of a single stream.  Figure 2 remains valid.

6.2.  Block or Encoding Window Management

   The details of how to create the block or encoding window are
   specific to the FEC Scheme.  A possible approach is the following.

   When creating the block (block FEC code) or encoding window (sliding
   window FEC code), the source symbols to consider of each stream are
   appended.  All the relevant source symbols of the first stream are
   appended, followed by all the source symbols of the second stream,

   etc.  These sequences do not follow any timing consideration in order
   to simplify signaling.

   Figure 3 illustrates, in case of a Sliding Window FEC Scheme, an
   encoding window with source symbols belonging to two streams, of
   Stream ID 120 and 51 respectively.

   < ----------- Stream ID 120 ---------- > < --- Stream ID 51 --- >
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    ^       < -E- >                         ^
    |                                       |
   offset = 0x42f0, length = 5*E       offset = 0x0f24, length = 3*E

                  and FEC protection across two streams.

6.3.  Signaling Considerations within STREAM and REPAIR Frames

   Source data on each stream is transmitted within STREAM frames, as
   would happen without any FEC based loss recovery mechanism.

   Repair symbols, generated during FEC encoding as a linear combination
   of source symbols that belong to one or more of the streams, are
   transmitted within REPAIR frames.  Each REPAIR frame can be
   associated to any of the input streams it protects, and therefore
   associated to any of the associated Stream IDs.

   Editor's notes:  Check that indeed, with FEC protection across
       several streams, assigning a REPAIR frame to any of the streams
       it protects is meaningful.  Should an approach for selecting one
       stream (and Stream ID) be preferred?

   The REPAIR frame format is FEC Scheme dependent and MUST be defined
   by document specifying a FEC Scheme.  One of the key information of
   this REPAIR frame is the composition of the block (with block codes)
   or encoding window (with sliding window codes) used to perform FEC
   encoding.  Indeed, this is the only manner to convey this information
   since an application flow is not predictable (e.g., if an application
   flow is momentarily suspended, the composition of the block or
   encoding window will be affected).  One possibility is to list, in
   each REPAIR frame header:

   o  the actual number of streams considered (the maximum number is
      known after the negotiation step, but if one of the streams
      remains silent for some time, it may not contribute during

      encoding and therefore be absent from the block or encoding
      window);

   o  for each stream concerned, its Stream ID, the offset of the first
      source symbol considered as well as the length, i.e., the number
      of bytes considered.

   This approach does not enable to keep track of the source symbol
   ordering across streams, but enables a non ambiguous description of
   the encoding window.

   The FEC Scheme specification MUST also detail how to manage the block
   or encoding window.  For instance, should the oldest source symbol of
   any stream be removed from the encoding window when this latter is
   shifted to the right?  This would mean that a timestamp is attached
   to each source symbol in order to identify the oldest one across all
   streams.
