Abstract

   This document describes the procedures for using more than one video
   channel in SIP based systems enabling the other endpoints to
   understand the content of each channel.  The document describe how to
   label individual channels with a "role".  The "role" indicates the
   requirements for processing the channel and the role of the channel
   content in the SIP call.  The procedure address multipoint and point
   to point scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   The document describes the procedures for using more than one video
   channel during the conference.  The first video channel is used to
   transmit video from the main camera.  The second video channel may
   have a role described using the content attribute described in
   draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-00[I-D.hautakorpi-mmusic-sdp-
   media-content].  Floor control may be used based on BFCP[I-D.ietf-
   xcon-bfcp]

   The procedures described in the document can be used for multipoint
   or point to point scenarios and are interoperable with the procedures
   described in ITU H.239[ITU.H239] recommendation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3.  Dual Stream framework

   H.239[ITU.H239] is the ITU standard for implementing "People +
   Content" functionality in H.323 and H.320 systems.  H.239 specifies
   mechanisms for adding additional media channels to conferences, and
   how to control presentation video during a multipoint conference
   involving H.320/H.323 based signaling systems.  H.239 includes the
   concept of roles, a notion that spells out the purpose of the
   additional video stream and how the streams should be presented to
   and processed by endpoints and MCUs.  Under H.239, video streams are
   given a role of 'Live', meaning that the video stream is processed as
   a normal, bidirectional stream, or 'Presentation', meaning that the
   stream is defined as a presentation to be distributed to all
   endpoints.  H.239 also makes it possible for users to hand-off the
   role of presenter between endpoints during the meeting using a floor
   control mechanism.

3.1.  Live role procedures

   The "Live" role indicates that the second video channel shall be
   distributed, managed, and presented using the traditional means.  The
   "Live" role is signalled using the alt content attribute from
   draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-00[I-D.hautakorpi-mmusic-sdp-
   media-content].  The "Live" role is appropriate for live video of
   meeting participants.  The "Live" video channel supplements the main
   video channel - it should carry a stream which is less important to
   display at end-user systems than the Presentation channel, main
   channel or channels without role labels.

   "Live" video is two-way transmission; multiple devices may transmit
   "Live" video simultaneously.

   MCUs that support roles and process "Live" video streams distribute
   all live video in accordance with manufacturer-defined conference
   policies.  MCUs should distribute a device's "Live" video stream to
   all participants who are also receiving the other video stream from
   the device.

3.2.  Presentation role procedures

   The "Presentation" role is used to indicate that the video channel
   contains a presentation which is intended to be seen by all
   conference participants.  Transmission on the Presentation channel
   shall be managed by a floor control mechanism using BFCP[I-D.ietf-
   xcon-bfcp], in order to provide the one-way transmission.  Generally,
   the Presentation channel when it is in use should carry the stream
   which is most important to display at end-user systems.  The
   "presentation" channel is described using the slides content

   attribute from draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-00[I-D.hautakorpi-
   mmusic-sdp-media-content]

   For the "Presentation" role, MCUs shall distribute the presentation
   video to all devices in the conference which support the
   "Presentation" role and its associated video mode.  It is optional to
   send the presentation video to the sender.  The MCU shall also manage
   the presentation token in a multipoint call (grants the token).  The
   MCU shall be the floor control server for the "Presentation" channel
   token.

4.  Offer answer flow

4.1.  Live role using the content alt attribute

   The following is an example of an offer of two video streams.  The
   first is the main camera from the room and the second in a view of
   all the room using a second camera.

      v=0

      o=Alice 292742730 29277831 IN IP4 131.163.72.4

      s=Two video streams from the room

      c=IN IP4 131.164.74.2

      t=0 0

      m=video 52886 RTP/AVP 31

      a=rtpmap:31 H261/9000

      a=content:main

      label:10

      m=video 53334 RTP/AVP 31

      a=rtpmap:31 H261/9000

      a=content:alt

      a=label:11

4.2.  Presentation role with floor control

   In this scenario there are two video streams.  The first is the main
   conference video, the second is a presentation.  The right to send
   the presentation is controlled by a floor token.  One of the users or
   the MCU may initiate the floor control channel.  In the case of
   multipoint the MCU shall be the floor control server.

   The following is an example of an offer sent by a client to a MCU
   based on ietf-mmusic-sdp-bfcp[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bfcp].  The
   'crypto' attribute is used to generate a shared secret between the
   client and the floor control server.

   The following is the answer returned by the MCU.  The MCU assign a
   floor only to the presentation channel.

      m=application 20000 TCP/BFCP *

      a=setup:passive

      a=connection:new

      m=video 35100 RTP/AVP 31

      a=content:slides

      a=label:12

   The endpoint will initiate the floor control connection to the MCU.
   When the endpoint wants to start sending presentation it will send a
   floor request as described in
   draft-ietf-xcon-bfcp[I-D.ietf-xcon-bfcp].  When the endpoint receives
   a floor request status granted, the endpoint can start sending the
   presentation.  The endpoint shall release the floor when done.
