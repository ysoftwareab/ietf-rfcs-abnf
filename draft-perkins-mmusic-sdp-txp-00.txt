   'txp'.  This is used to indicate that a text device has limited
   presentation capabilities.

Internet-Draft           The SDP 'txp' Attribute               July 2006


1.  Introduction

   *** This draft is a strawman proposal for discussion purposes ***

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a protocol that is intended
   for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session
   announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia
   session initiation.  One of the most typical use cases of SDP is the
   one where it is used with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

   When interworking with legacy devices through a gateway, an IP based
   text phone using SIP/SDP may be required to limit its capabilities to
   match those devices.  For example, V.21 textphones are full duplex in
   transport, but have varying handling of the presentation.  Some
   merges the two sources in one window.  Some have a kind of irc-like
   display with labels in front of the parties text.  And yet some do a
   split in two windows of real-time text from each direction.

   In order for an IP-based text phone to display an appropriate user
   interface when interacting with one of these legacy devices, it is
   necessary to convey a parameter indicating the limited capability of
   the legacy device.  This memo defines such a parameter.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  The SDP 'txp' Attribute

   This specification defines a new media-level value attribute, 'txp'.
   Its formatting in SDP is described by the following BNF:

       txp-attribute = "a=txp"

   The 'txp' attribute indicates that the media stream is originated
   from a textphone with some presentation limitation.  This limited
   device capability makes it probable that the user should apply formal
   turntaking habits that are common among text telephone users in the
   PSTN.  The indication should be used for an indication in the user
   interface.

   A typical use case is a connection where one endpoint is an analog
   textphone of a kind that merges text from both ends in the same
   window, and the other one is a native IP based real time text capable

   terminal.  The human user of the IP terminal need to change behaviour
   when this indication is received, and apply formal turn-taking
   habits.  They may also need to figure out to what extent it is
   possible to interrupt the other party if the need arises, because
   that possibility varies between textphone types.


4.  The 'txp' Attribute in the Offer/Answer Model

   When it is interacting with a legacy device, an IP text phone may
   receive an offer that contains the 'txp' attribute.  That attribute
   then acts as a cue to configure the user interface appropriately,
   although there is nothing in the generated answer to indicate that
   this has been done (*** should there be? ***).  Similiarly, if an
   answer is received that contains a 'txp' attribute, that indicates
   that the remote device has limited capabilities, and the user-
   interface should present some indication of this to the user.

   This specification does not define a means to discover whether or not
   the peer endpoint understands the 'txp' attribute.  Indeed, the 'txp'
   attribute is informative only at the offer/answer model level.  The
   fact that the peer endpoint does not understand the 'txp' attribute
   does not keep the media session from being established.  The only
   consequence is that user interaction may be initially disrupted,
   since the user interface will not be configured to match the
   capabilities of legacy devices, and users will have to intuit that
   turn taking is needed.

   Since the 'txp' attribute does not have to be understood, an SDP
   answer MAY contain 'txp' attributes even if none were present in the
   offer.  Similarly, the answer MAY contain no 'txp' attributes even if
   they were present in the offer.

   Use of the 'txp' attribute where SDP is used in the declarative
   style, for example with the Session Announcement Protocol, is for
   further study.


5.  Example

   The following example shows the use of the 'txp' attribute with SDP.

          a=rtpmap:100 t140/8000
          a=txp


6.  Relation to the SDP Content Attribute

   There is a proposal to use the SDP Content Attribute to signal that a
   text device has limited capabilities, using "a=content:txp".  This is
   not an appropriate use of the content attribute, since the content
   attribute is intended to describe only the content of a media stream,
   not to define the capabilities of the device that is generating that
   stream.


7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove 'txp' attributes
   from a session description.  This could result in an application
   behaving in an undesirable way.  So, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
   integrity protection be applied to the SDP session descriptions.  For
   session descriptions carried in SIP, S/MIME is the natural choice to
   provide such end-to-end integrity protection, as described in RFC
   3261.  Other applications MAY use a different form of integrity
   protection.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The new SDP attribute "txp" is registered (see Section 3).  This is a
   media level attribute and is not dependent on charset.

   Attribute draft (draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-content-04.txt).  Other
