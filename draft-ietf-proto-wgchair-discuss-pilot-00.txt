   As of this writing, many efforts aimed at streamlining various IETF
   processes are underway. One such effort is the Process and Tools, or
   PROTO Team. The PROTO Team is an IESG-driven activity focused  on
   improving the work flow of approval of documents, and the tools that
   support this work flow. This document describes a pilot process
   designed by the PROTO Team to streamline document flow by allowing
   working group chairs to coordinate the resolution IESG DISCUSS
   comments.

1.  Introduction


   As part of the currently ongoing effort to streamline various IETF
   processes, the PROTO team [PROTO] has designed a set pilot projects
   to test possible changes to current document flow processing.  This
   document describes a pilot project designed to allow working group
   chairs to follow up on IESG DISCUSS [IDTRACKER] comments, and thereby
   offload that function from shepherding Area Director (AD) and improve
   process efficiency.  Finally, see [KLENSIN] for one rationale
   supporting piloting of process changes.

   The key words "MUST"", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].



2.  Pilot Description


   This pilot is designed to allow a working group chair to follow up on
   and resolve the DISCUSS comments for a given internet draft, and by
   doing so increase the efficiency of the IETF document process flow.
   The next section defines the terminology used throughout the
   document, and remainder of the document describes the details of the
   pilot.

3.1.  Shepherding Working Group Chair (SWGC)


   The Shepherding Working Group Chair, or SWGC, is a working group
   chair that has been selected by the appropriate AD(s) to participate
   in the pilot described in this document.



3.2.  Pilot Internet Draft (PID)


   The Pilot Internet Draft, or PID, is an Internet draft which a

   shepherding working group chair takes through the post-working group
   last call stages of the approval and publication process.  The
   approval of the responsible Area Director is necessary to make an
   Internet draft part of the pilot.

6.  Pilot Process -- Details



   In this section we detail the steps that a SWGC will take in
   resolving the DISCUSS items against a given PID. The steps are given
   below, in the order that they are to be executed.

    (i).   Immediately after the weekly IESG conference call, the
           SWGC queries the ID tracker [IDTRACKER] to collect any
           DISCUSS comments raised against the PID.

           Note: The ID tracker is capable of sending email on
                 change of state. For the duration of the pilot, it
                 would be desirable for the tracker to send email to
                 the SWGC when the PID changes state to the AD
                 Followup, Revised ID Need, or Do Not Publish
                 states. If this is not possible, the SWGC will have
                 to query the tracker to determine if there are
                 DISCUSS comments.

    (ii).    The SWGC analyzes comments from the tracker, and
        initializes contact with any AD's who have placed
        comments (blocking or non-blocking) on a draft, notifying
        them that the SWGC is the current document shepherd and
        seeking any additional clarification necessary to
        understand the comment.


           +------+  Comments     +--------+  Comments      +-------+
           | (i)  |-------------> |  (ii)  | -------------> | (iii) |
           +------+  Collected    +--------+  Understood    +-------+
                                   /|\   |
                                    |    | Comments not fully understood
                                    |    | (Further AD/SWGC Discussion Required)
                                    +----+

    (iii). The SWGC then coordinates DISCUSS comments, and builds a
           a consistent interpretation the comments. This step may
           required iteration with step (ii). above. That is:


           +------+   Consistent     +-------+
           | (ii) |----------------> | (iii) |
           +------+ Interpretation   +-------+
             /|\                         |
              |                          | Further AD/SWGC Discussion
              |                          | Required
              +--------------------------+


    (iv).  The DISCUSS comments are then communicated to the working
        group.

    (v).   After the author(s) resolve the issues provided by the
           chair (the distilled DISCUSS issues), the SWGC reviews
           the updated document to ensure that (in her/his option)
           the DISCUSS issues have been resolved.

    (vi).  Finally, the SWGC prepares a summary of the resolution
        including new document text and notifies the responsible
        AD that the PID is ready to be reconsidered by the IESG.
