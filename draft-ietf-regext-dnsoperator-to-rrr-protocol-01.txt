       Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries Protocol
          draft-ietf-regext-dnsoperator-to-rrr-protocol-01.txt

Abstract

   There are several problems that arise in the standard
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is
   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation.
   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty
   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records
   for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the
   operator first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a
   serious issue.

   When the domain on the other hand uses DNSSEC it necessary to make
   regular (sometimes annual) changes to the delegation, in order to
   track KSK rollover, by updating the delegation's DS record(s).  Under
   the current model this is prone to delays and errors.  Even when the
   Registrant has outsourced the operation of DNS to a third party the
   registrant still has to be in the loop to update the DS record.

   There is a need for a simple protocol that allows a third party DNS
   operator to update DS and NS records in a trusted manner for a
   delegation without involving the registrant for each operation.  This
   same protocol can be used by Registrants.

   The protocol described in this draft is REST based, and when used
   through an authenticated channel can be used to establish the DNSSEC
   Initial Trust (to turn on DNSSEC or bootstrap DNSSEC).  Once DNSSEC
   trust is established this channel can be used to trigger maintenance
   of delegation records such as DS, NS, and glue records.  The protocol
   is kept as simple as possible.

1.  Introduction

   Why is this needed?  DNS registration systems today are designed
   around making registrations easy and fast.  After the domain has been
   registered there are really three options on who maintains the DNS
   zone that is loaded on the "primary" DNS servers for the domain this
   can be the Registrant, Registrar, or a third party DNS Operator.

   Unfortunately the ease to make changes differs for each one of these
   options.  The Registrant needs to use the interface that the
   registrar provides to update NS and DS records.  The Registrar on the
   other hand can make changes directly into the registration system.
   The third party DNS Operator on the hand needs to go through the
   Registrant to update any delegation information.

   Current system does not work well, there are many types of failures
   have been reported and they have been at all levels in the
   registration model.

   The failures result either inability to use DNSSEC or in validation
   failures that case the domain to become invalid and all users that
   are behind validating resolvers will not be able to to access the
   domain.

   The goal of this document is to create an automated interface that
   will reduce the friction in maintaining DNSSEC delegations.

2.  Notional Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   For the purposes of this draft, a third-party DNS Operator is any DNS
   Operator responsible for a zone where the operator is neither the
   Registrant nor the Registrar of record for the delegation.

   Uses of the word 'Registrar' in this document may also be applied to
   resellers: an entity that sells delegations through a registrar with
   whom the entity has a reseller agreement.

2.2.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  What is the goal?

   The primary goal is to have a protocol to establish a secure chain of
   trust that involves parties that are not in the traditional RRR EPP
   model, or when EPP is not used.

   In the general case there should be a way to find the right
   Registrar/Registry entity to talk to, but it does not exist.  Whois[]
   is the natural protocol to carry such information but that protocol
   but is unreliable and hard to parse.  Its proposed successor RDAP
   [RFC7480] has yet be deployed on most TLD's.

   The preferred communication mechanism is to use is to use a REST
   [RFC6690] call to start processing of the requested delegation
   information.

3.1.  Why DNSSEC?

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] provides data authentication for DNS answers, having
   DNSSEC enabled makes it possible to trust the answers.  The biggest
   obstacle in DNSSEC adoption is the initial configuration of the
   DNSSEC domain trust anchor at the parent, the DS record.

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                      July 2016


3.2.  How does a child signal its parent it wants DNSSEC Trust Anchor?

   The child needs first to sign the domain, then the child can "upload"
   the DS record to its parent.  The "normal" way to upload is to go
   through registration interface, but that fails frequently.  The DNS
   Operator may not have access to the interface thus the registrant
   needs to relay the information.  For large operations this does not
   scale, as evident in lack of Trust Anchors for signed deployments
   that are operated by third parties.

   The child can signal its desire to have DNSSEC validation enabled by
   publishing one of the special DNS records CDS and/or CDNSKEY[RFC7344]
   and its proposed extension [I-D.ietf-dnsop-maintain-ds].

   Once the "parent" "sees" these records it SHOULD start acceptance
   processing.  This document covers how to make the CDS records visible
   to the right parental agent.

   This document and [I-D.ogud-dnsop-maintain-ds] argue that the
   publication of CDS/CDNSKEY record is sufficient for the parent to
   start the acceptance processing.  The main point is to provide
   authentication thus if the child is in "good" state then the DS
   upload should be simple to accept and publish.  If there is any
   problem the parent does not add the DS.

   In the event this protocols and its associated authentication
   mechanism does not address the Registrant's security requirements to
   create a secure Trust Anchor delegation then the Registrant always
   has recourse by submitting its DS record via its Registrar interface
   with EPP submission to the Registry.

3.3.  What checks are needed by parent?

   The parent upon receiving a signal that it check the child for desire
   for DS record publication.  The basic tests include,

   1. Is the zone is signed
   2. The zone has a CDS signed by a KSK referenced in the current DS,
      referring to a at least one key in the current DNSKEY RRset
   3. All the name-servers for the zone agree on the CDS RRset contents

   Parents can perform additional tests, defined delays, queries over
   TCP, ensure zone delegation best practice as per
   [I-D.wallstrom-dnsop-dns-delegation-requirements] and even ask the
   DNS Operator to prove they can add data to the zone, or provide a
   code that is tied to the affected zone.  The protocol is partially-
   synchronous, i.e. the server can elect to hold connection open until
   the operation has concluded or it can return that it received the

   request.  It is up to the child to monitor the parent for completion
   of the operation and issue possible follow-up calls.

4.  Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries RESTful API

   The specification of this API is minimalist, but a realistic one.

   Registry Lock mechanisms that prevents domain hijacking block domains
   prevent certain attributes in the registry to be changed.  This API
   may be denied access to change the DS records for domains that are
   Registry Locked (HTTP Status code 401).

4.1.  Authentication

   The API does not impose any unique server authentication
   requirements.  The server authentication provided by TLS fully
   addresses the needs.  In general, the API SHOULD be provided over
   TLS-protected transport (e.g., HTTPS) or VPN.

4.2.  Authorization

   Authorization is outside the scope of this document.  The CDS records
   present in the zone file are indications of intention to sign/unsign/
   update the DS records of the domain in the parent zone.  This means
   the proceeding of the action is not determined by who issued the
   request.  Therefore, authorization is out of scope.  Registries and
   registrars who plan to provide this service can, however, implement
   their own policy such as IP white listing, API key, etc.

4.3.  Base URL Locator

   The base URL for registries or registrars who want to provide this
   service to DNS Operators can be made auto-discoverable as an RDAP
   extension.

4.4.  CDS resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/cds {domain}: is the domain name to be
   operated on

4.4.1.  Initial Trust Establishment (Enable DNSSEC validation)

4.4.1.1.  Request

   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/cds

   A DS record based on the CDS record in the child zone file will be
   inserted into the registry and the parent zone file upon the

   successful completion of such request.  If there are multiple CDS
   records in the CDS RRset, multiple DS records will be added.

   Either the CDS/CDNSKEY or the DNSKEY can be used to create the DS
   record.  Note: entity expecting CDNSKEY is still expected accept the
   /cds command.

4.4.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 201 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 403 indicates a failure due to an invalid
      challenge token.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.4.2.  Removing a DS (turn off DNSSEC)

4.4.2.1.  Request

                   Syntax: DELETE /domains/{domain}/cds

   A null CDS or CDNSKEY record mean the entire DS RRset must be
   removed.

4.4.2.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.4.3.  DS Maintenance (Key roll over)

4.4.3.1.  Request

                     Syntax: PUT /domains/{domain}/cds

   Maintenance activities are performed based on the CDS available in
   the child zone.  DS records may be added, removed.  But the entire DS
   RRset must not be deleted.

4.4.3.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.5.  Tokens resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/tokens {domain}: is the domain name to be
   operated on

4.5.1.  Setup Initial Trust Establishment with Challenge

4.5.1.1.  Request

                   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/tokens

   A random token to be included as a _delegate TXT record prior
   establishing the DNSSEC initial trust.

4.5.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.  Token included in the
      body of the response, as a valid TXT record

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.6.  Customized Error Messages

   Service providers can provide a customized error message in the
   response body in addition to the HTTP status code defined in the
   previous section.

   This can include an Identifying number/string that can be used to
   track the requests.

   #Using the definitions This section at the moment contains comments
   from early implementers

4.7.  How to react to 403 on POST cds

   The basic reaction to a 403 on POST /domains/{domain}/cds is to issue
   POST /domains/{domain}/tokens command to fetch the challenge to
   insert into the zone.

5.  Security considerations

   Supplying the DS record as proof of control is not realistic since
   the domain is already publicly signed and the CDS/DS is readily
   available.

   Open question:?? JL?: It is not recommended the protocol be used with
   high profile domains such as TLDs and governments that are DNS
   operators.  This protocol is meant to allow third party DNS operator
   to submit the initial DS in a trusted manner without involving the
   registrant.

   This protocol should increase the adoption of DNSSEC and get more
   zones to become validated thus overall the security gain outweighs
   the possible drawbacks.

   TBD This will hopefully get more zones to become validated thus
   overall the security gain out weights the possible drawbacks.
