   A DNS Query including A Main Question with Accompanying Questions
               draft-yao-dnsop-accompanying-questions-03

Abstract

   This document enables DNS initiators to send a main question
   accompanying with several related questions in a single DNS query,
   and enables DNS responders to put the answers into a single DNS
   response.  This extension enables a range of initiators to look up
   "X, or failing that, Y" in a better way than both current
   alternatives.  This mechanism can reduce the number of DNS round-
   trips per application work-unit.

1.  Introduction

   Sometimes, when DNS lookup of X, an application will lookup Y if X
   fails.  For examples, the initiator may fall back to A record if the
   lookup of MX record fails.

   Some initiators do it in sequence, X and after a few seconds, then Y.
   Although it is simple, this leads to unpleasant waiting whenever X
   times out or answers negatively.

Internet-Draft            accompanying-queries                 June 2017


   Some initiators use concurrent X/Y lookups and a state machine to
   decide whether to use X or Y.  If an answer to Y arrives but none to
   X, the initiator needs to wait a little or else fall back to Y
   inappropriately.  Concurrent lookup is faster if the X lookup takes
   time and falling back to Y is appropriate, but rather complex, with
   four states to test, and the initiator needs to wait for an answer to
   X or a timeout before it can use Y.

   This document enables a quicker, more easily tested failover.  There
   is no need to test different answer sequences, there's no need for a
   state machine, there's no need for timeouts beyond receiving the
   reply.  This document describes a method by which DNS initiators can
   send a main question accompanying with several related questions in a
   single DNS query, and enables DNS responders place all related
   answers into a single DNS response.  This mechanism can reduce the
   number of DNS round-trips per application work-unit, by carrying
   several related queries in a single query transaction.  It has the
   following advantages compared to other solutions.

   o  Compared to sequential lookups: It's roughly as simple, but much
      faster in case a fallback to Y is necessary.

   o  Compared to the concurrent mechanism: It is slightly faster (if
      the initiator needs to wait for an X timeout) and/or prevents
      inappropriate fallback (if the answer to X arrives too late), and
      it has a simpler state machine.

   This mechanism can also be used in the scenarios when the application
   needs more records of the same domain name or its sub-domain name.
   For examples, when asking about a QTYPE=A RRset, a QTYPE=AAAA RRset
   may also be of use [RFC 5321]; When asking for some RRset of
   www.example.com about A and AAAA, records of a sub-domain name such
   as _443._tcp.www.example.com for TLSA may be of interest[RFC 6698].

2.  Terminology

   The basic key words such as "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "MAYNOT" are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].

   The basic DNS terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].

3.  Mechanism for a main question with accompanying questions

   The initiator still puts a main question into the question section of
   the DNS query packet, as described in [RFC1035].  Accompanying
   questions will be put into the variable part of an OPT RR [RFC6891].

   o  Reserved field is kept for the future use.

   o  AQ-RCODE field will be set to 111111110100 bits when being
      initialized.  The AQ-RCODE with the value of 111111110100 bits
      means that the mechanism for accompanying has not been
      implemented, where "0100" in the RCODE value means "not been
      implemented".  The AQ aware responders will put the RCODE value
      for the query of this question into AQ-RCODE fields.

   o  AQ-ANCOUNT field will indicate the number of resource records in
      the answer section for this accompanying question.  The AQ aware
      responders will put the ANCOUNT value for the query of this
      question into AQ-ANCOUNT field.

   o  AQ-NSCOUNT field will indicate the number of name server resource
      records in the authority records section for this accompanying
      question.  The AQ aware responders will put the NSCOUNT value for
      the query of this question into AQ-NSCOUNT field.

   o  AQ-ARCOUNT field will indicate the number of resource records in
      the additional records section for this accompanying question.
      The AQ aware responders will put the ARCOUNT value for the query
      of this question into AQ-ARCOUNT field.

   o  Prefix field indicates a domain name with the form of a pointer or
      a sequence of labels ending with a pointer using the message
      compression defined in section 4.1.4. of RFC 1035.  The domain
      name for accompanying questions MUST be same with the domain name
      for a main question or be children name of it.  For an example, if
      the main domain name is example.com and the accompanying domain
      name is mail.example.com., the prefix is "mail." ending with a
      pointer pointing to "example.com.".

4.  Responder Processing

   The AQ aware responder will check the main question first, and put
   the results into the DNS response packet following RFC 1034.  If the
   AQ OPT is present, the responder assembles the prefix with the main
   domain name and makes it to be an accompanying question, checks the
   accompanying questions in order, and put the results into the DNS
   answer section, authority section or additional records section of
   the response following RFC 1034; but the response code is placed in
   the respective AQ-RCODE field in AQ OPT of the response.  The RCODE
   field in the DNS response header refers to the main question only.
   The AQ aware responders will put the ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT and ARCOUNT
   value for the query of this accompanying question into the respective
   AQ-ANCOUNT, AQ-NSCOUNT and AQ-ARCOUNT fields.  The ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT
   and ARCOUNT fields in the DNS response header refer to the main
   question only.  When the answer is negative for the accompanying
   question, the SOA resource record will be put in the authority
   section.

   The mechanism proposed in this document is intended for both between
   stub resolvers and recursive resolvers, and between recursive
   resolvers and authoritative servers.  Most DNS resource records
   needed to process parallel query are normally located in the same
   zone.  In case of that some children domain names are delegated and
   not in the main domain name's zone, the delegation information will
   be returned to the recursive resolvers.  The recursive resolvers then
   check the children domain based on the delegation information, and
   get the answer for the respective children domain names.

   When a stub resolver sends an AQ query to the recursive resolver, the
   recursive resolver may have some answers for one or more questions in
   the cache, but not for all questions.  Under that case, the recursive
   resolver SHOULD forward this AQ query to some relative authoritative
   servers for full answers instead of using the existing insufficient
   cache information.

   An AQ unaware responder is expected to ignore the AQ OPT of the
   query, and may echo the received OPT back into additional section of
   the response message.

5.  Initiator Processing

   An AQ aware initiator will put the main question into the question
   section of the DNS query packet, and put related accompanying
   questions into the related accompanying question fields of OPTION-
   DATA of OPT RR.  AQ-RCODE value will be sent as 111111110100 bits.
   The AQ-TYPE value should be set as the query type related to
   accompanying questions.  The Prefix value should be set as a pointer
   or a sequence of labels ending with a pointer pointing to the the
   main domain name of the main question for the respective accompanying
   domain name of the accompanying question.

   An AQ aware initiator SHOULD set the limitation of what is the
   maximum number of accompanying questions a AQ query can bring.  This
   document suggests that the maximum number is six since most DNS
   resource records which need parallel query will not larger than six.
   The implementers may set six as the defaul value in the
   implementation.  The responder can refuse to answer the AQ query if
   the maximum number of the accompanying questions is larger than the
   default maximum value, and return "not been implemented, too many
   accompanying-questions." information to the initiator.

   If the initial value of the AQ-RCODE is unchanged in the response or
   the AQ OPT is not echo back, it indicates that the responder is AQ
   unaware.  In that case, the responder will deal with the main
   question only.  The initiator should sent the accompanying questions
   one by one via the normal DNS query.  In such followup related
   queries, AQ processing should probably not be attempted, to reduce
   waste of network resources.

6.  Query and Response Example

     Example: one main question with 2 accompanying questions

       The query would look like:
