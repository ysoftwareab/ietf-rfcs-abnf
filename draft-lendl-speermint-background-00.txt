1.  Introduction

   The Speermint WG is chartered to help with the interconnection of SIP
   based layer 7 networks.  It should not deal with basic IP
   connectivity and SIP protocol issues; those are covered by other
   working-groups.

   Speermint focuses on what guidelines (and perhaps protocol elements)
   are needed by service providers and enterprises to move from ad-hoc,
   manual peerings to a fully standardized, secure, easy to implement,
   and thus widespread SIP based peering setup.

   This document aims solely at the telephony network aspects of SIP and
   ignores applications like Instant Messaging or Presence which might
   also be implemented using SIP.  The focus here is on the use of SIP
   in PSTN replacement services.

   The intent of this document is to advance the discussion in the WG by
   providing an alternative look at the problem space.  It does not
   propose any standard and is not intended for publication as a RFC.


2.  Interconnection Models

   In order to understand what Speermint is supposed to achieve, it is
   necessary to go beyond pure protocol issues and instead also talk
   about the ecosystems in which the protocols operate.  This section
   tries to be purely descriptive and makes no recommendations.

2.1.  The PSTN model

   The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is built upon the
   following fundamental assumptions:

   o  Global reachability is achieved by interconnecting individual
      smaller networks.  There is no global lower-layer connectivity:
      calls are passed through transit networks on the application
      layer.

   o  There are no ad-hoc connections between networks: all links are
      manually configured (physical) lines.

   o  There is a clear separation between network operators and network
      users.  This applies both to protocols (e.g.  SS7 ISUP versus
      ISDN) as well as to the regulatory rules.

Internet-Draft    SPEERMINT Background and Assumptions          Apr 2007


   o  Routing information is not directly passed from the destination
      network to the source network via some global database.  Instead,
      transit networks communicate to their customers which destinations
      they can handle.

   o  Accounting and settlement are core features.

2.2.  The email model

   SIP according to RFC 3261/3263 [2][3] follows the email model.  It
   can be summarized as follows:

   o  Email and SIP addresses are structured as username@domain.  For
      routing purposes, only the domain part is relevant.  The username
      is only interpreted by the machines serving this specific domain.

   o  The global, public DNS is used to map the domain from the address
      to a prioritized set of ingress points which handle incoming
      communication requests for this domain.  As the DNS is agnostic to
      who is querying data stored there, all senders receive the same
      set of ingress points.

   o  In order to achieve worldwide reachability, these ingress points
      need to accept incoming requests from the open Internet.  If they
      reject e.g. incoming packets from China, then there is no backup
      path for this communication, and the destination just will not be
      reachable from China.

   o  As anybody on the Internet can contact any destination domain, no
      business relationship between sender and destination domain is
      required.  This implies that there is no settlement: No money is
      changing hands because of such a communication.

   o  There is no inherent distinction between end-users and service
      providers hard-coded into the protocol.  Any client can do the DNS
      lookups himself and directly contact the destination servers.

   o  Usually clients don't talk directly to each other: On the source
      side the email (or SIP INVITE) is handed to a server which
      performs the routing algorithm (plus other services like email
      retries or NAT traversal), which then contacts his peer on the
      destination side which also performs additional services (SIP:
      registrar/location lookup, email: virus filtering, spooling)
      before handing off the communication to the other end user.

   The email model has proved to be extremely successful -- for email.

3.  Why is Speermint needed?

   In theory, the Speermint WG is not necessary: The SIP RFCs envision
   instant reachability of all SIP devices over the public Internet.
   Source networks just need to resolve the domain from the URI
   according to RFC 3263 and send the INVITE to the SIP proxy in charge
   of that destination domain.

   Telephone number (TN) based calling is also supported: RFC 3761 [1]
   provides TN to URI mapping and thus reduces the call routing problem
   to the already solved case of SIP URI resolution.

   * Apparently, the real world did not choose to implement and deploy
   SIP and ENUM as initially envisioned by their inventors.  In other
   words: the motivation for Speermint is the failure of the world to
   conform to the original IETF vision of SIP based real-time
   communication. *

3.1.  Why the email model failed for SIP

   Although SIP has won the protocol war against H.323 (just as SMTP won
   against X.400), it failed to establish the same sort of ecosystem in
   the Internet as SMTP was able to do.  The number of SIP users who are
   reachable via the open Internet using RFC 3263 is miniscule when
   compared to the number of SIP based telephones in operation today.

   SIP as a protocol has succeeded, SIP as an ecosystem similar to SMTP
   has failed.

   The need for Speermint arises from that failure: SIP has seen
   widespread deployment within enterprises and service providers, but
   the inter-connection part of SIP has not: current deployments usually
   do not follow RFC 3263, but use either hard-coded IP-addresses or
   private DNS to route calls between VSPs, if they use SIP at all and
   not the PSTN.

   The same applies to ENUM according to RFC 3761: The technology has
   been successful (as the large number of private ENUM trees
   demonstrates), but the original vision of ENUM proved to be elusive:
   the "golden tree" under e164.arpa contains a fraction of entries
   compared to the numbers found in private trees.

   Speermint is chartered to provide solutions for the interconnection
   problem.  It is thus essential to examine why the current standards
   have failed.  Without this gap-analysis there is little chance that
   Speermint will come up with the missing pieces.

   As mentioned before, this analysis cannot be restricted to pure



Lendl                   Expires October 20, 2007                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SPEERMINT Background and Assumptions          Apr 2007


   technological aspects, and will thus touch on the business models
   implied by the technical standards.  It is the firm believe of the
   author that the IETF credo "we don't do business models" has been
   implicitly violated by existing standards.  One approach is thus to
   identify these implications and augment the protocols to be neutral
   with respect to ecosystems and business models.

   Business model

      The email model hard-codes a "sender-keeps-all" settlement regime.
      As anybody is able to connect to anybody, no business relationship
      is needed between communication partners, thus no termination fees
      can be collected.

      The economic model of the current carrier landscape in most
      countries depends on these charges, and it just does not make
      sense for any single carrier to allow anonymous incoming SIP-based
      interconnection as that means lost income.  If call patterns are
      about symmetrical, switching to sender-keeps-all is revenue-
      neutral for all carriers.  There is no clear path on how such a
      fundamental shift in the bedrock of telco settlement could happen.

      The end-state might be viable business model, but there is no
      incentive for any individual VSP to start the transition.

      This argument applies only to VSPs which are substitutes for PSTN
      carriers, and not to enterprises operating a SIP infrastructure.

   Unwanted calls

      Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is another concern.  The free
      for all nature of the email ecosystem has led to a barrage of
      unsolicited email (SPAM) which poses a serious threat to the
      usefulness of email.

      Email is non-interactive: filters can be deployed to detect spam
      by the content of the mail before the recipient is alerted.  That
      is not possible for SPIT: content is only available after the
      recipient has picked up the phone.  A number of SPIT mitigation
      strategies have been proposed over the last years, their
      effectiveness is yet untested.

      As of 2007, SPIT is not a problem, mainly because the number of
      open reachable SIP devices is so low.  Just as SPAM only started
      to become a problem after open SMTP servers became common, many
      VSPs fear that SPIT will appear if they open up their networks.

   Identity

      Traditional telecom services provide reasonably reliable caller
      identification.  Telcos trust each other's signalling and end-
      users have learned to trust caller-id.  Such a trust model is not
      compatible with the email model of open SIP servers: the INVITE
      message can come from any host on the Internet and is thus not
      trusted.

      Providing a reliable caller identification is also important for
      policing: Harassing and abusive calls are more or less under
      control, as legal and contractual rules can be enforced by tracing
      calls back to the culprit.

      The SIP identity standard (RFC 4474) uses a different approach
      (certificate-based, end-to-end) than what is current practice in
      the telco space (transitive trust).

   QoS and Denial of Service

      The email model is not suitable for stringent Quality of Service
      (QoS) implementations.  As there are no pre-arranged relationships
      with between all communicating SIP servers, there are no
      mechanisms to guarantee neither network performance on the IP
      layer for the actual voice transmission, nor can there be
      comprehensive tests on SIP layer compatibility.

      As the ingress points need to be open to anybody on the Internet,
      they are exposed to Denial of Service attacks.

      This combination is at odds with the telco mind-set which thrives
      on predictable quality and stringent service level guarantees.

   Legal Requirements

      Operators of public telephony services need to observe a range of
      regulatory requirements.  These rules were written for the PSTN
      scenario with clearly defined boundaries between operators and
      users of the telephone network.  Changing the interconnection
      model make these regulations a bad fit for the email model.

      For example, if the user requests CLIR (Calling Line
      Identification Restriction) then his VSPs needs to differentiate
      in the call handling whether the peering partner is another
      commercial VSPs (transmit caller-ID) or an enterprise (suppress
      caller-ID).  Interconnecting only with other VSPs which operate
      under the same rules simplifies compliance.

3.2.  The PSTN model does not fit, either

   It is of course possible to rebuild the PSTN based on SIP instead of
   SS7.  Some might argue that this is what the IMS and NGN efforts are
   all about.  This is selling SIP and the Internet short: The basic
   infrastructure which the Internet offers allows for far more flexible
   interconnection arrangements than a simple copy of the PSTN
   structure.

   Shared Layer 3 Infrastructure

      The PSTN is based on trunk lines which connect voice switches.
      These trunks are manually established between carriers.  Each such
      link needs physical ports as well as dedicated bandwidth.
      Establishing direct links between carriers is thus only sensible
      if call volumes can justify the effort.

      In contrast to the point-to-point link world of the PSTN, SIP
      assumes an any-to-any IP based network like the Internet.  This
      has a profound impact on the economics of interconnection: A new
      peering is this not a matter of provisioning a new bit-pipe, but
      just one of configuring border elements on both sides.

      Economic theory states that there must be a optimal number of
      peerings per VSP given the costs to establish an interconnection
      versus the costs of transit.  As the cost structure is
      fundamentally different, the mesh density of the optimal SIP based
      network will deviate significantly from the current PSTN.

   Enterprise Peering

      As a corollary: Peering between TDM-based enterprise telephony
      systems is usually limited to very high traffic cross-links.  As
      enterprise to enterprise calls do not require settlement, there is
      a huge potential for additional peering in this space.

   Dynamic Routing

      Worldwide routing in the PSTN is still based mainly on manual
      processes.  As a consequence, it takes years to a get a new number
      range routed in the PSTN.  The switch from SS7 to SIP must be
      taken as a chance to upgrade the worldwide call routing to a
      better routing algorithm.

Internet-Draft    SPEERMINT Background and Assumptions          Apr 2007


4.  Core Assumptions

   We believe that some of the basic assumptions in the SIP peering
   world have to be re-thought as the current orthodoxy stiffles any
   progress.  Here are some suggestions to that end:

4.1.  The real problem with SPIT

   SPIT and QoS/DoS issues have often been cited as reason why so few
   people (enterprises and commercial VSPs) run an open SIP service.
   The IETF has taken on the challenge and tried to develop protocol
   extensions which should help with the SIP adoption.  These are often
   based on the following reasoning:

   +------------+          +-------------+          +-------------+
   |We want to  |          |They need to |          |They have a  |
   |interconnect|===(1)===>|run open     |===(2)===>|problem with |
   |VSPs        |          |SIP servers  |          |SPIT and DoS.|
   +------------+          +-------------+          +-------------+

   The IETF focus has been on step (2).  Protocols and procedures have
   been proposed to mitigate the exposure of open SIP proxies.  These
   include the consent framework for SIP, SPIT identification, anti-SPIT
   policy rules, the Identity: header, and all the transport layer
   security work.

   These are all worthwhile proposals which solve certain specific
   problems.  Regrettably, they don't remove the roadblocks to
   widespread SIP-based peering.  For that, they tackle the wrong set of
   problems.  They assume that the email model can be successful and we
   just need to make sure that all the associated problems are
   addressed.

   This assumption is wrong.  To move Speermint forward, we need to
   tackle step (1) instead.

   The question should not be "How can we achieve universal peering?",
   but "How can we get VSPs to peer at all?".  Instead of "How to keep
   out the unwanted connects?" we should focus on "How can we entice
   willing partners to a peering?".

4.2.  What is a SIP URI?

   SIP URIs are used in various contexts: They can specify contact
   points (sip:user@10.0.0.1), they can specify next hop information in
   a private interconnection setting
   (sip:012345678@sbc1.chicago.us.example.net), and they can be public
   SIP URIs (sip:alice@example.com) for which the responsible SIP proxy



Lendl                   Expires October 20, 2007                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    SPEERMINT Background and Assumptions          Apr 2007


   can be determined using RFC 3263.

   There is yet another interpretation of the SIP URI which may be
   relevant for Speermint: The URI as a simple identifier of a telephony
   customer without the commonly implied semantic on how that user can
   be contacted.

   While that is close to the public URI, the difference is important:
   RFC 3263 does not apply.  There is no simple, globally valid set of
   ingress points for calls towards that URI.  The default SIP call
   routing logic just is not applicable to such URIs.

   In other words: It is a very useful concept to use the SIP protocol
   and the URIs from RFC 3261 without also adopting RFC 3263, because
   the latter more or less implies the email model which has proven to
   be unworkable in the Speermint context.  It is thus expected that any
   SIP URI published in a public infrastructure ENUM will not imply the
   applicability of RFC 3263.

   In order to place calls, some alternative to RFC 3263 needs to be
   developed which accommodates the needs of carriers.

4.3.  Peering vs. Reachability

   Whatever the interconnection setup, subscribers of a telephony
   service expect to be able to call all subscribes of all other VSPs.
   When the email model cannot be assumed, this requires the use of
   transit networks and thus some sort of routing mechanism to find a
   path to the destination VSP.

   This is important, but not the focus of Speermint.  As the name
   states, Speermint is about "peering", i.e. how two (or a group of)
   VSPs can interconnect.  Speermint is about how one VSP can find out
   that a SIP call he is handling can be passed to peering partner and
   about details on how the actual call is signalled.

   Multi-hop routing is not part of the Speermint scope (yet).

   [Note: It is the opinion of the author that the IETF will have to
   tackle the complete routing problem in the future.  Given the current
   state of Speermint, it may be unwise to go beyond peering discovery
   at this stage.]

4.4.  The Key to Routing Data

   Currently, the PSTN side is using telephone numbers (TN) as the key
   to the routing information, whereas the RFC 3263 SIP uses the domain
   name.



Lendl                   Expires October 20, 2007               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    SPEERMINT Background and Assumptions          Apr 2007


   The TN used to be the perfect identifier for routing as the
   hierarchical structure of the number corresponded to the network
   topology in the PSTN.  The emergence of alternative carriers, number
   porting, and service numbers (free-phone, premium rate, ...) changed
   that: The telephone number is now primarily a "name" and not any
   longer an "address".

   Prefix-based routing used to be the way to aggregate routes to
   telephone numbers in order to keep the routing tables and their
   updates manageable.  While that is still useful to encode policies
   like "Route all of +43 to Carrier XYZ", within a country number
   portability made prefix-based routing increasingly inefficient.

   Looking at the routing information from a database design point of
   view, it does not make sense to store the set of possible routes
   (incl. all meta-data like prices, capacity, quality,...) for every
   individual number, as these will be identical for at least all
   numbers operated by a single carrier in some area.

   Any routing protocol will thus scale by several orders of magnitude
   better if it is based on some sort of "Route-ID" which comprises a
   carrier identification plus optionally a service or region-specific
   tag.

   Thus: while the telephone number is the starting point of the routing
   information lookup, it is not a good identifier to use as the key for
   storing routes.

4.5.  Lookups vs. Announcements

   Generally speaking, there are two ways how to distribute routing
   information:

   On Demand

      Whenever routing information is needed some external database is
      queried.

      Example: DNS (including ENUM).

   Pro-active Distribution

      The information for all possible destinations is distributed
      before the first routing decision is made.

      Example: BGP, OSPF.

   There are of mixed models as well, e.g. when an organization gathers



Lendl                   Expires October 20, 2007               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    SPEERMINT Background and Assumptions          Apr 2007


   routing information pro-actively to load an internal database which
   is then queried on an "on-demand" basis by network elements.
   Alternatively, some systems might pro-actively fetch the fraction of
   the global routing information which covers the most likely
   destinations, and only fall back to on-demand queries for the rest.

   The on-demand model requires a lower level transport infrastructure
   to contact the external database.  It's thus clear that Layer 3
   routing cannot use that model as this leads to a chicken-and-egg
   problem.  This is not an issue for the Speermint setting: Basic
   Internet connectivity can be assumed.

   The pro-active model on the other hand operates under a different
   constraint: Distributing all information needed for the routing
   decisions to all carriers requires that the aggregate dataset size of
   these routing information tables does not exceed sensible size
   limits.  For example, it is not feasible to replace the MX record
   lookup of mail-servers by a routing protocol which replicates the
   domain-name to mail-server mapping information to all ISPs and
   enterprise mail-servers.  There are just too many domains in use and
   thus the "mail-routing tables" would exceed all practical limits.

   With regards to TN based calls, both options are possible.  ENUM
   according to RFC 3761 is a clear on-demand approach.  On the PSTN
   side, downloads of database dumps are a common method to distribute
   routing information.

   Regarding routing in the Speermint context, we need to scale the
   system to the set of all active TN.  They number in the billions.
   Installing a "full routing table" into a core telephony (soft-)switch
   is thus not feasible.  Current PSTN implementations cope by crude
   aggregation of routes to foreign countries.

   The number of reachable IP addresses is roughly of the same order of
   magnitude, but the aggregation properties of IP addresses reduces to
   global routing table to under 500000 entries without any impact on
   the quality of the routing decisions.  Telephone numbers don't
   aggregate as well which makes a TN-based protocol similar to BGP
   infeasible (see TRIP [4]).

   The obvious solution is to add an on-demand mapping step ahead of the
   routing protocol.  That on-demand mapping should include the option
   to seed a cache with the most likely destination TNs.

4.6.  No National Solutions

   Telecom regulation, especially concerning number assignments and
   interconnection rules, is a national matter.  Calling patterns favor

   local destinations: local and national calls make up the majority of
   all calls.  It is thus not surprising that number based PSTN (and
   some of the emerging VoIP-based) routing exchanges only deal with
   numbers from a single country code.

   On the other hand, international voice termination markets deal
   usually not with individual numbers, but with routes to number
   prefixes.

   Given the increasingly international footprint of voice operators the
   country-specify ways of handling inter-carrier routing is an
   anachronism.  Just as the Internet routing does not care about
   national borders, there is no inherent reason why a single set of TN
   mapping and voice routing protocols can't be seamlessly deployed in
   an international setting.  There should be no need for special
   handling per country-code in the routing logic.

   Consider the case of a pan-European mobile operator X. If X has
   signed a peering agreement with a local Austrian VoIP operator Y,
   then Y should pass all calls over that link which terminate in any
   GSM network that X operates.  Ideally Y should notice when a number
   was ported to X's network in Germany and adapt the routing.  If X
   acquires a new network in, say Bulgaria, then Y should automatically
   route all calls to that set of numbers over the peering with X. All
   this should happen without Y having to participate in Germany- or
   Bulgaria-specific TN database exchanges.

   All this has been standard in Internet-based communication: both BGP
   as well as application layer protocols like SMTP or HTTP do not care
   about national borders.  The protocol to resolve a .com name is the
   same as the one to resolve within .cn.  BGP speakers announce routes
   without any regard for national borders.  Speermint should strive to
   achieve the same level of universality.

   This does not preclude local optimizations: e.g. if the mapping from
   TN to some sort of routing identifier is done by Infrastructure ENUM,
   then it makes sense to pro-actively prime the VSP name-servers with
   the data for all local numbers.
