               Abstract 
                   
                  In its current form, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows session 
                  invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered 
                  from one party to another. However it doesnot explicitly permit 
                  midcall events such as hook/flash from the user to be passed on to 
                  the network application server. Without such ability, it is not clear 
                  how SIP can be used to provide certain network controlled services. 
                  This document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP 
                  to provide a MidCall-based communications framework.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] supports communications 
                  across many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, 
                  instant messaging, and presence. This communication is established by 
                  the transmission of various SIP requests (such as INVITE and MESSAGE 
                  [4]) from an initiator to the recipient, with whom communication is 
                  desired. 
                      
                  Softswitches, or IP-based voice switches, are fast replacing 
                  expensive, proprietary telecom circuit switches as the primary 
                  switching elements in wireline carrier networks. 
                   
                  SIP has been widely accepted as the main signalling protocol in the 
                  Next Generation wireline and wireless networks. This is reflected in 
                  the endorsement of SIP by IPCC and 3GPP. 
                      
                  SIP is used for softswitch-to-softswitch signaling, as well as 
                  softswitch-to-application server and application server-to-media 
                  server signaling.

                  End users connect to the SIP based softswitch platform through a SIP-
                  based Integrated Access Device (IAD) or SIP Phone, which hooks into 
                  their broadband modem. However usage of SIP in the access network of 
                  a wireline carrier network has raised some new requirements about 
                  communicating mid-call events to the softswitch platform.

                           Requirements for Midcall Communication in SIP January 2005 
                   
                  This document defines the requirement for adding a MidCall framework 
                  to SIP. 
                
               2. Problem Statement 
                   
                  To provide a uniform service behavior to different kinds of Access 
                  end points like MGCP, H.248/Megaco, there is a requirement that SIP 
                  based softswitch platforms be able detect and then process mid call 
                  event from the SIP end points. 
                      
                  However there is lack of clarity as to how to use SIP end points can 
                  be made to provide the same service behavior as that provided by the 
                  ordinary POTS terminal. The reason is that SIP doesnot provide any 
                  mechanism to transfer the hook/flash event from the user's end-point 
                  to the softswitch. 
                    
                  SIP is a powerful and flexible protocol and provides many mechanisms 
                  [5] to provide supplementary services to the SIP end points. However 
                  if the same service behavior, as a POTS terminal, is desired then SIP 
                  should provide extensions to report any mid-call events like 
                  hook/flash to the central softswitch platform. 
                   
                   
               3. Requirements 
                   
                  The following description identifies requirements for a solution that 
                  provides MidCall-based communication in SIP. 
                   
                  REQ 1: The solution must enable SIP based IADs or PBXs to provide the 
                  same POTS interface to the end user. 
                   
                  REQ 2: The solution shall try to provide a generic framework for 
                  reporting mid-call events which is extensible. 
                   
                  REQ 3: The solution shall provide the flexibility in service mapping 
                  and preferenecs and based on the following assumptions 
                       1) Predefined mapping between the terminal and the service  
                       2) User's configuration of the preferred mid-call service (for  
                           example, through web page)  
                       3) Network application service provides full options to choose  
                           by prompting user to select call waiting, call transfer, etc  
                           when user provides a mid-call hook/flash indication. 
                   
                  REQ 4: The solution should require the SIP Phone to have only one 
                  HOOK/FLASH button, similar to the POTS phone. This is required to 
                  provide SIP based VOIP connectivity in the greenfield areas. 
                   
               4. Security Considerations 
                   
                  There are no specific Requirements related to Security. 
                   
               5. IANA Considerations 
                   
                  This document introduces no new considerations for IANA.
