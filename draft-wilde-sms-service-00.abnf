      Description of Use: SMSC - In some situations, it may be necessary
         to guide the sender of an SMS message to send the message via a
         certain Short Message Service Center (SMSC).  If the SMSC
         qualif-type1 element is present, an SMS client SHOULD try to
         send the message first using the specified SMSC.  If that
         fails, the SMS client MAY try another SMSC (such as the default
         SMSC for that client).

         Further description is available in draft-wilde-sms-service-00

      Use Restriction: The use of the "SMSC" qualif-type1 element is
         restricted to the "SMS" service-selector, it has no meaning
         outside the SMS service defined by the "SMS" service-selector.

      Security Considerations: See the Security Consideration section of
         draft-wilde-sms-service-00.
