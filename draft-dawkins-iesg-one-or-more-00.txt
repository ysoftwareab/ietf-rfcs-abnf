1.  Introduction and Scope

   This document updates RFC 2026 ([RFC2026], BCP 9) to remove a limit
   on the number of Area Directors who manage an Area in the definition
   of "IETF Area".  This document also updates RFC 2418 ([RFC2418], BCP
   25) to reflect this updated definition.

   This document allows the IESG additional flexibility in organizing
   the IETF's work.  It does not make any changes to existing Area
   structures, and does not argue that assigning more than two Area
   Directors to an Area is an optimal solution in the long run.

2.  Discussion

   In recent discussions, the IESG has explored splitting and combining
   Areas.  One proposal resulted in a single Area that would be managed
   by three Area Directors.

   An Area managed by three Area Directors conflicts with this
   definition in Section 14, "DEFINITIONS OF TERMS" of RFC 2026
   ([RFC2026]):

      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.

   A similar statement appears in Section 1, "Introduction" of RFC 2418
   ([RFC2418]):

      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).

   In the distant past, all IETF Areas had a single Area Director.  The
   movement from single Area Directors in an Area to pairs of Area
   Directors in most Areas happened over a period of years (for
   reference, see http://www.ietf.org/iesg/past-members.html), as part

Internet-Draft       More Area Directors in an Area         October 2014


   of the IESG organizing itself to do the work the IESG is chartered to
   do,

   The last time the IESG increased the number of Area Directors in an
   Area was when they provided a position description to the Nominating
   Committee for a second Area Director in the Routing Area in 1999.
   Although the number of Area Directors in an Area hasn't changed since
   then, the IESG continues to be responsible for specifying the
   positions that Nomcom would fill each year.

   It is consistent with the IESG's role in creating and dismantling
   entire Areas to allow the IESG flexibility in assigning enough Area
   Directors who have been selected by the Nominating Committee to
   effectively manage the working groups within an Area.

   Note that the requirement in RFC 3777 ([RFC3777], BCP 10) that the
   Nominating Committee review (approximately) half the positions for
   the IESG each year is unchanged.

3.  Normative Text Change

   For this text (OLD) in Section 14, "DEFINITIONS OF TERMS" of RFC 2026
   ([RFC2026]):

      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.

   Replace with this text (NEW):

      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or more Area Directors.

   For this text (OLD) in Section 1, "Introduction" of RFC 2418
   ([RFC2418]):

      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).

   Replace with this text (NEW):

      Each IETF area is managed by one or more Area Directors (ADs).

   Informational RFCs such as RFC 3710 ([RFC3710]) and informal
   descriptions of IETF organizational structure which also describe
   IETF Areas as being managed by one or two Area Directors should be
   considered updated by this normative specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document updates an IETF process BCP and has no direct Internet
   security implications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA and the RFC Editor can safely
   remove this section during publication.
