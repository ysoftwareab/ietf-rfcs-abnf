                 draft-gandhi-spring-sr-enhanced-plm-04

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is
   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6
   (SRv6) data planes.  This document defines procedures for Enhanced
   Performance and Liveness Monitoring (PLM) for end-to-end SR paths
   including SR Policies for both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes, those
   reduce the deployment and operational complexities in a network.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR Policies as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to steer traffic

   through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of Segments.
   Built-in Performance Measurement as well as Liveness Monitoring for
   Connectivity Verification (CV) and Continuity Check (CC) are
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in
   SR networks.

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks [RFC8762].  It eliminates the need for control protocol by
   using configuration and management model to provision and manage test
   sessions.  The STAMP can be used for Performance Measurement (PM) in
   SR networks as well as liveness monitoring and connectivity loss
   detection of SR paths.  However, the STAMP requires protocol support
   on the Session-Reflector to process the STAMP test packets as packets
   need to be punted from the forwarding fast path (to slow path or
   control plane) on the Session-Reflector and STAMP reply test packets
   need to be generated.  This limits the scale for number of STAMP test
   sessions and faster fault detection intervals.

   For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [RFC7880] can be used in SR networks.  However, S-BFD
   requires protocol support on the BFD-Reflector to process the S-BFD
   packets as packets need to be punted from the forwarding fast path
   and generate the reply packets thereby limiting the scale for number
   S-BFD sessions and faster fault detection intervals.  In addition,
   S-BFD protocol is not defined to enable performance measurement in a
   network.

   Enabling multiple protocols, S-BFD for liveness monitoring and STAMP
   for performance measurement increases the deployment and operational
   complexities a network.  Also, implementing multiple protocols in a
   hardware significantly increases the development cost.

   This document defines procedures for Enhanced Performance and
   Liveness Monitoring (PLM) for end-to-end SR paths including SR
   Policies for both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes, those reduce the
   deployment and operational complexities in a network.  The procedures
   use the new test packet formats those have the timestamps at the same
   locations as the base STAMP test packets to leverage the existing
   hardware support for STAMP.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the Session-Sender R1
   initiates a PLM test packet and the Session-Reflector R3 transmits a
   PLM return test packet.  The PLM return test packet is transmitted
   back to the Session-Sender R1 on the same path or a different path in
   the reverse direction.

   The Session-Sender R1 and Session-Reflector R3 are connected via an
   SR path [RFC8402].  The SR path may be an SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] on node R1 (called head-end)
   with destination to node R3 (called tail-end).

3.  Overview

3.1.  Loopback Mode

   In loopback mode, the Session-Sender R1 initiates PLM test packets
   and the Session-Reflector R3 forwards them just like data packets for
   the regular traffic back to the Session-Sender R1.  The PLM test
   packets are not punted at the Session-Reflector and does not process
   them and generate PLM return test packets.  The Session-Reflector
   must not drop the loopback PLM test packets, for example, due to a
   local policy provisioned.  No PLM test session is created on the
   Session-Reflector.

   The Source and Destination IP addresses in the PLM test packets are
   set to the Session-Reflector and the Session-Sender IP addresses,
   respectively (representing the reverse direction path).  The Source
   and Destination UDP ports in the PLM test packets follow the
   procedure defined in [RFC8762].  The IPv4 Time To Live (TTL) and IPv6
   Hop Limit (HL) are set to 255.

3.2.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming Function

   In loopback mode enabled with network programming function, both
   transmit (T1) and receive (T2) timestamps in data plane are collected
   by the PLM test packets transmitted in loopback mode as shown in
   Figure 1.  The network programming function optimizes the "operations
   of punt and generate the PLM test packet" on the Session-Reflector as
   timestamping is implemented in forwarding fast path in hardware.
   This helps to achieve higher test session scale and faster failure
   detection interval.

                           /                     \

                  |       | - - - - - - - - - - - |       |

                  |       |<- - - - - - - - - - - |       |
                  +-------+   Return Test Packet  +-------+
                           \
                            T4

                Session-Sender                 Session-Reflector
                                                (Timestamp,
                                                 Pop and Forward)

     Figure 1: Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming Function

   The Session-Sender adds transmit timestamp (T1) in the payload of the
   PLM test packet and clears the receive (T2) timestamp.  The Session-
   Reflector adds the receive timestamp (T2) in the payload of the
   received PLM test packet in forwarding fast path in hardware without
   punting the test packet to the slow path (or control-plane).  The
   network programming function enables Session-Reflector to add the
   receive timestamp (T2) at a specific offset in the payload which is
   locally provisioned consistently in the network.  The payload of the
   PLM test packet is not modified by the intermediate nodes.

   The Session-Reflector only adds the receive timestamp if the source
   IP address (in case of SR-MPLS) or destination IP address (in case of
   SRv6) in the PLM test packet matches the local node address to ensure
   that the PLM test packet reaches the intended Session-Reflector and
   the receive timestamp is returned by the intended Session-Reflector.

   An example provisioning model and typical measurement parameters are
   shown in Figure 2:

                   Figure 2: Example Provisioning Model

   Example of PLM mode is loopback mode.  The values for Timestamp Label
   and SRv6 Endpoint Behaviour may be provisioned as described in
   Section 6.  Example of Timestamp Format is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588].
   Example of Timestamp Offset is 16 and 32 bytes for the PLM test
   packet formats defined in this document.  Example threshold values
   configured for generating notifications are: Missed Packet Count (N),
   Delay Exceeded Threshold and Packet Count (T/M) and Packet Loss
   Threshold (XofY), as described in Section 7.

   The mechanisms to provision the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector
   are outside the scope of this document.

4.  PLM Test Packet Formats

   The PLM test packet formats for unauthenticated and authenticated
   modes are defined in this document as shown in Figure 3 those have
   the transmit and receive timestamps at the same locations as the base
   STAMP test packets to leverage the existing hardware support for
   STAMP.

             PLM Test Packet Format in Authenticated Mode

                     Figure 3: PLM Test Packet Formats

   Sequence Number is the sequence number of the PLM test packet
   according to its transmit order.  It starts with zero and is
   incremented by one for each subsequent PLM test packet.

   SSID (16-bits): PLM Sender Session Identifier.  Uses the procedure
   for SSID defined in [RFC8762].

   Transmit Timestamp and Transmit Error Estimate are the Session-
   Sender's transmit timestamp and error estimate for the PLM test
   packet, respectively.

   Receive Timestamp and Receive Error Estimate are the Session-
   Reflector's receive timestamp and error estimate, respectively.

   The timestamp and error estimate fields follow the definition and
   formats defined in Section 4.1.2 in [RFC8762].  The timestamp format
   used by default is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588].

   HMAC: The use of the HMAC field is described in Section 4.4 of
   [RFC8762].

   MBZ: Must be Zero.  It MUST be all zeroed on the transmission and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.

5.  PLM Procedure

   For performance and liveness monitoring of an end-to-end SR path
   including SR Policy, PLM test packets in loopback mode are used.

   For SR Policy, the PLM test packets are transmitted using the Segment
   List (SL) of the Candidate-Path
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  When a Candidate-Path has
   more than one Segment Lists, multiple PLM test packets are sent, one
   using each Segment List.  The PLM return test packets are received by
   the Session-Sender via IP/UDP [RFC0768] return path by default.  The
   Segment List of the return SR path can be added in the PLM test

   packet header to receive the return test packet on a specific path
   using the Binding SID [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] or Segment
   List of the Reverse SR Policy [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].

5.1.  PLM for SR-MPLS Policies

   The PLM test packets are transmitted using the MPLS header for each
   Label Stack of the SR-MPLS Policy Candidate-Path(s) as shown in
   Figure 4.  In case of IP/UDP return path, the MPLS header is removed
   by the Session-Reflector.  The Label Stack can contain a reverse SR-
   MPLS path to receive the PLM return test packet on a specific path.
   In this case, the MPLS header will not be removed by the Session-
   Reflector.

   Segment List can contain a reverse SRv6 path to receive the PLM
   return test packet on a specific path.  In this case, the SRH will
   not be removed by the Session-Reflector.  When the PLM return test
   packet contains an SRH at the Session-Sender, the procedure defined
   for upper-layer header processing for SRv6 SIDs in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] is used to process the UDP
   header in the received PLM test packets.

   Timestamp" field in the payload of the PLM test packet.  The Label
   Stack for the reverse SR-MPLS path can be added after the Timestamp
   Label to receive the PLM return test packet on a specific path.  When
   a Session-Reflector receives a packet with Timestamp Label, after
   timestamping the packet at a specific offset, the Session-Reflector
   pops the Timestamp Label and forwards the packet using the next label
   or IP header in the packet (just like the data packets for the

    Figure 6: Example PLM Test Packet with Timestamp Label for SR-MPLS

6.1.1.  Timestamp Label Allocation

   The timestamp Labels for unauthenticated and authenticated modes can
   be allocated using one of the following methods:

   o  Labels (values TBA1 and TBA2) assigned by IANA from the "Extended
      Special-Purpose MPLS Values" [I-D.ietf-mpls-spl-terminology].  For



Gandhi, et al.           Expires August 13, 2021               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  Performance and Liveness Monitoring in SR  February 2021


      Label (value TBA1), the timestamp offset is fixed at byte-offset
      16 from the start of the payload for the unauthenticated mode, and
      Label (value TBA2) at byte-offset 32 from the start of the payload
      for the authenticated mode, both using the timestamp format 64-bit
      PTPv2.

   o  Labels allocated by a Controller from the global table of the
      Session-Reflector.  The Controller provisions the labels on both
      Session-Sender and Session-Reflector, as well as timestamp offsets
      and timestamp formats.

   o  Labels allocated by the Session-Reflector.  The signaling and IGP
      flooding extension for the labels (including timestamp offsets and
      timestamp formats) are outside the scope of this document.

6.1.2.  Node Capability for Timestamp Label

   The PLM Session-Sender needs to know if the Session-Reflector can
   process the Timestamp Label to avoid dropping PLM test packets.  The
   signaling extension for this capability exchange is outside the scope
   of this document.

6.2.  Enhanced PLM with Timestamp Endpoint Function for SRv6 Policies

   The [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] defines SRv6 Endpoint
   Behaviours (EB) for SRv6 nodes.  In this document, two new Timestamp
   Endpoint Behaviours are defined for Segment Routing Header (SRH)
   [RFC8754] to enable "Timestamp and Forward (TSF)" function for the
   received test packets.

   In the PLM test packets for SRv6 Policies, Timestamp Endpoint
   Function (End.TSF) is carried with the target Segment Identifier
   (SID) in SRH [RFC8754] as shown in Figure 7, to collect "Receive
   Timestamp" field in the payload of the PLM test packet.  The Segment
   List for the reverse path can be added after the target SID to
   receive the PLM return test packet on a specific path.  When a
   Session-Reflector receives a packet with Timestamp Endpoint (End.TSF)
   for the target SID which is local, after timestamping the packet at a
   specific offset, the Session-Reflector forwards the packet using the
   next SID or IP header in the packet (just like the data packets for
   the regular traffic).

     Figure 7: Example PLM Test Packet with Endpoint Function for SRv6

6.2.1.  Timestamp Endpoint Function Assignment

   The Timestamp Endpoint Functions for "Timestamp and Forward" can be
   signaled using one of the following methods:

   o  Timestamp Endpoint Functions (values TBA3 and TBA4) assigned by
      IANA from the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors Registry".  For endpoint
      behaviour (value TBA3), the timestamp offset is fixed at byte-
      offset 16 from the start of the payload for the unauthenticated
      mode, and endpoint behaviour (value TBA4) at byte-offset 32 from
      the start of the payload for the authenticated mode, both using
      the timestamp format 64-bit PTPv2.

   o  Timestamp Endpoint Functions assigned by a Controller.  The
      Controller provisions the values on both Session-Sender and
      Session-Reflector, as well as timestamp offsets and timestamp
      formats.

   o  Timestamp Endpoint Functions assigned by the Session-Reflector.
      The signaling and IGP flooding extension for the endpoint

      functions (including timestamp offsets and timestamp formats) are
      outside the scope of this document.

6.2.2.  Node Capability for Timestamp Endpoint Function

   The PLM Session-Sender needs to know if the Session-Reflector can
   process the Timestamp Endpoint Function to avoid dropping PLM test
   packets.  The signaling extension for this capability exchange is
   outside the scope of this document.

7.  ECMP Handling

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  The
   PLM test packets need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to
   monitor an end-to-end SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  In IPv4 header of the PLM test
   packets, sweeping of Destination Address from the 127/8 range can be
   used to exercise different IPv4 ECMP paths in both loopback modes as
   long as the forward and the return paths are SR-MPLS paths.  In this
   case, the TTL field in the IPv4 header is set to 1.

   The Flow Label field in the outer IPv6 header can also be used for
   sweeping to exercise different IPv6 ECMP paths.

8.  Example PLM Failure Notifications

   Liveness or connectivity success for an end-to-end SR path is
   initially notified as soon as one or more PLM return test packets are
   received at the Session-Sender.

   Liveness or connectivity failure for an end-to-end SR path is
   notified when consecutive N number of PLM return test packets are not
   received at the Session-Sender, where N (Missed PLM Packet Count) is
   a locally provisioned value.

   The round-trip packet loss for an end-to-end SR path is calculated
   using the Sequence Number in the PLM test packets.  The packet loss
   metric is notified when X number of PLM test packets were lost out of
   last Y number of PLM test packets transmitted by the Session-Sender,
   where Threshold XofY is locally provisioned value.

   Similarly, the delay metrics are notified, as an example, when
   consecutive M number of PLM test packets have measured delay values
   exceed user-configured threshold T, where M (Delay Exceeded Packet

   Count) and T (Absolute and Percentage Delay Exceeded Threshold) are
   also locally provisioned values.

   In both loopback modes, the timestamps T1 and T4 are used to measure
   round-trip delay.  In loopback mode enabled with network programming
   function, the timestamps T1 and T2 are used to measure one-way delay.

   In both loopback modes, a failure on the reverse direction path can
   cause the PLM return test packets to not reach the Session-Sender.
   This is also true in the case where the PLM return test packets were
   generated by the Session-Reflector e.g. to indicate Session-Sender of
   a failure on the forward direction path.  As such, the test packet
   based methods have a limitation of false detection due to a reverse
   direction failure.

9.  Security Considerations

   The Performance and Liveness Monitoring is intended for deployment in
   the well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a monitoring operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the Session-
   Reflector.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the Session-Sender, of the timestamp fields in
   received PLM packets.  The minimal state associated with these
   protocols also limits the extent of disruption that can be caused by
   a corrupt or invalid packet to a single test cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the test packets.  Cryptographic measures may be
   enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists and
   firewalls.

   The security considerations specified in [RFC8762] also apply to the
   procedures defined in this document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   mpls-label-values/mpls-label-values.xml>).  IANA is requested to
   allocate Timestamp Label value from the "Extended Special-Purpose
   MPLS Label Values" registry:
