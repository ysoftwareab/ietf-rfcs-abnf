Internet-Draft               SIMCO over SCTP              September 2006


Abstract

   This document specifies how to use SCTP for the transport of the
   SIMCO (Version 3.0) protocol.  SIMCO (SImple Middlebox COnfiguration)
   is a protocol that implements the MIDCOM semantics.  It can be used
   for controlling middleboxes such as firewalls and network address
   translators.  SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a
   transport layer protocol that is expected to have advantages for this
   type of application, compared to TCP, which is the default transport
   layer protocol for SIMCO.  The specific requirements for SIMCO when
   using SCTP instead of TCP are specified in this document.

Internet-Draft               SIMCO over SCTP              September 2006


1.  Introduction

   The SIMCO (SImple Middlebox COnfiguration) protocol [RFC4540] is a
   signaling protocol that implements the MIDCOM protocol semantics
   [RFC3989].  In the context of the MIDCOM architecture [RFC3303], it
   can be used for controlling middleboxes [RFC3234] such as firewalls
   and network address translators (NATs).

   As outlined in [RFC3303], firewalls and NATs are potential obstacles
   to packet streams, for example if dynamically negotiated UDP or TCP
   port numbers are used, as in many peer-to-peer communication
   applications.  SIMCO allows applications to communicate with
   middleboxes on the datagram path in order to request a dynamic
   configuration at the middlebox that enables datagram streams to pass
   the middlebox.  Applications can request pinholes at firewalls and
   address bindings at NATs.

   The SIMCO specification [RFC4540] mandates TCP (Transmission Control
   Protocol) [RFC0793] as the default transport for SIMCO.

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC2960] has
   originally been designed as a part of the SIGTRAN architecture
   [RFC2719], for the transport of Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) messages
   over IP.  However, this rather special purpose is achieved by
   adaptation layers on top of SCTP.  SCTP itself has been designed as a
   generic transport protocol for IP networks, at the same layer in the
   protocol stack as TCP or UDP.

   SCTP offers several advantages compared to TCP for the transport of
   signaling protocols, especially in scenarios with high reliability
   requirements or high signaling traffic between two endpoints.

   This document supplements the SIMCO Version 3.0 specification
   [RFC4540] by itemizing the requirements for transporting SIMCO over
   SCTP.

3.  Potential benefits

   A summary of SCTP's properties and advantages is given in [RFC3257].
   Two of these properties are of special benefit, especially when SIMCO
   is used in large-scale deployments.

3.1.  Multiple streams for reduced head-of-line blocking

   SCTP allows to send user messages over several streams within a
   single SCTP association.  SCTP ensures in-order delivery only for
   those messages that are sent through the same stream.  This limits
   the impact of the so-called head-of-line blocking problem to one
   stream.

   Head-of-line blocking occurs if a reliable transport layer protocol
   has to retransmit a message due to packet loss or bit errors.
   Subsequent messages that have already arrived at the receiving side
   cannot be delivered to the upper protocol layers until the
   retransmission is completed.  Instead, they have to be buffered, in
   order to ensure in-order delivery.  Unlike TCP, which has to buffer
   the whole connection, SCTP has to buffer only one stream, while
   messages from other streams still can be delivered to the upper layer
   protocol.

   SIMCO can profit from SCTP's multiple streams feature as a typical
   SIMCO session consists of several message threads, each of them
   requiring in-order delivery, but being independent of each others.

3.2.  Multihoming Support

   SCTP transparently supports endpoints with several IP addresses.
   This allows for having several physical network interfaces connected
   to different networks.  The availability of all paths between these
   interfaces is monitored with keepalive messages.  If the primary
   path, which is normally used for message transmission, becomes
   unavailable an automatic changeover to one of the backup paths is
   performed.

4.  Usage of SCTP as transport protocol for SIMCO

4.1.  Leveraging SCTP's multiple streams feature

   A central concept of SIMCO are the so-called policy rules.  Policy
   rules correspond to pinholes on firewalls, and to address bindings on
   NATs.  They are created, modified, and deleted by means of SIMCO
   transactions, i.e., a request sent from the SIMCO agent to the
   middlebox plus a positive or negative reply.

   All SIMCO messages bear a Transaction Identifier (TID) field that
   identifies to which transaction the message belongs to.  The TID is
   uniquely assigned by the entity that sends the transaction's first
   message (usually the SIMCO agent, in case of asynchronous
   notifications the middlebox).  Policy rules are identified by a
   numerical policy rule identifier (PID).  When a request creates a new
   policy rule at the middlebox, the middlebox assigns a unique PID and
   returns it in the positive reply.  All subsequent transactions that
   modify or delete the policy rule contain the respective PID.

   It is important that the transport layer protocol preserves the order
   of transactions that refer to the same policy rule, i.e., to the same
   PID.  For example, it would be bad if a SIMCO agent requested a
   lifetime extension (PLC with non-zero value) for a specific policy
   rule and immediately afterwards requested to delete it (PLC with zero
   value), but the delete request was delivered to the middlebox before
   the lifetime extension request.  However, there is no requirement
   that prohibits reordering of SIMCO messages that refer to different
   policy rules.

   The basic idea is therefore to have several bidirectional pairs of
   streams within the SCTP association.  All SIMCO messages belonging to
   one transaction, i.e., all messages that have the same TID value
   shall be sent over the same stream pair.  Furthermore, all SIMCO
   transactions that refer to the same PID shall be transported over the
   same stream pair.  Transactions that refer to other PIDs may be
   transported over other streams and are therefore not affected if one
   stream suffers from head-of-line blocking.

4.2.  Establishment of SCTP association

   In order to setup a SIMCO session, an agent establishes one SCTP
   association to port 7626/SCTP at the middlebox.

   During establishment of the SCTP association, the agent and the
   middlebox will negotiate the number of streams to use, according to
   section 5.1.1 of [RFC2960].  After the negotiation the SCTP
   association has N1 streams from the agent to the middlebox and N2

Internet-Draft               SIMCO over SCTP              September 2006


   streams from the middlebox to the agent.  From these streams, only
   the first N = min(N1,N2) streams in each direction (i.e., streams
   with stream identifiers 0 to (N-1) ) will be used.  A pair consisting
   of two streams with the same stream identifier but running in
   opposite directions is considered and used as one bi-directional
   stream pair.

   If the middlebox has accepted fewer streams as requested by the
   agent, the agent MAY decide to shutdown the SCTP association without
   sending any SIMCO messages.

   The N bidirectional stream pairs are used for the transmission of
   policy rule related transactions and policy rule related asynchronous
   notifications.  SIMCO session related transactions and notifications
   are always transmitted over stream pair 0.

4.3.  Encapsulation of SIMCO messages into SCTP data chunks

   Every single SIMCO message MUST be passed as exactly one user message
   to the SCTP layer.  SCTP implementations used in conjunction with
   SIMCO MUST support fragmentation of user messages that exceed the MTU
   (see [RFC2960], section 6.9).

   The SCTP data chunk's Payload Protocol Identifier is set to 15
   (SIMCO).

4.4.  Mapping of SIMCO Session Control Messages into SCTP streams

   The objective of the following requirements is to reduce the impact
   of head-of-line blocking by distributing transactions on several SCTP
   streams while retaining ordering where needed.

4.4.1.  SIMCO Agent behavior requirements

4.4.1.1.  Session Control Messages

   Session control messages (SE, SA, ST) MUST be sent over stream 0.

4.4.1.2.  Policy Rule Control Messages that do not refer to a PID

   The SIMCO agent may use any implementation specific strategy to
   distribute policy rule control messages that do not include a PID
   attribute (PRR, PER, PRL, PDR) over the N streams.

   Possible strategies are, for example:

   o  round robin

   o  SIMCO transaction identifier (TID) modulo N

   If the SIMCO agent receives a PRR positive reply, PER positive reply,
   or PDR positive reply, the SIMCO agent MUST internally store the
   mapping between the PID contained in the reply and the number of the
   stream it was received on.

4.4.1.3.  Policy Rule Control Messages that refer to a PID

   The SIMCO agent MUST send requests that include a PID attribute (PEA,
   PLC, PS) using the stream number that was saved for this PID,
   according to Section 4.4.1.2.

   An agent may want to send one of these requests (especially PS)
   referring to a policy rule that was not established by this agent,
   e.g., if the agent has learned the PID by means of a PRL transaction.
   In this case, the agent has no mapping from this PID to an SCTP
   stream number.  The agent may send this request over any stream,
   according to a strategy as described in Section 4.4.1.2.  Then, the
   SIMCO agent MUST internally store the mapping between the PID and the
   stream number it had chosen, for later usage as described in the
   first paragraph of this section.

4.4.2.  SIMCO server (middlebox) requirements

4.4.2.1.  Replies to transactions initiated by Agent

   For sending (positive or negative) replies to requests issued by the
   MIDCOM agent, the middlebox MUST use the same outbound stream number
   as the number of the inbound stream on which the request was received
   on.

4.4.2.2.  Asynchronous Rule Event notifications

   For sending ARE messages, the middlebox may use any implementation
   specific strategy, such as round robin, to distribute the ARE
   notification messages over all N streams.

4.4.2.3.  Asynchronous Session Termination notifications

   AST messages MUST be sent over stream 0.

5.  Security Considerations

   SCTP has certain advantages over TCP with respect to the protection
   against denial of service (DoS) attacks (state cookie mechanism,
   verification tags) [RFC2960].  However, the main threats that are
   identified in [RFC4540] apply for using SIMCO over SCTP as well.
   Therefore, the requirements given in the section "Security
   Considerations" of [RFC4540] MUST be fulfilled when using SCTP
   instead of TCP, too.  Information on known security threats and
   countermeasures specific to SCTP can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctpthreat].

6.  IANA considerations

   For the transport of SIMCO over SCTP a user port number (see
   Section 4.2) and a SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (see Section 4.3)
   have already been registered with IANA.

   No further IANA action is required by this document.
