  Abstract 
      
     Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery protocol and Context Transfer 
     Protocol are experimental protocols designed to accelerate IP handover 
     between wireless access routers. These protocols require IANA allocations 
     for ICMP type and options, SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers, port numbers, 
     and registries for certain formatted message options. This document contains 
     instructions to IANA about what allocations are required for the Seamoby 
     protocols. The ICMP subtype extension format for Seamoby has additionally 
     designed so that it can be utilized by other experimental mobility 
     protocols, and the SCTP port number is also available for other experimental 
     mobility protocols.

   1.0    Introduction 
      
     The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol [CARD] and 
     Context Transfer Protocol (CTP) [CTP] are experimental protocols designed to 
     accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers. These protocols 
     require IANA allocations for ICMP options and type, SCTP Payload Protocol 
     Identifiers and port number, and establishment of registries for certain 
     formatted message options. Because the protocols are experimental, there is 
     no guarantee that they will ever see widespread deployment in their current 
     form. Consequently, it seems prudent to conserve Internet numbering 
     resources that might be needed for other protocols which could see wider 
     deployment. This draft contains instructions to IANA for the Seamoby 
     protocols. Additionally, the ICMP subtype extension format has been designed 
     so that it could be used by other experimental mobility protocols. 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
     document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
     Allocation policy names Specification Required, IETF Consensus Action, and 
     Designated Expert are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2434 [RFC2434]. 
      
   2.0    Common IPv4 and IPv6 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign SCTP port number TBD1 for use by experimental mobility 
     protocols such as Seamoby. See Section 5.2.1 of [CARD] for a description of 
     inter-access router CARD protocol use of SCTP, and Section 3.1 of [CTP] for 
     a description of the inter-access router CTP use of SCTP. 
      
     IANA SHALL assign SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPI) TBD2, designated 
     "CTP", for the Context Transfer Protocol, and SCTP Payload Protocol 
     Identifier TBD3, designated "CARD", for the Candidate Access Router 
     Discovery protocol. These are used to differentiate inter-router CARD and 
     CTP messages on the SCTP port. The allocation policy for new PPI numbers is 
     the method of IETF Consensus Action. 
      
   3.0    IPv4 Allocations 
      
     IANA SHALL assign ICMP type TBD4 for IPv4 identifying ICMP messages utilized 
     by experimental mobility protocols such as Seamoby. See Section 5.1.1 of

     Seamoby. See Section 9.0 of this document for a description of the 
     experimental mobility protocol subtype format and initial allocations.

   5.0    Candidate Access Router Discovery Protocol Registries 
      
     For CARD, two new registries are created that IANA is to maintain, named: 
      
        1) The AVP Type Registry,  
        2) The Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier Registry. 
      
     These are described in the following subsections. 
      
  5.1 AVP Type Registry 
   
     The AVP Type Registry allows future expansion of the CARD AVP type space to 
     include new AVPs. AVP Type codes are 16 bit unsigned integers. See Section 
     5.1.4 of [CARD] for a description of AVPs.  
      
     The registry SHALL be initially populated with the following table: 
      
                 AVP Name                            Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00  
      
     Future allocations of AVP type codes are made through Expert Review, as 
     defined in RFC 2434.

  5.2 Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier Registry 
      
     The Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier registry allows the registration of 
     type codes to uniquely identify specific access technologies in the L2-Type 
     field of the CARD L2 ID sub-option. L2 ID codes are 16 bit unsigned 
     integers. See Section 5.1.3.1 of [CARD] for a description of the CARD L2 ID 
     sub-option. 
      
     The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table: 
      
                 Layer 2 Access Technology            Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00 
                 IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)                   0x01 
                 IEEE 802.11a                            0x02 
                 IEEE 802.11b                            0x03 
                 IEEE 802.11g                            0x04 
                 IEEE 802.15.1(Bluetooth)                0x05 
                 IEEE 802.15.3                           0x06 
                 IEEE 802.15.4                           0x07 
                 IEEE 802.16                             0x08 
      
     Future allocation of Layer 2 Access Technology identifiers are made by the 
     method of Specification Required as defined in RFC 2434. All requests for 
     allocations MUST be accompanied by a reference to a technical document in 
     which the design of the Layer 2 access technology is described.  
      
   6.0    Context Transfer Profile Type Registry 
      
     CTP requires IANA to maintain a registry named the Context Transfer Profile 
     Type Registry, which is a registry of context Feature Profile Type 
     identifiers. Feature Profile Type identifiers are 16 bit unsigned integers 
     that identify particular types of feature contexts. See Section 2.4 of [CTP] 
     for a description of how contexts are carried in CTP. 
      
     The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table: 
      
                 Context Profile                      Type Code 
                 ----------------------------------------------  
                 RESERVED                                0x00 
                 IPv6 Multicast Listener Context         0x01 
      
     Future allocations of Feature Profile Type codes are made through Expert 
     Review, as defined in RFC 2434. 
      
   7.0    Context Transfer Protocol Authorization Token Calculation Algorithm 
      
     In Section 2.5.4 of [CTP], CTP requires an authorization token calculation 
     algorithm indicator. Currently, the only indicator defined is 0x1, for 
     HMAC_SHA1. Additional algorithms may be added by the method of Specification 
     Required [RFC2434].

   8.0    ICMP Experimental Mobility Subtype Format and Registry 
      
     The ICMP Experimental Mobility Type is utilized by CARD and CTP in the 
     following way. The interpretation of the Code field is as defined by the 
     relevant ICMP standard for IPv4 and IPv6, and does not change. The protocols 
     are free to utilize the Code for their own purposes. The ICMP Experimental 
     Mobility Type defines a one octet subtype field within the ICMP Reserved 
     field, which identifies the specific protocol. The ICMP header for the 
     Experimental Mobility Type is: 
      
          0                   1                   2                   3

     IANA SHALL maintain a registry of one octet unsigned integer subtype codes 
     for the Experimental Mobility protocols called the Experimental Mobility 
     Protocol Subtype Registry. 
      
     Initial allocations in the registry SHALL be established as follows:

     The ICMP Experimental Mobility type code and SCTP port are available for 
     other experimental mobility protocols to utilize. Other experimental 
     mobility protocols MAY define additional ICMP messages that utilize the code 
     points under the Experimental Mobility ICMP type, and MAY define protocols 
     that utilize additional SCTP PPI numbers for the Experimental Mobility 
     protocol port.
