Abstract

     This document describes a proposed implementation of an Automatic
     Call Back (ACB) service using SIP. This service is somtimes
     refered to as "camp on extension," "call again," "automatic
     redial," and "automatic recall."

1. Introduction

     Most services that exist in the public switched telephony network
     (PSTN) can be implemented trivially using SIP [1] , either by
     itself or with currently proposed extensions.

     An effiicient implementation of the ACB service, however, cannot
     be accomplished without a mechanism for notification when a
     called party has become free. This document proposes a method of
     implementing this functionality using the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY
     methods defined in "Call Event Notification in SIP" [2] .

2. Service Description



Roach                                                           [Page 1]

Internet Draft     Automatic Call Back Service in SIP         March 2000



     Typically, the caller initiates a call in the normal fashion for
     their access device (e.g. dialing a number, selecting an entry
     from an address book application). When the user receives
     indication of "ringing" or "busy," they may choose to activate
     the ACB service. The method of activation will vary depending on
     the access device. For a hardware phone, there will typically be
     a dedicated "callback" button; PC-based clients may have a menu
     option and/or a hot key; and PSTN bridges may play a series of
     prompts to guide the user in activating the service. The user
     receives confirmation of service activation.

     Once the callee's  device becomes available, the caller's phone
     will indicate that the ACB service has been triggered. For
     hardware phones and PSTN bridges, this will typically be a
     distinctive ring; for PC-based clients, it may be an audio alert
     accompanied by a dialogue box.

     The user responds to this alerting as if he were answering an
     incoming call. Upon doing so, he receives indication of the far
     end alerting, and the call proceeds as normal.

     At any time before the ACB service is triggered by the callee's
     device becoming available, the caller may cancel outstanding ACM
     requests.

3. "Event" header value

     This service uses an event type of "terminal-free" in its
     SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages. This event is defined to occur
     whenever a logical terminal transitions to an  idle state (i.e.
     has no ongoing calls).

4. Example Messages

     The following sections give example messages for various
     ACB-related scenarios. Some details, such as SDP bodies and
     "Via:" headers, have been omitted for the sake of clarity.

4.2. Requesting notification with SUBSCRIBE (no answer)

     This call flow demonstrates the flow of messages if a user
     decides to activate the ACB service after the callee's terminal
     has started alerting, but before the callee answers.
