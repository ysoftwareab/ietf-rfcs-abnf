   according to such information.  This is defined as the computing-
   aware SD-WAN.This document describes the use cases for computing-
   aware Software-Defined Wide Area Network(SD-WAN).

1.  Introduction

   SD-WAN provides organizations or enterprises with centralized control
   over multiple sites which are network endpoints including branch
   offices, headquarters, data centers, clouds, and more.  A enterprise
   may deploy their services and applications in different locations to
   achieve optimal performance.  The traffic sent by a host will take
   the shortest WAN path to the closest server.  However, the closet
   server MAY NOT be the best choice with lowest cost of network and
   computing resources for the host.  If the path computation element
   can consider the computing dimension information in path computation,
   the best path with lowest cost can be provided.

   The computing related information can be the number of vCPUs of the
   VM running the application/services, CPU utilization rate, usage of
   memory, etc.

   The SD-WAN can be aware of the computing resource of applications
   deployed in the multiple sites and can perform the routing policy
   according to the information is defined as the computing-aware SD-
   WAN.

   This document describe the use case of computing-aware SD-WAN.

2.1.  Computing-aware SD-WAN for Enterprise Cloudification

   Many enterprises are performing the cloud migration to migrate the
   applications from data centers to the clouds, including public,
   private, and hybrid clouds.  The clouds resources can be from the
   same provider or multiple cloud providers which have some benefits
   including disaster recovery, load balancing, avoiding vendor lock-in.

   In such cloudification deployments SD-WAN provides enterprises with
   centralized control over Customer-Premises Equipments(CPEs) in branch
   offices and the cloudified CPEs(vCPEs) in the clouds.The CPEs connect
   the clients in branch offices and the application servers in clouds.
   The same application server in different clouds is called an
   application instance.  Different application instances have different
   computing resource.

   SD-WAN is aware of the computing resource of applications deployed in
   the clouds by vCPEs, and selects the application instance for the
   client to visit according to computing power and the network state of
   WAN.

   Figure 1 below illustrates Computing-aware SD-WAN for Enterprise
   Cloudification.

        +-------+        +-------+
        |Client2| ------ |  CPE  |
        +-------+        +-------+                     +---------------+
      +-------+           \          +----------+      |    Cloud2     |
      |Client3|            \---------|   WAN2   |------|  vCPE2  APP1  |
      +-------+                      +----------+      +---------------+

       Figure 1: Illustration of Computing-aware SD-WAN for Enterprise
                            Cloudification

   The current computing load status of the application APP1 in cloud1
   and cloud2 is as follows: each application uses 6 vCPUs.  The load of
   application in cloud1 is 50%. The load of application in cloud2 is
   20%. The computing resource of APP1 are collected by vCPE1 and vCPE2
   respectively.  Client1 and Client2 are visiting APP1 in cloud1.  WAN1
   and WAN2 have the same network states.  Considering lightly loaded
   application SD-WAN selects APP1 in cloud2 for the client3 in branch
   office.  The traffic of client3 follows the path: Client3 -> CPE ->
   WAN1 -> Cloud2 vCPE1 -> Cloud2 APP1
