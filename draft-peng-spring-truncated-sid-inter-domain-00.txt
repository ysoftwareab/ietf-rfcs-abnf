1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing [RFC8402] leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
   called segments.  [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] proposes
   the Segment Routing in IPv6 (SRv6) Network Programming to specify a
   packet processing program by encoding a sequence of instructions in
   the IPv6 packet's extension header.
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] defined a Segment
   Identifier (SID) as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG, where a locator
   (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of the SID, followed
   by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of arguments (ARG).  A
   locator may be represented as B:N where B is the SRv6 SID block (IPv6
   prefix allocated for SRv6 SIDs by the operator) and N is the
   identifier of the parent node instantiating the SID.  Note that "SID
   Locator Block" and "BLOCK" are used interchangeably throughout the
   document.

   As demonstrated in several proposals, such as
   [I-D.cl-spring-generalized-srv6-for-cmpr] and
   [I-D.mirsky-6man-unified-id-sr], SIDs could be allocated by SRv6
   nodes from within the same SRv6 SID Locator Block, and referring to
   the idea described in [RFC6554] SRH only needs to store the
   difference between SIDs, such as NODE:FUNCT:ARGS, the non-BLOCK part,
   and does not need to contain the SRv6 SID Locator Block information.
   In this case, some or all SIDs encoded in the SRH are the non-BLOCK
   part of the 128-bit SIDs.

Internet-Draft         Truncated SID Inter Domain           January 2021


   An SRv6 path could traverse domains that use different block prefixes
   and achieving different compressed SIDs lengths.  This document
   provides a method of higher compression efficiency for interworking
   between domains.  It introduces a new SID flavor and defines the
   required control plane extensions.

3.  Interworking Between Different Domains

   The interworking of different domains is illustrated in Figure 1.

        .......... domain 1..............  .......domain2.........



                  Figure 1: Interworking between domains

   An end-to-end SRv6 path from A to D passes through two domains.  The
   block prefix of Domain 1 is BLOCK1, and the compressed SID's length
   is 32 bits.  The block prefix of Domain 2 is BLOCK2, and the
   compressed SID's length is 16 bits.

   The following notation is used in the document, 128bits-BLOCK1-SID-
   A-32 means that this is a 128-bit SID of node A whose block is BLOCK1
   and itself can be compressed to 32 bits if needed.  The original
   segment list before the compression is <128bits-BLOCK1-SID-A-32,
   128bits-BLOCK1-SID-B-32, 128bits-BLOCK1-SID-ABR-32, 128bits-BLOCK2-
   SID-C-16, 128bits-BLOCK2-SID-D-16>.

   This segment list is selected/computed by a Path Computation Element
   (PCE) system or a controller and the details are for further
   discussion.

Internet-Draft         Truncated SID Inter Domain           January 2021


   A new SID flavor is defined in this document to make the entire
   segment list more compressible.

   Block Swapping (BS) Flavor: it indicates that SRv6 SID Locator Block
   will be swapped.  And the information about the new block with
   block's length is maintained in the local SID entry.

   So in ABR, a 128bits-BLOCK1-ABR-32 SID with BS flavor is allocated.
   It is within 128-bit SID with block1 and has BS Flavor, and the local
   SID entry will swap BLOCK1 to BLOCK2.  Thus, the next short 16 bit
   SID can be stitched with BLOCK2 to generate a full 128 bit SID.  With
   the help of the BS flavor, the corresponding compressed segment list
   could be <32bits-SID-A,32bits-SID-B,32bits-SID-ABR(BS), 16bits-SID-C,
   16bits-SID-D>.

   32bits-SID-A means this is a 32-bit compressed SID of node A.

   32bits-SID-ABR(BS) means this is a 32-bit compressed SID of node ABR
   with BS flavor.

   At the headend S, the packet sent to node A is (SA,DA=BLOCK1+32bits-
   SID-A)(16bits-SID-D, 16bits-SID-C, 32bits-SID-ABR, 32bits-SID-B,
   32bits-SID-A; SL=3), i.e., only one single 128 segment entry is
   needed in SRH.  Note that SL=3 means there are three 32-bits segment
   items within SRH remaining to be visited.

   The packet sent from node A to node B is (SA,DA=BLOCK1+32bits-SID-
   B)(16bits-SID-D, 16bits-SID-C, 32bits-SID-ABR, 32bits-SID-B, 32bits-
   SID-A; SL=2).

   The packet sent from B to ABR is (SA,DA=BLOCK1+32bits-SID-
   ABR)(16bits-SID-D, 16bits-SID-C, 32bits-SID-ABR, 32bits-SID-B,
   32bits-SID-A; SL=1).

   When the packet arrives at ABR, it matches the local SID entry.  The
   endpoint behavior of that entry is END with BS Flavor, and the new
   block with its block length is provided in the local SID entry.  The
   next short 16 bit SID can be retrieved from SRH and be stitched with
   the new block to generate a full 128 bit SID to be copied to the DA
   field.  Thus, the packet sent from ABR to C could be
   (SA,DA=BLOCK2+16bits-SID-C)(16bits-SID-D, 16bits-SID-C, 32bits-SID-
   ABR, 32bits-SID-B, 32bits-SID-A; SL=1).  Note that SL=1 means there
   are one 16-bits segment items within SRH remaining to be visited.

   Generally, multiple BS-flavored SIDs may be allocated on the boundary
   node.  For example, SID-12 with BS flavor indicates that SRv6 SID
   Locator Block switches from BLOCK1 to BLOCK2, and SID-13 indicates
   that SRv6 SID Locator Block switches from BLOCK1 to block3.

   For the inter-AS scenario, END.X SID allocated for SR-EPE or a direct
   link can also have BS flavor to indicate the new block information of
   the next AS.

4.  Control Plane Extensions

4.1.  Extensions to BGP-LS

   This document introduces an SRv6 SID Swapped Block Sub-TLV.  It is an
   optional TLV for use in the BGP-LS Attribute for an SRv6 SID NLRI and
   as a sub-TLV of the SRv6 End.X, IS-IS SRv6 LAN End.X and OSPFv3 SRv6
   LAN End.X TLVs [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-srv6-ext].  This TLV is validate
   only when the SID has a BS flavor.

   The TLV has the following format:


        0                   1                   2                   3

   Swapped Block: This field encodes the advertised swapped block prefix
   information.

4.2.  Extensions to IGP

   Different nodes in the same IGP domain may have different block
   prefixes.  So IGP extensions are also needed in this scenario.

4.2.1.  Extensions to IS-IS

   SID Swapped Block Sub-Sub-TLV is introduced in this document.  It is
   an optional Sub-Sub-TLV of SRv6 End SID Sub-TLV, SRv6 End.X SID Sub-
   TLV and SRv6 LAN End.X SID Sub-TLV
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions].
