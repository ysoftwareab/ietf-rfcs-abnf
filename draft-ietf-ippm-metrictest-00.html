<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independent
      instantiations of a performance metric RFC have implemented the
      specifications in the same way. This is the performance metric
      equivalent of interoperability, required to advance RFCs along the
      standards track. Results from different implementations of metric RFCs
      will be collected under the same underlying network conditions and
      compared using state of the art statistical methods. The goal is an
      evaluation of the metric RFC itself, whether its definitions are clear
      and unambiguous to implementors and therefore a candidate for
      advancement on the IETF standards track.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The Internet Standards Process <a class='info' href='#RFC2026'>RFC2026<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2026]
      requires that for a IETF specification to advance beyond the Proposed
      Standard level, at least two genetically unrelated implementations must
      be shown to interoperate correctly with all features and options. This
      requirement can be met by supplying:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>evidence that (at least a sub-set of) the specification has been
          implemented by multiple parties, thus indicating adoption by the
          IETF community and the extent of feature coverage.
</li>
<li>evidence that each feature of the specification is sufficiently
          well-described to support interoperability, as demonstrated through
          testing and/or user experience with deployment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of a protocol specification, the notion of
      "interoperability" is reasonably intuitive - the implementations must
      successfully "talk to each other", while exercising all features and
      options. To achieve interoperability, two implementors need to interpret
      the protocol specifications in equivalent ways. In the case of IP
      Performance Metrics (IPPM), this definition of interoperability is only
      useful for test and control protocols like the One-Way Active
      Measurement Protocol, OWAMP <a class='info' href='#RFC4656'>[RFC4656]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., Teitelbaum, B., Karp, A., Boote, J., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, and the
      Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol, TWAMP <a class='info' href='#RFC5357'>[RFC5357]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hedayat, K., Krzanowski, R., Morton, A., Yum, K., and J. Babiarz, &ldquo;A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>A metric specification RFC describes one or more metric definitions,
      methods of measurement and a way to report the results of measurement.
      One example would be a way to test and report the One-way Delay that
      data packets incur while being sent from one network location to
      another, One-way Delay Metric.
</p>
<p>In the case of metric specifications, the conditions that satisfy the
      "interoperability" requirement are less obvious, and there was a need
      for IETF agreement on practices to judge metric specification
      "interoperability" in the context of the IETF Standards Process. This
      memo provides methods which should be suitable to evaluate metric
      specifications for standards track advancement. The methods proposed
      here MAY be generally applicable to metric specification RFCs beyond
      those developed under the IPPM Framework <a class='info' href='#RFC2330'>[RFC2330]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V., Almes, G., Mahdavi, J., and M. Mathis, &ldquo;Framework for IP Performance Metrics,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Since many implementations of IP metrics are embedded in measurement
      systems that do not interact with one another (they were built before
      OWAMP and TWAMP), the interoperability evaluation called for in the IETF
      standards process cannot be determined by observing that independent
      implementations interact properly for various protocol exchanges.
      Instead, verifying that different implementations give statistically
      equivalent results under controlled measurement conditions takes the
      place of interoperability observations. Even when evaluating OWAMP and
      TWAMP RFCs for standards track advancement, the methods described here
      are useful to evaluate the measurement results because their validity
      would not be ascertained in typical interoperability testing.
</p>
<p>The standards advancement process aims at producing confidence that
      the metric definitions and supporting material are clearly worded and
      unambiguous, or reveals ways in which the metric definitions can be
      revised to achieve clarity. The process also permits identification of
      options that were not implemented, so that they can be removed from the
      advancing specification. Thus, the product of this process is
      information about the metric specification RFC itself: determination of
      the specifications or definitions that are clear and unambiguous and
      those that are not (as opposed to an evaluation of the implementations
      which assist in the process).
</p>
<p>This document defines a process to verify that implementations (or
      practically, measurement systems) have interpreted the metric
      specifications in equivalent ways, and produce equivalent results.
</p>
<p>Testing for statistical equivalence requires ensuring identical test
      setups (or awareness of differences) to the best possible extent. Thus,
      producing identical test conditions is a core goal of the memo. Another
      important aspect of this process is to test individual implementations
      against specific requirements in the metric specifications using
      customized tests for each requirement. These tests can distinguish
      equivalent interpretations of each specific requirement.
</p>
<p>Conclusions on equivalence are reached by two measures.
</p>
<p>First, implementations are compared against individual metric
      specifications to make sure that differences in implementation are
      minimised or at least known.
</p>
<p>Second, a test setup is proposed ensuring identical networking
      conditions so that unknowns are minimized and comparisons are
      simplified. The resulting separate data sets may be seen as samples
      taken from the same underlying distribution. Using state of the art
      statistical methods, the equivalence of the results is verified. To
      illustrate application of the process and methods defined here,
      evaluation of the <a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>One-way Delay Metric<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2679] is
      provided in an Appendix. While test setups will vary with the metrics to
      be validated, the general methodology of determining equivalent results
      will not. Documents defining test setups to evaluate other metrics
      should be developed once the process proposed here has been agreed and
      approved.
</p>
<p>The metric RFC advancement process begins with a request for protocol
      action accompanied by a memo that documents the supporting tests and
      results. The procedures of <a class='info' href='#RFC2026'>[RFC2026]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> are expanded
      in<a class='info' href='#RFC5657'>[RFC5657]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dusseault, L. and R. Sparks, &ldquo;Guidance on Interoperation and Implementation Reports for Advancement to Draft Standard,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, including sample implementation and
      interoperability reports. Section 3 of <a class='info' href='#morton-advance-metrics-01'>[morton&#8209;advance&#8209;metrics&#8209;01]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Morton, A., &ldquo;Lab Test Results for Advancing Metrics on the Standards           Track,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> can serve as a template for a
      metric RFC report which accompanies the protocol action request to the
      Area Director, including description of the test set-up, procedures,
      results for each implementation and conclusions.

Basic idea</h3>

<p>The implementation of a standard compliant metric is expected to meet
      the requirements of the related metric specification. So before
      comparing two metric implementations, each metric implementation is
      individually compared against the metric specification.
</p>
<p>Most metric specifications leave freedom to implementors on
      non-fundamental aspects of an individual metric (or options). Comparing
      different measurement results using a statistical test with the
      assumption of identical test path and testing conditions requires
      knowledge of all differences in the overall test setup. Metric
      specification options chosen by implementors have to be documented. It
      is REQUIRED to use identical implementation options wherever possible
      for any test proposed here. Calibrations proposed by metric standards
      should be performed to further identify (and possibly reduce) potential
      sources of errors in the test setup.
</p>
<p>The Framework for <a class='info' href='#RFC2330'>IP Performance Metrics<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V., Almes, G., Mahdavi, J., and M. Mathis, &ldquo;Framework for IP Performance Metrics,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2330] expects that a "methodology for a metric should have the
      property that it is repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple
      times under identical conditions, it should result in consistent
      measurements." This means an implementation is expected to repeatedly
      measure a metric with consistent results (repeatability with the same
      result). Small deviations in the test setup are expected to lead to
      small deviations in results only. To characterise statistical
      equivalence in the case of small deviations, RFC 2330 <a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>and<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2679] suggest to apply a 95% confidence
      interval. Quoting RFC 2679, "95 percent was chosen because ... a
      particular confidence level should be specified so that the results of
      independent implementations can be compared."
</p>
<p>Two different implementations are expected to produce statistically
      equivalent results if they both measure a metric under the same
      networking conditions. Formulating in statistical terms: separate metric
      implementations collect separate samples from the same underlying
      statistical process (the same network conditions). The statistical
      hypothesis to be tested is the expectation that both samples do not
      expose statistically different properties. This requires careful test
      design:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The measurement test setup must be self-consistent to the largest
          possible extent. To minimize the influence of the test and
          measurement setup on the result, network conditions and paths MUST
          be identical for the compared implementations to the largest
          possible degree. This includes both the stability and non-ambiguity
          of routes taken by the measurement packets. See RFC 2330 for a
          discussion on self-consistency.
</li>
<li>The error induced by the sample size must be small enough to
          minimize its influence on the test result. This may have to be
          respected, especially if two implementations measure with different
          average probing rates.
</li>
<li>Every comparison must be repeated several times based on
          different measurement data to avoid random indications of
          compatibility (or the lack of it).
</li>
<li>To minimize the influence of implementation options on the
          result, metric implementations SHOULD use identical options and
          parameters for the metric under evaluation.
</li>
<li>The implementation with the lowest probing frequency determines
          the smallest temporal interval for which samples can be
          compared.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The metric specifications themselves are the primary focus of
      evaluation, rather than the implementations of metrics. The
      documentation produced by the advancement process should identify which
      metric definitions and supporting material were found to be clearly
      worded and unambiguous, OR, it should identify ways in which the metric
      specification text should be revised to achieve clarity and unified
      interpretation.
</p>
<p>The process should also permit identification of options that were
      not implemented, so that they can be removed from the advancing
      specification (this is an aspect more typical of protocol advancement
      along the standards track).
</p>
<p>Note that this document does not propose to base interoperability
      indications of performance metric implementations on comparisons of
      individual singletons. Individual singletons may be impacted by many
      statistical effects while they are measured. Comparing two singletons of
      different implementations may result in failures with higher probability
      than comparing samples.

Verification of conformance to a metric specification</h3>

<p>This section specifies how to verify compliance of two or more IPPM
      implementations against a metric specification. This document only
      proposes a general methodology. Compliance criteria to a specific metric
      implementation need to be defined for each individual metric
      specification. The only exception is the statistical test comparing two
      metric implementations which are simultaneously tested. This test is
      applicable without metric specific decision criteria.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Tests of an individual implementation against a metric specification</h3>

<p>A metric implementation MUST support the requirements classified as
        "MUST" and "REQUIRED" of the related metric specification to be
        compliant to the latter.
</p>
<p>Further, supported options of a metric implementation SHOULD be
        documented in sufficient detail. The documentation of chosen options
        is RECOMMENDED to minimise (and recognise) differences in the test
        setup if two metric implementations are compared. Further, this
        documentation is used to validate and improve the underlying metric
        specification option, to remove options which saw no implementation or
        which are badly specified from the metric specification to be promoted
        to a standard. This documentation SHOULD be made for all
        implementation relevant specifications of a metric picked for a
        comparison, which aren't explicitly marked as "MUST" or "REQUIRED" in
        the metric specification. This applies for the following sections of
        all metric specifications:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Singleton Definition of the Metric.
</li>
<li>Sample Definition of the Metric.
</li>
<li>Statistics Definition of the Metric. As statistics are compared
            by the test specified here, this documentation is required even in
            the case, that the metric specification does not contain a
            Statistics Definition.
</li>
<li>Timing and Synchronisation related specification (if relevant
            for the Metric).
</li>
<li>Any other technical part present or missing in the metric
            specification, which is relevant for the implementation of the
            Metric.
</li>
</ul>

<p>RFC2330 and RFC2679 emphasise precision as an aim of IPPM metric
        implementations. A single IPPM conformant implementation MUST under
        otherwise identical network conditions produce precise results for
        repeated measurements of the same metric.
</p>
<p>RFC 2330 prefers the "empirical distribution function" EDF to
        describe collections of measurements. RFC 2330 determines, that
        "unless otherwise stated, IPPM goodness-of-fit tests are done using 5%
        significance." The goodness of fit test determines by which precision
        two or more samples of a metric implementation belong to the same
        underlying distribution (of measured network performance events). The
        goodness of fit test to be applied is the <a class='info' href='#ADK'>Anderson-Darling K sample test (ADK sample test, K stands
        for the number of samples to be compared)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scholz, F. and M. Stephens, &ldquo;K-sample Anderson-Darling Tests of fit, for continuous and           discrete cases,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1986.</span><span>)</span></a> [ADK]. Please note that
        RFC 2330 and RFC 2679 apply an Anderson Darling goodness of fit test
        too.
</p>
<p>The results of a repeated test with a single implementation MUST
        pass an ADK sample test with confidence level of 95%. The resolution
        for which the ADK test has been passed with the specified confidence
        level MUST be documented. To formulate this differently: The
        requirement is to document the smallest resolution, at which the
        results of the tested metric implementation pass an ADK test with a
        confidence level of 95%. The minimum resolution available in the
        reported results from each implementation MUST be taken into account
        in the ADK test.

Test setup resulting in identical live network testing conditions</h3>

<p>Two major issues complicate tests for metric compliance across live
        networks under identical testing conditions. One is the general point
        that metric definition implementations cannot be conveniently examined
        in field measurement scenarios. The other one is more broadly
        described as "parallelism in devices and networks", including
        mechanisms like those that achieve load balancing (<a class='info' href='#RFC4928'>see<span> (</span><span class='info'>Swallow, G., Bryant, S., and L. Andersson, &ldquo;Avoiding Equal Cost Multipath Treatment in MPLS Networks,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4928]).
</p>
<p>This section proposes two measures to deal with both issues.
        Tunneling mechanisms can be used to avoid parallel processing of
        different flows in the network. Measuring by separate parallel probe
        flows results in repeated collection of data. If both measures are
        combined, WAN network conditions are identical for a number of
        independent measurement flows, no matter what the network conditions
        are in detail.
</p>
<p>Any measurement setup MUST be made to avoid the probing traffic
        itself to impede the metric measurement. The created measurement load
        MUST NOT result in congestion at the access link connecting the
        measurement implementation to the WAN. The created measurement load
        MUST NOT overload the measurement implementation itself, eg. by
        causing a high CPU load or by creating imprecisions due to internal
        transmit (receive respectively) probe packet collisions.
</p>
<p>Tunneling multiple flows reaching a network element on a single
        physical port may allow to transmit all packets of the tunnel via the
        same path. Applying tunnels to avoid undesired influence of standard
        routing for measurement purposes is a concept known from literature,
        see e.g. <a class='info' href='#GU+Duffield'>GRE encapsulated multicast
        probing<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gu, Y., Duffield, N., Breslau, L., and S. Sen, &ldquo;GRE Encapsulated Multicast Probing: A Scalable Technique for           Measuring One-Way Loss,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [GU+Duffield]. An existing IP in IP tunnel protocol can be applied to
        avoid Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing of different measurement
        streams if it meets the following criteria:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Inner IP packets from different measurement implementations are
            mapped into a single tunnel with single outer IP origin and
            destination address as well as origing and destination port
            numbers which are identical for all packets.
</li>
<li>An easily accessible commodity tunneling protocol allows to
            carry out a metric test from more test sites.
</li>
<li>A low operational overhead may enable a broader audience to set
            up a metric test with the desired properties.
</li>
<li>The tunneling protocol should be reliable and stable in set up
            and operation to avoid disturbances or influence on the test
            results.
</li>
<li>The tunneling protocol should not incurr any extra cost for
            those interested in setting up a metric test.
</li>
</ul>

<p>If tunneling is applied, two tunnels MUST carry all test traffic in
        between the test site and the remote site. For example, if 802.1Q
        Ethernet Virtual LANs (VLAN) are applied and the measurement streams
        are carried in different VLANs, the IP tunnel or Pseudo Wires
        respectively MUST be set up in physical port mode to avoid set up of
        Pseudo Wires per VLAN (which may see different paths due to ECMP
        routing), see RFC 4448. The remote router and the Ethernet switch
        shown in figure 2 must support 802.1Q in this set up.
</p>
<p>The IP packet size of the metric implementation SHOULD be chosen
        small enough to avoid fragmentation due to the added Ethernet and
        tunnel headers. Otherwise, the impact of tunnel overhead on
        fragmentation and interface MTU size MUST be understood and taken into
        account (see <a class='info' href='#RFC4459'>[RFC4459]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Savola, P., &ldquo;MTU and Fragmentation Issues with In-the-Network Tunneling,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>An Ethernet port mode IP tunnel carrying several 802.1Q VLANs each
        containing measurement traffic of a single measurement system was set

</p>
<p>The following headers may have to be accounted for when calculating
        total packet length, if VLANs and Ethernet over L2TPv3 tunnels are
        applied:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Ethernet 802.1Q: 22 Byte.
</li>
<li>L2TPv3 Header: 4-16 Byte for L2TPv3 data messages over IP;
            16-28 Byte for L2TPv3 data messages over UDP.
</li>
<li>IPv4 Header (outer IP header): 20 Byte.
</li>
<li>MPLS Labels may be added by a carrier. Each MPLS Label has a
            length of 4 Bytes. By the time of writing, between 1 and 4 Labels
            seems to be a fair guess of what's expectable.
</li>
</ul>

        issue with this solution, MPLS interfaces are mostly found in the

        are met.
</p>
<p>Each test is repeated several times. WAN conditions may change over
        time. Sequential testing is desirable, but may not be a useful metric
        test option. It is RECOMMENDED that tests be carried out by
        establishing N different parallel measurement flows. Two or three
        linecards per implementation serving to send or receive measurement
        flows should be sufficient to create 5 or more parallel measurement
        flows. If three linecards are used, each card sends and receives 2
        flows. Other options are to separate flows by DiffServ marks (without
        deploying any QoS in the inner or outer tunnel) or using a single CBR
        flow and evaluating every n-th singleton to belong to a specific
        measurement flow.

            to characterise measured metrics of a time-interval, at least 5
            singletons of a relevant metric SHOULD be present to ensure a
            minimum confidence into the reported value (see <a class='info' href='#Rule of thumb'>Wikipedia on confidence<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hardy, M., &ldquo;Confidence interval,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [Rule of thumb]). Note that
            this criterion also is to be respected e.g. when comparing packet
            loss metrics. Any packet loss measurement interval to be compared
            with the results of another implementation SHOULD contain at least
            five lost packets to have a minimum confidence that the observed
            loss rate wasn't caused by a small number of random packet
            drops.
</li>
<li>The minimum number of singletons or samples to be compared by
            an Anderson-Darling test SHOULD be 100 per tested metric
            implementation. Note that the Anderson-Darling test detects small
            differences in distributions fairly well and will fail for high
            number of compared results (RFC2330 mentions an example with 8192
            measurements where an Anderson-Darling test always failed).
</li>
<li>Generally, the Anderson-Darling test is sensitive to
            differences in the accuracy or bias associated with varying
            implementations or test conditions. These dissimilarities may
            result in differing averages of samples to be compared. An example
            may be different packet sizes, resulting in a constant delay
            difference between compared samples. Therefore samples to be
            compared by an Anderson Darling test MAY be calibrated by the
            difference of the average values of the samples. Any calibration
            of this kind MUST be documented in the test result.
</li>

Tests of two or more different implementations against a metric specification</h3>

<p>RFC2330 expects "a methodology for a given metric [to] exhibit
        continuity if, for small variations in conditions, it results in small
        variations in the resulting measurements. Slightly more precisely, for
        every positive epsilon, there exists a positive delta, such that if
        two sets of conditions are within delta of each other, then the
        resulting measurements will be within epsilon of each other." A small
        variation in conditions in the context of the metric test proposed
        here can be seen as different implementations measuring the same
        metric along the same path.
</p>
<p>IPPM metric specification however allow for implementor options to
        the largest possible degree. It can't be expected that two
        implementors pick identical options for the implementations.
        Implementors SHOULD to the highest degree possible pick the same
        configurations for their systems when comparing their implementations
        by a metric test.
</p>
<p>In some cases, a goodness of fit test may not be possible or show
        disappointing results. To clarify the difficulties arising from
        different implementation options, the individual options picked for
        every compared implementation SHOULD be documented in sufficient
        detail. Based on this documentation, the underlying metric
        specification should be improved before it is promoted to a
        standard.
</p>
<p>The same statistical test as applicable to quantify precision of a
        single metric implementation MUST be passed to compare metric
        conformance of different implementations. To document compatibility,
        the smallest measurement resolution at which the compared
        implementations passed the ADK sample test MUST be documented.
</p>
<p>For different implementations of the same metric, "variations in
        conditions" are reasonably expected. The ADK test comparing samples of
        the different implementations may result in a lower precision than the
        test for precision of each implementation individually.

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Clock synchronisation</h3>

<p>Clock synchronization effects require special attention. Accuracy
        of one-way active delay measurements for any metrics implementation
        depends on clock synchronization between the source and destination of
        tests. Ideally, one-way active delay measurement (<a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>RFC 2679,<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2679]) test endpoints either have direct
        access to independent GPS or CDMA-based time sources or indirect
        access to nearby NTP primary (stratum 1) time sources, equipped with
        GPS receivers. Access to these time sources may not be available at
        all test locations associated with different Internet paths, for a
        variety of reasons out of scope of this document.
</p>
<p>When secondary (stratum 2 and above) time sources are used with NTP
        running across the same network, whose metrics are subject to
        comparative implementation tests, network impairments can affect clock
        synchronization, distort sample one-way values and their interval
        statistics. It is RECOMMENDED to discard sample one-way delay values
        for any implementation, when one of the following reliability
        conditions is met:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Delay is measured and is finite in one direction, but not the
            other.
</li>
<li>Absolute value of the difference between the sum of one-way
            measurements in both directions and round-trip measurement is
            greater than X% of the latter value.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Examination of the second condition requires RTT measurement for
        reference, e.g., based on TWAMP (RFC5357, <a class='info' href='#RFC5357'>RFC
        5357<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hedayat, K., Krzanowski, R., Morton, A., Yum, K., and J. Babiarz, &ldquo;A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5357]), in conjunction with one-way delay measurement.
</p>
<p>Specification of X% to strike a balance between identification of
        unreliable one-way delay samples and misidentification of reliable
        samples under a wide range of Internet path RTTs probably requires
        further study.
</p>
<p>An IPPM compliant metric implementation whose measurement requires
        synchronized clocks is however expected to provide precise measurement
        results. Any IPPM metric implementation SHOULD be of a precision of 1
        ms (+/- 500 us) with a confidence of 95% if the metric is captured
        along an Internet path which is stable and not congested during a
        measurement duration of an hour or more.

<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h3>3.5.&nbsp;
Recommended Metric Verification Measurement Process</h3>

<p>In order to meet their obligations under the IETF Standards Process
        the IESG must be convinced that each metric specification advanced to
        Draft Standard or Internet Standard status is clearly written, that
        there are the required multiple verifiably equivalent implementations,
        and that all options have been implemented.
</p>
<p>In the context of this document, metrics are designed to measure
        some characteristic of a data network. An aim of any metric definition
        should be that it should be specified in a way that can reliably
        measure the specific characteristic in a repeatable way.
</p>
<p>Each metric, statistic or option of those to be validated MUST be
        compared against a reference measurement or another implementation by
        at least 5 different basic data sets, each one with sufficient size to
        reach the specified level of confidence, as specified by this
        document.
</p>
<p>Finally, the metric definitions, embodied in the text of the RFCs,
        are the objects that require evaluation and possible revision in order
        to advance to the next step on the standards track.
</p>
<p>IF two (or more) implementations do not measure an equivalent
        metric as specified by this document,
</p>
<p>AND sources of measurement error do not adequately explain the lack
        of agreement,
</p>
<p>THEN the details of each implementation should be audited along
        with the exact definition text, to determine if there is a lack of
        clarity that has caused the implementations to vary in a way that
        affects the correspondence of the results.
</p>
<p>IF there was a lack of clarity or multiple legitimate
        interpretations of the definition text,
</p>
<p>THEN the text should be modified and the resulting memo proposed
        for consensus and advancement along the standards track.
</p>
<p>Finally, all the findings MUST be documented in a report that can
        support advancement on the standards track, similar to those described
        in <a class='info' href='#RFC5657'>[RFC5657]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dusseault, L. and R. Sparks, &ldquo;Guidance on Interoperation and Implementation Reports for Advancement to Draft Standard,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. The list of measurement devices
        used in testing satisfies the implementation requirement, while the
        test results provide information on the quality of each specification
        in the metric RFC (the surrogate for feature interoperability).
</p>
<p>The complete process of advancing a metric specification to a
        standard as defined by this document is illustrated in <a class='info' href='#Figure 3'>Figure&nbsp;3</a>.

<p>Any recommendation for the advancement of a metric specification
        MUST be accompanied by an implementation report, as is the case with
        all requests for the advancement of IETF specifications. The
        implementation report needs to include the tests performed, the
        applied test setup, the specific metrics in the RFC and reports of the
        tests performed with two or more implementations. The test plan needs
        to specify the precision reached for each measured metric and thus
        define the meaning of "statistically equivalent" for the specific
        metrics being tested.
</p>
<p>Ideally, the test plan would co-evolve with the development of the
        metric, since that's when people have the most context in their
        thinking regarding the different subtleties that can arise.
</p>
<p>In particular, the implementation report MUST as a minimum
        document:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The metric compared and the RFC specifying it. This includes
            statements as required by the section "Tests of an individual
            implementation against a metric specification" of this
            document.
</li>
<li>The measurement configuration and setup.
</li>
<li>A complete specification of the measurement stream (mean rate,
            statistical distribution of packets, packet size or mean packet
            size and their distribution), DSCP and any other measurement
            stream properties which could result in deviating results.
            Deviations in results can be caused also if chosen IP addresses
            and ports of different implementations can result in different
            layer 2 or layer 3 paths due to operation of Equal Cost Multi-Path
            routing in an operational network.
</li>
<li>The duration of each measurement to be used for a metric
            validation, the number of measurement points collected for each
            metric during each measurement interval (i.e. the probe size) and
            the level of confidence derived from this probe size for each
            measurement interval.
</li>
<li>The result of the statistical tests performed for each metric
            validation as required by the section "Tests of two or more
            different implementations against a metric specification" of this
            document.
</li>
<li>A parameterization of laboratory conditions and applied traffic
            and network conditions allowing reproduction of these laboratory
            conditions for readers of the implementation report.
</li>
<li>The documentation helping to improve metric specifications
            defined by this section.
</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the tests for each set SHOULD be run in a test setup as
        specified in the section "Test setup resulting in identical live
        network testing conditions."
</p>
<p>If a different test set up is chosen, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid
        effects falsifying results of validation measurements caused by real
        data networks (like parallelism in devices and networks). Data
        networks may forward packets differently in the case of:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Different packet sizes chosen for different metric
            implementations. A proposed countermeasure is selecting the same
            packet size when validating results of two samples or a sample
            against an original distribution.
</li>
<li>Selection of differing IP addresses and ports used by different
            metric implementations during metric validation tests. If ECMP is
            applied on IP or MPLS level, different paths can result (note that
            it may be impossible to detect an MPLS ECMP path from an IP
            endpoint). A proposed counter measure is to connect the
            measurement equipment to be compared by a NAT device, or
            establishing a single tunnel to transport all measurement traffic
            The aim is to have the same IP addresses and port for all
            measurement packets or to avoid ECMP based local routing diversion
            by using a layer 2 tunnel.
</li>
<li>Different IP options.
</li>
<li>Different DSCP.
</li>
<li>If the N measurements are captured using sequential
            measurements instead of simultaneous ones, then the following
            factors come into play: Time varying paths and load
            conditions.
</li>

Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>In the case that a metric validation requires capturing rare
        events, an impairment generator may have to be added to the test set
        up. Inclusion of an impairment generator and the parameterisation of
        the impairments generated MUST be documented. Rare events could be
        packet duplications, packet loss rates above one digit percentages,
        loss patterns or packet re-ordering and so on.
</p>
<p>As specified above, 5 singletons are the recommended basis to
        minimise interference of random events with the statistical test
        proposed by this document. In the case of ratio measurements (like
        packet loss), the underlying sum of basic events, against the which
        the metric's monitored singletons are "rated", determines the
        resolution of the test. A packet loss statistic with a resolution of
        1% requires one packet loss statistic-datapoint to consist of 500
        delay singletons (of which at least 5 were lost). To compare EDFs on
        packet loss requires one hundred such statistics per flow. That means,
        all in all at least 50 000 delay singletons are required per single
        measurement flow. Live network packet loss is assumed to be present
        during main traffic hours only. Let this interval be 5 hours. The
        required minimum rate of a single measurement flow in that case is 2.8
        packets/sec (assuming a loss of 1% during 5 hours). If this
        measurement is too demanding under live network conditions, an
        impairment generator should be used.

<p>One-way Delay, Loss threshold, RFC 2679
</p>
<p>This test determines if implementations use the same configured
        maximum waiting time delay from one measurement to another under
        different delay conditions, and correctly declare packets arriving in
        excess of the waiting time threshold as lost. See Section 3.5 of
        RFC2679, 3rd bullet point and also Section 3.8.2 of RFC2679.

            to be declared lost, and that all packets that arrive successfully
            in step 2 are assigned a valid one-way delay.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>One-way Delay, First-bit to Last bit, RFC 2679
</p>
<p>This test determines if implementations register the same relative
        increase in delay from one measurement to another under different
        delay conditions. This test tends to cancel the sources of error which
        may be present in an implementation. See Section 3.7.2 of RFC2679, and
        Section 10.2 of RFC2330.

<p>Error Calibration, RFC 2679
</p>
<p>This is a simple check to determine if an implementation reports
        the error calibration as required in Section 4.8 of RFC2679. Note that
        the context (Type-P) must also be reported.

Examples related to statistical tests for One-way Delay</h3>

<p>A one way delay measurement may pass an ADK test with a timestamp
        resultion of 1 ms. The same test may fail, if timestamps with a
        resolution of 100 microseconds are eavluated. The implementation then
        is then conforming to the metric specification up to a timestamp
        resolution of 1 ms.
</p>
<p>Let's assume another one way delay measurement comparison between
        implementation 1, probing with a frequency of 2 probes per second and
        implementation 2 probing at a rate of 2 probes every 3 minutes. To
        ensure reasonable confidence in results, sample metrics are calculated
        from at least 5 singletons per compared time interval. This means,
        sample delay values are calculated for each system for identical 6
        minute intervals for the whole test duration. Per 6 minute interval,
        the sample metric is calculated from 720 singletons for implementation
        1 and from 6 singletons for implementation 2. Note, that if outliers
        are not filtered, moving averages are an option for an evaluation too.
        The minimum move of an averaging interval is three minutes in this
        example.
</p>
<p>The data in table 1 may result from measuring One-Way Delay with
        implementation 1 (see column Implemnt_1) and implementation 2 (see
        column implemnt_2). Each data point in the table represents a
        (rounded) average of the sampled delay values per interval. The
        resolution of the clock is one micro-second. The difference in the
        delay values may result eg. from different probe packet sizes.

<p>Average values of sample metrics captured during identical time
        intervals are compared. This excludes random differences caused by
        differing probing intervals or differing temporal distance of
        singletons resulting from their Poisson distributed sending times.
</p>
<p>In the example, 20 values have been picked (note that at least 100
        values are recommended for a single run of a real test). Data must be
        ordered by ascending rank. The data of Implemnt_1 and Implemnt_2 as
        shown in the first two columns of table 1 clearly fails an ADK test
        with 95% confidence.
</p>
<p>The results of Implemnt_2 are now reduced by difference of the
        averages of column 2 (rounded to 6581 us) and column 1 (rounded to
        5029 us), which is 1552 us. The result may be found in column 3 of
        table 1. Comparing column 1 and column 3 of the table by an ADK test
        shows, that the data contained in these columns passes an ADK tests
        with 95% confidence.
