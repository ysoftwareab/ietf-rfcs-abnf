Abstract

   This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for information centric
   networks. Moving the focus from "nodes" to "information objects"
   raises scalability issue because aggregation of flat name for objects
   is not easy task and the number of addressable information objects is
   so huge than the IP address space. For scalable routing, we propose
   hierarchically-organized domain architecture. A domain is a "logical
   group" of information objects and each domain has its own ID. The
   concatenation of domain IDs from top level domain to the current
   domain plays the role of "locator". Thus, we can get scalable routing
   table and it is more scalable by means of "topology reduction". More
   challenging issue is name-based forwarding. It is hard to aggregate
   forwarding table due to flat name space, therefore we propose
   "reactive path setup".

Internet-Draft      Scalable Domain-based Routing       February 20144


1. Introduction

   ICN routing locates a data object based on its name which is
   initially provided by a requestor. Currently, the Internet is
   addressing on the order of 10^9 nodes, whereas the number of
   addressable ICN objects is expected to be several orders of magnitude
   higher [ICNRG charter]. Therefore, it raises scalability issues in
   routing based on locator and forwarding based on name.

   ICN routing may comprise 3 steps: a name resolution step, a discovery
   step, and a delivery step [ICN challenges]. Name resolution step is
   not the main concern of this memo, but scalable routing in discovery
   and forwarding in delivery are mainly described.

   In this memo we propose hierarchically-organized domain architecture
   with topology reduction for scalable routing, and reactive path setup
   for scalable forwarding.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

3. Terminologies

   o Domain: a logical group of "information objects" which have
      similar characteristics (E.g. geographical region, same type of
      contents, similar category of contents etc.) or "other domains".

   o Domain Gateway: a border gateway for a domain. This domain gateway
      exchanges or filters LSAs (Link-State Advertisement) for domain-
      based routing, and forwards control messages or data object to the
      next-hop domain gateway.

                    Figure 1 Sample domain architecture

   In this scheme we compose network as a set of domains, and each of
   which may be further decomposed into smaller domains recursively. A
   domain is a logical group of information objects which have similar
   characteristics or other sub-domains. Figure 1 shows an example of

   domain architecture. In our scheme contents server itself is also a
   domain (see US server, Canada server, and Asia server)

4.1.1. Locator

   Each domain has its own ID (domain Id) and a concatenation of domain
   IDs from top level domain to the current domain plays the role of
   "locator". (E.g. locator for domain North America is 0x0A:0x0B:0x0C).

4.2. Name-Locator Mapping System (NLMS) (name resolution step)

   Name resolution step is done by querying locator mapped to a name to
   the NLMS. For fast processing we use bloom filter technique. NLMS is
   composed as a form of tree. More detailed structure is out of scope
   of this memo (it will be written as another I-D).

4.3. Domain-based Routing

   Each domain gateway (including contents server, of course) runs
   "modified link-state routing protocol". Each LSA transfers "locator"
   instead of IP prefix. Thus, locator appears in destination field and
   IP address of a domain gateway takes next-hop field of routing table
   entries.

   Unlike existing link-state routing protocol, each domain gateway
   forwards LSA to the other domain according to the following filtering
   rule:

   o LSAs in tier N domain are forwarded to all domain gateways which
      belong to tier N

   o LSAs in tier N-1 are injected to tier N

   o LSAs in tier N+1 are filtered, LSA which only includes aggregated
      locator is injected to tier N instead. (E.g. GW #2 delivers LSA
      which includes 0x0A:0x0B:0x0C)

   This results in topology reduction effect. Therefore, each domain
   gateway would have topology graph which is as reduced as possible in
   its current position.

5. Name-based Forwarding (discovery step)

   As we described earlier it is very difficult to aggregate flat names.
   Thus we chose "reactive path setup" for scalability of forwarding
   table.

   Detailed procedure of reactive path setup is as follows:

   1. A user issues request for certain named content. This request is
      forwarded to the default domain gateway ("GW #1" in Figure 1).

   2. If the default gateway receives the request from user, it checks
      there is any forwarding cache entry matching with the name. If
      there is any, it forwards the request to the next-hop domain
      gateway according to the found forwarding cache.

   3. If there is none, it queries current locator for the name to the
      NLMS. After getting the locator for the name, the domain gateway
      looks up its routing table entry matching the locator. Finally a
      forwarding cache for the name is made by using next-hop
      information of found routing table entry. If this is the first
      domain gateway which doesn't have forwarding cache for the name,
      the domain gateway keeps user request for a while and sends "path
      discovery message" including "locator". This will reduce
      unnecessary NLMS lookup.

   The forwarding cache is managed in "reactive" manner. Unused cache
   entries for certain time will be removed immediately.

6. Delivery step

   Once user request arrives at the contents server, it can send data
   object to the source address of request.

7. Security Considerations

   TBD.
