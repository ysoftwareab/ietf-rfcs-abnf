Internet-Draft       IPv6 Multicast over IEEE 802.16           June 2006


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 networks support mobile stations (MSs) to access
   broadband wireless networks while moving at vehicular speed
   [IEEE802.16e].  However, IEEE 802.16 networks do not provide link
   layer native multicast capability because of point-to-multipoint
   connection characteristic [IEEE802.16].  This feature restricts the
   adoption of protocols or applications that need IPv6 multicast
   capability.  One of the prominent ways to solve the multicast support
   problem is to use the built-in LAN emulation feature of IEEE 802.16
   which is based on Convergence Sublayer [I-D.jee-16ng-ps-goals].

   There is several previous work which was focused on the transport of
   link local scope multicast packets over IEEE 802.16 network
   [I-D.jeon-ipv6-ndp-ieee802.16] [I-D.jang-16ng-llm].  However, the
   IPv6 multicast service requires not only the delivery of link local
   scope multicast packets, but also the delivery of non-link local
   scope multicast packets such as site local or global scope multicast
   packets.  Since it is not clear that which subnet models would be
   used in IEEE 802.16 networks, we consider the transport of IPv6
   multicast packets over various subnet models proposed in [I-D.ietf-
   v6ops-802-16-deployment-scenarios].

   This memo describes how the IPv6 multicast packets with various scope
   can be delivered over four different types of subnet models.

1.1.  Assumption and Scope

   This document describes how to provide IPv6 CS based IPv6 multicast
   packets delivery over IEEE 802.16 networks.  We will consider
   Ethernet CS based IPv6 multicast packet transport in the later
   version of this document.

   We classify the IPv6 multicast packet into link local scope and non-
   link local scope multicast packet.  Node-local scope multicast packet
   is not considered in this memo.  When a BS is separated from an
   access router (AR), we assume that the BS is connected to the AR via
   Ethernet.  If Ethernet is not used between the BS and the AR,
   tunneling may be used to apply our proposed approaches.

   Our approaches are based on the use of multicast CID (mCID) to
   distinguish between multicast and unicast packets, and to deliver the
   multicast packets.  This memo presents mCID based transport of IPv6
   multicast packet not only link local scope, but also non-link local
   scope.  The initialization or distribution of mCID is not covered in
   this document, but we may guess that the mCID will be initialized
   during the establishment phase of host IPv6 connectivity.

1.2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   In this memo, a link local multicast packet indicates a multicast
   packet with link local scope such as NS, RA, and so on.  A non-link
   local multicast packet means that the scope of the packet is neither
   node local nor link local.  The non-link local multicast packet also
   includes a multicast data packet.

   Terminology in this document follows that in [I-D.jee-16ng-ps-goals],
   with the addition of a new terminology given here:

   o  mCID (multicast CID) : CID for IPv6 multicast packet transport

2.  Brief Description of Subnet Models

   The relationship between a BS and an AR induces several IPv6 subnet
   models in IEEE 802.16 networks.  This document describes the
   transport of IPv6 multicast packets with IPv6 CS over each subnet
   models proposed in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-802-16-deployment-scenarios].  We
   may deduce following four IPv6 subnet models from the IPv6 prefix
   assignment methods and the relationship between the AR and the BS.

3.  Subnet Model A

   In this section, we discuss the transport of IPv6 multicast packets
   over the 'Subnet Model A' shown in Figure 2 where a BS is separated
   from an AR and a subnet consists of single AR, multiple BSs, and
   multiple MSs.  This scenario covers the current celluar-like
   deployment models such as WiMax and WiBro.

          +-----+       |

   Figure 2: Subnet Model A

3.1.  Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 2, when the BS1 receives a multicast packet which was
   originated from the MS1, the BS1 multicasts the packet onto its
   downlinks by using mCID.  After then, BS1 converts the IEEE 802.16
   MAC frame format to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame and transmits the frame
   into the link connected to the AR.  The BS2 which is on the same link
   as the BS1, receives the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame sent from the BS1
   and examines the IPv6 destination address.  If the destination
   address is a multicast address, the BS2 multicasts the received
   packet to its downlinks with predefined mCID.

   When the AR receives the IPv6 multicast packet transmitted by BS1, it
   investigates the scope of the IPv6 multicast destination address.  If
   the multicast packet is destined to itself (i.e., link local scope
   multicast packet), the AR processes the multicast packet.  If the
   multicast packet has non-link local scope, the AR performs the
   multicast routing table lookup and forwards the received multicast
   packet according to the lookup result.

3.2.  Multicast Packet from AR or Other Subnets

   When the AR receives an IPv6 multicast packet from the edge router,
   it looks up the multicast routing table and checks whether there

   exists a receiver of the multicast packet in the AR's subnet.  If
   there is a receiver, the AR sends the packet to the BSs in the
   downlinks.  Each BS in the AR's subnet receives the multicast packet
   sent from the AR and multicasts the packet to its downlinks by using
   mCID.

   In case of a link local multicast packet originated from the AR, the
   BSs in the AR's subnet transmits the received multicast packet to
   their downlinks with mCID

4.  Subnet Model B

   In this section, we discuss the transport of IPv6 multicast packets
   over the 'Subnet Model B' depicted in the Figure 3 where a BS is
   separated from an AR, and a subnet consists of multiple BSs and
   multiple MSs.  This scenario covers the hot-zone deployment model in
   IEEE 802.11.

                                             <---> IP termination

   Figure 3: Subnet Model B

4.1.  Multicast Packet from MS

   In the Figure 3, when the BS1 receives a multicast packet originated
   from the MS1, the BS1 multicasts the packet onto its downlinks by
   using mCID.  After then, the BS1 transmits the packet into the link
   connected to ARs through IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame.  The BS2 which is
   on the same link as the BS1, receives the IPv6 multicast packet sent
   from BS1 and multicasts the packet to its downlinks with predefined
   mCID.

   When an AR receives an IPv6 multicast packet transmitted by BSs, it
   follows the same procedure as Subnet Model A scenario except that
   both the AR1 and the AR2 simultaneously receive the link local scope
   multicast packet.  In case of non-link local scope multicast packet,
   the AR1 and the AR2 look up their own multicast routing table and
   forward the received multicast packet according to the lookup result.

4.2.  Multicast Packet from AR or Other Subnets

   The operation of the BSs and the ARs in this case follows the same
   procedure as Subnet Model A scenario except that there are two ARs in
   the network and these ARs have their own multicast routing tables.

5.  Subnet Model C

   When a BS and an AR are integrated in a same box, there exist two
   cases of IPv6 prefix allocation method.  The one is to assign an IPv6
   prefix to each BS/AR box and the other is to allocate an IPv6 prefix
   to each MS, similar to 3GPP scenario [RFC 3314].

   In this section, we discuss the delivery of IPv6 multicast packets
   over 'Subnet Model C' shown in Figure 4 where a BS is integrated with
   an AR, composing one box, and a subnet consisting of only single
   BS/AR and multiple MSs.

          +-----+
          | MS1 |<------+
          +-----+       |
          +-----+       |    +-------+         +--------+
          | MS2 |<------+--->|BS/AR1 |---------| Edge   |    ISP
          +-----+            +-------+         | Router +==>Network
                                               +--------+
          +-----+            +-------+           |
          | MS3 |<---------->|BS/AR2 |-----------+
          +-----+            +-------+
                                        <---> IP termination

   Figure 4: Subnet Model C

5.1.  Multicast Packet from MS

   After the BS/AR1 receiving a multicast packet from the MS1, the BS/
   AR1 transmits the received packet to its downlinks by using mCID.  If
   the multicast packet is destined to itself (i.e., link local scope
   multicast packet), the BS/AR1 processes the multicast packet.

   In case of a non-link local multicast packet, the BS/AR1 looks up the
   multicast routing table and forwards the packet to the Edge Router
   according to the lookup result.  The packet forwarded by the BS/AR1
   is delivered to the BS/AR2 or the Edge Router by means of
   conventional IPv6 multicast packet transport procedure.

5.2.  Multicast Packet from BS/AR or Other Subnets

   When the BS/AR1 needs to send a multicast packet to MSs in its
   subnet, the BS/AR1 transmits the packet to its downlinks with mCID.

   When the BS/AR1 receives a multicast packet from Edge Router, it
   looks up the multicast routing table and checks whether the packet is
   destined to its subnet.  If there exists a receiver in the subnet,
   the BS/AR1 sends the packet to its downlinks by using mCID.

6.  Subnet Model D

   In this section, we discuss the delivery of IPv6 multicast packets
   over 'Subnet Model D' depicted in Figure 5 where a BS is integrated
   with an AR, composing one box in view of implementation.  In this
   subnet model, each subnet consists of single BS/AR and only one MS.
   Thus, each MS has a unique IPv6 prefix.  This scenario is similar to
   3GPP scenario [RFC 3314].

          +-----+
          | MS1 |<-------------+
          +-----+              v
          +-----+            +-------+         +--------+
          | MS2 |<---------->|BS/AR1 |---------| Edge   |    ISP
          +-----+            +-------+         | Router +==>Network
                                               +--------+
          +-----+            +-------+           |
          | MS3 |<---------->|BS/AR2 |-----------+
          +-----+            +-------+
                                        <---> IP termination

   Figure 5: Subnet Model D

6.1.  Multicast Packet from MS

   If the BS/AR1 receives a link local multicast packet from the MS1,
   the BS/AR1 has only to process the received multicast packet.

   In case of a non-link local multicast packet, the BS/AR1 looks up the
   multicast routing table and forwards the packet to the Edge Router
   according to the lookup result.  Then, the packet will follow a
   conventional IPv6 multicast packet transport procedure.

6.2.  Multicast Packet from BS/AR or Other Subnets

   When the BS/AR1 needs to send a multicast packet to MSs in its
   subnet, the BS/AR1 transmits the packet to its downlink by using
   either mCID or unicast CID.

   When the BS/AR1 receives a multicast packet from Edge Router, it
   looks up the multicast routing table and checks whether the packet is
   destined to its own subnet.  If there exists a receiver in the
   subnet, the BS/AR1 sends the packet to its downlink by using wither
   mCID or unicast CID.

7.  Considerations about mCID Format

   The allocation of mCID to IPv6 multicast packets needs to be
   considered in IEEE.  However, in this memo, we present a candidate.

7.1.  IPv6 scope-based mCID Format

   This section specifies a modification to the CID format as follows.


         |               11             | 1 |     4    |
         +------------------------------+---+----------+
         |          mCID prefix         | CS|   scop   |
         +------------------------------+---+----------+


   Figure 6: IPv6 Scope based mCID Format

   mCID consists of mCID prefix, CS, and scope field. mCID prefix is
   used to indicate that a multicast packet is embedded in IEEE 802.16
   frame.  CS field implies that whether IPv6 CS or Ethernet CS is used
   to encapsulate the IPv6 packet.  CS field with its value 1 implies
   that IPv6 CS is used and scope field be set to the same value as the
   scope field of encapsulated IPv6 destination address.  CS field with
   its value 0 indicates that Ethernet CS is used and scope field be set
   to the same value as the scope field of encapsulated IPv6 destination
   address.
