1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document assumes readers are familiar with the terms and
   concepts that are used in [RFC7252] and [I-D.ietf-ace-usecases].

2.  Background

   The ACE WG, as per their charter, is in the process of defining use
   cases to drive the specification of standardized solutions for
   authentication and authorization to enable authorized access (Get,
   Put, Post, Delete) to resources identified by a URI and hosted on a
   resource server in constrained environments.  As a starting point,
   the WG will assume that access to resources at a resource server by a
   client device takes place using CoAP and is protected by DTLS
   ([RFC7252]).  Both resource server and client may be constrained.
   This access will be mediated by an authorization server, which is not
   considered to be constrained.

3.  Public Safety Use Case

   A Fire Department requires that as part of the building safety code,
   that the building have sensors that sense the level of smoke, heat,
   Etc., when a fire breaks out.  These sensors report metrics which are
   then used by a back-end server to map safe areas and un-safe areas
   within a building and also possibly the structural integrity of the
   building before fire-fighters may enter it.  Sensors may also be used
   to track where human/animal activity is within the building.  This
   will allow people stuck within the building to be guided to safer
   areas and suggest possible actions that they make take (e.g. using a
   client application on their phones, or loudspeaker directions) in

   order to bring them to safety.  In certain cases, other organizations
   such as the Police, Ambulance, and federal organizations are also
   involved and therefore the co-ordination of tasks between the various
   entities have to be carried out using efficient messaging and
   authorization mechanisms.

4.  Authorization Problem Summary

   1.  The principal wants to ensure that only authorized clients can
   read data from sensors and send commands to the actuators.

   2.  The principal wants to be able to grant access rights dynamically
   when needed.  This may be triggered where the Principal may be human
   or machine (server/cloud system).

   3.  The principal wants to ensure the authenticity of the data
   originating from the sensors (authenticating the originator of data).

   4.  The principal wants to ensure the Integrity of the received data.

   5.  The principal wants to ensure that data sent to the actuators are
   Integrity protected.

   6.  The principal wants to ensure that extremely time-sensitive
   operations have to be carried out in a quick manner.

   7.  The principal wants to ensure the ability to prove that an entity
   (e.g. police or fire chief) that issued a message had indeed issued
   the message (authenticating the sender of the message).

   8.  The principal wants to ensure that all the messaging and data
   involved during a crisis is audit-able in a transparent manner.

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The entire draft is regarding a security use case related to
   authentication and authorization for constrained environments.
