                   draft-yang-alto-http2-transport-00

Abstract

   The ALTO base protocol and ALTO/SSE are based on HTTP/1.x, and they
   introduce complexities to address limitations of HTTP/1.x.  The
   deployment of HTTP/2 allows this document to design ALTO/H2, which
   benefits from the additional capabilities of HTTP/2 to provide
   services for ALTO.

1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a means for
   network applications to obtain network status information.  The ALTO
   base protocol [RFC7285] is based on the sequential request and
   response model of HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230]; hence, in the base protocol, an
   ALTO client only can issue a sequence of requests on network
   information resources, and the ALTO server sends the information
   resources one-by-one, in the order of the request sequence.  To
   address the use cases where an ALTO client may need to efficiently
   monitor changes to a set of network information resources and the
   protocol is still based on the HTTP/1.1 model, the ALTO Working Group
   introduces ALTO/SSE (ALTO Incremental Update based on Server-Sent-
   Event) [RFC8895], so that an ALTO client can manage (i.e., add and
   remove) a set of requests maintained at an ALTO server, and the
   server can continuously, concurrently, and incrementally push updates
   whenever a monitored network information resource changes.  ALTO/SSE
   can be considered a more general protocol of the ALTO base protocol
   to transport network information.  Figure 1. shows the architecture
   and message flow of ALTO/SSE.

             Figure 1: ALTO SSE Architecture and Message Flow.

   With the wide deployment of newer HTTP (e.g., HTTP/2 [RFC7540]), this
   document specifies ALTO transport based on HTTP/2, referred to as
   ALTO/H2.  The newer transport can provide multiple benefits:

   o  ALTO based on HTTP/2 natively supports multiple concurrent
      requests pending at the server, realizing a main design goal of
      ALTO SSE.  At the same time, instead of using two TCP connections
      (a control channel and a data channel) as ALTO/SSE does, ALTO
      based on HTTP/2 can use a single TCP connection, achieving a
      design with only one connection.

   o  ALTO based on HTTP/2 can take advantage of the benefit provided by
      HTTP/2 to avoid head-of-line blocking in the data channel,
      reducing latency.

   o  ALTO based on HTTP/2 can take advantage of other benefits of
      HTTP/2, including potentially higher encoding efficiency and
      stronger enforcement of security (i.e., using https).

2.  ALTO/H2 Design Overview

   There are multiple design points.

   o  First, how to transport incremental update messages to a monitored
      resource (e.g., in a single HTTP/2 stream or each update uses a
      unique HTTP/2 stream)?  Since there is sequential dependency among
      the incremental updates to a single information resource, there is
      no concurrency gain in separating them into different streams.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Transport Using HTTP/2             July 2021


      Creating multiple streams, on the other hand, has overhead.
      Hence, ALTO/H2 uses a single HTTP/2 stream to carry the
      incremental updates to each monitored request.  An implication of
      the preceding design is that to allow flexibility, ALTO/SSE allows
      different types of incremental update encodings (e.g., merge patch
      vs JSON patch), and hence ALTO/H2 needs to solve the same problem:
      it needs a header layer above HTTP/2 to indicate the media type of
      each incremental update.

   o  Second, how to distinguish between an ALTO service that sends a
      one-shot response and one that sends incremental updates.  Instead
      of introducing ALTO/H2 to completely replace the ALTO base
      protocol [RFC7285] and ALTO/SSE [RFC8895], ALTO/H2 can run in
      parallel with them, to support incremental deployment.  A single
      ALTO server can provide multiple resources in its IRD, and an
      ALTO/H2 resource is indicated in the ALTO IRD, consistent with
      ALTO base protocol and ALTO/SSE.

3.  ALTO/H2 Information Resource Directory (IRD)

   Extending the IRD example in Section 8.1 of [RFC8895], Figure 2 is
   the IRD of an ALTO server supporting ALTO base protocol, ALTO/SSE,
   and ALTO/H2.

   Note that it is straightforward for an ALTO sever to run HTTP/2 and
   support concurrent retrieval of multiple resources such as "my-
   network-map" and "my-routingcost-map" using multiple HTTP/2 streams
   with the need to introducing ALTO/H2.

   The resource "update-my-costs-h2" provides an ALTO/H2 based
   connection, and this is indicated by the media-type "application/
   alto-h2".  For an ALTO/H2 connection, the client can send in a
   sequence of control requests using media type application/alto-
   updatestreamparams+json.  The server creates HTTP/2 streams and
   pushes updates to the client.

4.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [RFC7285].

5.  ALTO based on HTTP/3 Considerations

   One consideration of the ALTO/H2 design is the pending deployment of
   HTTP3.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to register the alto-h2 media type under ALTO registry
   as defined in [RFC7285].
