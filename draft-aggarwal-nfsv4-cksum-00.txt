2.  Introduction

   The standard NFS protocol (without Kerberos) has historically relied
   on the underlying transport for data integrity and it itself does not
   make an attempt to ensure data integrity.  Kerberised NFS provides
   data integrity via the use of krb5i.

   Version 4 of the Network File System (NFSv4) protocol specification
   [RFC3530] employs TCP and Ethernet as it's underlying transport
   mechanism and it relies on these protocols to provide data integrity.
   In order to ensure data integrity, TCP uses a one's complement of 16-
   bit integers as it's standard checksum.  It's a weak checksum in that
   it's not resilient to certain single bit errors as well as data re-
   arrangement and thus cannot be relied upon it's error detection
   capabilities.  Ethernet, on the other hand, uses a relatively strong
   checksum in the form of CRC32.  However, this checksum is not end-to-
   end and is computed at every hop thus rendering the protection rather
   weak.

   Given that the underlying transports don't provide enough protection,
   the NFSv4 protocol (when deployed without Kerberos) needs to add it's
   own data integrity mechanisms in order to ensure sane data.  Much
   like other transport protocols, implementing checksums at the NFSv4
   layer is an obvious choice.

   Checksums for NFSv4 might be implemented for the entire NFS payload
   or a part of the payload.  This document proposes extensions to NFSv4
   that might provide for a way to implement checksums for the READ/
   WRITE data portion of NFSv4 payload.

3.  Checksum Extensions

3.1.  Checksum Algorithm Negotiation

   In order for the client and server to checksum the data, they need to
   arrive at a common checksum algorithm that both sides will use to
   compute the checksum values.  This can be accomplished by having the
   client query the server for it's preferences at the time of mounting
   the filesystem.  The server's preferences will serve as a hint for
   the client as to what algorithm might be appropriate.

   If it has been a priori determined that the server supports
   checksums, the client will now add an extra operation, CKINFO, to the
   mount compound.  The server will respond with a list of checksum
   algorithms it supports, in the order of preference.  Given the
   server's preferences and it's own preferences, the client will
   determine which algorithms to use.  If the client determines that it
   cannot support any of the algorithms supported by the server, it must
   settle on using the "none" algorithm.  That is, it must turn off
   checksumming.

   The checksum algorithm will need to be renegotiated incase of
   failover events, migration events and while crossing server
   boundaries.

3.2.  Checksumming the READs and the WRITEs

   After the algorithm preferences have been determined, all READ and
   WRITE operations should be checksummed using the CKSUM operation.  In
   the case of a read, CKSUM should succeed READ and in the case of a
   write, CKSUM should precede WRITE.

      algorithms

                      uint32_t     alg_bits;
                 };

                 typedef struct cksum_algs4 {
                      uint32_t     alg_len;
                      cksum_alg4   alg_val<>;
                 };

                 struct CKINFO4resok {
                      cksum_algs4  cksum_algs;
                 };

                 union CKINFO4res switch (nfsstat4 status) {
                 case NFS4_OK:
                      CKINFO4resok resok4;
                 default:
                      void;
                 };

   DESCRIPTION

      The CKINFO operation is added in the mount compound by the client
      to gather a list of checksum algorithm preferences that the server
      may have.  The server responds by returning a list of algorithms
      it supports in the order of preference.

      The client should compute the intersection of algorithms supported
      by the server and itself.

   IMPLEMENTATION

      The client gathers checksum preferences at mount time.  The
      preferences are essentially treated as hints as to which
      algorithms may be best suited for future READ or WRITE operations
      for a given file system.

      If a server implementation supports finer grained checksumming
      such as per-file based checksums, the preferences may often be
      invalid.  In such cases, the CKSUM operation (See Section 3.4)
      will allow for the flexibility to enable per-file based checksums.

                           void;
                   };

   DESCRIPTION

      The CKSUM operation carries checksum value computed using the
      algorithm specified in cksum_alg.  It also specifies the client's
      preferences in cksum_alg_pref.  This operation is not intended to
      be used as a standalone operation, rather in conjunction with the
      READ or the WRITE operation.

      When used with READ operation, this operation should follow the
      READ.  The client must set the checksum value to 0 to indicate
      that a checksum wasn't computed because CKSUM is being compounded
      with READ.  The client should also set the checksum algorithm it
      prefers in cksum_alg and it's list of preferences in
      cksum_alg_pref.

      If the server supports the requested checksum algorithm, it
      computes a checksum, over the READ data, using that algorithm.  It
      also indicates it's preferences (if different from the client's)
      by setting the cksum_alg_pref.

      If the server doesn't support the requested algorithm (say, it
      implements per-file checksums), it should compute the checksum
      using one of the algorithms in cksum_alg_pref and indicate the
      checksum algorithm used by setting cksum_alg as well as updating
      the cksum_alg_pref in the results.  If the server is not able to
      support any of the algorithms out of cksum_alg_pref, it should
      indicate that by setting the sub-status to NFS4ERR_WRONGALG.  The
      server may also consider specifying it's preferences via
      cksum_alg_pref.

      The client should verify the checksum by computing a checksum over
      the READ data using the algorithm specified in cksum_alg.

Internet-Draft      Extensions to NFSv4 for Checksums      February 2006


      When used with the WRITE operation, CKSUM should precede the
      WRITE.  The client must compute the checksum over the WRITE data
      and set cksum_alg to the algorithm that was used to compute the
      checksum.  It may also set indicate it's algorithm preferences via
      cksum_alg_pref.

      The server must verify the checksum value by computing a checksum
      over the WRITE data using the algorithm specified in cksum_alg.
      If the checksum value matches, it should indicate success by
      setting the status to NFS4_OK.  If the checksum value matches but
      the checksum algorithm, different than the one specified in
      cksum_alg, is more suitable, it may be indicated by setting the
      cksum_alg_pref.

      If the checksum verification failed due to incorrect checksum, the
      server will set the status to NFS4ERR_WRONGCKSUM.  If the checksum
      verification failed due to inability to support a particular
      checksum algorithm, the server should indicate that by returning
      an NFS4ERR_WRONGALG and optionally setting the cksum_alg_pref.  If
      the checksum verification failed due to an internal error, the
      server should set the status to NFS4ERR_CKSUM.

   IMPLEMENTATION

      On a READ or a WRITE, if the client believes it wants to read the
      data or write it regardless of the capabilities of the server, it
      may specify that by specifying the "none" algorithm in it's
      preferences.  The server should honour this by successfully
      reading or writing the data without checksumming.

      In the case of a READ, if the checksum verification on the client
      side fails, it's most beneficial for the client to retry the READ
      atleast once in order to rule out transient errors.

      Likewise for a WRITE, if the checksum verification on the server
      fails, it's most beneficial for the client to retry the WRITE
      atleast once in order to rule out transient errors.

   ERRORS

3.5.  Checksum Algorithm Considerations

   If the client and the server support checksums, they should support
   atleast one of the recommended algorithms.  Taking a cue from some of
   the other newer protocols like SCTP and iSCSI, CRC32 is likely a good
   candidate for a recommended algorithm.  The "none" algorithm must

Internet-Draft      Extensions to NFSv4 for Checksums      February 2006


   also be included as a recommended algorithm.

   It is expected that the client and server may also support algorithms
   beyond the recommended set of algorithms.

   Algorithm names must not contain an at-sign("@"), a comma (",") or
   whitespace or control characters.  The algorithm names are case-
   sensitive, and should not be longer than 256 characters [TBD: Is
   there value in providing algorithm names longer than 256 characters]

   User defined algorithms must be defined using names in the format
   name@userdomainname, e.g., "ourchecksum@sun.com".  All the rules from
   above, except the use of the at-sign ("@") apply to user defined
   algorithms.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The CKINFO and CKSUM operations carry algorithm numbers rather than
   carrying algorithm strings over the wire.  This makes implementations
   easier as it eliminates the need for tedious string comparisons on
   the client.

   The constraint this brings about is that now there needs to be an
   agreement on which algorithm numbers correspond to which algorithm
   names.  An IANA registry will need to be created to manage the
   algorithm namespace.

5.  Checksum Futures

   This document proposes integrity protection for only the READ and
   WRITE data between the client and the server.  The rest of the
   operations in the NFSv4 compound will not be protected.  A natural
   extension to this document would be to enhance the checksum
   operations to enable protection for the entire NFSv4 compound.  This
   may or may not be akin to the krb5i protection.
