1. Introduction 

   DSN[1],the abbreviation of Distributed Services Network, is a new 
   question being standardized in ITU-T proposed by China Mobile. The 
   first DSN conference was held on January 11th to 23rd,2009 in ITU-T 
   SG13 plenary meeting in Geneva. Two work items, DSN scenarios[2] and 
   requirements[3] of DSN capabilities were approved to set up in 
   current stage. In ITU-T DSN is defined as the evolution of NGN which 
   uses distributed technologies such as P2P to rebuild the core network 
   with lower CAPEX/OPEX and more flexible application support to suit 
   with mobile Internet and FMC development. Therefore it's important to 
   introduce DSN in related STDs like IETF and 3GPP to accelerate 
   NGN/NGI development. PPSP can be used in DSN for p2p streaming 
   applications.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

2.1. DSN 

   DSN is the evolution of NGN driven by p2p technology which provides  
   distributed, operatable  and  managable characteristics to  support  
   more carrier's grade rich multimedia services beyond current NGN 
   scope. 

2.2. Core node 

   Core node refers to the DSN node deployed in service provider domain, 
   e.g. DSL/Wireless access and aggregation network, IP/MPLS core, etc. 

2.3. User node 

   User node refers to the DSN node in user domain, e.g. PCs, mobile 
   terminals, etc.  

3. DSN architecture 

   DSN focuses on overlay network layer, which may belong to 
   application-layer in ISO/OSI model. The traditional Internet is a 
   dumbbell structure, which places most of the intelligence in the 
   terminal system and leaves the network as simple as possible. Along 
   with overlay network introduced in the migration of internet, it 
   stresses more intelligence in the middle of the network. To make it 
   clear for designers, we divide this layer into several sub-layers as 
   follows:

Internet-Draft  Introduction of Distributed Services Network                                                                  March 2009 
    

   technology, different p2p system inter-working and distributed 
   management functions to monitor the p2p system running condition and 
   individual nodes. 

   The third is service enabler sub-layer, which is the basic components 
   to develop applications. They can also be used jointly. For    
   example, VoIP uses distributed relay module and streaming uses 
   distributed cache and storage module where gaming uses both. 

   Atop is application sub-layer where DSN operators open API to expose 
   network capability to both self-run applications and 3rd applications. 

4. DSN Scenarios[4] 

   DSN applies the P2P technology to provide operators with reduced 
   CAPEX/OPEX, improved scalability/ubiquity, self 
   organization/maintenance and fault tolerance. 

   DSN enables the core architecture of wireless Internet with the 
   combination of P2P technology and other distributed technologies. 
   With DSN, carriers are able to build scalable telecom network 
   platform that deliver multimedia applications and content 
   applications. In DSN application system, the following services are 
   enabled: 

4.1. Service Scenarios 

4.1.1. Multimedia telephony services 

   With DSN, carriers can build cost effective and large scale MMTel 
   service system. 

   Compared with existing MMTel system, DSN's service control node is 
   named as core node who collaborate with each other in a peer to peer 
   paradigm. There is no central server for session processing. 

   Core Nodes compose of a P2P overlay which has its own addressing and 
   routing mechanisms. Users are registered in different Core Nodes in 
   the P2P overlay. Core Nodes communicate with each other by exchanging 
   the application routing information.  

   Since there is no central server, a single node failure will not 
   cause system failure. When parts of the nodes are not available in 
   the system, other nodes can continue to provide services as an entire 
   system with the organization of P2P technology without any impact 
   from the unavailable hosts.

Internet-Draft  Introduction of Distributed Services Network                                                                  March 2009 
    

   It is unnecessary to configure the added hosts specifically, instead 
   it only requires that the application layer supports P2P related 
   protocols in the system, and the system will be expanded 
   automatically. All the application layer addressing and routing 
   information are communicated by P2P protocols without manual 
   configuration. And system capacity can be enlarged by adding new Core 
   Nodes even by using user equipment as it can also runs Core Node 
   functions. 

   In a complicated IP environment, end to end QoS is hard to realize 
   because congestion may happen along the media path, "Best of effort" 
   feature may ignores the service requirements of real-time 
   applications such as MMTel. With DSN, a peer acting as a relay node 
   can be inserted to the media path to enhance the performance of real-
   time service. The relay mechanism can also provides good NAT traverse 
   capability, which allows users to access high quality service after 
   NAT. 

4.1.2. Streaming services 

   Streaming services become more and more popular in current Internet. 
   Conventional C/S model suffers from performance bottleneck and poor 
   scalability when the number of streaming service subscribers keeps 
   growing. Operators thus would have to maintain the service quality by 
   deploying more and more streaming servers, which increases their 
   CAPEX/OPEX of the network. While in P2P mode, each user acts as a 
   peer that not only downloads the streaming content but uploads the 
   content to other users, thus effectively reduce the burden of 
   streaming server and improve the scalability of streaming service. 

   Streaming across different network domains may cause increased 
   network traffic where a network domain usually means a subnetwork 
   with peers having the vicinity in network topology (e.g. same LAN, 
   same service PoP). Therefore, it is important for DSN to realize 
   traffic localization. 

4.1.3. Content distribution service 

   DSN enables very large data storage and content delivery with the 
   help of p2p overlay distribution network. In P2P-enabled system, 
   network resources are distributed across peer nodes. Users can 
   provide and obtain resources and data simultaneously. Such features 
   make it easier for very large data storage. For carriers, these 
   features allow maximization of edge network resources and reduce the 
   load of the server. For users, the new technology provides a richer 
   resource and a faster resource-sharing channel.

   The Content distribution network  based on DSN should closely combine 
   with underlying routing and the transmission mechanism to realize the 
   optimization of traffic. 

4.1.4. Large-scale High Bandwidth Multi-media Service  

   Bandwidth exhausting multimedia service in the future may become the 
   killer application. However it has higher requirements on the network 
   bandwidth and node processing capability. These applications have 
   very high requirements on the carrier network: Presence system 
   requires 3-10M network bandwidth, less than 100ms delay, and 10ms 
   jitter, and also have high requirement on route setup process as well 
   as QoS. DSN intelligent routing mechanism provides routing function 
   for the system, and provides QoS guarantee for large capacity 
   multimedia service on the basis of P2P bandwidth aggregation 
   capability. 

4.2. Carrier Deployment Scenarios 

   For the real deployment of DSN, it can be classed into private 
   network-based deployment and Internet-based deployment for different 
   applications from the perspective of carriers. 

4.2.1. Carrier private network-based Deployment 

   Carriers can deploy DSN in the mode of private network. Private 
   network deployment means deploying DSN on the carrier's private 
   network, e.g. IP private network of China Mobile. DSN serving modes 
   are deployed on the private network of carrier, which can NOT be 
   accesses from Internet. They deliver services in a trusted 
   environment, and DSN network will provide the required high security 
   and manageability. This deployment mode, however, only optimizes the 
   serving nodes of its owns compared with the deployment in Internet 
   environment, without maximizing the resources in Internet environment. 
   Private network-based DSN can provide traditional telecom service, 
   including basic voice/video call, supplementary services, value-added 
   service and IM communication, it also provides service interface for 
   future new services (e.g. VoIP service, content delivery, real-time 
   file download and large-capacity multimedia service etc.) with 
   enhanced service capability. Private network-based DSN can interact 
   with traditional telecommunication networks via gateway. 

4.2.2. Internet Deployment 

   In this mode, DSN node can be deployed over Internet, or services 
   provided by DSN node can be accessed from Internet. DSN node on 
   Internet includes the equipment of carrier and also a large number of

   user nodes on the Internet. The sufficient resources of Internet can 
   be better utilized, which will drive the carrier to reduce the 
   network deployment cost. In addition, DSN allows the diversity of 
   services. With the service interface provided by carriers,  a number 
   of practical service modes will emerge in the open Internet 
   environment. However, a lot of DSN service nodes on the Internet may 
   be the users nodes, whose security and stability can not be 
   guaranteed, and increase the difficulty to control and manage network. 
   Internet-based DSN can help carriers converge Internet service and 
   address the service mode shift from voice to data. Internet-based DSN 
   can also interact with traditional telecommunication networks via 
   gateway. 

5. Relationship between DSN and PPSP 

   As shown in last section, p2p streaming and other content services 
   are important types in DSN. Therefore we need a uniform p2p streaming 
   protocol run among core nodes and user nodes. It can also be used 
   when there are multiple DSN implementations which can be inter-worked 
   each other for streaming service. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The motivation of this draft is to introduce Distributed Service 
   Network (DSN). We don't consider security issues in this draft.
