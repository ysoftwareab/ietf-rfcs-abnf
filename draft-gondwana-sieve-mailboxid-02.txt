              Sieve Email Filtering: delivery by mailboxid
                   draft-gondwana-sieve-mailboxid-02

Abstract

   The OBJECTID capability of the IMAP protocol (I-D.ietf-extra-imap-
   objectid) allows clients to identify mailboxes by a unique identifier
   which survives rename.  In contrast, the Sieve mail filtering
   language (RFC 5228) currently has no such capability.  This memo
   defines a Sieve extension that fills this gap: it adds a method for
   specifying the unique identifier of a mailbox as a target for
   fileinto rules, and a method for testing the existence of a mailbox
   by its unique identifier.

1.  Introduction

   Sieve rules are sometimes created using graphical interfaces which
   allow users to select the mailbox to be used as a target for a rule.
   If that mailbox is renamed, the client may also update its internal
   representation of the rule and update the sieve script to match,
   however this is a multi-step process and subject to partial failures.
   Also, if the folder is renamed by a different mechanism (e.g. another
   IMAP client) the rules will get out of sync.

   By extending "fileinto" to reference an immutable mailboxid, sieve
   rules can continue to target the same mailbox, regardless of how it
   gets renamed.

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                   June 2020


3.  Sieve capability string

   The server advertises the capability "mailboxid", and scripts which
   use the following extensions MUST explicitly request the capability
   "mailboxid".

   Example:

   require "mailboxid";

4.  Argument ":mailboxid" to Command "fileinto"

   Normally, the "fileinto" command delivers the message in the mailbox
   specified using its positional mailbox argument.  However, if the
   optional ":mailboxid" argument is also specified, the "fileinto"
   command first checks whether a mailbox exists in the user's personal
   namespace [RFC2342] with the specified [I-D.ietf-extra-imap-objectid]
   MAILBOXID.  If that is the case, that mailbox is used for delivery
   instead.  If there is no such mailbox, the "fileinto" action proceeds
   as it would without the ":mailboxid" argument.

   The tagged argument ":mailboxid" to fileinto consumes one additional
   token, a string with the objectid of the mailbox to file into.

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";

   if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
       fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
                "INBOX.harassment";
   }

4.1.  Interaction with "mailbox" extension

   For servers which also support the [RFC5490] mailbox extension, the
   ":create" modifier to fileinto does not create mailbox with the
   specified mailboxid, however it may be specified and interacts as
   normal with all other extensions.

   Example:

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                   June 2020


   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";
   require "mailbox";

   fileinto :mailboxid "Fnosuch"
            :create
            "INBOX.no-such-folder";
               # creates INBOX.no-such-folder, but it doesn't
               # get the "Fnosuch" mailboxid.

4.2.  Interaction with "specialuse" extension

   For servers which also support [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use], if
   a fileinto command has both ":mailboxid" and ":special-use"
   specified, then the mailboxid is resolved first.  If the mailboxid
   does not exist, then the special-use is evaluated next following the
   process specified in [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use] - this
   includes processing of [RFC5490] ":create" tags to add the special-
   use on creation.

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";
   require "special-use";
   if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
       fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
                :specialuse "\\Junk"
                "INBOX.harassment";
   }

   Example:

   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";
   require "mailbox";
   require "special-use";

   fileinto :mailboxid "F1234567"
            :specialuse "\\Archive"
            :create
            "INBOX.Archive";
               # creates INBOX.Archive with use \Archive but
               # with a different mailboxid.

4.3.  Interaction with "fcc" extension

   This document extends the definition of the :fcc argument so that it
   can optionally be used with the ":mailboxid" argument.

   FCC =/ [":mailboxid" <mailboxid: string>]

   If the optional ":mailboxid" argument is specified with ":fcc", it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to check whether a mailbox exists
   with the specific mailboxid.  If such a mailbox exists, the generated
   message is filed into that mailbox.  Otherwise, the generated message
   is filed into the ":fcc" target mailbox.

   Example:

   require ["enotify", "fcc", "mailboxid"];
   notify :fcc "INBOX.Sent"
          :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
          :message "You got mail!"
          "mailto:ken@example.com";

5.  Test ":mailboxidexists"

   The "mailboxidexists" test is true if all mailboxes listed in the
   "mailboxids" argument exist in the mailstore, and each allows the
   user in whose context the Sieve script runs to "deliver" messages
   into it.  When the mailstore is an IMAP server, "delivery" of
   messages is possible if:

   a) the READ-WRITE response code is present for the mailbox (see
   Section 7.1 of [RFC3501]), if IMAP Access Control List (ACL)
   [RFC4314] is not supported by the server, or

   b) the user has 'p' or 'i' rights for the mailbox (see Section 5.2 of
   [RFC4314]).

   Note that a successful "mailboxidexists" test for a mailbox doesn't
   necessarily mean that a "fileinto :mailboxid" action on this mailbox
   would succeed.  For example, the "fileinto" action might put user
   over quota.  The "mailboxidexists" only verifies existence of the
   mailbox and whether the user in whose context the Sieve script runs
   has permissions to execute "fileinto" on it.

   Example:

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                   June 2020


   require "fileinto";
   require "mailboxid";

   if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
       if mailboxidexists "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3" {
           fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3"
                               "INBOX.harassment";
       } else {
           fileinto "INBOX.harassment";
       }
   }

   Not to implementers: this test behaves identically to the
   "mailboxexists" test defined in [RFC5490] but operates on mailboxids
   rather than mailbox names.

6.  Formal Syntax

   test /= ":mailboxidexists" string-list

   tag /= ":mailboxid" string

   If [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-fcc] is supported:

   FCC =/ [":mailboxid" <mailboxid: string>]

7.  Security considerations

   Because mailboxid is always generated by the server, implementations
   MUST NOT allow sieve to make an endrun around this protection by
   creating mailboxes with the specified ID by using ":create" and
   ":mailboxid" in a fileinto rule for a non-existant mailbox.

   Implementers are referred to the security considerations sections of
   those documents in [RFC5228], [I-D.ietf-extra-imap-objectid].

8.  IANA considerations

   IANA are requested to add a capability to the sieve-extensions
   registry:

   Is there a more explicit way to update the grammar?  It seems less
   fully specified than IMAP.
