1.  Introduction

   This document presents a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module defining
   identities, typedefs, and groupings useful to cryptographic
   applications.

1.1.  Relation to other RFCs

   This document presents one or more YANG modules [RFC7950] that are
   part of a collection of RFCs that work together to define
   configuration modules for clients and servers of both the NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocols.

   The modules have been defined in a modular fashion to enable their
   use by other efforts, some of which are known to be in progress at
   the time of this writing, with many more expected to be defined in
   time.

   The relationship between the various RFCs in the collection is
   presented in the below diagram.  The labels in the diagram represent
   the primary purpose provided by each RFC.  Links the each RFC are
   provided below the diagram.

1.2.  Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Adherence to the NMDA

   This document in compliant with the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  It does not define any protocol
   accessible nodes that are "config false".

2.  The "ietf-crypto-types" Module

   This section defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module that defines data
   types (typedefs and identities) and groupings supporting downstream
   models needing cryptographic primitives.

2.1.  Data Model Overview

2.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-crypt-types" module:

   Features:
     +-- one-symmetric-key-format
     +-- one-asymmetric-key-format
     +-- encrypted-one-symmetric-key-format
     +-- encrypted-one-asymmetric-key-format
     +-- certificate-signing-request-generation

2.1.2.  Identities

   The following diagram illustrates the relationship amongst the
   "identity" statements defined in the "ietf-crypto-types" module:

Internet-DrafYANG Data Types and Groupings for Cryptography    July 2020


   Identities:
     +-- public-key-format
     |  +-- subject-public-key-info-format
     |  +-- ssh-public-key-format
     +-- private-key-format
     |  +-- rsa-private-key-format
     |  +-- ec-private-key-format
     |  +-- one-asymmetric-key-format
     |  |         {one-asymmetric-key-format}?
     |  +-- encrypted-one-asymmetric-key-format
     |            {encrypted-one-asymmetric-key-format}?
     +-- symmetric-key-format
        +-- octet-string-key-format
        +-- one-symmetric-key-format
        |         {one-symmetric-key-format}?
        +-- encrypted-one-symmetric-key-format
                  {encrypted-one-symmetric-key-format}?

   Comments:

   *  The diagram shows that there are three base identities.  These
      identities are used by this module to define the format that key
      data is encoded in.  The base identities are "abstract", in the
      object orientied programming sense, in that they only define a
      "class" of formats, rather than a specific format.

   *  The various derived identities define specific key encoding
      formats.  The derived identities defined in this document are
      sufficient for the effort described in Section 1.1 but, by nature
      of them being identities, additional derived identities MAY be
      defined by future efforts.

   *  Identities use to specify uncommon formats are enabled by
      "feature" statements, enabling applications to support them when
      needed.

2.1.3.  Typedefs

   The following diagram illustrates the relationship amongst the
   "typedef" statements defined in the "ietf-crypto-types" module:











Watsen                   Expires 9 January 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-DrafYANG Data Types and Groupings for Cryptography    July 2020


   Typedefs:
     binary
       +-- csr-info
       +-- csr
       +-- x509
       |  +-- trust-anchor-cert-x509
       |  +-- end-entity-cert-x509
       +-- crl
       +-- ocsp-request
       +-- ocsp-response
       +-- cms
          +-- data-content-cms
          +-- signed-data-cms
          |  +-- trust-anchor-cert-cms
          |  +-- end-entity-cert-cms
          +-- enveloped-data-cms
          +-- digested-data-cms
          +-- encrypted-data-cms
          +-- authenticated-data-cms

   Comments:

   *  All of the typedefs defined in the "ietf-crypto-types" module
      extend the "binary" type defined in [RFC7950].

   *  Additionally, all the typedefs define a type for encoding an ASN.1
      [ITU.X680.2015] structure using DER [ITU.X690.2015].

   *  The "trust-anchor-*" and "end-entity-*" typedefs are syntactically
      identical to their base typedefs and only distiguish themselves by
      the expected nature of their content.  These typedefs are defined
      to facilitate common modeling needs.

2.1.4.  Groupings

   The following diagram lists all the "grouping" statements defined in
   the "ietf-crypto-types" module:

   Groupings:
     +-- encrypted-key-value-grouping
     +-- symmetric-key-grouping
     +-- public-key-grouping
     +-- asymmetric-key-pair-grouping
     +-- trust-anchor-cert-grouping
     +-- end-entity-cert-grouping
     +-- generate-csr-grouping
     +-- asymmetric-key-pair-with-cert-grouping
     +-- asymmetric-key-pair-with-certs-grouping

Internet-DrafYANG Data Types and Groupings for Cryptography    July 2020


   Each of these groupings are presented in the following subsections.

2.1.4.1.  The "encrypted-key-value-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "encrypted-key-
   value-grouping" grouping:

     grouping encrypted-key-value-grouping
       +-- encrypted-by
       +-- encrypted-value    binary

   Comments:

   *  The "encrypted-by" node is an empty container (difficult to see in
      the diagram) that a consuming module MUST augment key references
      into.  The "ietf-crypto-types" module is unable to populate this
      container as the module only defines groupings.  Section 2.2.1
      presents an example illustrating a consuming module populating the
      "encrypted-by" container.

   *  The "encrypted-value" node is the key, encrypted by the other key
      referenced by the "encrypted-by" node, encoded in the format
      specified by the "format" identity Section 2.1.2 associated with
      the ancestor node using this grouping.

2.1.4.2.  The "symmetric-key-grouping" Grouping

   This section presents two tree diagrams [RFC8340] illustrating the
   "symmetric-key-grouping" grouping.  The first tree diagram does not
   expand the internally used grouping statement(s):

     grouping symmetric-key-grouping
       +-- key-format?            identityref
       +-- (key-type)
          +--:(key)
          |  +-- key?             binary
          +--:(hidden-key)
          |  +-- hidden-key?      empty
          +--:(encrypted-key)
             +-- encrypted-key
                +---u encrypted-key-value-grouping

   The following tree diagram expands the internally used grouping
   statement(s), enabling the grouping's full structure to be seen:

Internet-DrafYANG Data Types and Groupings for Cryptography    July 2020


     grouping symmetric-key-grouping
       +-- key-format?            identityref
       +-- (key-type)
          +--:(key)
          |  +-- key?             binary
          +--:(hidden-key)
          |  +-- hidden-key?      empty
          +--:(encrypted-key)
             +-- encrypted-key
                +-- encrypted-by
                +-- encrypted-value    binary

   Comments:

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "encrypted-key-value-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.4.1.

   *  The "key-format" node is an identity-reference to the "symmetric-
      key-format" abstract base identity discussed in Section 2.1.2,
      enabling the symmetric key to be encoded using the format defined
      by any of the derived identities.

   *  The "choice" statement enables the private key data to be plain-
      text, encrypted, or hidden, as follows:

      -  The "key" node can encode any plain-text key value.
      -  The "hidden-key" node is of type "empty" as the real value
         cannot be presented via the management interface.
      -  The "encrypted-key" node's structure is discussed in
         Section 2.1.4.1.

2.1.4.3.  The "public-key-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "public-key-
   grouping" grouping:

     grouping public-key-grouping
       +-- public-key-format    identityref
       +-- public-key           binary

   Comments:

   *  The "public-key-format" node is an identity-reference to the
      "public-key-format" abstract base identity discussed in
      Section 2.1.2, enabling the public key to be encoded using the
      format defined by any of the derived identities.

Internet-DrafYANG Data Types and Groupings for Cryptography    July 2020


   *  The "public-key" node is the public key data in the selected
      format.  No "choice" statement is used to hide or encrypt the
      public key data because it is unecessary to do so for public keys.

2.1.4.4.  The "asymmetric-key-pair-grouping" Grouping

   This section presents two tree diagrams [RFC8340] illustrating the

   *  The "private-key-format" node is an identity-reference to the
      "private-key-format" abstract base identity discussed in
      Section 2.1.2, enabling the private key to be encoded using the
      format defined by any of the derived identities.

   *  The "choice" statement enables the private key data to be plain-
      text, encrypted, or hidden, as follows:

      -  The "private-key" node can encode any plain-text key value.
      -  The "hidden-private-key" node is of type "empty" as the real
         value cannot be presented via the management interface.
      -  The "encrypted-private-key" node's structure is discussed in
         Section 2.1.4.1.

2.1.4.5.  The "certificate-expiration-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "certificate-
   expiration-grouping" grouping:

     grouping certificate-expiration-grouping
       +---n certificate-expiration
          +-- expiration-date    yang:date-and-time

   Comments:

   *  This grouping's only purpose is to define the "certificate-
      expiration" notification statement, used by the groupings defined
      in Section 2.1.4.6 and Section 2.1.4.7.

   *  The "certificate-expiration" notification enables servers to
      notify clients when certificates are nearing expiration.

   *  The "expiration-date" node indicates when the designated
      certificate will (or did) expire.

   *  Identification of the certificate that is expiring is built into
      the notification itself.  For an example, please see
      Section 2.2.3.

2.1.4.6.  The "trust-anchor-cert-grouping" Grouping

   This section presents two tree diagrams [RFC8340] illustrating the

   Comments:

   *  This grouping's only purpose is to define the "generate-
      certificate-signing-request" action statement, used by the
      groupings defined in Section 2.1.4.9 and Section 2.1.4.10.

   *  This action takes as input a "csr-info" type and returns a "csr"

2.1.5.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-crypto-types" module does not contain any protocol-
   accessible nodes, but the module needs to be "implemented", as
   described in Section 5.6.5 of [RFC7950], in order for the identities
   in Section 2.1.2 to be defined.

2.2.  Example Usage

2.2.1.  The "symmetric-key-grouping" and "asymmetric-key-pair-with-
        certs-grouping" Grouping

   The following non-normative module is constructed in order to
   illustrate the use of the "symmetric-key-grouping" (Section 2.1.4.2)
   and the "asymmetric-key-pair-with-certs-grouping" (Section 2.1.4.10)
   grouping statements:

3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  No Support for CRMF

   This document uses PKCS #10 [RFC2986] for the "generate-certificate-
   signing-request" action.  The use of Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF) [RFC4211] was considered, but is was unclear if there
   was market demand for it.  If it is desired to support CRMF in the
   future, a backwards compatible solution can be defined at that time.

3.2.  No Support for Key Generation

   Early revisions of this document included "rpc" statements for
   generating symmetric and asymmetric keys.  There statements were
   removed due to an inability to obtain consensus for how to identify
   the key-algorithm to use.  Thusly, the solution presented in this
   document only supports keys to be configured via an external client,
   which does not support Security best practice.

3.3.  Deletion of Cleartext Key Values

   This module defines storage for cleartext key values that SHOULD be
   zeroized when deleted, so as to prevent the remnants of their
   persisted storage locations from being analyzed in any meaningful
   way.

   The cleartext key nodes are the "key" node defined in the "symmetric-
   key-grouping" grouping (Section 2.1.4.2) and the "private-key" node
   defined in the "asymmetric-key-pair-grouping" grouping
   ("Section 2.1.4.4).

3.4.  The "ietf-crypto-types" YANG Module

   The YANG module in this document defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   Some of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  The "key" node:

         The cleartext "key" node defined in the "symmetric-key-
         grouping" grouping is additionally sensitive to read operations
         such that, in normal use cases, it should never be returned to
         a client.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
         all" has been applied to it.

   *  The "private-key" node:

         The cleartext "private-key" node defined in the "asymmetric-
         key-pair-grouping" grouping is additionally sensitive to read
         operations such that, in normal use cases, it should never be
         returned to a client.  For this reason, the NACM extension
         "default-deny-all" has been applied.

   All of the writable data nodes defined by all the groupings defined
   in this module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For instance, even the modification of a
   public key or a certificate can dramatically alter the implemented
   security policy.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
   write" has been applied to all the data nodes defined in the module.

   Some of the operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  generate-certificate-signing-request:

         This "action" statement SHOULD only be executed by authorized
         users.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-all"
         has been applied.  Note that NACM uses "default-deny-all" to
         protect "RPC" and "action" statements; it does not define,
         e.g., an extension called "default-deny-execute".

         For this action, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations assert
         channel binding [RFC5056], so as to ensure that the application
         layer that sent the request is the same as the device
         authenticated when the secure transport layer was established.

   *  Clarified in asymmetric-key-pair-with-certs-grouping, in
      certificates/certificate/name/description, that if the name MUST
      NOT match the name of a certificate that exists independently in
      <operational>, enabling certs installed by the manufacturer (e.g.,
      an IDevID).

A.4.  02 to 03

   *  renamed base identity 'asymmetric-key-encryption-algorithm' to
      'asymmetric-key-algorithm'.

   *  added new 'asymmetric-key-algorithm' identities for secp192r1,

   *  removed 'mac-algorithm' identities for mac-aes-128-ccm, mac-aes-
      192-ccm, mac-aes-256-ccm, mac-aes-128-gcm, mac-aes-192-gcm, mac-
      aes-256-gcm, and mac-chacha20-poly1305.

   *  for all -cbc and -ctr identities, renamed base identity
      'symmetric-key-encryption-algorithm' to 'encryption-algorithm'.

   *  for all -ccm and -gcm identities, renamed base identity
      'symmetric-key-encryption-algorithm' to 'encryption-and-mac-
      algorithm' and renamed the identity to remove the "enc-" prefix.

   *  for all the 'signature-algorithm' based identities, renamed from
      'rsa-*' to 'rsassa-*'.

   *  removed all of the "x509v3-" prefixed 'signature-algorithm' based
      identities.

   *  added 'key-exchange-algorithm' based identities for 'rsaes-oaep'
      and 'rsaes-pkcs1-v1_5'.

   *  renamed typedef 'symmetric-key-encryption-algorithm-ref' to

A.5.  03 to 04

   *  ran YANG module through formatter.

A.6.  04 to 05

   *  fixed broken symlink causing reformatted YANG module to not show.

A.7.  05 to 06

   *  Added NACM annotations.

   *  Updated Security Considerations section.

   *  Added 'asymmetric-key-pair-with-cert-grouping' grouping.

   *  Removed text from 'permanently-hidden' enum regarding such keys
      not being backed up or restored.

   *  Updated the boilerplate text in module-level "description"
      statement to match copyeditor convention.

   *  Added an explanation to the 'public-key-grouping' and 'asymmetric-
      key-pair-grouping' statements as for why the nodes are not
      mandatory (e.g., because they may exist only in <operational>.

   *  Added 'must' expressions to the 'public-key-grouping' and
      'asymmetric-key-pair-grouping' statements ensuring sibling nodes
      are either all exist or do not all exist.

   *  Added an explanation to the 'permanently-hidden' that the value
      cannot be configured directly by clients and servers MUST fail any
      attempt to do so.

   *  Added 'trust-anchor-certs-grouping' and 'end-entity-certs-
      grouping' (the plural form of existing groupings).

   *  Now states that keys created in <operational> by the *-hidden-key
      actions are bound to the lifetime of the parent 'config true'
      node, and that subsequent invocations of either action results in
      a failure.

A.8.  06 to 07

   *  Added clarifications that implementations SHOULD assert that
      configured certificates contain the matching public key.

   *  Replaced the 'generate-hidden-key' and 'install-hidden-key'
      actions with special 'crypt-hash' -like input/output values.

A.9.  07 to 08

   *  Removed the 'generate-key and 'hidden-key' features.

   *  Added grouping symmetric-key-grouping

   *  Modified 'asymmetric-key-pair-grouping' to have a 'choice'
      statement for the keystone module to augment into, as well as
      replacing the 'union' with leafs (having different NACM settings.

A.10.  08 to 09

   *  Converting algorithm from identities to enumerations.

A.11.  09 to 10

   *  All of the below changes are to the algorithm enumerations defined
      in ietf-crypto-types.

   *  Add in support for key exchange over x.25519 and x.448 based on
      RFC 8418.

   *  Add in SHAKE-128, SHAKE-224, SHAKE-256, SHAKE-384 and SHAKE 512

   *  Revise/add in enum of signature algorithm for x25519 and x448

   *  Add in des3-cbc-sha1 for IPSec

   *  Add in sha1-des3-kd for IPSec

   *  Add in definit for rc4-hmac and rc4-hmac-exp.  These two
      algorithms have been deprecated in RFC 8429.  But some existing
      draft in i2nsf may still want to use them.

   *  Add x25519 and x448 curve for asymmetric algorithms

   *  Add signature algorithms ed25519, ed25519-cts, ed25519ph

   *  add signature algorithms ed448, ed448ph

   *  Add in rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 for SSH protocols (rfc8332)

A.12.  10 to 11

   *  Added a "key-format" identity.

   *  Added symmetric keys to the example in Section 2.2.

A.13.  11 to 12

   *  Removed all non-essential (to NC/RC) algorithm types.

   *  Moved remaining algorithm types each into its own module.

   *  Added a 'config false' "algorithms-supported" list to each of the
      algorithm-type modules.

A.14.  12 to 13

   *  Added the four features: "[encrypted-]one-[a]symmetric-key-
      format", each protecting a 'key-format' identity of the same name.

   *  Added 'must' expressions asserting that the 'key-format' leaf
      exists whenever a non-hidden key is specified.

   *  Improved the 'description' statements and added 'reference'
      statements for the 'key-format' identities.

   *  Added a questionable forward reference to "encrypted-*" leafs in a
      couple 'when' expressions.

   *  Did NOT move "config false" alg-supported lists to SSH/TLS drafts.

A.15.  13 to 14

   *  Resolved the "FIXME: forward ref" issue by modulating 'must',
      'when', and 'mandatory' expressions.

   *  Moved the 'generatesymmetric-key' and 'generate-asymmetric-key'
      actions from ietf-keystore to ietf-crypto-types, now as RPCs.

   *  Cleaned up various description statements and removed lingering
      FIXMEs.

   *  Converted the "iana-<alg-type>-algs" YANG modules to IANA
      registries with instructions for how to generate modules from the
      registries, whenever they may be updated.

A.16.  14 to 15

      asymmetric key groupings.

   *  Added 'typedef csr' and 'feature certificate-signing-request-

   *  Updated draft title (refer to "Groupings" too).

   *  Removed 'end-entity-certs-grouping' as it wasn't being used
      anywhere.

   *  Added "csr-info" typedef, to complement the existing "csr"
      typedef.

   *  Expanded "Data Model Overview section(s) [remove "wall" of tree
      diagrams].

   *  Updated the Security Considerations section.
