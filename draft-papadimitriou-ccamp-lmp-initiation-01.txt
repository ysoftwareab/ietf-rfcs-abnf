1. Abstract

   This memo is a companion document to Link Management Protocol [LMP],
   for which it details the FA-LSP Initiation and Bundling process.
   [LMP] protocol is being developed as part of the GMPLS protocol
   suite to control and manage Traffic Engineering (TE) Links. The
   current document extends the LMP capabilities to FA-LSPs enabling
   among other to dynamically configure TE Links (in particular the LSP
   it can serve) between non-adjacent LSRs.

3. Introduction

   The Link Management Protocol [LMP] protocol has demonstrate its
   value in automating Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) operations. This
   protocol is being developed as part of the GMPLS protocol suite to
   control and manage Traffic Engineering (TE) Links (aka link
   bundles). LMP currently consists of four main functions, of which,
   the first two are mandatory and the last two are optional (depending
   on the capabilities provided by the transport plane):

      1. Control channel management
      2. Link property correlation
      3. Link verification
      4. Fault management

   Control channel management is used to establish and maintain control
   channel connectivity between adjacent nodes. As such, this function
   enables the maintenance of the control plane adjacencies. This is
   performed using a Config message exchange followed by a lightweight
   keep-alive message exchange (aka Hello protocol). Link property
   correlation is used to aggregate multiple data links into a single
   TE Link and to synchronize their link properties. Link verification
   is used to verify the physical connectivity of the data bearing
   links and to exchange their identifiers (aka Discovery function).
   Fault management functions include alarm suppression and fault
   localization in both opaque and transparent networks.

   Note: control channel bootstrapping is described in [LMP-BOOT].

4. FA-LSP Initiation and Bundling - Overview

   In this document, we extend the LMP capabilities to enable (FA-)LSP
   initiation and bundling. The usefulness of the proposed mechanism is
   illustrated by the following multiple LSP Regions case description:


   LSR(X) <--------------------- LMP ---------------------> LSR(Y) n+1
     |                                                          |
     |                                                          |
     |                                                          |
   LSR(X) <--LMP--> LSR(1) <--.. LMP ..--> LSR(N) <--LMP--> LSR(Y)  n


   Typically, LSR(1) to LSR(N) belongs to one LSP region (for instance,
   LSC) and the LSPs established through these nodes crosses the LSP
   region boundary at LSR(X) and LSR(Y) that belongs for instance to
   the TDM region (see [MPLS-HIER]). When dealing with non-PSC layers
   the LSP and TE Links are defined as the control plane mapping of the
   transport plane path and section entities (aka trails). Therefore,
   the LSP established at region n appears as a TE link at layer n+1
   and are referred to as a Forwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP).

   Note: such hierarchy is referred to as ôhierarchical TE Linkö when
   the instance of the control plane having raised the LSP at layer n
   is distinct from the one using this link to setup an LSP at layer
   n+1. Corresponding considerations are outside out of the scope of
   this document.

   In this context, the main issues are on one hand related to the TE
   Link assignment performed at layer n while only its sub-components
   may be the object of a FA-LSP setup. Note also that once setup these
   FA-LSPs appear at layer n+1 with the interface switching capability
   having raised these LSPs at layer n. For instance, the triggering of
   an FA-LSP with TDM switching capability is only possible if both
   LSR(X) and LSR(Y) through the TE Links they define with their
   neighboring nodes (i.e. LSR(1) and LSR(N)) give access to an LSC
   switching capability region. Moreover, when an FA is dynamically
   triggered the TE attributes of its FA-LSP are inherited from the
   LSP, which induced its creation.

   On the other hand, the correlation of FAÆs having similar Traffic
   Engineering (TE) attributes can induce the creation of an FA bundle
   (here, in this example between LSR(X) and LSR(Y)) whose number of
   sub-components is at most as large as the number of sub-components
   of the TE Links defined between LSR(X) and LSR(1) and between LSR(N)
   and LSR(Y).

   Note: there is a similarity between this and the context where [LMP-
   WDM] protocol is defined: LSR(X) and LSR(Y) corresponds to OXC and
   LSR(1) to LSR(N) to Optical Line System (OLS); the only exception is
   that in the latter case, one of the LMP neighbor is a non GMPLS-
   capable node.

5. (FA-)LSP Initiation

   (FA-)LSP initiation runs over an LMP adjacency and is invoked each
   time an LSP is setup between a pair of ingress-egress LSR belonging
   to the same LSP region. To initiate an LMP adjacency between these
   nodes at least one bi-directional control channel MUST be activated.
   Once an LMP adjacency has been brought up, LMP session information
   can start between the ingress-egress LSR pair.

   The exact implementation of this control channel is not specified in
   this document. It could be, for example, a dedicated wavelength, an
   Ethernet link, or an IP tunnel defined between LSR(1) ingress and
   LSR(N) egress, or even the overhead bytes of a data-bearing link.
   Rather, a node-wide unique 32-bit non-zero integer control channel
   identifier (CCId) is assigned at each end of the control channel.
   This identifier comes from the same space as the unnumbered
   interface Id.

   The control channel defined between LSR(X) and LSR(Y) is either
   permanently maintained (in this case the control channel is
   explicitly configured) or established on-demand (in this case the
   control channel is dynamically configured and selected). As

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-lmp-initiation-01.txt              June 2002


   described in [LMP] (see Section 3), once a control channel is
   activated between two nodes, the LMP Hello protocol (see [LMP]
   Section 3.2) can be used to maintain control channel connectivity
   between the nodes and to detect control channel failures. This
   protocol is intended to be a lightweight keep-alive mechanism that
   will react to control channel failures rapidly.

   Therefore, FA-LSP initiation can be invoked only after control
   channel setup completion between LSR(X) and LSR(Y) but also between
   LSR(X) and LSR(1) at the head-end (ingress) and between LSR(N) and
   LSR(Y) at the tail-end (egress). Note that the LSR(X) to LSR(Y) LMP
   session can use the same transport medium as the ingress and egress
   LMP sessions (these sessions may be used as entry point). This
   procedure consists of a sequence of LMP message exchanges between
   the ingress LSR(X) and egress LSR(Y) prior to the LSP establishment
   between these end-points. Consequently, when used, the FA-LSP
   initiation MUST be performed before the corresponding LSP is
   established.

   Once the FA-LSP has been initiated, it can be established and the
   created entity (i.e. the FA) used for path computation purposes by
   the upper LSP region as any other TE Link belonging to this region
   (see [MPLS-HIER]).

6. FA-LSP Verification

   After the FA-LSP establishment (see [GMPLS-SIG] and [MPLS-HIER]),
   verification of the newly created Lambda LSP at any time the FA-LSP
   is not in the property correlation process (see Section 6). This
   verification can be performed either using J0 Section Trace byte and
   out-of-band Test Message or in-band 16/64 byte J0 test message as
   described in [LMP]. In the latter case, procedure as described in
   [LMP] is used.

   In the former case, the out-of-band Test message is not transmitted
   using the J0 Section Trace byte i.e., over the data bearer link, but
   is sent over the ingress to egress LSR control channel and
   correlated for consistency to the received J0 pattern.

   In order to get the mapping between the Interface ID over which the
   out-of-band test message is sent and the J0 pattern sent in-band,
   the transmitting node must provide the correlation between this
   pattern and the out-of-band test message. This correlation is
   performed using the TRACE object as defined in [LMP-WDM] with Trace
   Type=1 or 2 for SONET or SDH, respectively.

   Note that verification can only be performed on already initiated
   and established FA-LSPs.

7. FA-LSP Bundling

   The messages defined in [LMP] for Link Property Correlation are used
   for FA-LSP bundling purposes: LinkSummary (MsgType = 14),

D.Papadimitriou - Internet Draft û Expires December 2002             4

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-lmp-initiation-01.txt              June 2002


   LinkSummaryAck (MsgType = 15) and LinkSummaryNack (MsgType = 16).
   The contents of these messages are built using existing (see [LMP]
   Section 13) and additional LMP sub-objects, which can be either
   negotiable or non-negotiable. Here, negotiable objects are used to
   let both sides agree on the acceptance of certain parameters for the
   requested LSP. Non-negotiable objects are used for announcement of
   specific values that do not need, or do not allow, negotiation.

   These messages are exchanged between the ingress and the egress LSR
   (through the control channel) and used as follows. When the ingress
   LSR has established an FA-LSP and wants to add/remove this FA-LSP
   from an existing bundle of FA-LSPs, it sends a LinkSummary message
   to the egress LSR indicating its local TE Link and data bearing link
   information (including status and availability) while requesting the
   corresponding information from the remote side. Since the ingress
   LSR can be aware of the remote node TE Link and data bearing link
   information, this request MAY include the remote side information.

   The LinkSummary message can also be used to aggregate simultaneously
   multiple established FA-LSP into a bundle of FA-LSPs. In addition to
   add/remove an FA-LSP from an existing bundle of FA-LSPs, it can also
   change the FA-LSPs correlation parameters.

   Remember here that each TE Link has an identifier (TE Link_Id) that
   is assigned at each end of the TE Link. These identifiers MUST be
   the same type (i.e. IPv4, IPv6, unnumbered) at both ends. Similarly,
   each component interface is assigned an identifier (Interface_Id) at
   each end. These identifiers MUST be the same type at both ends.
   Interface Id values MUST be taken from the space used for local LMP
   sessions.

   If the LinkSummary message is received from a remote node and the
   Interface Id mappings match those that are stored locally, then the
   two nodes have agreement on Interface Id and TE Link Id if these are
   known by the ingress.

   The LinkSummaryAck message is used to signal an agreement (including
   availability and status) on ALL the parameters both negotiable and
   non-negotiable received in the LinkSummaryAck message. This
   agreement includes the Interface Id mapping and Link Property
   definitions as well as the TE Link Id mapping if the latter are
   known by the ingress LSR. Moreover, when sending such a message, the
   receiverÆs data links support the capabilities listed in the
   LinkSummary message.

   Otherwise, a LinkSummaryNack message MUST be sent as response to
   indicated which Interface Id mappings are not correct and/or which
   data bearing link properties are not accepted. If a LinkSummaryNack
   message indicates that the Interface Id mappings are not correct it
   means that an error from a previous information has occurred (such
   issues are outside of the scope of this document). If a
   LinkSummaryNack message includes negotiable parameters, then
   acceptable values for those parameters MUST be included. If a

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-lmp-initiation-01.txt              June 2002


   LinkSummaryNack message is received and includes negotiable
   parameters, then the initiator of the LinkSummary message MUST send
   a new LinkSummary message that SHOULD include new values for the
   negotiable parameters. These values SHOULD take into account the
   acceptable values received in the LinkSummaryNack message.   

   Last, the following data structures are maintained at the ingress
   (LSP initiator) and the egress (LSP receptor or destinator) LSR:

   - Retransmission Timer, r: This configurable timer is set by a node
     sending a LinkSummary message. The timer is reset if an
     LinkSummaryAck or LinkSummaryNack message is received for this
     message. The expiry of this timer results in the retransmission of
     the LinkSummary message. The default value of this timer is 1
     second.

   - Number of Retransmissions, n: This configurable parameter
     indicates the maximum number of allowed retransmissions of
     LinkSummary messages. The default value of this number is 3. A
     node considers the LSP Initiation procedure to have failed if a
     response is not received from the peer after n retransmission
     attempts.

   Note: if the ingress LSR i.e. the LSP initiator, receives more than
   one LinkSummaryAck/Nack after having issued a second (or subsequent)
   LinkSummary message after retransmission timer expiration, only the
   last LinkSummaryAck/Nack message is considered by the initiator.

8. Security Considerations

   LMP provides authentication on a per IP Control Channel basis. The
   packet authentication procedure is very similar to the one
   used in OSPF, including multiple key support, key management, etc.
   The details specific to LMP are defined in [LMP] Section 13.3.
