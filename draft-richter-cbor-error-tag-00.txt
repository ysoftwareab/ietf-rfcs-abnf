 Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tag for Error Indications
                    draft-richter-cbor-error-tag-00

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
   While CBOR defines representations for null values and for an
   undefined value, there is no convention for expressing errors or
   exceptions in data structures, where the actual value desired could
   not be calculated due to an error.  The present specification defines
   a tag for such error indications, enabling the addition of varying
   levels of detail.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, [RFC7049]) provides
   for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
   pre-agreed schema.  RFC 7049 defines a basic set of data types, as
   well as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data
   types supported via an IANA registry.

   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
   While CBOR defines representations for null values and for an
   undefine value, there is no convention for expressing errors or
   exceptions in data structures.  The present specification defines a
   tag for such error indications, enabling varying levels of detail.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Error Format

   An error value is indicated by CBOR tag TBD101, which tags a data
   item that may contain additional information about the error value:

   o  If no further information is provided, the data item is the CBOR
      value null.

   o  If a diagnostic text string is provided, the data item is that
      text string.

   o  If more detailed information is provided, the data item is a map
      (CBOR major type 5), with text string or integer keys and values
      as defined by the application.

3.  CDDL typenames

   For the use with the CBOR Data Definition Language, CDDL
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl], the type names defined in Figure 1 are
   recommended:

   error = error-of<(null / text / {* (int/tstr) => any})>
   error-of<T> = #6.101(T)

                 Figure 1: Recommended type names for CDDL

4.  IANA Considerations

   In the registry [IANA.cbor-tags], IANA is requested to allocate the
   tag in Table 1 from the FCFS space, with the present document as the
   specification reference.

         +--------+-----------------+----------------------------+
         |    Tag | Data Item       | Semantics                  |
         +--------+-----------------+----------------------------+
         | TBD101 | null, text, map | [RFCthis] error indication |
         +--------+-----------------+----------------------------+

                         Table 1: Values for Tags

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 7049 apply; the tag introduced
   here are not expected to raise security considerations beyond those.
