Abstract

   This document proposes a binding from the abstract iCalendar
   Transport-independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) using
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as transport and SIP/SIPS URIs
   as addresses. The iTIP objects are used as a MIME payload format
   with SIP. iTIP is an abstract transport protocol for exchanging
   calendaring information between calendar systems using the
   iCalendar, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification defined by RFC-2445. SIP is a application-layer
   signaling protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating
   multimedia sessions, retrieving user presence and sending instant
   messages.

1 Introduction and Motivation

   This document provides the transport specific information necessary
   to convey iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability Protocol
   (iTIP) over SIP as a MIME payload as defined in [SIP] and [RFC-2045].

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                         June 2003

   The goal of this document is to re-use the iCalendar framework so
   that it can be used to describe Internet multimedia conferences and
   chat rooms. The iCalendar provides means to provide descriptions,
   identify participants, their roles and other resources for meetings
   taking place on the Internet as well as in the real world. The
   iCalendar information can easily be transmitted over SIP instant
   messages [SIP-IM] just as Internet e-mail is used today. 

   The iSIP is very similar to the e-mail binding of iTIP [iMIP]. The
   only significant change is in the addressing. iMIP uses e-mail
   addresses, iSIP allows also use of SIP or SIPS URIs. When SIP
   addresses are used to identify the attendees and other meeting
   resources, the addresses can directly be used to contact participants
   and to establish conferences.

   Other applications may also include availability and timezone
   information. For example, if callee's SIP telephone returns his
   freebusy and timezone information, the caller's SIP user-agent can
   automatically determine suitable time to retry the call. This kind of
   information can also be included in the SIP event documents.

   There is simple mapping from iTIP methods to SIP message types. Any
   iTIP method can be sent within the message body of SIP MESSAGE
   request. However, an iTIP PUBLISH method can be sent within the
   message body of any SIP message that can be delivered from UA to UA. 
   This excludes CANCEL requests and responses to them as well as
   hop-by-hop ACK requests from including an iCalendar object.


1.1 Applicability of iSIP

   This section describes how iSIP may be useful within Internet. 

   iSIP is used by systems whose main purpose is to set up communication
   sessions using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). iSIP can be used to
   exchange calendaring information between such systems, when the main
   purpose of that exchange is to agree on suitable time, virtual venue
   and participants for a future SIP-based communication session. iSIP
   can be used to publish calendaring information when the main purpose
   is to announce availability of a person or a device for a SIP-based
   communication sessions, or to announce participant roles or resources
   available within a communication session.

   iSIP does not replace iMAP or CAP as a protocol for exchanging
   generic calendaring information. On the contrary, entities using iSIP
   may use iMAP or CAP when the instant delivery of a SIP message is not
   possible, e.g., because a recipient is not available at the moment.

1.2 Related Documents

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that
   form the existing framework for SIP and Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards.

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                         June 2003

   This document, [iSIP], proposes a SIP binding for iTIP;

   [iCAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
            properties and property parameters;

   [iTIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
            between different implementations;

   [SIP] - specifies SIP, Session Initiation Protocol; and

   [SIP-IM] - specifies an extension to SIP for delivering instant
              messages.

   This document does not attempt to repeat the specification of
   concepts or definitions from these other documents. Where possible,
   references are made to the document that provides for the
   specification of the concepts or definitions. 

1.3 Terminology

   The SIP-related terms used in this document are defined in [SIP,
   SIP-IM]. The MIME-related terms used in this document are defined in
   [RFC2045]. The calendaring and scheduling terms used in this document
   are defined in [iCAL] and [iTIP].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

2 SIP Message Format Binding

   This section defines the iCalendar message binding to the SIP message
   bodies. SIP messages can carry MIME body parts as their content.

   The sections below refer to the "originator" and the "respondent" of
   an iSIP message. Typically, the originator is the "Organizer" of an
   event. The respondent is an "Attendee" of the event.

   The [SIP] "From", "To", "Contact", "Reply-To" or [SIP-PRIV]
   "Remote-Party-ID" headers typically contains the SIP address of the
   originator or respondent of an event. However, this cannot be
   guaranteed as SIP user-agents are not required to enforce iTIP
   semantics.

2.1 SIP Requests and Responses

   The iTIP requests are included in SIP MESSAGE requests. A response to
   a iTIP request MUST NOT be included in the SIP response message, but
   a separate SIP MESSAGE MUST be used for sending the response.

   Other SIP requests and responses MAY be used to send iTIP PUBLISH
   requests of iCalendar components.

2.3 Security

   This section addresses several aspects of security including
   Authentication, Authorization and Confidentiality. Authentication and
   Confidentiality is achieved using normal SIP means, e.g., using
   S/MIME [RFC-1847, RFC-2630, RFC-2633] as specified in [RFC-3261].

2..1 Authorization

   In [iTIP] messages, only the "Organizer" is authorized to modify or
   cancel calendar entries they organize. That is, sip:spoof@xyz.com is
   not allowed to modify or cancel a meeting that was organized by
   sip:a@example.com. Furthermore, only the respondent has the
   authorization to indicate their status to the "Organizer". That is,
   the "Organizer" must ignore an [iTIP] message from sip:spoof@xyz.com
   that declines a meeting invitation for sip:b@example.com.

   Implementations of iSIP SHOULD verify the authenticity of the creator
   of an iCalendar object before taking any action. The methods for
   doing this are presented later in this document.

   Message flow in iTIP supports someone working on behalf of a
   "Calendar User" through use of the "sent-by" parameter that is
   associated with the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties. However,
   there is no mechanism to verify whether or not a "Calendar User" has
   authorized someone to work on their behalf. It is left to
   implementations to provide mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to
   make that decision.

2.2.2 Authentication

   Authentication can be performed using an implementation of [RFC-1847]
   "multipart/signed" that supports public/private key certificates.
   Authentication is possible only on messages that have been signed.
   Authenticating an unsigned message may not be reliable.

2.2.3 Confidentiality

   To ensure confidentiality using iSIP implementations should utilize
   S/MIME-compliant encryption. The protocol does not restrict a
   "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) from forwarding iCalendar objects to
   other users or agents.

2.3 Attendee Addresses

   The calendar address of the "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" property in an
   iCalendar object SHOULD be a valid SIP or SIPS URI [RFC3261] address
   in the "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VFREEBUSY" components.

   If the calendar user agent has a valid SIP address,the "ORGANIZER" or
   "ATTENDEE" property MUST contain the SIP or SIP URI of the calendar
   user as property value. When the calendar user agent has also a valid
   e-mail address, the MAILTO URI SHOULD be included as a "sent-by"

   parameter.

   Examples:

	ORGANIZER;SENT-BY="mailto:pessi@iki.fi":sips:pessi@iki.fi
	RESOURCE;CUTYPE=RESOURCE:sip:camera-1@iptel.research.nokia.com

   Because [iTIP] does not preclude "attendees" from forwarding
   "vevents" or "vtodos" to others, the apparent originator address may
   not equal that of the "Organizer". Additionally, the "Organizer" or
   "Attendee" cannot be reliably inferred by the [SIP] "From",
   "Contact", "P-Asserted-Identity" or "Reply-To" header values of a SIP
   message.

   The relevant address MUST be ascertained by opening the
   "text/calendar" MIME body part and examining the "ATTENDEE" and
   "ORGANIZER" properties.

2.3.1 Gatewaying iSIP Messages Outside SIP

   When an iSIP message is forwarded to an another messaging system,
   such as CPIM-compliant instant messaging system or e-mail, the
   gateway between SIP and the non-SIP messaging system usually just
   forwards the message contents unmodified sans the transfer encoding
   required by the non-SIP messaging system.

      OPEN ISSUE: Presumably such a gateway usually inserts a return
                  address to the message. The return address typically
                  points to the gateway, so that gateway can forward any
                  replies to the original sender of the message. 

2.4 Content-Transfer-Encoding

   The default character set for iCalendar objects is UTF-8. As SIP
   protocol can handle binary message bodies, transfer encoding MUST NOT
   be used for iCalendar objects. Gateways from MIME-compliant protocols
   to SIP MUST remove any Content-Transfer-Encoding prior to delivering
   the iCalendar object to SIP.
           
2.5 Content Type

   A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this
   document MUST have an "Content-Type" header field of "text/calendar". 
   The "Content-Type" header field SHOULD also include the type
   parameters "method" and "component". The "method" contains a single
   iTIP method name which MUST correspond to the value of the "METHOD"
   parameter of the vCalendar components within the iCalendar object. 
   The "component" parameter is also a quoted, comma-separated list and
   it defines the iCalendar component types contained within the
   iCalendar object.

   A "charset" parameter MUST be present if the iCalendar object
   contains characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set.

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                         June 2003

   The default character set for iCalendar objects is UTF-8. 

   The following is an example of this header field with a value that
   indicates an event message.

        Content-Type: text/calendar;method="REQUEST"
           ;component="VEVENT,VTODO"

   The "text/calendar" content type allows for the scheduling message
   type to be included as a MIME multipart message body with other
   content information (i.e., "multipart/mixed") or included in a MIME
   message with a clear-text, human-readable form of the scheduling
   message (i.e., "multipart/alternative"). This can be done in order to
   permit the information in the scheduling message to be understood by
   SIP user agents (UA) that do not support the "text/calendar" content
   type.

2.6 Content-Disposition

   The SIP User-Agents determine how to interpret a message body or a
   message body part based on the Content-Disposition header field. The
   default "disposition-type" for SIP is "render", indicating that the
   body part should be displayed or otherwise rendered to the user.

   If the application requires that the iSIP message is properly
   processed, the Content-Disposition header MAY also contain a
   "handling" parameter with value "required" indicating that the
   receiving user-agent is to reject the request with 415 Unsupported
   Media Type if the "text/calendar" MIME type is not understood.
   
3 Security Considerations

   The security threats that applications must address when implementing
   iTIP are detailed in [iTIP]. Two spoofing threats are identified:
   Spoofing the "Organizer", and Spoofing an "Attendee". To address
   these threats, the originator of an iCalendar object must be
   authenticated by a recipient. Once authenticated, a determination can
   be made as to whether or not the originator is authorized to perform
   the requested operation. Compliant applications MUST support signing
   and encrypting text/calendar attachments using a mechanism based on
   S/MIME and [RFC2633, RFC1847, RFC3261] to facilitate the
   authentication the originator of the iCalendar object. 
   Implementations MAY provide a means for users to disable signing and
   encrypting. The steps are described below:

   1. The iCalendar object MUST be signed by the "Organizer" when
   sending an update or the "Attendee" when sending a reply.

   2. Using the S/MIME, determine who signed the iCalendar object. This
   is the "signer". Note that the signer is not necessarily the person
   that sent the SIP message. 

   3. Correlate the signer to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar

Pessi & Mela         Expires December 24, 2003                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    iSIP                         June 2003

   object. In case of SIP or SIPS URI, the signer should match with the
   concatenation of the "userinfo" "@" and "domainname" portions of the
   URI. If the signer cannot be correlated to an "ATTENDEE" property,
   ignore the message.

   4. Determine whether or not the "ATTENDEE" is authorized to perform
   the operation as defined by [iTIP]. If the conditions are not met,
   ignore the message.

   5. If all the above conditions are met, the message can be processed.

   To address the confidentiality security threats, signed iSIP messages
   SHOULD be encrypted by a mechanisms based on S/MIME [RFC-1847,
   RFC-2633].

   It is possible to receive iSIP messages sent by someone working on
   behalf of another "Calendar User". This is determined by examining
   the "sent-by" parameter in the relevant "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE"
   property.  [iCAL] and [iTIP] provide no mechanism to verify that a

   "Calendar User" has authorized someone else to work on their behalf.
   To address this security issue, implementations MUST provide
   mechanisms for the "Calendar Users" to make that decision before
   applying changes from someone working on behalf of a "Calendar User".

5 Recommended Practices

   This section outlines a series of recommended practices when using a
   SIP to exchange iCalendar objects.

5.1 Use of Content and Message IDs

   The [iCAL] specification makes frequent use of the URI for data types
   in properties such as "DESCRIPTION", "ATTACH", "CONTACT" and others.
   Two forms of URIs are Message ID (MID) and Content ID (CID). These
   are defined in [RFC-2111]. Although [RFC-2111] allows referencing
   messages or MIME body parts in other MIME entities or stores, it is
   strongly recommended that iSIP implementations include all referenced
   messages and body parts in a single MIME entity. Simply put, if an
   iCalendar object contains CID or MID references to other messages or
   body parts, implementations should ensure that these messages and/or
   body parts are transmitted with the iCalendar object. If they are not
   there is no guarantee that the receiving "CU" will have the access or
   the authorization to view those objects.
