                    EVPN Vendor-Specific Route Type
                draft-rabadan-bess-vendor-evpn-route-02

Abstract

   RFC7432 defines Ethernet VPN as a BGP address family that makes use
   of Typed NLRIs. IANA has a registry called "EVPN Route Types" that
   allocates values to Route Types. The purpose of this document is to
   solicit IANA the registration of a route type value for a vendor
   specific usage, as well as the definition of the EVPN NLRI for that
   route.

1. Introduction

   RFC7432 creates an IANA managed registry called "EVPN Route Types"
   and makes the initial registrations for different NLRIs. The ability
   to define Typed NLRIs makes EVPN a flexible and extensible technology
   that can be used for multiple purposes. This document solicits the
   value 255 for a new Route Type that will be called "EVPN Vendor
   Specific" Route Type. 

   The intend of this new Type is to allow operators and vendors to
   design rapidly new EVPN applications/prototypes and experiment with
   them in deployed networks before standardizing the specific
   application. Software Defined Networks (SDN) are evolving fast and
   the flexibility allowed by this new Route Type will contribute to the
   SDN control plane evolution.

   Another motivation for this new Route Type is the exchange of vendor
   specific information that may be relevant only for the vendor using
   it. Other vendors may convey the information in a different way, or
   they simply don't need to exchange it.  

   In order to allow multiple applications, the new NLRI contains a
   Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) field for which the IEEE
   registers and maintains values.

2. The EVPN Vendor-Specific Route Type

   [RFC7432] defines the EVPN NLRI with the following format:


     +-----------------------------------+
     |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
     +-----------------------------------+
     |     Length (1 octet)              |
     +-----------------------------------+
     | Route Type specific (variable)    |
     +-----------------------------------+

   Where Route Type can be a value between 0 and 255. IANA maintains a
   registry called "EVPN Route Types" where the different values are
   assigned. This document solicits a new Route Type with value 255.

   When the Route Type field includes the value 255, the Route Type
   specific field will include the following information:


     +--------------------------------------------+
     |    Route Distinguisher (RD) (8 octets)     |
     +--------------------------------------------+
     | Organizational Unique Id (OUI) (3 octets)  |
     +--------------------------------------------+
     |         Vendor Key Length (1 octet)        |
     +--------------------------------------------+
     |            Vendor Specific Key             |
     |                (variable)                  |
     +--------------------------------------------+
     |               Vendor Specific              |
     |            Information (variable)          |
     +--------------------------------------------+


   Where OUI, Vendor Key Length and Vendor Specific Key are considered
   part of the route key for BGP processing. The Vendor Key Length field
   indicates the length in octets of the Vendor Specific Key field of

   the NLRI.

   The OUI values are owned and assigned by the IEEE Registration
   Authority.

   As per [RFC7606] section 5.4, a BGP speaker advertising support for
   EVPN address family MUST handle routes with unrecognized NLRI types
   within that address family by discarding them unless the relevant
   specification for that address family specifies otherwise. However, a
   BGP speaker supporting this new Route Type MUST accept the route even
   if the OUI and Vendor fields are unrecognized. Specifically, a Route
   Reflector MUST forward this new route type to its BGP peers, even if
   the receiver does not understand or cannot process the route.


3. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

4. Security Considerations

   The relevant Security Considerations described in [RFC7432] apply to
   the new Route Type defined in this document.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new value in the "EVPN Route Types"
   registry:

      255      EVPN Vendor Specific		[This document]
