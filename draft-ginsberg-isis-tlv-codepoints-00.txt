Internet-Draft             isis-tlv-codepoints                  May 2014


1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS TLV Codepoints registry was created by [RFC3563] and
   extended by [RFC6233].  As IS-IS related RFCs are published the
   codepoints required for the protocol extensions are added to the IANA
   managed registry.  In the case of TLVs supporting neighbor
   advertisement a common sub-TLV registry has been created.  This sub-
   TLV registry needs to include additional neighbor advertisement TLVs
   defined in [RFC5311].

   In the case of TLVs supporting prefix advertisement, currently
   separate sub-TLV registries are maintained for each TLV.  These
   registries need to be combined into a common sub-TLV registry similar
   to what has been done for neighbor advertisement TLVs.

   There is a need to support early allocation of codepoints defined in
   drafts which seem likely to eventually gain WG approval.  The
   procedure for obtaining early allocation of codepoints is described.


2.  IS Neighbor sub-TLV Registry

   There is an existing common sub-TLV registry for Sub-TLVs for TLV 22,
   141, and 222.  [RFC5311] defines the IS Neighbor Attribute TLV (23)
   and the MT IS Neighbor Attribute TLV (223).  Format of these TLVs is
   identical to TLVs 22 and 222 respectively.  The IS Neighbor sub-TLV
   Registry needs to be extended to include these two TLVs.  Settings
   for inclusion of each sub-TLV are identical to the settings for TLVs
   22 and 222 respectively.


3.  Prefix Reachability sub-TLV Registry

   Currently there exist separate sub-TLV registries for TLVs (135, 235,
   236, 237).  As in the case of the IS Neighbor TLVs discussed in the
   previous section, assignment of sub-TLVs applicable to one or more of
   these TLVs is intended to be common.  Therefore the existing separate
   sub-TLV registries need to be combined into a single registry
   entitled "Sub-TLVs for TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237".  As existing
   sub-TLV assignments are common to all the TLVs this represents no
   change to the protocol - only a clearer representation of the
   intended sub-TLV allocation strategy.  Format of the registry would
   be as shown below:

4.  Early Allocation of Codepoints

   When new drafts are introduced requiring new codepoints, it is
   advantageous to have the ability to do early allocation of
   codepoints.  The reasons this is advantageous and the process to do
   so is described in [RFC7120].  However, [RFC7120] procedures do not
   apply to registries such as the IS-IS TLV Codepoints Registry which
   utilize "Expert Review" allocation policy.  In such cases what is
   required is that a request be made to the designated experts.  The
   following procedures are defined.  Note these procedures apply
   specifically to the IS-IS TLV Codepoints registry.  This document is
   not defining a general early allocation process for other Expert
   Review registries.

   1.  In order to qualify for early allocation a draft MUST be accepted
       as a WG document

   2.  The author(s) of the draft MAY request early allocation of
       codepoints to the chair(s) of the WG in which the document is
       submitted

   3.  The WG chair(s) gauge whether there is consensus within the WG
       that early allocation is appropriate for the given document and
       that the conditions for early allocation specified in [RFC7120]
       Section 2 are satisfied.  If so the request is forwarded to the
       Area Director(s).

   4.  If the Area Director(s) approve, the request is forwarded to the
       Designated Experts for their approval.

   5.  Once the Designated Experts have granted approval IANA will
       update the registry marking the allocated codepoints as
       "Temporary" following the procedures specified in [RFC7120]
       Section 3.1

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the addition of TLVs 23 and 223 to the
   existing Sub-TLVs for TLV 22, 141, and 222 registry as described in
   Section 2.

   This document requires the existing sub-TLV registries for TLVs (135,
   235, 236, 237) be combined into a single registry as described in
   Section 3.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security issues.


7.  Acknowledgements

   input in defining the correct process to follow to get these changes
   implemented.
