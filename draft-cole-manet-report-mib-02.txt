        Definition of Managed Objects for Performance Reporting
                     draft-cole-manet-report-mib-02

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report
   generation on any device that supports MIBs containing counter and
   gauge objects for performance monitoring.  This allows a management
   station to instruct a device to build off-line reports to be
   collected asynchronously by the management station.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous, off-
   line report generation for performance monitoring on any device
   supporting MIBs containing variables that resolve to type Integer32
   (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks).  This should be
   useful to devices or networks where efficient use of bandwidth is of
   concern or where intermittent connectivity is common.  Hence, the
   REPORT-MIB is useful for devices managed over some Mobile Ad-Hoc
   Networks (MANETs) or Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs).

   The REPORT-MIB offers three types of off-line reporting.  One type
   offering reports which present statistical analysis of the objects
   being tracked; found within the reportStatsGroup.  The second type
   offering a means to collect sampled data related to defined MIB
   objects.  This second type of reporting is contained in the
   reportSampledGroup.  The third offering reports which present
   (collect) raw data values and their time of change from the objects
   being tracked; found within the reportHistoryGroup.

   For statistical reporting, the REPORT-MIB borrows from the RMON
   [RFC1757] ReportsControl and Reports Tables.  Here the
   reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup defines the capabilities of the device
   with respect performance monitoring and statistical analysis.  Some
   analysis is hard-coded into the definition of the
   reportStatsDataGroup while the device can also advertise extended
   statistical reporting via the reportMetricExtDefTable.  The
   reportsControlTable specifies the report metrics, the Object ID to
   monitor and other aspects of the statistical report development and
   storage.

   For the collection of sampled data, the REPORT-MIB draws directly
   from the usrHistoryGroup from RMON 2 [RFC2021].  Here the
   reportSampledControlTable allows the user to define aspects of the
   report for sampled data, including the number of MIB objects to be
   sampled and the nature of the sampling frequency and overall report
   duration.  This group uses the notion of buckets, which contained
   sampled data from a set of idetified MIB objects sampled at the same
   time point.  The report consists of the buckets each containing sets
   of sampled data from the same MIB objects but at differing sampling
   times.  The reportSampledObjectTable allows the user to identify the
   multiple MIB objects to be sampled.  The reportSampledDataTable
   contains the storage of the reported sampled data contained within
   buckets, one for each sampling instance.

   For the collection of raw data, the REPORT-MIB contains a

   reportHistoryGroup comprised of the reportHistoryControlTable for
   control of historical data reports and the reportHistoryDataTable for
   the storage of the historical reports.

   Various compliance groups which allow for development of raw data
   collection reports, collection of sampled data reports or only
   statistical data reports, or all combinations.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Reporting MIB ... and notifications.

4.1.  REPORT-MIB Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the Reporting MIB
   process.  First, the model for the reportStatsGroup is presented.
   Then the model for the reportSampledGroup and the reportHistoryGroup
   are presented.

   Figure 1 illustrates a potential use of the REPORT-MIB for the
   generation of off-line, remotely generated reports.  The management
   station on the left hand side of the illustration instructs the
   remote device to create reports through manipulation of the
   ReportCntrl Objects in the REPORT-MIB resident on the remote device.
   The reports instruct the device to monitor the status of specified
   counters (on other MIBs) periodically and to generate a set of
   metrics describing the temporal behavior of those counter values.

   The reports are stored locally until the management station decides
   to pull them off the device.  The figure shows a case where the
   REPORT-MIB generates a notification that Report_2 has completed,
   prompting the management station to pull Report_2 from the device.

   Figure 1: REPORT-MIB front-end report generation process.

   The REPORT-MIB's reportStatsGroup defines specifically a set of
   metrics which are computed within all reports.  It also allows for
   the specification of metric extensions which are local to the
   specific implementation of the REPORT-MIB.  These are identified in
   the reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup metricExtension Table.

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                   March 2010


   Each metric has an associated Object ID of type counter associated
   with it.  The control table specifies a report interval and a bin
   interval.  The report interval is an integral multiple of the bin
   interval.  For each bin interval, the device identifies the change in
   the counter value over the bin interval (called x_i) and then
   computes the associated metric, e.g., sum, sum of the square, etc,
   over the set {x_i}.  It maintains the sum of these computations
   within the metric objects in the 'reportStatsDataTable'.  Once the
   report interval is complete, the management station has enough
   information to compute a set of interesting and useful statistics.

   The computational model of the reportStatsGroup of the REPORT-MIB is
   illustrated in the figure below.  The important controls are a) the
   contrlInterval, b) the cntrlBinInterval, c) the specific
   counterObjectId, and d) the metric.  In the figure x_i represents the
   ith value of the counter change, i.e., x_i = counterValue(t_i+1) -
   counterValue(t_i).  The metrics reported are then computed from the
   set (x_i).  Three examples are identified in the figure, e.g.,
   StatSumX, StatSumSq and StatMaxX.  Other existing and potential
   metrics are discussed below.

   o  These are accessible from the statistical datum provided by this

   The REPORT-MIB also provides for the collection of sampled data
   instead of statistical data.  It does this by importing (copying) the
   usrHistory group from RMON2 [RFC2021] which allows for the generation
   of reports collecting the sampled object values binned for the
   purpose of aggregation and efficiency of collection.  These are
   defined within the reportSampledGroup.  The model used for this type
   of report generation is based upon three tables.  The
   reportSampledControlTable defines aspects of the report generation
   related to duration of the reporting interval, the bin (or bucket)
   sizes for the report, and the number of object values collected for
   each bucket.  The reportUsrHistoryObjectTable identifies the specific
   MIB objects whose values and binned within the report.  And the
   reportSampledDataTable contains the binned data values collected for
   the report.

   The REPORT-MIB also provides for the collection of historical data
   instead of statistical or sampled data.  It does this by defining the
   reportHistoryControlTable for the control of the historical reports
   and the reportHistoryDataTable for the storage of the historical
   reports.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Capabilities - Objects related to the capabilities of the device
      and MIB implemented on the device.  Some objects are explicitly
      defined within the REPORT-MIB.  Other capabilities can be exposed
      through the REPORT-MIB, but which are not explicitly defined
      within this document.  These later capabilities include objects,
      e.g., for new metrics.

   o  Control - Objects defined within this document which set the
      parameters for specific reports to be generated offline on the the
      remote managed device.

   o  Data - Objects which hold the report data, either statistical,
      sampled or raw history data.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the REPORT-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  reportMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the REPORT-MIB.

   o  reportMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      REPORT MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

   o

      *  Statistics Group - This group contains the objects which
         support the generation of reports of a statistical nature.

      *  Sampled Group - This group contains the objects which support
         the generation (collection) of reports exposing sampled data
         values.

      *  History Group - This group contains the objects which support
         the generation (collection) of historical reports exposing raw
         data values.

   o  reportMIBConformance - Defines a variety of conformance of
      implementations of this REPORT-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the REPORT-MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].

5.2.  The Statistics Group

   The REPORT-MIB device has a ....

   o  StatsCapabilities - ...

   o  StatsControl - ...

   o  StatsData - ...

   The reportStatsCapabilitiesGroup contains .....

   The reportStatsControlGroup contains .....

   The reportStatsDataGroup contains ...  As and example of how the
   metrics are to be computed within the REPORT-MIB, consider the
   standard metric object 'reportStatsDataStatSumX'.  For each bin
   interval defined by the object reportCntrlReportsBinInterval, the
   change in the value of the counter pointed to by the Object ID
   reportCntrlReportsPriObjID is calculated.  Then this (delta) value is
   added to the current value of the value contained in the object
   'reportStatsDataStatSumX'.  Then, if interested in computing the
   average change in this object (sampled each bin interval) for the
   duration of the report, the management station simply divides
   reportStatsDataStatSumX by reportStatsDataStatN.  Although this is a
   trivial example because the value of reportAggrReportStatSumX is
   simple the difference in the counter reportCntrolReportsPriObjID at
   the start and the end of the total report interval, the other metrics
   defined are not as trivial.

   The objects 'reportStatsDataOverflowStatSumX' and
   'reportStatsDataHCSumX' are borrowed from RMON and exist to handle
   integer overflow situations where, e.g., 'reportStatsDataStatSumX'
   overruns its maximum vary numerous times.

   Computations and utility of the other standard metrics are as
   follows:

   o  reportStatsDataStatSumXSq -

   o  reportStatsDataStatMaximum -

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                   March 2010


   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The REPORT-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following REPORT-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

-- REPORT-MIB Editors' Note:
-- The reportSampledGroup is copied from the usrHistory
-- group documented in RMON2 [RFC2021].  We have perserved all of
-- the annotations and object descriptions, as any changes would
-- only diminish the quality of the development.  The only changes
-- made were to the naming of the objects themselves.  Here we have
-- merely prefixed the original names with 'report' and changed the
-- 'usrHistory' to 'Sampled' as we felt this better reflected the
-- the nature of the capability being offered by this group.
-- The remainder of this group development is essentially
-- copied from [RFC2021]:

--
-- Sampled Collection Group (reportSampledGroup)
--
-- The reportSampled group combines mechanisms seen in the alarm and
-- history groups to provide user-specified samplying collection,
-- utilizing two additional control tables and one additional data
-- table. This function has traditionally been done by NMS
-- applications, via periodic polling.  The reportSampled group allows
-- this task to be offloaded to a remote managed device.
--
-- Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object) is collected in the same
-- manner as any data table (e.g. etherHistoryTable) except
-- that the user specifies the MIB instances to be collected and their
-- sampling frequency. Objects are collected in
-- bucket-groups, with the intent that all MIB
-- instances in the same bucket-group are collected as atomically as
-- possible by the remote managed device.
--
-- The reportSampledControlTable is a one-dimensional read-create table.
-- Each row configures a collection of sampling buckets; the creation of a
-- row in this table will cause one or more associated instances in
-- the reportSampledObjectTable to be created. The user specifies the
-- number of bucket elements (rows in the reportSampledObjectTable)
-- requested, as well as the number of buckets requested.
--
-- The reportSampledObjectTable is a 2-d read-write table.
-- Each row configures a single MIB instance to be collected.
-- All rows with the same major index constitute a bucket-group.
--
-- The reportSampledTable is a 3-d read-only table containing

-- the data of associated reportSampledControlEntries. Each
-- entry represents the value of a single MIB instance
-- during a specific sampling interval (or the rate of
-- change during the interval).
--
-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.
--
-- Row Creation Order Relationships
--
-- The static nature of the reportSampledObjectTable creates
-- some row creation/modification issues. The rows in this
-- table need to be set before the associated
-- reportSampledControlEntry can be activated.
--
-- Note that the reportSampledObject entries associated with a
-- particular reportSampledControlEntry are not required to
-- be active before the control entry is activated. However,
-- the reportSampled data entries associated with an inactive
-- reportSampledObject entry will be inactive (i.e.
-- reportSampledValStatus == valueNotAvailable).

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,

Internet-Draft               The REPORT-MIB                   March 2010


   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

11.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank Bert Wijnen and Andy Bierman for pointing out
   the existence of the usrHistory group within RMON2 and in answering
   our numerous questions on the usrHistory group.  Further, we wish to
   thank U. Herberg for his forcing additions to this MIB through his
   thoughtful consideration of performance monitoring requirements for
   other MIBs, e.g., NHDP and OLSR MIBs.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Changes from -01 to -02 draft.

   1.  Restructured the MIB somewhat to now offer the three reporting
       capabilities in increasing order of detail: a) statistical
       reports, b) sampled reports, and c) historical reports.

   2.  Renamed the usrHistoryGroup and elements to samplingGroup.  This
       is in line with its actual capabilities.

   3.  Added a new historyGroup which provides a history of change
       events.

   4.  Updated the4 Conformance section to reflect the above changes and
       additions.  But did not yet run smilint to check MIB syntax.

   Changes from -00 to -01 draft.

   1.  Added (copied) the usrHistory group from RMON2 into the REPORT-
       MIB.

   2.  Restructured the MIB to account for the inclusion of the
       reportSampledGroup.

   3.  Dropped the reportCurReportsTable as this did not make sense
       within the context of the REPORT-MIB.

   4.  Added the Compliance and Conformance material.  Defined several
       Compliance Groups to all for base implementations of the REPORT-
       MIB for only statistical reports, for only historical reports or
       for both.  Allow for enhanced implementations to address higher
       capacity issues and extension to metric reporting for statistical
       reporting.

   5.  Ran the MIB through the smilint checker and in the process
       corrected numerous typos, ommisions, TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS,
       IMPORTS, etc.

   6.  Updated main text to reflect changes.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the REPORT-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   Need to add an index associated with object IDs of interest
        which are conatined within a table, e.g., IfPacketsIn in an
        InterfaceTable which is indexed by IfIndex.

   2.   Specify the set of metrics for default support.  Done.

   3.   Clean up the Table indexing.  Specifically, what uniquely
        defines a report?

   4.   Complete notification group.

   5.   Complete conformance group.  Done but not yet checked by
        smilint.

   6.   Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.

   7.   Update the text of the document to reflect the final state of
        the MIB.

   8.   Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   9.   Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   10.  Complete the security analysis and section.

   11.  Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.
