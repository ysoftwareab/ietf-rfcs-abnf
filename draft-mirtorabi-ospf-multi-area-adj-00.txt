Abstract

    This memo documents an extension to OSPF to allow a single physical
    link to be shared by multiple areas. This is necessary to allow the 
    link to be considered an intra-area link in multiple areas.
    This would create an intra-area path to the corresponding areas 
    sharing the same link.

1.  Motivation

    There could be a requirement to have a link in multiple areas in 
    order to allow the link to be considered as an intra-area link in
    multiple areas and be preferred over high cost intra-area paths. 
    A simple example is to use a high speed backbone link between two
    ABRs to create multi-area adjacencies belonging to different areas.

2.  Possible Solutions

    For numbered interfaces, the OSPF specification [OSPF] allows a 
    separate OSPF interface to be configured in each area using a 
    secondary address. The disadvantages of this approach are that 
    it requires additional IP address configuration, doesn't apply to
    unnumbered interfaces, and advertising secondary addresses will
    result in a larger overall routing table.

    Allowing a link with a single address to simply be configured in 
    multiple areas would also solve the problem. However, this would 
    result in the subnet corresponding to the interface residing in 
    multiple areas which is contrary to the definition of an OSPF 
    area as a collection of subnets.  

    Another approach is to simply allow unnumbered links to be 
    configured in multiple areas. Section 8.2. of the OSPF 
    specification already specifies that the OSPF area ID should
    be used to de-multiplex received OSPF packets. One limitation
    of this approach is that multi-access networks are not supported.
    Although this limitation may be overcome for LAN media with 
    support of "Point-to-Point operation over LAN in link-state 
    routing protocols" [P2PLAN], it may not be acceptable to 
    configure the link as unnumbered.

3.  Proposed Solution

    ABRs will simply establish multiple adjacencies belonging to different 
    areas. Each multi-area adjacency is announced as a point-to-point 
    unnumbered link in the configured area. This point-to-point link will 
    provide a topological path for that area. The first or primary 
    adjacency using the link will operate and advertise the link 
    consistent with RFC 2328 [OSPF]. 

4. Bringing up multi-area adjacencies

   Multi-area adjacencies are configured between two routers having a
   common interface. On physical point-to-point networks, packets are
   sent to the AllSPFRouters address. For all other network types, 
   packets are unicast to the remote neighbor's IP address. 

5. Neighbor discovery
  
   On point-to-point networks, neighbor discovery is dynamic since Hello 
   packets are sent to the AllSPFRouters address. For all other network 
   types, one needs to configure remote neighbor IP address for the 
   multi-area adjacency. 

6. Interface data structure

   An OSPF interface data structure is built for each configured
   multi-area adjacency as specified in section 9 of OSPF [OSPF]. The 
   interface type will always be point-to-point.

7. Interface FSM

   The interface FSM will be the same as a point-to-point link
   irrespective of the underlying physical link.

8. Neighbor data structure and neighbor FSM

   Both the neighbor data structure and neighbor FSM are the same as 
   for standard OSPF, specified in section 10 of OSPF [OSPF].

9. Advertising multi-area adjacencies

   Multi-area adjacencis are announced as unnumbered point-to-point 
   links. Once the router's secondary adjacency reaches the FULL state 
   it will be added as a link type 1 to the Router LSA with:

   Link ID = remote's Router ID
   Link ID = IfIndex
  
   This will announce a topological path through the corresponding 
   area.

10. Compatibility Issues

    All mechanisms described in this document are backward-compatible
    with standard OSPF implementations.

11. Other Solutions

    The "OSPF Tunnel Adjacency" [OSPFTA] describes a more elaborate 
    mechanism which satisfies this requirement as well as others. 

12. Security

   This document does not raise any security issues that are not 
   already covered in [OSPF].

13. Acknowledgments

   The authors wish to acknowledge Pat Murphy for bringing focus
   to the requirement.
