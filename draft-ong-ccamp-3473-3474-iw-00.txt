1. Abstract

   This document defines interworking procedures between [RFC 3473]
   (Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE) and [RFC 3474] (GMPLS RSVP-TE 
   Usage and Extensions for ASON) signaling. RFC 3474 extensions
   are used in ITU-T Recommendation [G.7713.2].  Two basic interworking 
   scenarios are discussed. 

   RFC 3474 was intended to use the same basic mechanisms as and
   to be backwards compatible to RFC 3473.  Some objects in 3474
   are carried transparently over an RFC 3473 network, in
   accordance with RSVP procedures for unrecognized objects.
   Other objects must be mapped or generated at the interworking
   point.

   The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to
   any types of interfaces common to RFC 3473 and Recommendation 
   G.7713.2, esp. time-division multiplexed, lambda or
   fiber switching interfaces.

3. Introduction

   This document defines interworking procedures between [RFC 3473]
   (Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE) and [RFC 3474] (GMPLS RSVP-TE 
   Usage and Extensions for ASON) signaling. RFC 3474 extensions
   are used in ITU-T Recommendation [G.7713.2].  The terms I-NNI 
   (Internal Network-Network Interface) and E-NNI (External Network-
   Network Interface) are taken from ITU-T Recommendation [G.8080]. 

   It should be noted that some interworking procedures described
   have been implemented by multiple parties, although further 
   interoperability testing may be needed.

3.2  RFC 3473 to RFC 3474 Interworking

   The 3473-3474 interworking scenario occurs where a 3473 Overlay
   interface is supported by either an RFC 3474 network or
   a node with a 3473 Overlay interface is connected across
   multiple domains using RFC 3474 at the E-NNI.  This is shown
   in Figures 1 and 2.

              Figure 2: 3473-3474 Interworking Case 2


   These interworking cases may occur, for example, where
   networks supporting RFC 3474 internally or at the E-NNI
   interface to neighboring networks also support 3473 Overlay
   to an IP client system.

   
3.2 RFC 3474 to RFC 3473 Interworking


   The 3474-to-3473 interworking case is where a network using
   RFC 3473 internally supports RFC 3474 interfaces at its border
   nodes, as shown in Figure 3 below.  In this case, RFC 3474
   is supported across an RFC 3473 network or domain.


                         -------------
                     ////             \\\\
                   //                     \\

                   \\                     //
        RFC 3474     \\\\             ////     RFC 3474
        UNI/NNI          -------------         UNI/NNI

                          RFC 3473
                           I-NNI

              Figure 3: 3474-to-3473 Interworking


   This may be a typical application, for example, if the client
   nodes A and C are not IP nodes or are identified by non-IP
   addresses.  RFC 3474 supports a client address (TNA) which is
   separate from the 3473 addressing range and can convey non-IP
   address formats such as NSAP.  It also allows full overlap of
   the client address range with the address range used in the
   network, since separate objects are used for each.

draft-ong-ccamp-3473-3474-iw-00.txt               November 2003


   The interworking point between 3474 and 3473 is required to 
   perform resolution of the TNA to the corresponding destination
   node in the 3473 network.

3.3 Mapping of General 3474 Capabilities

   RFC 3474 also identifies four specific requirements generating
   the extensions defined:

   a) support for call and connection separation
   b) support for soft permanent connection
   c) support for extended restart capabilities 
   d) additional error codes/values

   As RFC 3473 does not support call and connection separation
   or soft permanent connection, there are currently no additional 
   interworking requirements beyond transparent transport of
   related objects (see 5.4).  However, future study may be required 
   for support of features such as a call with no connections.

   (c) is a local procedure and has no interworking implications
   (d) is strictly a support item for the preceding requirements.

4. Procedures for 3473-3474 Interworking

4.1 Interworking of Session Object

   For RFC 3473, the Session Object contains the tunnel endpoint
   address, i.e., in Figure 1 the IP address of node C.  For RFC
   3474, which treats the tunnel as a concatenation of tunnels
   linking multiple domains and domain boundaries, the Session 
   Object contains the endpoint of the local tunnel, i.e., in
   Figure 1 the 3474 Session Object created by Node X would carry
   the address of Node Z as the local tunnel endpoint.

   For interworking purposes, the node receiving RFC 3473 RSVP
   must map the tunnel endpoint address of the Session Object 
   into the Destination TNA sub-object of the GENERALIZED_UNI 
   object that is defined in RFC 3476 and used in 3474, since this
   carries the end-to-end tunnel endpoint.  That ingress node
   then generates an appropriate RFC 3474 Session Object.

   At the egress RFC 3474 node, the RFC 3473 Session Object
   must be regenerated from the TNA and passed across the terminating 
   RFC 3473 interface to the destination client.

4.2  Interworking of Sender_Template

   For RFC 3473, the Sender_Template contains the tunnel sender,
   i.e., in Figure 1 the IP address of node A.  For RFC 3474, the


L. Ong  et al               - Expires May 2004                        4


draft-ong-ccamp-3473-3474-iw-00.txt               November 2003


   Sender_Template contains the sender of the local tunnel, i.e.,
   in Figure 1 the address of Node X at the X-Y interface.

   For interworking purposes, the node receiving the RFC 3473
   message must map the Sender_Template address into the Source
   TNA sub-object of the GENERALIZED_UNI object from 3476, which
   carries the corresponding information in RFC 3474/3476.  

   At the egress interface, the egress node uses the Source TNA
   to regenerate the Sender_Template tunnel sender address.

4.3  Response Messages

   The inverse mapping is required for messages sent from the
   tunnel endpoint back to the tunnel source, before the 
   corresponding message is sent across the RFC 3473 interface
   to the end-to-end tunnel source. 

4.4  Other Objects

   Other objects are unchanged in their significance between
   RFC 3473 and RFC 3474.


5. Procedures for 3474-3473 Interworking

5.1  Addressing

   One significant difference between RFC 3474 and RFC 3473 is
   in the use of identifiers or address objects.  RFC 3474
   creates a separate client interface address using the TNA
   (Transport Network-Assigned Address), which is a globally
   unique identifier that may use Ipv4, Ipv6 or NSAP formats.
   
   It should be noted that a common application for RFC 3474 
   may be for the access of systems that do not support IP
   addressing. In this case, the end-to-end tunnel source/endpoint
   may use non-IP addresses that cannot be supported by RFC
   3473 objects.  RFC 3474-3473 interworking would get around
   this issue by carrying the actual tunnel source/endpoint
   identifiers in a separate object and using IP format identifiers
   within the 3473 domain.

5.2  Interworking of Session Object

   The ingress node (i.e., node X of Figure 3)
   maps the Destination TNA sub-object found in the received
   GENERALIZED_UNI object into the IP address of the local
   tunnel endpoint within the 3473 domain, i.e., node Z of

draft-ong-ccamp-3473-3474-iw-00.txt               November 2003


   Figure 3.  This is then used in the RFC 3473 Session object
   sent to other nodes within the 3473 domain.
   The GENERALIZED_UNI object is otherwise passed unchanged
   across the 3473 domain.  It is passed transparently at
   nodes that support RFC 3473 only.

   The egress RFC 3473 node (i.e., node Z of Figure 3)
   then uses the Destination TNA sub-object to determine
   the destination client interface.

5.3  Interworking of the Sender_Template

   The ingress node is itself the local
   tunnel source within the 3473 domain, and therefore puts
   its own IP address in the RFC 3473 Sender_Template object.

5.4  Other Objects

   Other objects may be received at the 3474/3473 interface,
   esp. the Call_ID and Call_OPS objects defined in RFC 3474.
   These are passed transparently across the 3473 domain.


6. Evolution Considerations

   If the additional requirements that generated RFC 3474 are 
   accepted to be requirements that 3473 networks must also
   support, interworking can be simplified by incorporating
   protocol extensions from RFC 3474 that provide needed
   functions, e.g., the Call_ID object, rather than attempting
   to duplicate these functions in alternative ways.
