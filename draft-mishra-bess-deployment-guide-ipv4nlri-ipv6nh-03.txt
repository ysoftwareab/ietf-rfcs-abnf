     Deployment Guidelines for Edge Peering IPv4-NLRI with IPv6-NH
         draft-mishra-bess-deployment-guide-ipv4nlri-ipv6nh-03

Abstract

   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or
   green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-
   BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of the core as well
   as an edge from IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators can now continue to support
   the legacy IPv4, Virtual Private Network (VPN)-IPv4, and Multicast
   VPN-IPv4 customers.

   This document describes the critical use case and OPEX savings of
   being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange usage as a pure
   transport, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the same
   (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session.  By doing so, provides for
   the elimination of Dual Stacking on the Provider Edge - Customer Edge
   connections.  Thus making the eBGP peering IPv6-ONLY to now carry
   both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).

   This document now provides a solution for Internet Exchange Point
   (IXP) that are facing IPv4 address depletion at these peering points
   to use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in [RFC8950] to carry IPv4
   (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI in an IPv6 next hop
   using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft              IPv4 NLRI IPv6NH                  April 2021


1.  Introduction

   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or
   green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport such as MPLS LDPv6, SR-
   MPLSv6 or SRv6, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) now plays an important
   role in the transition of the core from IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators can
   now continue to support legacy IPv4 address family and Sub-Address-
   Family Virtual Private Network (VPN)-IPv4, and Multicast VPN IPv4
   customers.

   IXP are also facing IPv4 address depletion at their peering points,
   which are large Layer 2 transit backbones that service providers peer
   and exchange IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information
   (NLRI).  Today, these transit exchange points are dual stacked.  One
   proposal to solve this issue is to use [RFC8950] to carry IPv4
   (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI in an IPv6 next hop and
   eliminate the IPv4 peering completely using the concept of [RFC5565]
   softwire mesh framework.  So now, with the Multiprotocol Extension
   for Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) MP-REACH capability exchanged
   for an IPv4 AFI/SAFI over an IPv6 next hop peer, we can now advertise
   IPv4(Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI over IPv6 peering
   using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.

   MP-BGP specifies that the set of usable next-hop address families is
   determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent
   Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  Historically the AFI/SAFI
   definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for
   advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when
   advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4.  [RFC8950] specifies the extensions
   necessary to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next
   Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an
   extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the
   Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6
   Protocol.  [RFC8950] defines the encoding of the Next Hop to
   determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and
   a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to discover dynamically
   whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
   Next Hop.

   This new MP-BGP capability exchange allows the BGP peering session to
   act as a pure transport to allow the session to carry AFI and SAFI
   for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Furthermore, a number of these existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop
   to belong to either the IPv4 Network Layer Protocol or the IPv6
   Network Layer Protocol, and specify the encoding of the Next Hop
   information to determine which of the protocols the address actually
   belongs to.  For example, [RFC4684] allows the Next Hop address to be



Mishra, et al.          Expires October 11, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              IPv4 NLRI IPv6NH                  April 2021


   either IPv4 or IPv6 and states that the Next Hop field address shall
   be interpreted as an IPv4 address whenever the length of the Next Hop
   address is 4 octets, and as an IPv6 address whenever the length of
   the Next Hop address is 16 octets.

   The current specification for carrying IPv4 NLRI of a given address
   family via a Next Hop of a different address family is now defined in
   [RFC8950], and specifies the extensions necessary to do so.  This
   comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the
   address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to belong to
   either the IPv4 or the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop
   information to determine which of the protocols the address belongs
   to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP peers to dynamically
   discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN- IPv4 NLRI with
   an IPv6 Next Hop.

   With the new extensions defined in [RFC8950] supporting NLRI and next
   hop address family mismatch, the BGP peer session can now be treated
   as a pure transport and carry both IPv4 and IPv6 NLRI at the Provider
   Edge (PE) - Customer Edge (CE) over a single IPv6 TCP session.  This
   allows for the elimination of dual stack from the PE-CE peering
   point, and now enable the peering to be IPv6-ONLY.  The elimination
   of IPv4 on the PE-CE peering points translates into OPEX expenditure
   savings of point-to-point infrastructure links as well as /31 address
   space savings and administration and network management of both IPv4
   and IPv6 BGP peers.  This reduction decreases the number of PE-CE BGP
   peers by fifty percent, which is a tremendous cost savings for all
   Enterprises and Service Providers.

   While the savings exists at the PE-CE peering, on the core side PE to
   Route Reflector peering carrying <AFI/SAFI> IPv4 <1/1>, VPN-IPV4
   <1/128>, and Multicasat VPN <1/129>, the cost savings nets to a break
   even to be the same as with an IPV4 Core carrying IPv6 NLRI IPV6
   <2/1>, VPN-IPV6 <2/128>, and Multicasat VPN <2/129>.

   This document also provides a possible solution for IXP that are
   facing IPv4 address depletion at these peering points to use BGP-MP
   capability exchange defined in [RFC8950] to carry IPv4 NLRI in an
   IPv6 next hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework concept of
   IPv4 NLRI edge over an IPv6 core.

3.  External BGP PE-CE Peering IPv4 and IPv6 NLRI over a single IPv6
    Next Hop Peer Interoperability Testing

   Today the IPv4 NLRI and IPv6 NLRI are carried over separate BGP
   sessions based on the address family of the NLRI being transported.

   The goal of this document is to provide operators interoperability
   test result data from external BGP PE-CE edge peering between vendors
   Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei.  The goal is also to
   provide critical test results to operators to depict that all the
   features and functionality of carrying IPv4 NLRI over a separate IPv4
   peer that exists today is not only viable but recommended to be
   carried over a single IPv6 peer along with IPv6 NLRI.  Proving to
   operators that this scenario can be accomplished with no loss of
   features and functionality using [RFC8950] IPv6 next hop encoding.

   The test results published from this document provide concrete
   evidence that this is now the Best Practice for Edge peering.  The
   document will be the de-facto standard for operators to now use a
   single PE-CE Edge IPv6 peer to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 NLRI.

   With the use case defined in this document, IPv6 NLRI Unicast SAFI
   along with now the IPv4 NLRI Unicast SAFI, can now being carried by
   the single transport style IPv6 next hop peer.

   This document describes the use case of advertising with IPv4 NLRI
   over IPv6 Next hop with MP_REACH_NLRI with:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 1

   o  Length of Next Hop Address = 16 or 32

   o  Next Hop Address = IPv6 address of next hop (potentially followed
      by the link-local IPv6 address of the next hop).  This field is to
      be constructed as per Section 3 of [RFC2545].

   The BGP speaker receiving the advertisement MUST use the Length of
   Next Hop Address field to determine which network-layer protocol the
   next hop address belongs to.

   Note that this method of using the Length of the Next Hop Address
   field to determine which network-layer protocol the next hop address
   belongs to (out of the set of protocols allowed by the AFI/SAFI
   definition) is the same as used in [RFC4684] and [RFC6074].

4.  RFC 8950 updates to RFC 5549

   This section describes the updates to [RFC8950] next hop encoding
   from [RFC5549].  In [RFC5549] when AFI/SAFI 1/128 is used, the next-
   hop address is encoded as an IPv6 address with a length of 16 or 32
   bytes.  This document modifies how the next-hop address is encoded to
   accommodate all existing implementations and bring consistency with
   VPNv4oIPv4 and VPNv6oIPv6.  The next-hop address is now encoded as a
   VPN-IPv6 address with a length of 24 or 48 bytes [RFC8950] (see
   Sections 3 and 6.2 of this document).  This change addresses Erratum
   ID 5253 (Err5253).  As all known and deployed implementations are
   interoperable today and use the new proposed encoding, the change
   does not break existing interoperability.

   [RFC5549] next hop encoding of MP_REACH_NLRI with:

   o  NLRI= NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition

   Advertising with [RFC4760] MP_REACH_NLRI with:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 128 or 129

   o  Length of Next Hop Address = 16 or 32

   o  NLRI= NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition

   [RFC8950] next hop encoding of MP_REACH_NLRI with:

   o  NLRI= NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition

   Advertising with [RFC4760] MP_REACH_NLRI with:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 128 or 129

   o  Length of Next Hop Address = 24 or 48

   o  Next Hop Address = VPN-IPv6 address of next hop with an 8-octet RD
      set to zero (potentially followed by the link-local VPN-IPv6
      address of the next hop with an 8-octet RD is set to zero).

   o  NLRI= NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition

5.  Operational Improvements with Single IPv6 transport peer

   As Enterprises and Service Providers migrate their IPv4 core to an
   MPLS LDPv6 or SRv6 transport, they must continue to be able to
   support the legacy IPv4 customers.  With the new extensions defined
   in [RFC4760], supporting NLRI and next hop address family mismatch,
   the BGP peer session can now be treated as a pure transport and carry
   both IPv4 and IPv6 NLRI at the PE-CE edge.  This paves the way to now
   eliminate dual stacking on all PE-CE peering points to customers
   making the peering IPv6 only.  With this change, all IPv4 and IPv6
   NLRI will now be carried over a single BGP session.  This also solves
   the dual stack issue with IXP having to maintain separate peering for
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  From an operations perspective the PE-CE edge
   peering will be drastically simplified by eliminating of IPv4 peers
   yielding a reduction of peers by 50 percent.  From an operations
   perspective, prior to elimination of IPv4 peers, an audit is
   recommended to identify and IPv4 and IPv6 peering incongruencies that
   may exist and to rectify them.  No operational impacts or issues are
   expected with this change.

6.  Operational Considerations

   With a single IPv6 Peer carrying both IPv4 and IPv6 NLRI there are
   some operational considerations in terms of what changes and what
   does not change.

   What does not change with a single IPv6 transport peer carrying IPv4
   NLRI and IPv6 NLRI below:

   Routing Policy configuration is still separate for IPv4 and IPv6
   configured by capability as previously.

   Layer 1, Layer 2 issues such as one-way fiber or fiber cut will
   impact both IPv4 and IPv6 as previously.

   If the interface is in the Admin Down state, the IPv6 peer would go
   down, and IPv4 NLRI and IPv6 NLRI would be withdrawn as previously.

   Changes resulting from a single IPv6 transport peer carrying IPv4
   NLRI and IPv6 NLRI below:

   Physical interface is no longer dual stacked.

   Any change in IPv6 address or DAD state will impact both IPv4 and
   IPv6 NLRI exchange.

   Single BFD session for both IPv4 and IPv6 NLRI fate sharing as the
   session is now tied to the transport, which now is only IPv6 address
   family.

   Both IPv4 and IPv6 peer now exists under the IPv6 address family
   configuration.

   Fate sharing of IPv4 and IPv6 address family from a logical
   perspective now carried over a single physical IPv6 peer.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are not any IANA considerations.

8.  Security Considerations

   The extensions defined in this document allow BGP to propagate
   reachability information about IPv6 routes over an MPLS IPv4 core
   network.  As such, no new security issues are raised beyond those
   that already exist in BGP-4 and the use of MP-BGP for IPv6.  The
   security features of BGP and corresponding security policy defined in
   the ISP domain are applicable.  For the inter-AS distribution of IPv6
   routes according to case (a) of Section 4 of this document, no new
   security issues are raised beyond those that already exist in the use
   of eBGP for IPv6 [RFC2545].

Appendix A.  IPv4 NLRI IPv6 Next Hop Vendor Testing

   IPv4 NLRI with IPv6 Next Hop encoding is supported for all BGP peers
   both iBGP and eBGP.

   This section details the vendor support QA testing of RFC 8950 Next
   Hop Encoding for "PE-CE eBGP" using GUA (Global Unicast Address),
   Link Local (LL) peering.  This drafts goal is to first ensure that QA
