             GRASP discovery of Registrar by Join Assistant
               draft-richardson-anima-6join-discovery-00

Abstract

   This document describes an Autonomic System Agent (ASA) that permits
   discovery of a registrar, as well as determination via GRASP if a
   registrar would be willing to consider enrolling a specific node.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.richardson-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join] and
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] describe autonomic protocols
   wherein a New Entity or Pledge is joined to a network.  While the two
   protocols are different, in each case they make use of a helper,
   called the Join Assistant which is a single layer-2 hop from the
   pledge.

   The Join Assistant relays packets to and from the Registrar using a
   circuit proxy, or with an IPIP tunnel.  In order to do this, the Join
   Assistant needs to know the address of the Registrar.

   GRASP has a discovery mechanism that permits the Join Assistant to
   discover the location of the Registrar, and then, it can use the
   negotiation part of the protocol to communicate the existance of the
   new Pledge/New Entity to the Registrar.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

2.  Autonomic System Agent Description

   This ASA has an objective named "6JOIN".

   The objective takes two arguments: the EUI-64 or IID of the new
   pledge, and an enumerated type to indicate the kind of join process
   being pursued.  The current list of join process mechanism are:

   1.  "6p-ipip"

   2.  "https-est"

2.1.  CDDL for objective

    objective = ["6JOIN", objective-flags, loop-count,
                 [IID, join-method]]

    loop-count = 0..255         ; as in the GRASP specification
    objective-flags /=          ; as in the GRASP specification
    IID = bytes .size 8         ; the IID of the New Entity or Pledge
    join-method /= "6p-ipip"    ; the Join method is outgoing CoAP-6p
                                ; with an IPIP encapsulation
    join-method /= "https-est"  ; the Join method is EST over HTTP

3.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This allocates a new entry in the GRASP Objective Names Table with
   the name "6JOIN".
