Abstract 
    
   The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to 
   control different switching technologies as well as different 
   applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections 
   including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). 
    
   This document provides the extensions of the IETF Link State Routing 
   Protocols to meet the routing requirements for an Automatically 
   Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology and 
   requirements developed in [ASON-RR] and the evaluation outcomes 
   detailed in [ASON-EVAL]. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   There are certain capabilities that are needed to support the ITU-T 
   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) control plane 
   architecture as defined in [G.8080]. [ASON-RR] details the routing 
   requirements for the GMPLS suite of routing protocols to support the 
   capabilities and functionality of ASON control planes identified in 
   [G.7715] and in [G.7715.1].  
    
   [ASON-EVAL] evaluates the IETF Link State Routing Protocols against 
   the requirements identified in [ASON-RR]. Candidate routing protocols 
   are IGP (OSPFv2 and IS-IS). 
    
   ASON (Routing) terminology sections are provided in Appendix 1 and 2. 
 
3. Reachability   
    
3.1 OSPFv2 
    
   In order to advertise blocks of reachable address prefixes a 
   summarization mechanism is introduced that complements the 
   techniques described in [OSPF-NODE].  
    
   This extension takes the form of a network mask (a 32-bit number 
   indicating the range of IP addresses residing on a single IP 
   network/subnet). The set of local addresses are carried in an OSPF 
   TE LSA node attribute TLV (a specific sub-TLV is defined per address 
   family, e.g., IPv4 and IPv6). 
 
   The proposed solution is to advertise the local address prefixes of 
   a router as new sub-TLVs of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) Node Attribute top 
   level TLV (of Type TBD). This document defines the following sub-
   TLVs: 
    
        - Node IPv4 Local Prefix sub-TLV: Type 3 - Length: variable 
        - Node IPv6 Local Prefix sub-TLV: Type 4 - Length: variable 
    
3.1.1 Node IPv4 local prefix sub-TLV 
    
   The node IPv4 local prefix sub-TLV has a type of 3 and contains one 
   or more local IPv4 prefixes. It has the following format:

   PrefixLength: length in bits of the prefix.  
    
   PrefixOptions: 8-bit field describing various capabilities 
   associated with the prefix (see [RFC2740] Section A.4.2).  
    
   Address Prefix: encoding of the prefix itself as an even multiple of 
   32-bit words, padding with zero bits as necessary.  
    
   The Length is set to Sum[n][4 + #32-bit words/4] where n is the 
   number of local prefixes included in the sub-TLV. 
    
   The local addresses that can be learned from TE LSAs i.e. router 
   address and TE interface addresses SHOULD not be advertised in the 
   node IPv6 local prefix sub-TLV.  
    
3.2 IS-IS 
    
   A similar mechanism does not exist for IS-IS as the Extended IP 
   Reachability TLV [RFC3784] focuses on IP reachable end-points 
   (terminating points), as its name indicates.   
    
   Solution TBD 
    
4. Link Attribute 
    
4.1 Local Adaptation   
    
   The Local Adaptation is defined as TE link attribute (i.e. sub-TLV) 
   that describes the cross/inter-layer relationships. This information 
   is encoded as an Interface Adaptation Capability Descriptor (IACD). 
       
   In OSPF, the Interface Adaptation Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV 
   (of type TBA) of the Link TLV (of type 2). 
    
   In IS-IS, the Interface Adaptation Capability Descriptor is a sub-
   TLV (of type TBA) of the Extended IS Reachability TLV (of type 22). 
    
4.2 Technology Specific Bandwidth Accounting 
    
   GMPLS Routing defines an Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 
   (ISCD) that delivers among others the information about the 
   (maximum/minimum) bandwidth per priority an LSP can make use of.

   In the ASON context, accounting on per timeslot basis using 32-bit 
   tuples of the form <signal_type (8 bits); number of unallocated 
   timeslots (24 bits)> may optionally extend the technology specific 
   information part of the ISCD sub-TLV. 
    
   In OSPF, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV 
   (of type 15) of the Link TLV (of type 2). 
    
   In IS-IS, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV 
   (of type 21) of the Extended IS Reachability TLV (of type 22). 
     
5. Routing Information Scope 
    
   The Ri is a logical control plane entity that is associated to a 
   control plane "router". The latter is the source for topology 
   information that it generates and shares with other control plane 
   "routers". The Ri is identified by the (advertising) Router_ID. The 
   routing protocol MUST support a single Ri advertising on behalf of 
   more than one Li. Each Li is identified by a unique TE Router ID.  
    
5.1 Link Advertisement (Local and Remote TE Router ID sub-TLV)   
    
   A Router_ID (Ri) advertising on behalf multiple TE Router_ID (Li's) 
   creates a 1:N relationship between the Router_ID and the TE 
   Router_ID. As the link local and link remote (unnumbered) ID 
   association is not unique per node (per Li unicity), the 
   advertisement needs to indicate the remote Lj value and rely on the 
   initial discovery process to retrieve the [Li;Lj] relationship. In 
   brief, as unnumbered links have their ID defined on per Li bases, 
   the remote Lj needs to be identified to scope the link remote ID to 
   the local Li. Therefore, the routing protocol MUST be able to 
   disambiguate the advertised TE links so that they can be associated 
   with the correct TE Router ID. 
    
5.1.1 OSPFv2 
    
   For this purpose, a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top level 
   Link TLV is introduced that defines the local and the remote 
   TE_Router_ID.  
    
   The type of this sub-TLV is 17, and length is eight octets. The 
   value field of this sub-TLV contains four octets of Local TE Router 
   Identifier followed by four octets of Remote TE Router Identifier. 
   The value of the Remote TE Router Identifier SHOULD NOT be set to 0. 
    
   The format of this sub-TLV is the following: 
 
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   This sub-TLV is optional and SHOULD only be included as part of the 
   top level Link TLV if the Router_ID is advertising on behalf of more 
   than one TE_Router_ID. In any other case, this sub-TLV SHOULD be 
   omitted. 
    
   Note: The Link ID sub-TLV that identifies the other end of the link 
   (i.e. Router ID of the neighbor for point-to-point links) MUST 
   appear exactly once per Link TLV. 
    
5.1.2 IS-IS 
    
   TBD 
 
5.1 Reachability Advertisement (Local TE Router ID sub-TLV)   
    
   When the Router_ID advertises on behalf of multiple TE Router_IDs, 
   the routing protocol MUST be able to associate the advertised 
   reachability information with the correct TE Router ID.  
    
5.2.1 OSPFv2 
    
   For this purpose, a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top level 
   Node Attribute TLV is introduced. This TLV associates the local 
   prefixes (sub-TLV 3 and 4, see above) to a given TE Router_ID.  
    
   The type of this sub-TLV is 5, and length is four octets. The value 
   field of this sub-TLV contains four octets of Local TE Router 
   Identifier.  
    
   The format of this sub-TLV is the following: 
 
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   This sub-TLV is optional and SHOULD only be included as part of the 
   Node Attribute TLV if the Router_ID is advertising on behalf of more 
   than one TE_Router_ID. In any other case, this sub-TLV SHOULD be 
   omitted.

Appendix 1: ASON Terminology 
    
   This document makes use of the following terms: 
    
   Administrative domain: (see Recommendation G.805) for the purposes of 
   [G7715.1] an administrative domain represents the extent of resources 
   which belong to a single player such as a network operator, a service 
   provider, or an end-user. Administrative domains of different players 
   do not overlap amongst themselves. 
    
   Control plane: performs the call control and connection control 
   functions. Through signaling, the control plane sets up and releases 
   connections, and may restore a connection in case of a failure. 
    
   (Control) Domain: represents a collection of (control) entities that 
   are grouped for a particular purpose. The control plane is subdivided 
   into domains matching administrative domains. Within an 
   administrative domain, further subdivisions of the control plane are 
   recursively applied. A routing control domain is an abstract entity 
   that hides the details of the RC distribution. 
    
   External NNI (E-NNI): interfaces are located between protocol 
   controllers between control domains. 
    
   Internal NNI (I-NNI): interfaces are located between protocol 
   controllers within control domains. 
    
   Link: (see Recommendation G.805) a "topological component" which 
   describes a fixed relationship between a "subnetwork" or "access 
   group" and another "subnetwork" or "access group". Links are not 
   limited to being provided by a single server trail.  
    
   Management plane: performs management functions for the Transport 
   Plane, the control plane and the system as a whole. It also provides 
   coordination between all the planes. The following management 
   functional areas are performed in the management plane: performance, 
   fault, configuration, accounting and security management 
    
   Management domain: (see Recommendation G.805) a management domain 
   defines a collection of managed objects which are grouped to meet 
   organizational requirements according to geography, technology, 
   policy or other structure, and for a number of functional areas such 
   as configuration, security, (FCAPS), for the purpose of providing 
   control in a consistent manner. Management domains can be disjoint, 
   contained or overlapping. As such the resources within an 
   administrative domain can be distributed into several possible 
   overlapping management domains. The same resource can therefore 
   belong to several management domains simultaneously, but a management 
   domain shall not cross the border of an administrative domain. 
    
   Subnetwork Point (SNP): The SNP is a control plane abstraction that 
   represents an actual or potential transport plane resource. SNPs (in

   different subnetwork partitions) may represent the same transport 
   resource. A one-to-one correspondence should not be assumed. 
    
   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP): A set of SNPs that are grouped together 
   for the purposes of routing. 
    
   Termination Connection Point (TCP): A TCP represents the output of a 
   Trail Termination function or the input to a Trail Termination Sink 
   function. 
 
   Transport plane: provides bi-directional or unidirectional transfer 
   of user information, from one location to another. It can also 
   provide transfer of some control and network management information. 
   The Transport Plane is layered; it is equivalent to the Transport 
   Network defined in G.805 Recommendation. 
    
   User Network Interface (UNI): interfaces are located between protocol 
   controllers between a user and a control domain. Note: there is no 
   routing function associated with a UNI reference point.

Appendix 2: ASON Routing Terminology 
    
   This document makes use of the following terms: 
    
   Routing Area (RA): a RA represents a partition of the data plane and 
   its identifier is used within the control plane as the representation 
   of this partition. Per [G.8080] a RA is defined by a set of sub-
   networks, the links that interconnect them, and the interfaces 
   representing the ends of the links exiting that RA. A RA may contain 
   smaller RAs inter-connected by links. The limit of subdivision 
   results in a RA that contains two sub-networks interconnected by a 
   single link. 
    
   Routing Database (RDB): repository for the local topology, network 
   topology, reachability, and other routing information that is updated 
   as part of the routing information exchange and may additionally 
   contain information that is configured. The RDB may contain routing 
   information for more than one Routing Area (RA). 
    
   Routing Components: ASON routing architecture functions. These 
   functions can be classified as protocol independent (Link Resource 
   Manager or LRM, Routing Controller or RC) and protocol specific 
   (Protocol Controller or PC).  
    
   Routing Controller (RC): handles (abstract) information needed for 
   routing and the routing information exchange with peering RCs by 
   operating on the RDB. The RC has access to a view of the RDB. The RC 
   is protocol independent. 
    
   Note: Since the RDB may contain routing information pertaining to 
   multiple RAs (and possibly to multiple layer networks), the RCs 
   accessing the RDB may share the routing information. 
    
   Link Resource Manager (LRM): supplies all the relevant component and 
   TE link information to the RC. It informs the RC about any state 
   changes of the link resources it controls. 
    
   Protocol Controller (PC): handles protocol specific message exchanges 
   according to the reference point over which the information is 
   exchanged (e.g. E-NNI, I-NNI), and internal exchanges with the RC. 
   The PC function is protocol dependent.
