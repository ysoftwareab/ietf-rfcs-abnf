Internet-Draft           XMPP Presence Analysis             January 2008


1.  Introduction

   Presence is information about the network availability of an
   individual (or, more precisely, of a presence address of the kind
   that is often but not necessarily associated with an individual).  As
   typically designed and deployed, presence is shared only with
   authorized entities, where the authorization takes the form of a
   subscription.  (In this document, we employ the term "user" to
   signify an account that generates presence information and the term
   "contact" to signify an annount that is subscribed to the user's
   presence.)

   The sharing of basic presence information can result in a large
   volume of traffic as users log on or off throughout the life of a
   presence session, especially for users with large numbers of contacts
   (e.g., the author of this document has over 1,700 contacts in his
   presence-enabled contact list).  The volume is increased by
   communication of information beyond basic on-off network
   availability, such as availability substates (e.g., "away" and "do
   not disturb").  The volume is further increased if the presence
   "transport" is used to communicate information such as device
   capabilities, geolocation, mood, activity, even the music to which a
   user is listening.

   Such traffic may be a concern even in a standalone presence domain.
   However, when presence is shared across domain boundaries through
   presence "federation", then such traffic may introduce a more
   significant impact on the functioning of the Internet as a whole.
   Therefore it is important to analyze the traffic generated during
   interdomain communication of presence information.  This document
   provides such an analysis regarding the Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol (XMPP) as defined in [XMPP-CORE] and [XMPP-IM].


2.  Assumptions

   The XMPP presence model is based on the following assumptions:

   1.   A user shares presence only with a contact whom the user has
        explicitly authorized via a presence subscription.
   2.   Presence subscriptions are long-lived: they last across presence
        sessions and indeed as long as the user and contact maintain
        their XMPP accounts (until and unless the subscription is
        cancelled by one of the parties).
   3.   The typical subscription state is a bidirectional subscription
        from the contact to the user and from the user to the contact
        (so that both entities can view each other's presence).

   4.   Users have presence sessions, i.e., times in which they
        advertise their network availability to their contacts.
   5.   Not all registered users have an active presence session at any
        one time.  In typical usage patterns, the number of online users
        is some percentage of the number of registered users.  Within an
        organization, the precentage might be as high as 50%.  At a
        consumer-oriented provider of presence-enabled communication
        services, the percentage might be 10% or less.
   6.   A presence session is initiated when a user's client sends an
        initial presence notification to its server, expressing network
        availability.
   7.   Upon receiving the initial presence notification, a user's
        server broadcasts that presence notification to all of the
        user's contacts and also sends a presence probe to all of the
        user's contacts.
   8.   Upon receiving a presence probe, a contact's server checks the
        contact's authorization policies and, if the user is authorized
        and the contact is online, sends a presence notification to the
        probing user.
   9.   During the life of the user's presence session, any subsequent
        changes to the user's presence information are broadcasted via
        presence notifications sent by the user's server to the user's
        online contacts.
   10.  Presence notifications are not acknowledged by the recipient.
   11.  Presence notifications are generated by a user's client only to
        advertise on-off network availability, availability sub-states
        (e.g., "away" or "do not disturb") as defined in [XMPP-IM], or
        information related to the communication capabilities of the
        user's XMPP client (see [CAPS]).  Any other real-time
        notifications (a user's activity or mood, the music to which a
        user is listening, the games a user is playing, etc.) are not
        sent via the XMPP presence "transport" but instead are published
        using non-presence technologies such as the XMPP Publish-
        Subscribe extension [PUBSUB], in particular the Personal
        Eventing profile thereof (see [PEP]).
   12.  A presence session is terminated when a user's client sends an
        unavailable presence notification to its server or the server
        detects that the client is no longer online; in either case the
        user's server broadcasts an unavailable presence notification to
        all of the user's online contacts.


3.  Protocol Flows

   A user (in these examples romeo@example.net) initiates a presence
   session by sending an initial presence notification.  To provide a
   realistic example, this presence notification includes entity
   capabilities information as defined in [CAPS].



Saint-Andre               Expires July 19, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           XMPP Presence Analysis             January 2008


   User sends initial presence notification (200 bytes):

   <presence from='romeo@example.net/orchard'>
     <priority>5</priority>
     <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
        hash='sha-1'
        node='http://www.chatopus.com'
        ver='zHyEOgxTrkpSdGcQKH8EFPLsriY='/>
   </presence>

   Upon receiving the initial presence notification, the user's server
   sends an XMPP presence stanza of type "probe" to the contact (in
   these examples juliet@example.com).

   User's server sends presence probe to contact (82 bytes):

   <presence
       from='romeo@example.net/orchard'
       to='juliet@example.com'
       type='probe'/>

   If the contact's server determines that the user is authorized to see
   the contact's presence, the contact's server returns the contact's
   current presence state to the user.  Here again the presence
   notification includes entity capabilities information.

   Contact's server sends presence notification to user (311 bytes):

   <presence
       from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
       to='romeo@example.net/orchard'
       xml:lang='en'>
     <show>away</show>
     <status>be right back</status>
     <priority>0</priority>
     <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
        hash='sha-1'
        node='http://code.google.com/p/exodus'
        v='0.9.1'
        ver='8RovUdtOmiAjzj+xI7SK5BCw3A8='/>
   </presence>

   If the contact subsequently changes her presence, the contact's
   server sends an updated presence notification to the user.

Internet-Draft           XMPP Presence Analysis             January 2008


   Contact's server sends updated presence to user (301 bytes):

   <presence
       from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
       to='romeo@example.net/orchard'
       xml:lang='en'>
     <show>xa</show>
     <status>bbiab</status>
     <priority>0</priority>
     <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
        hash='sha-1'
        node='http://code.google.com/p/exodus'
        v='0.9.1'
        ver='8RovUdtOmiAjzj+xI7SK5BCw3A8='/>
   </presence>

   A presence session can include any number of subsequent presence
   changes.

   When the user goes offline, the user's server sends a presence stanza
   of type "unavailable" to the contact.

   User's server sends unavailable presence to contact (96 bytes):

   <presence
       from='romeo@example.net/orchard'
       to='juliet@example.com/balcony'
       type='unavailable'/>

   Naturally, similar protocol flows are generated by the contact during
   her presence session.


4.  Analysis

   Traffic calculations are based on the following inputs and formulae.

4.1.  Constants

   o  (C1) Presence session lifetime in hours -- assumed to be 8 hours
      in all scenarios.
   o  (C2) Presence state changes per hour -- assumed to be 3 times per
      hour in most scenarios.
   o  (C3) Total federated contacts per user -- varies according to the
      scenario.
   o  (C4) Number of online contacts -- varies according to the
      scenario.

Internet-Draft           XMPP Presence Analysis             January 2008


   o  (C5) Number of federated users -- varies according to the
      scenario.
   o  (C6) Number of online users -- varies according to the scenario.
   o  (C7) Size of presence probe sent by user's server upon receipt of
      initial outbound presence notification -- 100 bytes.
   o  (C8) Size of presence notifications sent by users and contacts --
      300 bytes.
   o  (C9) Size of unavailable presence notifications -- 100 bytes.

4.2.  Initial Stanzas

   When a user initiates a presence session, the following presence
   stanzas are exchanged.

   o  (I1) Number of outbound presence notifications = 1 per federated
      contact (C3).
   o  (I2) Size of outbound presence notifications = (C3*C8).
   o  (I3) Number of presence probes = one per federated contact (C3).
   o  (I4) Size of presence probes = (C3*C7).
   o  (I5) Number of inbound presence notifications = 1 per online
      contact (C4).
   o  (I6) Size of inbound presence notifications = (C4*C8).
   o  (I7) Total number of initial stanzas = (I1+I3+I5).
   o  (I8) Total size of initial stanzas = (I2+I4+I6).

4.3.  State-Change Stanzas

   During the life of a user's presence session, the following presence
   stanzas are exchanged as a result of changes in the user's
   availability.

   o  (S1) Number of presence state changes per user = (C1*C2)-2).
   o  (S2) Number of outbound presence notifications = (S1*C4).
   o  (S3) Size of presence notifications = (S2*C8).

4.4.  Termination Stanzas

   When a user terminates a presence session, the following presence
   stanzas are exchanged.

   o  (T1) Number of unavailable presence notifications = 1 per online
      contact (C4).
   o  (T2) Size of unavailable presence notifications = (C4*C9).

4.5.  Bottom Line

   The foregoing assumptions result in the following number and size of
   stanzas exchanged per user per presence session.

Internet-Draft           XMPP Presence Analysis             January 2008


   o  (B1) Number of stanzas exchanged per presence session =
      (I7+S2+T1).
   o  (B2) Size of stanzas exchanged per presence session = (I8+S3+T2).

   Therefore the total number and size of stanzas exchanged between two
   federated domains is as follows (i.e., summed for all online users).

   o  (B3) Total number of stanzas exchanged = (B1*C6).
   o  (B4) Total size of stanzas exchanged = (B2*C6).
   o  (B5) Total stanzas exchanged per second = (B3/(C1*3600)).
   o  (B6) Total bytes exchanged per second = (B4/(C1*3600)).


5.  Scenarios

5.1.  Enterprises in Different Industries

   This scenario assumes two domains, each with 20,000 users, where each
   user has 4 contacts in the other domain, each user changes presence 3
   times per hour during an 8-hour presence session, and 50% of the
   users are online at any one time.  Such a scenario might be
   applicable to presence federation between two medium-sized
   enterprises in different industries.

6.  Optimizations

   This document does not focus on optimizations that can be applied to
   XMPP traffic.  The main such optimization is compression of XML
   streams.  There are several reasons why stream compression can yield
   significant reductions in the network impact of XMPP traffic,
   especially in the case of interdomain federation:

   1.  XMPP uses long-lived TCP connections in which (typically) a
       single XML parser instance is used to parse the incoming and
       outgoing XML stanzas.
   2.  The fact that XMPP stanzas are XML means that the same strings
       are repeatedly communicated over the stream (e.g., the string
       "<presence from='>), resulting in effective use of compression
       dictionaries.

   Compression of XML streams can be provided via native TLS compression
   at the transport layer (see [XMPP-CORE]) or via XMPP stream
   compression at the application layer (see [COMPRESS]).  Based on both
   testing and real-world experience, it appears that these compression
   methods can result in compressed traffic that is 10% the size of pre-
   compressed traffic.


7.  Comparison With Other Presence Technologies

   This document does not provide a formal comparison of XMPP to other
   presence technologies.  A similar analysis for presence systems based
   on the Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] as defined in [SIP-PRES] is
   provided in [PROBLEM].


8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces and addresses no security concerns above and
   beyond those already defined in [XMPP-CORE] and [XMPP-IM].
