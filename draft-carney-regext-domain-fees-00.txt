1.  Introduction

   This document defines the file format for the storage of non-standard
   domain name fees and related details for a top level domain name
   registry, designed to facilitate interoperability and reusability
   among domain name registries and registrars.

   The increased number of domain name registries and registrars, the
   greater number of registration fees for domain names in a single Top
   Level Domain (TLD), and to make accommodations for possible real-time
   communications issues between registries and registrars has driven
   the need for this standard sharable file.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  General File Format Elements

   File format will be a comma separated values (CSV) file and MUST use
   the US-ASCII character set.  See informational RFC 4180 and RFC 7111
   for details on the CSV file format.

   Filename has two forms depending on content.  For a file containing
   only a list of domain names in one Top Level Domain (TLD) the
   filename MUST be <TLD>-nonstandardnames-<YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss>.csv.  For
   a file containing a list of domain names in multiple Top Level
   Domains (TLDs) the filename MUST be nonstandardnames-<YYYY-MM-
   DDThhmmss>.csv.  For an IDN TLD <TLD> MUST be ace-encoded (i.e. in
   the "xn--" format).  Additionally, <YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss> MUST be the
   date and time (in UTC) the file was created.

Internet-Draft                 Domain Fees                     June 2016


   The first row MUST be the column headings: TLD, Domain Name, Status,
   Description, Currency, Domain Create Fee (Yearly), Domain Renew Fee
   (Yearly), Domain Transfer Fee (Yearly), Domain Restore Fee (per
   Restore), Effective Date.  The remaining rows will contain the data
   (all unavailable names) from the registry in the following structure:
   <TLD>, <Domain Name>, <Status>, <Description>, <Currency>, <Domain
   Create Fee (Yearly)>, <Domain Renew Fee (Yearly)>, <Domain Transfer
   Fee (Yearly)>, <Domain Restore Fee (per Restore)>, <Effective Date>.
   Where <TLD> is the TLD of the domain name, <Domain Name> is the
   string of characters that represent the domain name, <Status> is one
   of five values (REGISTRY REGISTERED, REGISTERED, AVAILABLE, REGISTRY
   RESERVED, POLICY RESERVED), <Description> is the descriptive name for
   the premium tier to which the name is allocated, <Currency> is the
   ISO 4217 Alpha Currency Code for the currency required by the EPP
   commands used with the SRS, <Domain Create Fee (Yearly)> is the
   1-year Initial Registration fee to the Registrar incurred on a 1-year
   domain create EPP command and does not reflect any marketing or
   rebate reductions, <Domain Renew Fee (Yearly)> is the 1-year renewal
   fee to the Registrar incurred on a 1-year domain renewal EPP command
   and does not reflect any marketing or rebate reductions, <Domain
   Transfer Fee (Yearly)> is the fee to the Registrar that is incurred
   when the domain is transferred between Registrars, <Domain Restore
   Fee (per Restore)> is the fee to the Registrar to restore a domain
   that is in the Redemption Period, <Effective Date> is the date and
   time the fee listed will go into effect in UTC time using the
   combined date/time format from ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ).  If
   the <TLD> and/or <Domain Name> is an IDN it MUST be ace-encoded (i.e.
   in the "xn--" format).

3.3.  Fee Change File Example

   If the fee for a domain name is changing or moving to reserved or
   unreserved in the future, there SHOULD be two entries for the name:
   an entry for the current fee and status of the name (This entry will
   be removed once the change takes place.) and an entry for the future
   fee of the name with the effective date in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ
   format.

   Example of a file that contains a future fee change.

   FileName: nonstandardnames-2016-05-01T010000.csv

      TLD,Domain Name,Status,Description,Currency,Domain Create Fee
      (Yearly),Domain Renew Fee (Yearly),Domain Transfer Fee
