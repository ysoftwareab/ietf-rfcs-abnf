    Open Source Software Manifest Retrieval from a Headless Device 
                     draft-beese-opsawg-ossman-00


Abstract

   In commercial embedded systems utilizing open source, there are legal
   requirements to make open source software utilized in a product
   known.  Headless devices have no UI to display an open source
   manifest.  Additionally, printed manuals become out of date as
   software updates occur throughout the product lifetime.  This
   standard intends to create a common method of retrieving open source
   manifests directly from an embedded device utilizing Ethernet or Wi-
   Fi.

INTERNET DRAFT   O.S.S. Manifests from Headless Devices   March 31, 2016


1  Introduction

   To comply with various governmental legal requirements around using
   open source software, it is fairly routine to make open source
   software manifests available to anyone asking for it.  On devices
   with built-in displays, the display can visually present the user
   with an open source manifest.  However, on headless devices, another
   mechanism must be used.

   This draft outlines a few methods make the open source mainfest
   readily available through the embedded device's communications ports.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   O.S.S. stands for Open Source Software.

2.  Protocol

   If the device has an ethernet connection, the user may attach a
   mobile device to the device utilizing ethernet.  Likewise, if Wi-Fi
   is in use, the user could attach a mobile device to the same Access
   Point the device is on [or attach to the embedded device acting as an
   access point].  

   To remove the reliance on IP addressing schemes, a multicast address
   and associated UDP port number is suggested:  239.79.83.83
   [239.O.S.S] and port YYYYY.

   A request from the client to port YYYYY on 239.79.83.83 with any
   payload will trigger a multicast reply to the same multicast IP
   address on 239.79.83.83 and port YYYYY containing a JSON document:


      {"oss": {
        "<Package Name>": {
          "Version": "<Version>",
          "License Type": "<License Type>",
          "URL": "<URL>",
          [...]
          }
        "<Package Name2>": {
          "Version": "<Version>",
          "License Type": "<License Type>",
          "URL": "<URL>",
          [...]
          }
      }}

   The user's mobile device may collect all responses from any devices
   on a subnet and display results to the user.


3  Security Considerations

   UDP listening port only listens for multicast on port XXXXX.  Replies
   can be throttled to only allow Y datagrams per second to prevent
   flooding attacks.


4  IANA Considerations

   Port number XXXXX should be reserved for this protocol standard.
   Multicast IP Address 239.79.83.83 should be reserved for this
   protocol standard.
