  Using transport layer security (TLS) with DSA and ECDSA ciphersuites
                   draft-mavrogiannopoulos-tls-dss-01

   (DSA) with extended key lengths, in the transport layer security

Internet-Draft           TLS with DSA and ECDSA                June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The TLS protocols support the DSA algorithm even from its first
   incarnation in [RFC2246].  However the latest DSA publication from
   NIST at [DSS], suggests some changes that do not straightforwardly
   apply to the TLS protocols.

   In this document we describe the differences on the new DSS
   algorithms[DSS], and define a profile for TLS implementations.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the same notation and terminology used in the TLS
   Protocol specification [RFC5246].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DSA in FIPS-186-3

   In this section we discuss the differences between the old DSS
   publication [OLDDSS] and the new one [DSS], that justify the need for
   a TLS profile.

   DSA parameters include a prime modulus p and a prime divisor of p-1
   called q.  In [OLDDSS] the bit length of p was fixed to 1024 bits,
   the length of q to 160 bits and the underlying hash algorithm was
   fixed to SHA-1.  However the DSA algorithm in [DSS] allows more
   lengths for p and q, as well different hash algorithms, than the
   older version which is currently referred by TLS protocols.

   The new document relies on the "bits of security" term defined in
   [SP800-57], and recommends that security strength of the hash
   algorithm matches the security strength of other DSA parameters.  It
   is required either the bits of the hash algorithm to match the bits
   of length of q (N), or if the hash size is larger, only the N
   leftmost bits of the hash output are being used.  The corresponding
   mappings are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

4.  The SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols

4.1.  DSA

   The SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols support ciphersuites that
   utilize the DSA algorithms for signing.  The digital signatures are
   used for the "Server key exchange" and "Certificate verify" messages.
   In those messages there is no indication of the signature algorithm
   used, thus the selection is implicit.  The signature contained in
   both messages is defined, for the DSA algorithm, as:

          select (SignatureAlgorithm)
          {
              case dsa:
                  digitally-signed struct {
                      opaque sha_hash[20];
                  };
          } Signature;

   This structure refers to the DSA algorithm with L=1024 and N=160, but
   this is not an explicit requirement of those protocols and several
   existing implementations are using the SHA-1 algorithm for all DSA

   key sizes.  For this reason it is RECOMMENDED not to use DSA keys of
   sizes other than L=1024 and N=160 in combination with those
   protocols.

   If however keys of sizes larger than L=1024 and N=160 have to be
   used, then the SHA-1 algorithm has to be used.

4.2.  ECDSA

   For TLS negotiation to proceed smoothly when an ECDSA enabled
   ciphersuite is negotiated both parties must agree to a curve.
   However given that [RFC4492] lists a very large number of curves but
   doesn't recommend any, it is unclear which curves should be used in
   certificates for TLS.

   To improve interoperability implementations SHOULD use certificates
   with curves restricted to the recommended by [RFC5480].  Those are
   summarized in Table 3.

                               +-----------+
                               |   Curve   |
                               +-----------+
                               | secp224r1 |
                               | secp256r1 |
                               | secp384r1 |
                               | secp521r1 |
                               +-----------+

                                  Table 3

5.  The TLS protocol 1.2

   This version of the protocol also requires signatures for the "Server
   key exchange" and "Certificate verify" messages.  However in this
   version signature algorithm negotiation is explicit via the
   "Signature algorithms" extension.  The signature used is as below:

         struct {
            SignatureAndHashAlgorithm algorithm;
            opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
         } DigitallySigned;

   It is however desirable for interoperability reasons to restrict the
   available options.  This would allow constrained clients to support
   only the required algorithms, and servers that do not cache all
   messages up to "Certificate verify" in order to calculate the
   signature, to carry a single hash state instead.

5.1.  DSA

   In this case a signature algorithm should be selected that matches
   the requirements as in Table 4.  Implementations SHOULD select the
   algorithms shown on that table.

   |  Length of p |  Length of q |    Hash    |  Hash  |   Truncated   |

   |     1024     |      160     |    SHA-1   |   20   |       20      |
   |     2048     |      224     |   SHA-256  |   32   |       28      |
   |     2048     |      256     |   SHA-256  |   32   |       32      |
   |     3072     |      256     |   SHA-256  |   32   |       32      |
   +--------------+--------------+------------+--------+---------------+

                                  Table 4

   Note: When the hash size does not match the length of q, then only
   the leftmost bytes of the hash, that match the length of q, are used.
   This is indicated in the "Truncated hash size" column of the table.

5.1.1.  Parameters not allowed by DSS

   TLS implementations MUST NOT support parameter lengths not allowed by
   [DSS].  If illegal parameters are encountered, the handshake should
   be aborted using an "illegal_parameter" alert.

5.2.  ECDSA

   The signature hash algorithm SHOULD be selected in way that matches
   the requirements of Table 5.  Also implementations SHOULD use
   certificates with curves restricted to the recommended by [RFC5480].
   Those are summarized in Table 3.

   +----------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------+

                                  Table 5

   Note: As with DSA, when the hash size does not match the curve key
   size, only the leftmost bytes of the hash are used.  This size is
   shown in the "Truncated hash size" column of the table.

6.  Security Considerations

   When DSA keys are being used in connections that involve the SSL 3.0,
   TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 protocols then the entire connection security
   depends on the SHA-1 algorithm.  This is about 80-bits of security
   irrespective of the sizes of the DSA keys.

   All security considerations discussed in [RFC5246], apply to this
   document.
