Abstract


   There are applications which require additional attributes to
   be advertised with an OSPF route. The existing OSPF LSA
   formats do not allow for backward compatible extension to advertise
   these attributes. This draft proposes an extension to OSPF for 
   advertising additional attributes which will be associated with an
   OSPF route.

1. Motivation


   There are applications which require the advertisement of
   additional attributes associated with an OSPF route. Examples 
   of such applications include: 


   o Association of an administrative tag with an intra-area or
     inter-area route.


   o For Nexthop FRR [NHOPFRR], advertising the next hop of an 
     inter-area route.


   o Indication that the route corresponds to a loopback interface.

2. OSPF Route Attributes (RA) Opaque LSA
     
   OSPF routers will optionally advertise additional route attributes
   (RA) in an area-scoped or AS-scoped opaque-LSA [OPAQUE]. The 
   advertising OSPF router will originate an area-scoped (type 10) 
   opaque LSA to associate additional attributes with a route 
   advertised in a router-LSA (type 1), network-LSA (type 2), 
   summary-LSAs (type 3 or type 4) or NSSA-LSA (type 7). An 
   AS-scoped (type 11) Opaque-LSA will be originated to associate 
   additional attributes with a route advertised in an 
   AS-external-LSA (type 5).
   For certain applications the additional route attributes may only 
   need to be advertised to a adjacent neighbor, in this case 
   a link-scoped (type 9) opaque LSA may be originated in place of 
   an area-scoped (type 10) or AS-scoped (type 11) opaque LSA.
    
   The Route Attributes LSA will have an Opaque type of 5 and a 
   unique ID.

    Reference LSA ID
        The LSA ID for the LSA advertising the IPv4 prefix. The 
        advertising router is not required to be respecified since
        an OSPF router may not use this LSA to associate additional 
        attributes with LSAs that it does not originate.


    IPv4 Address
        The IPv4 address which requires association of additional 
        attributes. For OSPF router routes advertised in 
        Summary-ASBR LSAs, this will be the router ID.


    The format of the TLV's within the body of a route attributes LSA 
    is the same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering 
    Extensions to OSPF [OSPF-TE].  The LSA payload consists of one or
    more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplets.  The format of 
    each TLV is:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                            Value...                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


             Figure 2. TLV Format


    The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
    (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of zero). The
    TLV is padded to four-octet alignment;  padding is not included in
    the length field (so a three octet value would have a length of
    three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).  Nested
    TLV's are also 32-bit aligned.  For example, a one byte value
    would have the length field set to 1, and three bytes of padding
    would be added to the end of the value portion of the TLV.
    Unrecognized types are ignored.

2.1 OSPF Route Tag TLV


   The first defined TLV in the body of an RA opaque LSA is 
   the Route Tag TLV. It allows one or more tags to be associated with
   a given OSPF routes. Its use is optional.


   The format of the Route Tag TLV is as follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o                                                               o

                Figure 4. OSPF Router Capabilities TLV



   Type        A 16 bit field set to 1. 
   Length      A 16 bit field that indicates the length of the value 
               portion in bytes.  The value will be N * 4 where N is the
               number of advertised tags.  The maximum number of tags
               that can be associated with a route is TBD.  
   Value       The value is comprised of one or more tags.  The use of 
               the tags is beyond the scope of this document but can be 
               used for applications such as marking a particular route
               for a specific action or preference.

2.2 OSPF Inter-Area Route Attribute TLV


   This Inter-Area Route Attribute TLV in RA opaque LSA is to
   allow the area border routers (ABRs) to advertise certain
   route attributes related to topology information in another
   area. For example, the ABR can advertise the nexthop
   OSPF node for an inter-area prefix. This can be used for
   Nexthop FRR of IP traffic in inter-area node protection case.
   Its use is optional.


   The format of the Inter-area Route Attribute TLV is as follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3

   Type        A 16 bit field set to 2. 
   Length      A 16 bit field that indicates the length of the value 
               portion in bytes.  The value will be N * 8 where N is the

   Value       The value is comprised of one or more route attributes.
               It has an Attribute Flag field, a Reserved field and
               a Router-ID field.

         Bits       Description
    
            N       Nexthop Bit. If set, the router advertising this
                    IP prefix with this TLV uses router specified  
                    in the Router-ID field as the nexthop node.    
  
            O       Origination Bit. If set, the router advertising this
                    IP prefix with this TLV had learnt this prefix
                    from the router specified in the Router-ID field.


            B       Non-Best Path Bit. The N bit and B bit are mutually
                    exclusive. If set, the ABR advertising this this TLV
                    does not consider router specified in the Router-ID
                    field to be on the IGP best path to reach the
                    IP prefix. 


   Router-ID    This is a 32-bit number representing the router which
                can be used to forward traffic towards the destination
                for the prefixes.


   The list may contain multiple (Attribute Flag, Router-ID) tuples to
   handle ECMP or non-ECMP cases. 


   If this TLV is being used in support of node protection, the RA 
   opaque LSA containing the Nexthop attributes need only be flooded
   using a link-scoped (type 9) LSA. 


3. Operation of OSPF Routers Originating the RA Opaque LSA


   OSPF routers originating an RA opaque LSA should directly correlate
   the existence with the reference LSA.  In other words, the RA opaque
   LSA MUST only be originated when the referenced LSA has been 
   originated and should purge (i.e., MaxAged) the RA opaque LSA when 
   the referenced LSA is purged.  Reoriganation of either the 
   referenced LSA or the RA opaque LSA do require reorignation of the 
   other (unless of course, the underlying reason for the reorgination 
   affects both).

Internet Draft    draft-lindem-ospf-route-attr-00.txt          Jun 2004


4. Operation of OSPF Routers 


   OSPF routers supporting the RA opaque LSA MUST find the 
   reference LSA and associate the received LSA with the reference 
   LSA.  If the reference LSA is chosen as the best path during the
   SPF computation [OSPF] then the additional attributes in the RA 
   opaque LSA will be associated with the route and handled in an 
   application specific manner. In essence, the RA opaque LSA and the
   LSA it references are concatentated.


   In the case of ECMP with more than one of the contributing LSAs
   having route attributes, the route will have a superset of optional 
   route attributes.  In the case of conflicting route attributes, 
   the route will inherit the attributes the LSA with the highest 
   advertising router ID.


5. Operation of OSPF Area Border Routers 


   OSPF Area Border Routers (ABRs) supporting RA opaque LSAs will 
   be required to originate an RA opaque LSA whenever they propagate 
   routes with additional attributes from one area to another.  This 
   implies that the ABR will:


     1. Originate an RA area-scoped opaque LSA when it originates 
        a summary LSA (type 3 or 4) for an intra-area or inter-area 
        route with additional attributes.


     2. Originate an RA AS-scoped opaque LSA when it originates 
        an AS external LSA corresponding to a translated NSSA route 
        with additional attributes.


     3. Originate an RA area-scoped opaque LSA when it originates
        a summary LSA for an area range and policy dictates that the
        ABR should associate additional attributes with the 
        area range.


     4. Originate an RA AS-scoped opaque LSA when it originates
        an AS external LSA for an NSSA area range and policy dictates 
        that the ABR should associate additional attributes with the 
        NSSA area range.

6. OSPFv3 Route Attribute LSA


   For OSPFv3 [OSPFV3], the OSPFv3 Route Attributes (RA) LSA will be 
   similiar to the OSPF opaque LSA. It will have it's own OSPFv3 
   LSA function code assigned by IANA. The U bit will always 1 and
   and S1 and S2 bits will be the same as the referenced LSA type.  
   Optionally, a link-scoped LSA may be orignated when the route 
   attributes need not be propagated beyond immediate neighbors.

             Figure 1. OSPF Route Attributes LSA


    Reference LSA Type
        The type for the LSA advertising the IPv6 prefix. The 
        reference LSA type may be 0x2001-0x2005, 0x2007, 0x2009,
        of 0x0008.


    Prefix Length
        The number of significant bits in the IPv6 address. For 
        router routes, a length of 32 MUST be specified.

    Reference LSA ID
        The LSA ID for the LSA advertising the IPv6 prefix. The 
        advertising router is not required to be respecified since
        an OSPFv3 router may not use this LSA to associate additional 
        attributes with LSAs that it does not originate.


    IPv6 Address
        The IPv6 address which requires association of additional 
        attributes. IPv6 Address Prefix is an encoding of the prefix 
        itself as an even multiple of 32-bit words,  padding with zero 
        bits as necessary; this encoding consumes (Prefix Length 
        + 31) / 32) 32-bit words. For OSPFv3 router routes advertised 
        in Inter-Area-Router-LSAs, this will be the router ID.


6.1 Operation of OSPFv3 Area Border Routers


   OSPFv3 Area Border Routers (ABRs) supporting RA LSAs will 
   be required to originate an RA LSA whenever they propagate 
   routes with additional attributes from one area to another. 
   The rules documented in Section 5 apply to Inter-Area-Prefix-LSAs,
   Inter-Area-Router-LSAs, and NSSA LSAs.


6.2 Operation of OSPFv3 Designated Routers


   Operation of OSPFv3 Routers acting as a DR is similar to OSPFv3 
   ABRs in that they will propagate route attributes associated with
   the prefixes advertised in the intra-area-prefix-LSA referencing
   the DR's network LSA.


7. Security Consideration


   This memo does not create any new security issues for the OSPF
   protocol.  Security considerations for the base OSPF protocol are
   covered in [OSPF]. Security considerations for OSPFv3 are covered
   in [OSPFV3].


8. Acknowledgments
   
   TBD.

9. IANA Considerations


   A new OSPF opaque LSA type and OSPFv3 LSA function code will need 
   to be assigned by IANA.  Additionally, IANA will need to have 
   registries for the Route attributes LSA TLV's.  The TLV assignee 
   will be responsible for allocation of any sub-TLV's for the IANA 
   assigned TLV.  All TLV's and sub-TLV's will be subject to OSPF 
   WG review.
