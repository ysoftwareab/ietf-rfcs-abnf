Abstract

   There are places in building SIP [2] based communications systems
   where it is useful to have a stable identifier for particular user
   agents that are used for user communications. This draft defines a
   convention for names that can be used to satisfy these needs.

1. Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].

2. Introduction and Use Cases

   There are a few cases in which it is convenient to be able to
   identify instances of a user agent. Some examples are described. They
   all require the name to be stable across reboots of the device.

      In the config framework[4], a user agent sends a subscribe to
      fetch its configuration.  It needs to get the same configuration
      each time.

      A particular user, Alice, has several user agents that all
      register as Alice. A registrar wishes to report which user agent
      are currently registered to a network management system. For this
      reporting to make sense, each of Alice's user agents must have a
      stable name.

      A system that is using the dialog package to monitor a particular
      user agent would like to be able to assign an alias like "My
      Office Phone" for display purposes to that particular user agent.

      When several presence user agents are providing presence data, it
      must be possible to correlate a particular set of data with the
      particular device that provided it.

   In all these cases, the user agent could be a software program
   running on a computer with more than one user.

3. Requirements

   The identifier needs to be unique.

   Identifiers are needed for user agents that are in dedicated pieces
   of hardware such as IP phones.

   Identifiers are needed for software user agents running on multi-user
   computers.

   In some of the cases with IP phones, it is desirable for this same
   identifier to be recorded as a bar code on the outside of the box
   that the IP phone comes in.

4. Solution

   User agents that follow the convention of this document MUST put a
   unique identifier in a new tag, called "instance", of the Contact
   header when sending a SIP request. They MAY omit this for a
   particular sequence of SIP messages if the user has requested it be
   removed for privacy reasons.

   The unique identifier has no real semantic information other than
   uniqueness. In cases in which the user agent runs on a single
   computer and this is the only user agent on that computer, the MAC
   address of the primary network card is the preferred identifier.  In
   cases in which it is impossible to use the MAC address, then when the
   user agent is first run, it should generate a random 64 bit number
   and use this as the identifier. It MUST store this number in some non
   volatile storage that is stable over reboots and power outages. The
   user agent SHOULD use the same instance identifier tag even if it is
   registering different AOR or contacts.

   If the identifier is a MAC address, it MUST be formatted as the
   letters "MAC-" followed by a 12 digit hexadecimal representation of
   the MAC address. The address can not include ":", whitespace, or
   other formatting. If the identifier is a random number, it MUST be
   formatted as the letters "RANID-" followed by a 16 digit hexadecimal
   representation of the number. Note that the identifiers are case
   sensitive and all alpha characters are upper case.

   The MAC and RANDID identify the namespace for the unique identifier.
   In the future this unique identifer namespace may be extended with
   other namespaces that use unique identifiers from things like USB,
   Bluetooth, or Firewire.

   These same identifiers may be used in the user portion of request
   URIs when that is appropriate. A SUBSCRIBE for configuration
   information is a good example.

5. Discussion

   The contact header in a SIP request identifies an address that can be
   used to reach the device that is sending the request. This address
   may change each time the device running the user agent gets a new IP
   address, but it is very reasonable for the display name to give a
   unique identifier for what this instance of the user agent wishes to
   be known by. Right now SIP does not give any recommendation on what
   to place in the field. This document suggests a naming convention for
   this.

   MAC addresses are usually put on the outside of the box for IP phones

   in a form that humans can read and also by a barcode scanner.

6. BNF

   The following ABNF follows the rules in RFC-2234 [1] and updates the
   BNF in RFC 3261.

      contact-params = c-p-q / c-p-expires / c-p-instance
                       / contact-extentions
      c-p-intance = "instance" EQUAL uniq-ident
      UHEX  =  DIGIT / %x41-46 ;uppercase A-F
      MAC  =  %x4d.41.43 ; MAC in caps
      RANDID  = %x52.41.4e.44.49.44 ; RANDID in caps
      uniq-ident = ( mac-ident / rand-ident )
      mac-ident = MAC "-" 12UHEX
      rand-ident = RANDID "-" 16UHEX


7. Example

   The following are some valid Contact headers:

   Contact: <sip:alice@host22.example.com>;instance=MAC-123456789ABC
   Contact: <sip:alice@host22.example.com>;instance=
            RANDID-0123456789ABCDEF


8. Security Consideration

   The unique identifer reveals further privacy related information to
   other people that see the SIP signalling. Currently user agents put
   an IP address or DNS name in the contact header, so the amount of
   extra information this reveals is very minimal. The MAC address may
   reveal the manufacturer of the user agent.

9. Open Issues

   Would this be better in an "Instance-ID" header?

   Would this be better in the User-Agent header? Some systems are doing
   already doing this.

   Is 64 bits the right size for the random identifier?

   Is requiring upper case appropriate?
