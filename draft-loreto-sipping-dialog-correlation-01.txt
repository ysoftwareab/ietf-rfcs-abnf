Abstract

   This document defines a new header field for use with SIP.  The Same-
   Session header field is used to logically correlate an existing SIP
   dialog with a new SIP dialog when the media sessions established by
   both dialogs can be considered a single logical session.  This
   mechanism can be used to share the user interface and other resources
   between all the media streams from both sessions.

Internet-Draft            SIP Dialog Correlation               June 2006


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2.  Overview

   This document defines a new SIP [5] header field: Same-Session.  The
   Same-Session header field is used to logically correlate an existing
   SIP dialog with a new SIP dialog when the media sessions established
   by both dialogs can be considered a single logical session.  This is
   especially useful in peer-to-peer call control environments.

   While is possible insert a new participant into a multimedia
   conversation with the Join header field [6], the Join operation is
   normally used to create or join a conference.  It adds a dialog to
   the conversation space associated with the matched dialog and
   performs a media mixing or media combining.

   Instead, the Same-Session operation inserts a new dialog into a
   multimedia conversation.  It enables a dialog to share all the
   resources and the user interface with the matched dialog.

   Obviously it is also possible to achive the Same-Session operetion
   effect using Third Party Call Controll (3pcc) [18] and the SIP
   Session Mobility [20].  However there are various disadvantages in
   the use of 3pcc.

   Appendix A provides some concrete examples regarding the different
   complexity level using the 3pcc or the Same-Session header.


3.  Requirements

   This specification was created in order to meet the following
   requirement:

   It should be possible for a user agent to correlate two dialogs so
   that all the media streams associated to them are treated as a single
   media session.


4.  Use case

   Alice establishes a voice session with Bob. Alice wants add video to
   the session using her SIP-enabled camera.  Alice sends a REFER to her



Loreto & Camarillo      Expires December 27, 2006               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            SIP Dialog Correlation               June 2006


   camera, which has SIP user agent on it, so that her camera sends an
   INVITE request to Bob in order to establish a video stream.  Alice
   wants Bob to treat the video stream from her camera and the voice
   stream from her voice-only user agent as part of the same media
   session.  That is, Alice wants Bob to treat both streams as if both
   had been established using a single SIP dialog.


5.  Same-Session Header Field Syntax

   The following is the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) syntax [2] of
   the Same-Session header field:


         Same-Session         = "Same-Session" HCOLON callid * (SEMI same-session-param)
         same-session-param  = to-tag / form-tag / strictly-flag / generic-param
         to-tag              = "to-tag" EQUAL token
         from-tag            = "from-tag" EQUAL token

   Examples:


         Same-Session: 98732@sip.example.com
                      ;from-tag=r33th4x0r
                      ;to-tag=ff87ff

         Same-Session: 12adf2f34456gs5;to-tag=12345;from-tag=54321;strictly

         Same-Session: 87134@171.161.34.23;to-tag=24796;from-tag=0


6.  User Agent Server Behavior

   The Same-Session header field contains information used to match an
   existing SIP dialog (Call-ID, to-tag, and from-tag).  Upon receiving
   an INVITE with a Same-Session header field, the UA (User Agent)
   attempts to match this information with a confirmed or early dialog.
   The to-tag and from-tag parameters are matched as if they were tags
   present in an incoming request.  In other words the to-tag parameter
   is compared to the local tag, and the from-tag parameter is compared
   to the remote tag.

   If more than one Same-Session header field is present in an INVITE,
   or if a Same-Session header field is present in a request other than
   INVITE, the UAS (User Agent Server) MUST reject the request with a
   400 (Bad Request) response.

   The Same-Session header has specific call control semantics.  If both



Loreto & Camarillo      Expires December 27, 2006               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            SIP Dialog Correlation               June 2006


   a Same-Session header field and another header field with
   contradictory semantics (for example a Replaces [7] header field) are
   present in a request, the request MUST be rejected with a 400 (Bad
   Request) response.

   If the Same-Session header field matches more than one dialog, the UA
   MUST act as if no match is found.

   If no match is found, the UAS rejects the INVITE and returns a 481
   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) response.  Likewise, if the Same-
   Session header field matches a dialog which was not created with an
   INVITE, the UAS MUST reject the request with a 481 (Call/Transaction
   Does Not Exist) response.

   If the Same-Session header field matches a dialog which has already
   terminated, the UA SHOULD decline the request with a 603 (Decline)
   response.

   If the Same-Session header field matches an active dialog, the UA
   MUST verifies that the initiator of the new INVITE is authorized to
   be part of the session previously established by the matched dialog.
   If the initiator of the new INVITE has authenticated successfully as
   equivalent to the user who established the matched dialog, then the
   merging of both session is authorized.  For example, if the user who
   established the initial dialog and the initiator of the new INVITE
   request share the same credentials for Digest authentication [8], or
   they sign the correlation request with S/MIME [11] with the same
   private key and present the (same) corresponding certificate used in
   the original dialog, then the merging of the session is authorized.

   Alternatively, the Referred-By mechanism [9] defines a mechanism that
   the UAS can use to verify that an INVITE request with a Same-Session
   header field was sent on behalf of the other participant in the
   matched dialog (in this case, triggered by a REFER request).  If the
   INVITE request contains a Referred-By header which corresponds to the
   user that established the matched dialog, the UA SHOULD authorize the
   merging of the sessions.  The Referred-By header field MUST reference
   a corresponding, valid Referred-By Authenticated Identity Body [10].
   The UA MAY apply other local policy to authorize the remainder of the
   request.  In other words, the UAS may apply different policy to the
   new dialog than was applied to the matched dialog.

   If authorization is successful, the UA attempts to accept the new
   INVITE and treats the session newly-established and the previously
   established session as if they were one.  It SHOULD return in the
   response the Contact header filled in the same way as it returned
   during the original dialog establishment phase; in this way,
   subsequent users joining the session will be able to use the same

Internet-Draft            SIP Dialog Correlation               June 2006


   URL.

   If the authorization is successful, but the UA cannot accept the new
   INVITE (for example: it cannot establish required QoS or keying, or
   it has incompatible media), the UA MUST return an appropriate error
   response and MUST leave the matched dialog unchanged.

   If the UAS is incapable of satisfying the Same-Session request, it
   MUST return a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response.


7.   User Agent Client Behavior

   A User Agent that wishes to add a new dialog of its own to a single
   existing early or confirmed dialog sends the target User Agent an
   INVITE request containing a Same-Session header field.  The UAC (User
   Agent Client) places the Call-ID, to-tag, and from-tag information
   for the target dialog in a single Same-Session header field and sends
   the new INVITE to the target.

   If the User Agent receives a 300-class response, and acts on this
   response by sending an INVITE to a Contact in the response, this
   redirected INVITE MUST contain the same Same-Session header which was
   present in the original request.  Although this is unusual, this
   allows INVITE requests with a Same-Session header to be redirected
   before reaching the target UAS.

   Note that use of the Same-Session mechanism does not provide a way to
   match multiple dialogs, nor does it provide a way to match an entire
   call, an entire transaction, or to follow a chain of proxy forking
   logic.


8.  New Same-Session Option Tag

   This specification defines a new Require/Supported header option tag
   "Same-Session".  UAs which support the Same-Session header field MUST
   include the "Same-Session" option tag in a Supported header field.
   UAs that want explicit failure notification if Same-Session is not
   supported MAY include the "Same-Session" option in a Require header
   field.

   The following is an example of a Require header field with the "Same-
   Session" option tag:

   Require: Same-Session

             |              |              |

   In this example, Alice starts a phone call with Bob (messages 1,2,3).
   At a later point, Alice wants to add video to the session using a
   different user agent that supports video.  Alice wants Bob to treat
   media stream (i.e., audio and video)as if they had been established
   using a single INVITE-initiated dialog.  Consequently, Alice's user
   agent generates the following REFER request.

10.  Security Considerations

   The extension specified in this document significantly changes the
   relative security of SIP devices.  It has the same problems of both
   "Join" and "Replace" header fields.

   This extension can be used to insert a new dialog in a multimedia
   conversation in order to monitor potentially sensitive content.  As
   such, invitations with the Same-Session header field MUST only be
   accepted if the peer requesting a Same-Session has been properly
   authenticated as a user already involved in the call.

         Mobility", draft-shacham-sipping-session-mobility-02 (work in
         progress), March 2006.


Appendix A.  Same Session header AND Third Party Call Controll

   It is possible to achive the Same-Session operation effect using
   Third Party Call Controll (3pcc) [18] and the SIP Session Mobility
   [20].  However there are various cons in the use of 3pcc:

   o  complexity: some use cases that are quite complex implemented
      using the Third Party Call Controll (3pcc) become more simpler
      using the Same-Session Header.
   o  implementation: not many terminals are going to implement what is
      needed to be a 3pcc controller.  However, any terminal will
      implement REFER.
   o  support of an extension at the remote end: the controller needs to
      understand all the SIP extensions applied to both dialogs.

   Moreover Same-Session Header solves the SIP lack, underlined in the
   SIP Session Mobility [20], of a standard way to associate multiple
   sessions as part of a single call in SIP.

   The following examples show the different complexity, in term of
   amount of messages, using the Same-Session header or the 3pcc, in the
   scenario where the user A has an on-going session with the user agent
   B and then A wants to add a new media to the session using a
   different user agent C.

Appendix A.1.  Example: preconditions using the Same-Session Header


                               A ------------------ B
                                                    |
                               C -------------------|

                    Figure 1: Same-Session architecture

   Fig.1 shows the architecture achived using the Same-Sessione header
   peer to peer call control model.

   Using the same-session header, as showed in fig.2, A issues a REFER
   transaction to C, then C send an INVITE to B following the basic
   session establishment call flow showed in Figure 1 of [19].  The flow
   if fig.2 has 17 messages.

                        Figure 3: 3pcc architecture

   Fig.3 shows the architecture achived using the Third Party Call
   Control (3pcc) model.

   Using 3pcc, A behaves as the controller in Figure 11 of [18].  In
   this scenario the flow contains 26 messages.  We don't insert the
   figure for the sake of space.

   Alternatively, it is possible using 3pcc in a different way.  A
   issues a REFER to C and C send the INVITE towards A. The flow, as
   showed in fig.4, without precondition already has 16 messages.
