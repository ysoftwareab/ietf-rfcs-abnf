1.  Introduction

   This document defines the 'payto' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   [RFC3986] scheme for designating transfer form data for payments.  In
   particular, it always identifies the target of a payment.  A 'payto'
   URL consists of a payment target type, a target identifier and
   optional parameters such as an amount or a payment reference.

   The interpretation of the target identifier is defined by the payment
   target type, and typically represents either a bank account or an
   (unsettled) transaction.

   A unified URI scheme for all payment target types allows applications
   to offer user interactions with URIs that represent payment targets,
   simplifying the introduction of new payment systems and applications.

2.  Syntax of a 'payto' URL

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) of
   [RFC5234].

Internet-Draft           The 'payto' URI scheme                July 2019


     payto-URI = "payto" "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" opts ]
     opts = opt *( "&" opt )
     opt = (generic-opt / authority-specific-opt) "=" *( pchar )
     generic-opt = "amount" / "receiver-name" / "sender-name" /
                   "message" / "instruction"
     authority = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." )
     path-abempty = <path-abempty, see [RFC3986], Section 3.3>
     pchar = <pchar, see [RFC3986], Appendix A.>


3.  Semantics

   The authority component of a payment URI identifies the payment
   target type.  The payment target types are defined in the "Payment
   Target Types" registry, see Section 8.2.  The path component of the
   URI identifies the target for a payment as interpreted by the
   respective payment target type.  The query component of the URI can
   provide additional parameters for a payment.  Every payment method
   SHOULD accept the options defined in generic-opt.  The default
   operation of applications that invoke a URI with the payto scheme
   SHOULD be to launch an application (if available) associated with the
   payment target type that can initiate a payment.  If multiple
   handlers are registered for the same payment target type, the user
   SHOULD be able to choose which application to launch.  This allows
   users with multiple bank accounts (each accessed the respective
   bank's banking application) to choose which account to pay with.  An
   application SHOULD allow dereferencing a payto URI even if the
   payment target type of that URI is not registered in the "Payment
   Target Types" registry.  Details of the payment MUST be taken from
   the path and options given in the URI.  The user SHOULD be allowed to
   modify these details before confirming a payment.

4.  Examples

     payto://iban/DE75512108001245126199?amount=EUR:200.0&message=hello

     INVALID (authority missing):  payto:iban/12345


5.  Generic Options

   Applications MUST accept URIs with options in any order.  The
   "amount" option MUST only occur at most once.  Other options MAY be
   allowed multiple times, with further restrictions depending on the
   payment method.  The following options SHOULD be understood by every
   payment method.

Internet-Draft           The 'payto' URI scheme                July 2019


   amount: The amount to transfer, including currency information if
   applicable.  The format MUST be:

     amount = [ currency ":" ] unit [ "." fraction ]
     currency = 1*ALPHA
     unit = 1*(DIGIT / ",")
     fraction = 1*(DIGIT / ",")


   The unit value MUST be smaller than 2^53.  If present, the fraction
   MUST consist of no more than 8 decimal digits.  The use of commas is
   optional for readability and they MUST be ignored.

   receiver-name: Name of the entity that receives the payment
   (creditor).

   sender-name: Name of the entity that makes the payment (debtor).

   message: A short message to identify the purpose of the payment,
   which MAY be subject to lossy conversions (for example, due to
   character set encoding limitations).

   instruction: A short message giving instructions to the recipient,
   which MUST NOT be subject to lossy conversions.  Character set
   limitations allowed for such instructions depend on the payment
   method.

6.  Internationalization and Character Encoding

   Various payment systems use restricted character sets.  An
   application that processes 'payto' URIs MUST convert characters that
   are not allowed by the respective payment systems into allowable
   character using either an encoding or a replacement table.  This
   conversion process MAY be lossy, except for the instruction field.

   To avoid special encoding rules for the payment target identifier,
   the userinfo component [RFC3986] is disallowed in payto URIs.
   Instead, the payment target identifier is given as an option, where
   encoding rules are uniform for all options.

7.  Security Considerations

   Interactive applications handling the payto URI scheme MUST NOT
   initiate any financial transactions without prior review and
   confirmation from the user, and MUST take measures to prevent
   clickjacking [HMW12].

Internet-Draft           The 'payto' URI scheme                July 2019


   Unless a payto URI is received over a trusted, authenticated channel,
   a user might not be able to identify the target of a payment.  In
   particular due to homographs [unicode-tr36], a payment target type
   SHOULD NOT use human-readable names in combination with unicode in
   the target account specification, as it could give the user the
   illusion of being able to identify the target account from the URL.

   To avoid unnecessary data collection, payment target types SHOULD NOT
   include personally identifying information about the sender of a
   payment that is not essential for an application to conduct a
   payment.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  URI Scheme Registration

   The "payto" URI scheme is already registered in the "Provisional URI
   Schemes" registry [RFC7595].

8.2.  Payment Target Type Registry

   This document defines a registry for payment methods.  The name of
   the registry is "Payment Target Types".

   The registry shall record for each entry:

   o  Name: The name of the payment target type (case insensitive ASCII
      string, restricted to alphanumeric characters, dots and dashes)

   o  Description: A description of the payment target type, including
      the semantics of the path in the URI if applicable.

   o  Example: At least one example URI to illustrate the payment target
      type.

   o  Contact: The contact information of a person to contact for
      further information

   o  References: Optionally, references describing the payment method
      (such as an RFC) and method-specific options, or references
      describing the payment system underlying the payment target type.

   The registration policy for this registry is "First Come First
   Served", as described in [RFC5226].  When requesting new entries,
   careful consideration of the following criteria is strongly advised:

   1.  The description clearly defines the syntax and semantics of the
       payment target and optional parameters if applicable.

   2.  Relevant references are provided if they are available.

   3.  The chosen name is appropriate for the payment target type, does
       not conflict with well-known payment systems, and avoids
       potential to confuse users.

   4.  The payment system underlying the payment target type is not
       fundamentally incompatible with the general options (such as
       positive decimal amounts) in this specification.

   5.  The payment target type is not a vendor-specific version of a
       payment target type that could be described more generally by a
       vendor-neutral payment target type.

   6.  The specification of the new payment target type remains within
       the scope of payment transfer form data.  In particular
       specifying complete invoices is not in scope.  Neither are
       processing instructions to the payment processor or bank beyond a
       simple payment.

   7.  The payment target and the options do not contain the payment
       sender's account details.

8.2.1.  ACH Bank Account

   o  Name: ach

   o  Description: Automated Clearing House.  The path consist of two
      components, the routing number and the account number.

   o  Example: payto://ach/122000661/1234

   o  Contact: N/A

   o  References: [NACHA]

8.2.2.  Business Identifier Code

   o  Name: bic

   o  Description: Business Identifier Code.  The path consist of just a
      BIC.  This is used for wire transfers between banks.  The registry
      for BICs is provided by SWIFT.  The path does not allow specifying
      a bank account number.

   o  Example: payto://bic/SOGEDEFFXXX

   o  Contact: N/A

   o  References: [BIC]

8.2.3.  International Bank Account Number

   o  Name: iban

   o  Description: International Bank Account Number (IBAN).  Generally
      the IBAN allows to unambiguously derive the the associated
      Business Identifier Code (BIC).  However, some legacy applications
      process payments to the same IBAN differently based on the
      specified BIC.  Thus the path can either consist of a single
      component (the IBAN) or two components (BIC and IBAN).

   o  Example: payto://iban/DE75512108001245126199
      payto://iban/SOGEDEFFXXX/DE75512108001245126199

   o  Contact: N/A

   o  References: [ISO20022]

8.2.4.  Unified Payments Interface

   o  Name: upi

   o  Description: Unified Payment Interface.  The path is an account
      alias.  The amount and receiver-name options are mandatory for
      this payment target.

   o  Example: payto://upi/alice@example.com?receiver-
      name=Alice&amount=INR:200

   o  Contact: N/A

   o  References: [UPILinking]

8.2.5.  Bitcoin Address

   o  Name: bitcoin

   o  Description: Bitcoin protocol.  The path is a "bitcoinaddress" as
      per [BIP0021].

   o  Example: payto://bitcoin/12A1MyfXbW6RhdRAZEqofac5jCQQjwEPBu

   o  Contact: N/A

   o  References: [BIP0021]

8.2.6.  Interledger Protocol Address

   o  Name: ilp

   o  Description: Interledger protocol.  The path is an ILP address as
      per [ILP-ADDR].

   o  Example: payto://ilp/g.acme.bob
