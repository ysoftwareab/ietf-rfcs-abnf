Abstract

   This memo proposes a scheme that supports a fast handover effectively
   in Proxy Mobile IPv6 by optimizing the associated data and signaling
   flows during the handover.  New signaling messages, Fast PBU and
   Reverse PBU, are defined and utilized to expedite the handover
   procedure.

Internet-Draft                 Fast PMIPv6                     June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The PMIPv6 (Proxy Mobile IPv6) protocol provides local mobility
   management to a mobile node without requiring any modification of the
   mobile node.  But, PMIPv6's handover could cause undesirable delay to
   the mobile nodes running real time applications like VoIP.  This memo
   proposes a scheme that supports a fast handover effectively in PMIPv6
   by optimizing the associated data and signaling flows during the
   handover.

   FMIPv6 (Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6) [RFC5268] is a well-known fast
   handover scheme for the host-based Mobile IPv6.  It may be harnessed
   to enhance PMIPv6's handover performance.  Actually, some schemes
   have been proposed based on the FMIPv6's strategy (see [I-D.xia-
   netlmm-fmip-mnagno] and [I-D.yokota-mipshop-pfmipv6]).  However, they
   induce unnecessary processing overhead for re-tunneling at the MAGs,
   as well as inefficient usage of network bandwidth if there are no
   direct secure links between them.  The main reason for this is that
   the data transport of PMIPv6 is based on the tunneling from the LMA
   to the MAG, not between MAGs, while the FMIPv6 and the existing
   schemes use the tunneling between the previous AR (PAR) and new AR
   (NAR) for fast handover.

   We propose a new PMIPv6's fast handover scheme to overcome such
   ineffectiveness by defining the signaling messages between LAM and
   MAG.  The proposed scheme utilizes only pre-established bi-
   directional tunnels between LMA and MAGs, and does not create and
   utilize a bi-directional tunnel between MAGs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6], in addition to the ones specified in
   this section:

   o  Previous Mobile Access Gateway (PMAG): The MAG that manages
      mobility related signaling for the MN before handover.

   o  New Mobile Access Gateway (NMAG): The MAG that manages mobility
      related signaling for the MN after handover.

   o  Previous Point of Attachment (P-PoA): The access network device to
      which the MN is attached before handover.

Internet-Draft                 Fast PMIPv6                     June 2008


   o  New Point of Attachment (N-PoA): The access network device to
      which the MN is attached after handover.

   o  Fast Proxy Binding Update (Fast PBU): A request message sent by an
      MAG to a mobile node's LMA for expediting the handover procedure.

   o  Fast Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (Fast PBA): A reply message
      sent by an LMA in response to a Fast PBU message that it received
      from a MAG.

   o  Reverse Proxy Binding Update (Reverse PBU): A request message sent
      by LMA to a mobile node's new MAG after establishing a binding
      between the home network prefix assigned to the mobile node and
      its new care-of address (Proxy-CoA).

   o  Reverse Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (Reverse PBA): A reply
      message sent by a MAG in response to a Reverse PBU message that it
      received from an LMA.


3.  Protocol Operation

   Because a mobile node is not directly involved with IPv6 mobility
   management, it is also unaware of fast handover procedure defined in
   this memo.  All new signaling messages defined in this memo are
   exchanged by the MAG and the LMA.  The proposed scheme is not based
   on the fast handover strategy defined in [RFC5268].

   To reduce the handover latency due to signaling between the MAGs and
   the LMA, this memo only utilizes the bi-directional tunnels between
   the LMA and the PMAG/NMAG.  That is, no tunnel creation between MAGs
   is required.  The bi-directional tunnel between the LMA and the PMAG
   has been always established to provide a visited mobile node with the
   packet delivery service.  The bi-directional tunnel between the LMA
   and the NMAG may be also already established because the tunnels are
   shared for multiple mobile nodes in PMIPv6.

                     The proposed handover procedure.

                                 Figure 1

   The procedure is as follows (see Figure 1):

   (a)     A handover is imminent and a link-specific pre-handover
           procedure is performed.  The pre-handover procedure can be
           host-initiated or network-initiated.  The exact procedure is
           out of scope.

   (b)     P-PoA, to which the MN is currently attached, indicates the
           handover of the mobile node to the PMAG.  The exact procedure
           of this indication is also out of scope.

   (c)     The PMAG sends the Fast PBU to the LMA.  The Fast PBU message
           MUST include the MN ID and the new PCoA, the address of NMAG,
           which is resolved by the New AP ID.

   (d)     The LMA sends back the Fast PBA to the PMAG.

   (e)     The LMA establishes a binding between the home network prefix
           (HNP) assigned to the mobile node and its new PCoA.  The LMA
           sends the Reverse PBU to the NMAG.  The Reverse PBU message
           MUST include the MN ID and the HNP of the mobile node.

   (f)     The NMAG sends back the Reverse PBA to the LMA.

   (g)     If the bi-directional tunnel is not established between the
           NMAG and the LMA, a new tunnel is established.  The LMA
           starts to transfer packets destined for the mobile node via
           the NMAG.  If the mobile node has not established a
           connection with NMAG at this time, the NMAG starts to buffer
           the packets.

   (h)     The mobile node hands over to the New Access Network.

   (i)     The mobile node establishes a connection (e.g. radio channel)
           with the N-PoA, which in turn triggers the establishment of
           the connection between the N-PoA and NMAG.  The exact
           procedure of this procedure is also out of scope.

   (j)     The NMAG starts to transfer packets destined for the mobile
           node via the N-PoA.

   (k)     The uplink packets from the mobile node are sent to the NMAG
           via the N-PoA and the NMAG forwards them to the LMA.

   It is noted that the Reverse PBU and PBA are the alternates of the
   original PBU and PBU of PMIPv6.  That is, the proposed scheme
   incorporates the main part of PMIPv6 procedure in the fast handover
   procedure, and thus any subsequent PMIPv6 procedure is not necessary.
