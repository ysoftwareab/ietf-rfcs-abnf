        Requests the Media Gateway to create an ephemeral termination
        within the D-channel. The Media Gateway will indicate in its
        response the assigned termination identifier. This is new
        functionality in Megaco/H.248 for SCN terminations.

Stream = 66

c=ISDN DLCI 88
        The network is the ISDN, with Q.921 DLCI as addressing scheme
        The Terminal Equipment Identifier is 88.

m=data 16 ppp
        A data stream is set up to Service Access Point 16, over PPP.
