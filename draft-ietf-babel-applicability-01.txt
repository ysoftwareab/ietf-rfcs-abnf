1.  Introduction

   Babel [RFC6126] is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol
   that aims to be robust in a variety of environments.

   This document describes a few areas where Babel has been found to be
   useful.  It is structured as follows.  In Section 2, we describe
   application areas where Babel has been successfully deployed, and in
   Section 3, we describe application areas where deployment of Babel is
   not encouraged because better alternatives are available.

2.  Existing successful deployments of Babel

2.1.  Hybrid networks

   Babel is able to deal with both classical, prefix-based ("Internet-
   style") routing and flat ("mesh-style") routing over non-transitive
   link technologies.  Because of that, it has seen a number of
   succesful deployments in medium-sized hybrid networks, networks that
   combine a wired, aggregated backbone with meshy wireless bits at the
   edges.  No other routing protocol known to us is similarly robust and
   efficient in this particular type of network.

2.2.  Large scale overlay networks

   The algorithms used by Babel (loop avoidance, hysteresis, delayed
   updates) allow it to remain stable and efficient in the presence of
   unstable metrics, even in the presence of a feedback loop.  For this
   reason, it has been successfully deployed in large scale overlay
   networks, built out of thousands of tunnels spanning continents,
   where it is used with a metric computed from links' latencies
   [DELAY-BASED].

2.3.  Pure mesh networks

   Babel has been repeatedly shown to be competitive with dedicated
   routing protocols for wireless mesh networks [REAL-WORLD]
   [BRIDGING-LAYERS].  While this particular niche is already served by
   a number of mature protocols, notably OLSR-ETX and OLSRv2 [RFC7181]
   equipped with the DAT metric [RFC7779], Babel has seen a moderate
   amount of successful deployment in pure mesh networks.

2.4.  Small unmanaged networks

   Because of its small size and simple configuration, Babel has been
   deployed in small, unmanaged networks (three to five routers), where
   it serves as a more efficient replacement for RIP [RFC2453], with the
   significant advantage of having good support for wireless links.

3.  Application Areas where Babel is not recommended

   There exist application areas where Babel is a poor fit.

3.1.  Large, stable networks

   Babel relies on periodic updates, and even in a stable network, it
   generates a constant amount of background traffic.  In large, stable,
   well-administered networks, it is preferable to use protocols layered
   above a reliable transport mechanism, such as OSPF [RFC5340], EIGRP
   [RFC7868] or IS-IS [RFC1195].

3.2.  Low-power and constrained networks

   Babel relies on periodic updates and maintains within each node an
   amount of state that is proportional to the number of reachable
   destinations.  In networks containing resource-constrained or
   exteremely low-power nodes, it may be preferable to use a protocol
   that limits the amount of state maintained and propagated; we have
   heard of AODVv2 [AODVv2], RPL [RFC6550] and LOADng [LOADng].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.  [RFC Editor: please remove
   this section before publication.]

5.  Security Considerations

   As in all distance-vector routing protocols, a Babel speaker receives
   reachability information from its neighbours, which by default is
   trusted.  A number of attacks are possible if this information is not

   suitably protected, either by a lower-layer mechanism or by an
   extension to the protocol itself (e.g. [RFC7298]).

   Implementors and deployers must be aware of the insecure nature of
   the base protocol, and must take suitable measures to ensure that the
   protocol is deployed as securely as required by the application.
