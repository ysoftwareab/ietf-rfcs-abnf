1.  Problem Statement

   ICE was developed roughly ten years ago and several things have been
   learned that could be improved:

   1.  It is spectacularly difficult to debug on analyze failures or
       successes in ICE or develop good automated tests.  Many
       implementing have had significant bugs for long periods of time.

   2.  It is timing depended.  It relies on both sides to to do
       something at roughly the same time and that ability to do this
       goes down with the number of interfaces and candidates being
       handled.  Mobile interfaces and dual stack make this worse.

   3.  Many widely deployed devices do not implement aggressive
       nomination.

   4.  Many widely deployed devices do not implement normal nomination.

   5.  It does not discover asymmetric routes.  For example UDP leaving
       a device may work just fine even thought UDP coming into that
       device does not work at all.

   6.  Almost all deployments include a TURN server.  At the time ICE
       was done it was not understood if this would be too expensive or
       not so ICE works without TURN but better with it.

   7.  The asymmetric of the controlling / controlled sides has caused
       many interoperability problems and bugs.

   8.  Priorities are complicated in dual stack world and ICE is brittle
       to changes in this part of the algorithm

2.  Possible Solutions

   Lets consider what we could do if both sides had a back channel that
   always worked for sending information to the other side.  I'll
   discuss how we get a back channel later in the draft.

   Each side is responsible for discovering a viable path for it's
   incoming media.  Each end sends media to where the other sides tells
   it.  There is no controlling concept or aggressive or normal
   nomination.  The candidates are exchanged as in normal ICE along with
   some attribute that explains the extensions in this draft are
   supported.

   If both sides support this, each side performs it's check by sending
   outbound STUN pings to open local pin holes, then tracks the life
   times of theses and reopens them before they expire.  It then tells
   the other side using the back channel to send it a STUN ping from a
   given location to one of a specific candidates.  If this works, it
   knows it has a viable path.

   One side can tell the other side which path to use (or not use) over
   the back channel.  This can happen at any point of time time and
   there is not concept of ICE is "done", ice is running while the
   connection is up and at any point in time there some number (or
   perhaps zero) viable paths for media in each direction.

   There are alms no case where ICE works but that TCP data through the
   TURN servers does not.  The candidates that go though the TURN server
   would be used for the back channel and they would be assumed to work.
   There are environments where this back channel would not work but in
   those cases, it is very unlikely ICE would work.

   Many parts of ICE were designed to support finding multiple ports for
   RTP / RTCP , voice video and so on.  At this point in time we should
   fully optimize for just a single port and assume bundle and rtcp-mux.

   A variation of this could be each side discover a path for it's
   outgoing media.  Not clear where is best.

3.  Advantages

3.1.  Diagnostics

   This makes it very easy to see which outbound connection were sent
   from side A to open a pin hole, then when side A asked B to send a
   test PING and if B received that.  It becomes easier to set up a
   client with an automated test jig that tests all the combinations and

   makes sure they work as you only need to test receiving capability
   and sender capability independently.

3.2.  Timing

   This more or less removes the timing complexity by allowing both
   sides to be responsible for their own timing.  If it turns out that
   we can pace things much faster than 20ms (see Juberti's tests results
   when they come out), then this allows us to take advantage of that
   without both sides up grading at the same time.  If we end up with a
   lot more candidates due to v6, mobile etc, this removes the issue we
   have today where a path might have worked but the two sides did not
   find it due to timing issues.

3.3.  Asymmetric Media

   This allows media to be sent in one direction over a path that does
   not work in the reverse direction.

4.  Backwards Compatibility

   At IETF 92 I thought it would be possible to design a backwards
   compatibly solution that did roughly this.  That might be possible if
   all the major implementations fully implemented the current ICE spec
   but many of them do not.  Even worse, they implement different parts.
   My proposal here is more or less make an ICE2.  ICE2 advertises the
   same candidates as ICE but also adds some SDP signaling to indicate
   the device supports ICE and ICE2.

   In the short term we would need device such as web browsers would be
   requires to support ICE and the ICE2 extensions here but in the
   future we could move to devices that only did ICE2.

   The main mechanisms between ICE and ICE2 are largely the same but the
   way paths are chosen and used is somewhat different.
