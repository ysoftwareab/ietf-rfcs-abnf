Abstract

   This document describes Virtual Circuit Connection Verification 
   (VCCV) procedures for use with psuedowire connections. VCCV 
   supports connection verification applications for pseudowire 
   VCs regardless of the underlying MPLS or IP tunnel technology.  
   VCCV makes use of IP based protocols such as Ping and MPLS-Ping 
   to perform operations and maintenance functions.  A network
   operator may use the VCCV procedures to test the network's
   forwarding plane liveliness.

2. Introduction

   As network operators deploy pseudowire services, fault
   detection and diagnostic mechanisms particularly for the PSN
   portion of the network are pivotal. Specifically, the ability
   to provide end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for an
   emulated pseudowire service is critical for the network
   operator. Operators have indicated in [MPLSOAMREQS] that such
   a tool is required for pseudowire deployments. This document
   describes procedures for PSN-agnostic fault detection and
   diagnostics called virtual circuit connection verification
   (VCCV).

      Figure 2: PWE3 Protocol Stack Reference Model 
                including the VCCV control channel.

   Figure 2 depicts how the VCCV control channel is run along 
   with the pseudowire to verify specific VCs. Ping and other 
   IP messages are encapsulated using the PWE3 encapsulation 
   as described below in sections 5 and 6. These messages, referred 
   to as VCCV messages, are exchanged only after the desire to 
   exchange such traffic has been negotiated between the PEs 
   (see section 8).

3. MPLS as PSN

   In order to apply IP monitoring tools to PWE3 circuits, VCCV
   creates a control channel between PWE3 PEs[PWEARCH].  Packets 
   sent across this channel are IP packets, allowing maximum
   flexibility.

   Ideally such a control channel would be completely in band.
   When a control word is present on virtual circuit, it is
   possible to indicate the control channel by setting a bit in
   the control header.  This method is described in section 7.1
   and is referred to as inband MPLS VCCV.



PWE3 WG                    Expires January 2004             [Page 3]

Internet Draft                 PWE3 VCCV               July 24, 2004




   However in order to address the case when the control header
   is not in use as well as to deal with a number of existent
   hardware devices, use of the MPLS Router Alert Label to indicate 
   the IP control channel is also proposed.  This is described in
   section 7.2.

   The actual channel type is agreed through signaling as
   described in section 8.

3.1.  Inband MPLS VCCV

   The PW set-up protocol determines whether a PW uses a control word.
   When a control word is used, it SHOULD have the following preferred
   form:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   for the purpose of indicating VCCV control channel messages. 

   Note that for data, one uses the control word defined just
   above the MPLS payload [PWEARCH] .



        
   The MPLS payload type is defined as follows:

         0                   1                   2                   3
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The first nibble 0000 indicates data.  When the first nibble is 
   0001, the protocol of the frame is indicated by the Protocol
   Number.  IP OAM flows are identified by either an IPv4 or IPv6
   codepoint. 

3.2.  Router Alert Label Approach

   When the control word is not used, or the receiving hardware



PWE3 WG                    Expires January 2004             [Page 4]

Internet Draft                 PWE3 VCCV               July 24, 2004



   cannot divert control traffic, an IP control channel can be
   created by including the MPLS router alert label immediately
   above the VC label.  If the control word is in use on this VC
   it is also included in the IP control flow.

   0x1  OAM Flag in PWE header
   0x2  Include the control channel label in stack above VC
        label


4. IP Probe Traffic

   For connectivity verification, both ICMP Ping and LSP-Ping
   packets may be used on the control channel.  The type of
   packets used is agreed in signaling as described in section 9.


4.1.  ICMP Ping

   When ICMP packets are used, the source address should be set
   to the source address of the LDP session and the destination
   address to the destination of the LDP session.  The Identifier
   and Sequence Number fields of the ICMP Echo Request / Echo
   Reply messages are used to track what VCs are being tested.

   These fields are only interpreted by the sending PE.  Specific
   use of these fields is an implementation matter.


4.2.  MPLS Ping Packet

   The LSP Ping header must be used as described [LSP-PING] and
   must also contain the sub-TLV of 8 for PW circuits.  This
   sub-TLV must be sent containing the circuit to be verified as
   the "VC ID" field:

      
4.2.1 L2 Circuit ID TLV for MPLS LSP Ping

   The value field consists of a remote PE address (the address
   of the targeted LDP session), the source address of the PE 
   that originated this request, a VC ID and an encapsulation 
   type, as follows.

    0                   1                 2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Two PWID types are defined:

   1. A FEC 128 VCID as defined in [MARTINISIG].
   2. A FEC 129 Attachment Identifier, as defined [L2SIG].

   The PWID length field contains the length of the
   PWID field in bytes. Zero to three bytes of padding will follow 
   the PWID field, so that the parameters field starts on a 64-bit 
   boundary.

   Parameters are:

   - Interface parameters, as defined in [MARTINISIG].

   ***Note that we propose that this field be removed from the
      LSP Ping draft [LSPPING] and defined here instead.


5. OAM Capability Indication

   To permit negotiation of the use and type of OAM for
   Connectivity Verification, a VCCV parameter is defined below.
   When a PE signals a PWE3 VC and desires OAM for that VC, it
   MUST indicate this during VC establishment using the messages
   defined below.  Specifically for LDP it MUST include the VCCV 
   parameter in the VC setup message.

   As the overall method of PWE3 signaling is
   downstream, unsolicited, this leaves the decision of the type
   of IP control channel completely to the receiving control
   entity.  OAM capability MUST be signaled BEFORE a PE may send
   OAM messages. If a PE receives OAM messages prior to sending
   a VCCV parameter, it MUST discard these messages and not reply
   to them. In this case, the LSR SHOULD increment an error counter 
   and optionally issues a system and/or SNMP notification to indicate 
   to the system administrator that a mis-configuration exists.

   The requesting PE indicates its desire for the remote PE to
   support OAM capability by including the VCCV parameter with
   appropriate options set to indicate which methods of OAM are



PWE3 WG                    Expires January 2004             [Page 6]

Internet Draft                 PWE3 VCCV               July 24, 2004



   acceptable.  The requesting PE MAY indicate multiple IP control
   IP control channel options.  The absence of the VCCV FEC TLV 
   indicates that no OAM functions are supported or desired by
   the requesting PE.  This last method MUST be supported by all
   PEs in order to handle backward-compatibility with older PEs.
   The receiving PE agrees to accept any of the indicated 
   OAM types and options by virtue of establishing the VC. If
   it does not or cannot support at least one of the options
   specified, it MUST not establish the VC. If the requesting
   PE wishes to continue, it may choose different options and
   try to signal the PE again.


5.1.  Optional VCCV Parameter

   [PWE3CONTROL] defines a VC FEC TLV for LDP.  Parameters can be
   carried within that TLV to signal different capabilities for
   specific PWs. We propose an optional parameter to be used to
   indicate the desire to use a control channel for VCCV as
   follows.

   The TLV field structure is defined in [PWE3CONTROL] as
   follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Parameter ID |    Length     |    Variable Length Value      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Variable Length Value                 |
   |                             "                                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The VCCV parameter ID is defined as follows:

     Parameter ID   Length     Description
       0x06           4           VCCV


   The format of the VCCV parameter TLV is as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      0x06     |       0x04    |   CC Type     |   CV Types    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The CC type field defines the type of IP control channel.
   The defined values are:




PWE3 WG                    Expires January 2004             [Page 7]

Internet Draft                 PWE3 VCCV               July 24, 2004



    0x1  OAM Flag set in PWE header
    0x2  MPLS Router Alert Label

   The CV Types field defines the types of IP control packets
   that may be sent on the control channel.  The defined values 
   are:

    0x1  ICMP Ping
    0x2  LSP Ping


6.  L2TPV3 as PSN

   When L2TPv3 is used as the underlying PSN, a VCCV mechanism is
   needed for the L2TPv3 session. The L2TPv3 control connection does
   employ a keepalive mechanism. However this mechanism isn't 
   sufficent for fault detection and diagnostic of the L2TPv3 session
   i.e. data plane. In L2TPv3 a session is analogous to a PW. A L2TPv3 
   VCCV mechanism is needed in particular for verifying the session 
   forwarding state at the egress router. 

   When a PE verifies the connection status of a L2TPv3 session it must
   transmit a L2TPv3 VCCV message encoded in the L2TPv3 session packet.

   The presence of a VCCV message in a L2TPv3 session packet can be

           Default L2-Specific Sublayer Format with V bit.

   The 'V' bit indicates that this is a VCCV session packet. If the PW 
   has not been signaled to include a L2-specific sublayer format, other

   mechanisms are needed to indicate the VCCV message. Such mechanisms are
   for further study.

6.1. L2TPv3 VCCV Message

   The VCCV message MUST contain a VCCV AVP. It does not contain a message
   header. A new AVP, called the VCCV AVP is defined. The usage of the 
   L2TPv3 AVP format leaves room for adding further AVPs to this message

   in the future as needed. 

6.1.1. L2TPv3 VCCV AVP

   This AVP encodes the LSP Ping header as defined in [LSP-PING]. M and H

   not encapsulated in UDP. The modifications to the semantics of the 
   fields of this header are specified here. Unless otherwise specified 
   the semantics of the fields as explained in [LSP-PING] are to be

   The version number is currently 1. The message type is one of the 
   following:

   1 - L2TPv3 VCCV Echo Request
   2 - L2TPv3 VCCV Echo Reply

   The Reply Mode is:

   1 - Do not reply
   2 - Reply using the L2TPv3 session

   As explained in [LSP-PING] a reply mode of "do not reply" can be used

   for one way connectivity tests. The VCCV message will normally contain 
   a reply mode of "reply using the L2TPv3 session". 

   The return code can be set to the following by the receiver:

   1 - Malformed echo request received
   2 - One or more of the TLVs was not understood
   3 - Replying router has a session mapping for the verified pseudo wire
   4 - Replying router does not have a mapping for the verified pseudo 
       wire

   The LSP Ping header must contain the L2 Circuit ID TLV as defined in 
   section 8.2. This TLV identifies the pseudo wire associated with the
   session, that is being verified. For L2TPv3 the remote PE address is 
   the address of the session's remote end. A new PWID type is defined
   for L2TPv3, in addition to the ones defined in section 8.2:

   3. L2TPv3 Remote End Identifier AVP

6.2. L2TPv3 VCCV Capability Negotiation

   A LCCE or a LAC should be able to indicate whether the session is
   capable of processing VCCV packets. This is done by including the
   optional VCCV capability AVP in an ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ or OCRP.

6.2.1. L2TPv3 VCCV Capability AVP

   This AVP specifies the VCCV capability. Its attribute type
   is TBD. The value field has the following format:

       0                   1          
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
      | Reserved                     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- 

6.3. L2TPv3 VCCV Operation

   A PE sends VCCV echo requests on a L2TPv3 signaled pseudo wire for 
   fault detection and diagnostic of the L2TPv3 session. The destination

   IP address in the echo request is set to the remote PE's IP address, 
   while the source IP address is set to the local PE's IP address. The 
   egress of the L2TPv3 session verifies the signaling and forwarding state
   of the pseudo wire, on reception of the VCCV message. Any faults 
   detected can be signaled in the VCCV echo response. Its to be noted 
   that the VCCV mechanism for L2TPv3 is primarily targeted at verifying

   the pseudo wire forwarding and signaling state at the egress PE. It 
   also helps when L2TPv3 control and session paths are not identical. 

   A PE must send VCCV packets on a L2TPv3 session only if it has signaled
   VCCV capability to the remote end and received VCCV capability from the 
   remote end. If a PE receives VCCV packets and its not VCCV capable or

   it has not received VCCV capability indication from the remote end, it 
   must discard these messages. In addition if a PE receives VCCV messages
   and it has not received VCCV capability from the remote end, it should

   increment an error counter. In this case the PE can optionally issue a
   system and/or SNMP notification.
