               BGP RPKI-Based Origin Validation on Export
                    draft-ietf-sidrops-ov-egress-02

Abstract

   A BGP speaker may perform RPKI origin validation not only on routes
   received from BGP neighbors and routes that are redistributed from
   other routing protocols, but also on routes it sends to BGP
   neighbors.  For egress policy, it is important that the
   classification uses the effective origin AS of the processed route,
   which may specifically be altered by the commonly available knobs
   such as removing private ASs, confederation handling, and other
   modifications of the origin AS.

1.  Introduction

   This document does not change the protocol or semantics of [RFC6811]
   of RPKI-based origin validation.  It highlights an important use case
   of origin validation in eBGP egress policies, explaining specifics of
   correct implementation in this context.

   As the origin AS of a BGP UPDATE is decided by configuration and
   outbound policy of the BGP speaker, a validating BGP speaker MUST
   apply Route Origin Validation policy semantics against the origin
   Autonomous System number which will actually be put in the AS_PATH
   (see [RFC4271] 4.3 Path Attributes:b) of the UPDATE to the peer.

   This effective origin AS of the announcement might be affected by
   removal of private AS(s), confederation, AS migration, etc.  Any
   AS_PATH modifications resulting in origin AS change MUST be taken
   into account.

Internet-Draft BGP RPKI-Based Origin Validation on Export     March 2020


   This document updates [RFC6811] by clarifying that implementations
   must use the effective origin AS to determine the Origin Validation
   state when applying egress policy.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI,
   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), [RFC6482], RPKI-based
   Prefix Validation, [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications,
   [RFC8481].

3.  Egress Processing

   BGP implementations supporting RPKI-based origin validation SHOULD
   provide the same policy configuration primitives for decisions based
   on validation state available for use in ingress, redistribution, and
   egress policies.  When applied to egress policy, validation state
   MUST be determined using the effective origin AS of the route as it
   will (or would) be announced to the peer.  The effective origin AS
   may differ from that of the route in the RIB due to commonly
   available knobs such as: removal of private ASs, AS path
   manipulation, confederation handling, etc.

   Egress policy handling can provide more robust protection for
   outbound eBGP than relying solely on ingress (iBGP, eBGP, connected,
   static, etc.) redistribution being configured and working correctly -
   better support for the robustness principle.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Configurations may have complex policy where the final announced
   origin AS may not be easily predicted before all policies have been
   run.  Therefore it SHOULD be possible to specify an origin validation
   policy which MUST BE run after such non-deterministic policies.

   An operator SHOULD be able to list what announcements are not sent to
   a peer because they were marked Invalid, as long as the router still
   has them in memory.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create security considerations beyond those of
   [RFC6811] and [RFC8481].
