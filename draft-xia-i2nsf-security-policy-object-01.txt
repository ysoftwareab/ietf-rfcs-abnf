1.  Introduction

   I2NSF policy consists of policy rules that are used to provision NSF
   instances.  The I2NSF policy rule is defined by using "Event-
   Condition-Action" (ECA) model described in I2NSF framework draft
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-framework].  In the ECA model, a condition is used to
   determine whether or not the predefined actions should be executed.
   A condition usually consists of several attributes.  Information
   Model of NSFs Capabilities [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability] describes
   attributes of different condition subclasses.  When configuring
   policy rules by attributes, it is common to see that the same
   attribute or the same set of several attributes are configured for
   several times or more.  And modifications of the policy rules are
   also very tedious and time-consuming.

   To facilitate the provisioning of NSF instances, this document
   describes a set of policy objects which are reusable and can be
   referenced by variable I2NSF policy rules.  A policy object consists

Internet-Draft           Policy Object for I2NSF               July 2017


   of a name attribute that identifies itself and one or several
   attributes that are typically used together to represent a certain
   condition.  For example, protocol type and port number are usually
   used together to represent a certain service.  Each policy object is
   predefined and named in order to be used in I2NSF policy rules.  By
   defining policy objects, the creation and maintenance of policy rules
   are greatly simplified.

   o  A policy object can be referenced in different policy rules as
      required to provide re-usability.  And a policy rule can reference
      several policy objects.

   o  The modification of a policy object will be propagated to the
      I2NSF policy rules that reference this object.  No modification
      should be made to the related policy rules.

   In this document, a set of policy objects are described, and for each
   policy object, several essential attributes are defined.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in Interface to Network
   Security Functions (I2NSF) Terminology [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology].

4.  Policy Object

   IP addresses, port numbers, protocol types, services, applications,
   user accounts are commonly used attributes to determine whether a
   certain condition occurs.  In real-world deployment, these attributes
   are often configured for many times.  The definition of policy
   objects could help to minimize the configuration effort and provide
   simplicity.

   Figure 1 shows the policy objects defined in this document and their
   relationships.

                   Figure 1: The Policy Objects Overview

4.1.  Address Object

   A of IPv4/IPv6 addresses or MAC addresses can be defined as an
   address object, which may belongs to an address group object.  An
   address object consists of the following attributes:

4.1.1.  The addressName Attribute

   This attribute defines a unique name for the address object.

4.1.2.  The addressRange Attribute

   This attribute defines a set of IPv4/IPv6 addresses or MAC addresses,
   or a range of contiguous IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

   An IPv4 address range can be defined by one of the following
   representations:

   o  IPv4 address with wildcard mask, e.g., 10.10.1.2\0.0.0.255.

   o  IPv4 address with subnet mask (subnet mask address or length of
      the subnet mask), e.g., 10.10.1.2/255.255.255.0 or 10.10.1.2/32.

   o  Start address and end address of the IPv4 address range, e.g.,
      10.10.1.2-10.10.1.254.

   An IPv6 address range can be defined by one of the following
   representations:

Internet-Draft           Policy Object for I2NSF               July 2017


   o  IPv6 address with length of the prefix, e.g., a234::120/120.

   o  Start address and end address of the IPv6 address range, e.g.,
      a231::a237-b231::b237.

4.2.  Address Group Object

   An address group object is comprised of several address items that
   require the same policy enforcement.  An address item can be an IPv4/
   IPv6 address, or a MAC address, or a range of contiguous IPv4/IPv6
   addresses, or existing address object, or existing address group
   object.  An address group object consists of the following
   attributes:

4.2.1.  The addressGroupName Attribute

   This attribute defines a unique name for the address group object.

4.2.2.  The addressReference Attribute

   This attribute refers to the existing address objects or existing
   address group objects identified by their unique names.

4.2.3.  The addressRange Attribute

   This attribute is the same as the addressRange attribute of address
   object.  It can define a set of IPv4/IPv6 addresses or MAC addresses,
   or a range of contiguous IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

   An IPv4 address range can be defined by one of the following
   representations:

   o  IPv4 address with wildcard mask, e.g., 10.10.1.2\0.0.0.255.

   o  IPv4 address with subnet mask (subnet mask address or length of
      the subnet mask), e.g., 10.10.1.2/255.255.255.0 or 10.10.1.2/32.

   o  Start address and end address of the IPv4 address range, e.g.,
      10.10.1.2-10.10.1.254.

   An IPv6 address range can be defined by one of the following
   representations:

   o  IPv6 address with length of the prefix, e.g., a234::120/120.

   o  Start address and end address of the IPv6 address range, e.g.,
      a231::a237-b231::b237.

Internet-Draft           Policy Object for I2NSF               July 2017


4.3.  Service Object

   A service object can be a single service based on IP, or ICMP, or
   UDP, or TCP, or SCTP and it can also contain a set of services.  To
   identify services based on different protocols, different attributes
   should be specified (see Section 4.3.2 The serviceList Attribute).

   o  IP based service is recognized by the value of the protocol field
      in IP packet header.

   o  ICMP or ICMPv6 based service is recognized by two header fields in
      the ICMP or ICMPv6 packets: type field and code field.

   o  UDP, TCP, or SCTP based service is recognized by port number.  The
      source port number and destination port number are used to
      identify the sending and receiving service respectively.

   A set of well-known services should be predefined by NSFs as service
   objects to support direct reference.  A service object consists of
   the following attributes:

4.3.1.  The serviceName Attribute

   This attribute defines a unique name for the service object.

4.3.2.  The serviceList Attribute

   This attribute defined a set of services.  Each service can be
   defined by a subset of the following sub-attributes, according to the
   protocol on which the service is based.

   o  For IP based service, the serviceProtocolNumber attribute should
      be specified.

   o  For ICMP or ICMPv6 based service, the serviceICMPType attribute
      and serviceICMPCode attribute should be specified.

   o  For UDP, TCP, or SCTP based service, the serviceSourcePort
      attribute and serviceDestinationPort attribute should be
      specified.

4.3.2.1.  The serviceProtocol Attribute

   This attribute defines the protocol type on which the service is
   based, IP, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, UDP, or SCTP.

Internet-Draft           Policy Object for I2NSF               July 2017


4.3.2.2.  The serviceProtocolNumber Attribute

   This attribute defines the protocol number for IP based service.  The
   protocol number is the value of protocol field in IP packet header
   which identifies the corresponding upper layer protocol.  For
   example, to define a service object for IPsec Encapsulating Security
   Payload, this attribute should be set to 50.

4.3.2.3.  The serviceICMPType Attribute

   This attribute defines the ICMP/ICMPv6 type number for ICMP/ICMPv6
   based service.  This attribute shall be used together with
   serviceICMPCode attribute.  For example, to define a service object
   for IPv4 ping request, this attribute should be set to 8 and
   serviceICMPCode attribute should be set to 0.

4.3.2.4.  The serviceICMPCode Attribute

   This attribute defines the ICMP/ICMPv6 message code for ICMP/ICMPv6
   based service.  This attribute shall be used together with
   serviceICMPType attribute.  For example, to define a service object
   for IPv6 ping request, this attribute should be set to 0 and
   serviceICMPCode should be set to 128.

4.3.2.5.  The serviceSourcePort Attribute

   This attribute defines the source port number for service based on
   TCP, UDP or SCTP.  The value could be a single port number which
   identifies a single service, or a range of port numbers which
   identify a family of services or several services in consecutive port
   numbers.  For example, to define a service object using port number
   greater or equal to 1024 and enforce security policy on the traffic
   that this object sends out, this attribute should be set as a port
   range, 1024-65535.

4.3.2.6.  The serviceDestinationPort Attribute

   This attribute defines the destination port number for service based
   on TCP, UDP or SCTP.  The value could be a single port number or a
   range of port numbers.  For example, to define a service object for
   HTTP and enforce security policy on the traffic that communicates
   with this service object, this attribute should be set to 80.

4.4.  Service Group Object

   A service group object is a collection of service objects that
   require the same policy enforcement.  It consists of the following
   attributes:

Internet-Draft           Policy Object for I2NSF               July 2017


4.4.1.  The serviceGroupName Attribute

   This attribute defines a unique name for the service group object.

4.4.2.  The serviceReference Attribute

   This attribute refers to the existing service objects or service
   group objects identified by their unique names.

4.5.  Application Object

   Due to the diversity and large amount of applications, it is not able
   to identify a certain application based on protocol type and port
   number.  For example, there are many web applications with different
   risk levels run on ports 80 and 443 using HTTP and HTTPS, such as web
   gaming application and web chat application.  Protocol type and port
   number could not distinguish applications using the same application
   protocol.  In this document, category, subcategory, data transmission
   model, vulnerability, and risk level are used to describe an
   application.  A set of well-known application objects should be
   predefined in NSFs to support direct reference.  For a newly created
   application object, the rules for NSFs to identify this application
   in the traffic should be configured.  In this document, the
   configuration of these rules is out of scope.  An application object
   consists of the following attributes:

4.5.1.  The applicationName Attribute

   This attribute defines a unique name for the application object.

4.5.2.  The applicationCategory Attribute

   This attribute defines the category for the application.  The value
   of this attribute is selected from a predefined set of categories,
   e.g., general category, network category.  Values of this attribute
   are defined in Appendix A.1.  Each category is broken down into
   several subcategories.

4.5.3.  The applicationSubCategory Attribute

   mandatory.  It defines the password corresponding to the user name.

4.8.6.  The userExpirationTime Attribute

   This attribute defines when will this user object expire.

4.9.  User Group Object

   A user object group is a collection of user objects that require the
   same policy enforcement and it usually corresponds to a physical
   entity such as a department.  The user group objects are organized as
   a hierarchical structure.  A user group object may belong to another
   user group object.  The user group objects may be created locally on
   the NSFs, or be imported from third parties, such as authentication
   servers.  It consists of the following attributes:

   security group object belongs.

4.10.4.  The securityGroupType Attribute

   This attribute defines the type of the security group object.  There
   are two types: static and dynamic.  For static security group, the
   member objects are fixed and added as required.  For dynamic security
   group, the member objects are dynamically generated by setting
   filtering rules.

4.10.5.  The securityGroupReference Attribute

   This attribute defines the member objects for static security group
   object.  It refers to the existing user objects or security group
   objects which belong to this security group object.

4.10.6.  The securityGroupFilters Attribute

   object.

5.  Acknowledgements

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   When the policy objects are transmitted, the integrity of these
   policy objects should be guaranteed.  NSFs should verify that the
   modifications of policy objects come from the authenticated security
   controller.  And NSF should protect the stored policy objects from
   being tampered.

Appendix B.  Example of Application Scenario for Policy Object

   This appendix describes the utilization of policy objects in policy
   rules for enterprise scenario.

   NSFs are key components to protect security in enterprise network.
   For the typical architecture of an enterprise network, NSFs are
   deployed on-premise at network perimeter.  The inbound and outbound
   traffic of the enterprise network are processed according to the
   predefined security policies rules.

   Figure 3 demonstrates an example of enterprise network topology.
   Firewall is a typical NSF that used at the network perimeter to
   protect enterprise intranet.  Assuming that the firewall should be
   provisioned to provide different network access controls for
   marketing departments and R&D departments.

   o  Marketing departments are allowed to access the Internet website
      but could not use entertainment applications such as online games,
      instant messaging software, in work day.

   o  R&D departments are not allowed to access the Internet.  But
      managers of R&D departments have Internet access.

   For Internet users who want to access the public website of this
   enterprise, they are only allowed to access the servers deployed in
   DMZ.
