1.  Introduction

   LISP [RFC6830] provides reachability to overlay addresses called
   Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) via one or more underlay addresses called
   Routing Locators (RLOCs).  For each destination RLOC, it may be
   desirable for the control plane to select one of potentially multiple
   underlay paths.

   For traffic traversing an Ingress Transit Router (ITR) to an Egress
   Transit Router (ETR), the ITR may be able to reach a particular ETR
   RLOC through multiple underlay paths available via one or more
   locally connected service providers.  Furthermore, the ITR may be
   able to select which of these paths per provider to use, for example
   different paths may have unique bandwidth and latency metrics making
   them more or less suitable for traffic destined to some EIDs.  When
   the ITR requests and obtains an EID mapping, it needs to know how to
   choose an underlay path for each remote RLOC.  If the ETR can provide
   a hint in terms of an opaque color attribute for each RLOC the EID
   maps to, then the ITR would be able to select a policy matching that
   <RLOC,color> tuple to satisfy the needs of the application or
   endpoint associated with this particular EID.

   One expected use of the <RLOC,color> tuple is to select a Segment
   Routing policy as defined in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   This draft specifies an LCAF type [RFC8060] that encodes the color
   for each RLOC in an EID mapping record.  The ITR MAY use the color to
   determine the underlay path to reach the EID via the corresponding
   RLOC.

   A locator record now has an RLOC and color, and both fields are part
   of the comparison to determine if two locator records are the same.

   The definition of how the color is chosen or configured at the ETR,
   or how policies are distributed and configured at the ITR is outside
   the scope of this document.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Color LCAF

   When a color is stored in the LISP Mapping Database System for
   selection of an appropriate policy to reach an EID via a destination
   RLOC it MAY be encoded in a LISP Canonical Address.

   CO Flags:   The CO Flags are as defined in
      [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy] and have the
      following impact on how the subsequent Color is interpreted. 00 is
      their default value.

      When 00, the traffic destined to EID is preferably steered onto a
      valid policy <RLOC, C> where RLOC is the IPv4/6 destination RLOC
      address and C is a color value, else it is steered on the shortest
      path to the RLOC.

      When 01, the traffic destined to EID is preferably steered onto a
      valid policy <RLOC, C> else onto a valid policy (null endpoint, C)
      else on the shortest path to the RLOC.

      When 10, the traffic destined to EID is preferably steered onto a
      valid policy <RLOC, C> else onto a valid policy (null endpoint, C)
      else on any valid SR-TE policy <any endpoint, C> else on the IGP
      path to the RLOC.

      The null endpoint is 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 and ::0 for IPv6 (all bits
      set to 0).

   Color:   A 64-bit color value.

   AFI:   The address family of the locator.  Valid values are 1 for
      IPv4 and 2 for IPv6.

   Address:   The address of the locator.

   The Color Canonical Address Type can be used to encode RLOC
   addresses.

   Usage: This encoding can be used in RLOC records in Map-Requests,
   Map-Replies, Map-Registers, and Map-Notify messages.  When LISP-DDT
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt] is used as the mapping system mechanism, extended
   EIDs are used in Map-Referral messages.

4.  IANA Considerations

   An assignment is requested from IANA "LISP LCAF Type" registry for
   the "Color LCAF", value is TBD.

5.  Security Considerations

   The Color LCAF may indirectly indicate association of the type of
   service offered by some subsets of endpoints to ITRs that was not
   previously disclosed to the ITR.
