<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
    
    This document proposes an experiment for the IETF RFC publication
    process. The experiment is limited in scope and duration. The
    specific experiment has been chosen because (a) it has potential
    to provide a significant process improvement, (b) it can be
    executed at a low cost, (c) it addresses a widely recognized
    problem in the IETF process, and (d) tool support for the
    experiment can be (and has been) built for it. The experiment
    relates to the copyediting and other manual tasks in the
    publication process. Specifically, the amount of work these manual
    tasks require differs widely between drafts, and that for a
    certain subset of drafts, there are either very minor editorial
    changes or no changes at all, modulo the different formatting
    requirements between RFCs and drafts. The experiment involves
    identification of this subset of drafts and processing them
    separately with a "fast path" process that uses almost entirely
    automated processes. For the drafts that belong to this subset, it
    is expected that the RFC Editor queuing time is reduced from
    months or years to weeks.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>When a document is approved by the IESG, it is sent to the RFC
  Editor for publishing. The publication process includes processing
  at IANA, copyediting for grammar and spelling purposes, waiting for
  references to be published, the formatting of the document in the
  RFC style, final checks by authors in so called "Author's 48 Hours",
  and the storage of the draft and metainformation related to it in
  the RFC Editor's information systems.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the entire process can take a long time, from months
  to over a year. There are multiple reasons behind such long processing
  delays:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>RFC Editor or IANA workload. This includes the workload of their
  subcontractors, such as the professional copyediting services
  sometimes employed by the RFC Editor.
</li>
<li>Waiting for normative references to progress through the IETF and
  RFC publication processes.
</li>
<li>Busy, unresponsive or hard-to-reach authors that do not respond in AUTH48
  or do not participate in discussions with IANA.
</li>
<li>Events happening in parallel elsewhere that cause changes to be
  considered for the documents in question. This leads to longer
  AUTH48 periods, going back to the WG or ADs to confirm changes, and
  sometimes even pulling the documents back from the queue.
</li>
<li>Imperfect administrative processes, tool support, or lack of
  input materials. Documents have been known to fall between the
  cracks. The publication process itself is not fully automatic, and
  sometimes there RFC Editor has to do extra work when input material
  such as XML source is missing.
</li>
<li>Bad document quality which results in more copyediting and
  sometimes leads to a need to make even technical modifications.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the current delays are problematic for the IETF. The
  contributors expect to be able to ship products based on RFCs as
  soon as the specifications are approved by the IESG. The long wait
  after the approval delays the deployment of Internet technology, is
  not motivating for the participants, and brings uncertaintity that
  can be harmful. Long processing times increase the likelihood of
  events that prompt people to request "bis" level changes in AUTH48,
  due to implementation experience, for instance.
</p>
<p>If the entire process for creating new specifications is lengthy,
  it can become a barrier to standardizing new technology. An
  efficient IETF process serves the needs of the Internet community
  best. At a high level, the process consists of various parts, such
  as chartering and processing at WG, IESG, and RFC Editor. All of
  these parts take a significant amount of time, and need to be
  addressed separately if a more efficient process is desired.
</p>
<p>This document proposes a limited experiment to be conducted for
  the RFC publication process part, with an expectation to provide a
  significant improvement in the processing time for a subset of
  drafts. It is expected that the experiment does not cause
  significant extra work load either in the IETF or for the RFC
  Editor; tool support for this experiment is released simultaneously
  with the publication of this proposal.
</p>
<p>The experiment relates to the copyediting and other manual tasks
  in the RFC publication process. Specifically, it has been observed
  that the amount of work these manual tasks require differs widely
  between drafts, and that for a certain subset of drafts, there are
  either very minor editorial changes or no changes at all, modulo the
  different formatting requirements between RFCs and drafts. The
  experiment involves identification of this subset of drafts under
  IETF control, and processing them separately with a "fast path"
  process that uses almost entirely automated processes.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Proposed Process</h3>

<p>Under the proposed process, in certain cases the IETF (not
  the RFC Editor) makes the decision how much copyediting the document
  should get. The goal of this change is to focus the limited
  copyediting resources to those documents which would benefit most
  from it, and to allow documents with "good enough" language to
  proceed directly to publication.
</p>
<p>In order for these documents to benefit from having to undergo
  less copyediting, the process focuses only on a very restricted
  subset of documents, namely those that do not require any special
  manual operations other than copyediting. A document is eligible for
  the new process if it fulfills the following conditions when it 
  is approved:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It is an IETF document that undergoes normal IETF last call and IESG evaluation.
</li>
<li>It has an IANA section indicating there are no IANA actions.
</li>
<li>It has no Internet Drafts as normative references.
</li>
<li>It receives no IESG or RFC Editor notes during the IESG process.
</li>
<li>It has been generated using XML2RFC so that automatic processing 
  becomes possible.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fullfillment of these conditions is either already checked
  during the existing process or it can be determined
  programmatically. Our preliminary analysis suggests that more than
  20% of all current Working Group drafts meet these criteria.
</p>
<p>An eligible document is included in this experiment if the IESG 
  decides that copyediting would not significantly improve the quality
  of the document. This determination of having "good enough" language
  is a human decision, made by the IESG during the course of their 
  technical review. Since
  the area directors often read the drafts for the first time during
  IESG evaluation, they will get a fairly good impression how
  difficult the document was to read for someone who has not seen it
  before. Thus, we believe IESG is a good place to make this
  decision. Furthermore, given that the IESG has to read the document
  in any case, this check does not represent a major increase of
  workload for the IESG. Note that the IESG will only record
  their impression of the language quality. It would not be a good
  use of the IESG to ask them to write down the observed problems
  or suggest improvements.
</p>
<p>Under the new process, IESG members voting "Yes" for a given
  document MUST provide and others MAY provide an indication of
  whether the document has sufficiently good language. When providing
  this indication, the IESG members consider the following 
  aspects:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Does the document contain more than a minor number of typos, grammar
    mistakes, or unnecessarily difficult-to-understand language?
</li>
<li>Would copyediting, done by a person who is not familiar with
    the technical content, significantly improve the document?  Or are
    the problems in aspects such as overall document organization or
    bad protocol design that cannot be realistically improved by such
    copyediting?
</li>
<li>What is the purpose of the document? For instance, fine-tuning
    the language is perhaps less important for a document archiving a
    design discussion, and more important for a protocol specification
    that will be read by a large number of people implementing and
    using the protocol.
</li>
<li>What is the intended status (proposed standard, informational,
    etc.) of the document?
</li>
</ul>

<p>An eligible document that has received solely "good enough"
  indications from the IESG is chosen for the fast track process. The
  RFC Editor determines eligibility using a tool, and inspects the
  IESG language quality decision. The fast track process, if chosen,
  eliminates the IANA, copyediting, reference wait, manual format
  conversion, and AUTH48 steps. The following steps are followed:
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>RFC Editor Note</dt>
<dd><br />

  A special RFC Editor Note is attached to the approval decision. This
  note indicates to the RFC Editor what level of copyediting is
  believed to be necessary.
</dd>
<dt>Acquiring XML source</dt>
<dd><br />

  As is already done currently, the RFC Editor asks for the
  authors of recently approved RFCs for the XML source of
  the draft. If such source is not available, the regular process is
  followed.
</dd>
<dt>Determine eligibility</dt>
<dd><br />

  The RFC Editor determines the eligibility of draft, for instance
   by employing a new tool to check reference status and other 
  requirements necessary for the new process.
</dd>
<dt>Format conversion</dt>
<dd><br />

  An option given to a new version of the XML2RFC tool enables it
  to generate output suitable for an RFC. This tool is used to
  generate the final RFC output.
</dd>
<dt>Storage</dt>
<dd><br />

  The RFC Editor updates their information systems (such as the database of
  RFCs) with the new RFC and its metadata.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>This process is done at the document approval notice reception / author
  response reception time. The RFC Editor acts often immediately after
  the approval notice is received, so the fast track process has potential
  to publish the RFC within days of the approval.

Process Expirement</h3>

<p>We believe the crucial question to answer is "Does the
  publication process work better with the modification proposed in
  this document, or without it?"
</p>
<p>If the answer to this question is found to be "yes", then this
  change should be done, independently of other, more ambitious
  projects such as determining the overall requirements for technical
  publication services <a class='info' href='#TechPub'>[TechPub]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mankin, A. and S. Hayes, &ldquo;Requirements for IETF Technical Publication Service,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. However, an
  experiment is needed to better evaluate the effects of the proposed
  process.
</p>
<p>The experiment needs to have a limited scope and duration.  The
  scope of the experiment is naturally limited by the eligibility
  rules, so it is suggested that for a duration of one year, all
  drafts satisfying the eligibility and language quality rules will be
  run through the new process. The experiment is set to begin at
  the time this document is approved for publication.
</p>
<p>Based on our initial analysis, we expect that roughly 100
  documents could be eligible; depending on the quality of these
  documents, we expect somewhere between 25 and 50 documents to use
  the fast track process. The figure depends highly on how strong
  incentives this experiments creates for the authors to improve the
  language before IESG approval.
</p>
<p>During the experiment, the RFC Editor collects separate
  statistics of the processing and queuing times for the regular and
  fast track processes. A person designated as the experiment
  supervisor posts feedback forms to document authors and WG chairs
  with documents going through the new process. At the end of the
  experiment feedback is also solicited from the IESG.
</p>
<p>An evaluation is performed the end of the experiment and the
  results are published as an Internet Draft. The evaluation involves
  employing the statistics to determine the effect of the fast track
  process on document processing time and effort at the RFC Editor
  organization and summary of the feedback received.

Discussion</h3>

<p>This change allows the IESG to focus the limited copyediting
  resources to documents where the benefits are the largest. It is
  expected that the reduced workload for the subset of documents that
  go through this process will also reduce the processing time of
  other documents, given the same level of resources devoted to
  the RFC Editor activities.
</p>
<p>In making the copyediting level decision, the IESG is in a better
  position than the RFC editor to consider all the factors involved
  (e.g., purpose of the document, priority). We believe it is in the
  interest of IETF community to make this decision transparently. When
  this decision is recorded in the public records that IESG makes
  available, this condition is fulfilled.
</p>
<p>More fine-grained scheme that goes beyond on/off control of the
  copyediting can also be considered. However, it is suggested that
  such a scheme be considered if the results of the experiment prove
  useful.
</p>
<p>We have not yet fully analyzed what other choices exist for
  making this decision than IESG evaluation. Some other alternatives
  appear to be possible as well. For instance, there are a number
  of review boards such as GEN-ART that could also provide input.

Incentives</h3>

<p>We believe this arrangement would better align the incentives of
  various parties with the IETF's goals.
</p>
<p>Specifically, this process ensures that the IETF has control over
  the level of copy editing. If the RFC Editor function is contracted
  to a for-profit entity, that entity has an incentive to increase the
  amount of copyediting, and ask for more funding. In a true market
  competition between service providers would control this, but we do
  not currently believe there will be significant price competition
  for the RFC Editor contract.
</p>
<p>The experiment also provides better incentives for document
  authors, WG chairs, and other reviewers. 
  If better-quality text means the
  document progresses faster, people interested in the document have
  an incentive to fix the text earlier (e.g., provide more editorial
  comments during WG last call).  These people are also in good
  position to know what changes are purely editorial and what actually
  change the meaning of the text.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Document Quality</h3>

<p>One argument that could be made against this experiment is that
  less involvement by the RFC editor means that quality will
  suffer.
</p>
<p>We believe the experiment will have exactly the opposite effect.
  The editing work done by the RFC editor does very little to increase
  the quality of documents that are already in a pretty good shape.
  This experiment allows focusing the limited resources on those
  documents where the "return on investment" is the largest.  It also
  creates incentives for the authors to work on the language before
  the document is approved.
</p>
<p>Another potential complication is the difference between the
  XML2RFC output and the style currently used by the RFC editor.
  Discussions about the exact formatting requirements have been going
  on since November 2005, and when used with the "rfcedstyle" option,
  version 1.31pre4 produces output that is believed to match the
  current RFC editor style.  While it is possible that some
  differences remain, and that the preferred style changes over time,
  we believe the current formatting is more than
  acceptable, and fine-tuning it further does not produce value for the
  IETF community.

IESG Workload</h3>

<p>The experiment intentionally proposes a very simple process for
  determining which documents meet the language quality criterion,
  as explained in <a class='info' href='#newprocess'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Proposed Process</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>We expect that the IESG members can make this decision without
  spending any more time than they already do. We also do not expect
  the IESG to produce an explanation why the document was or was not
  chosen, list any of the language problems identified in the
  document, or to negotiate about the decision with the document
  authors.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
Appeals</h3>

<p>One possible problem with the experiment is that <a class='info' href='#RFC2026'>[RFC2026]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> specifies a two-month period for appealing IESG
  decisions. Some people have interpreted this to mean that no document 
  can be published faster than this.
</p>
<p>However, appeals to the IESG are almost always filed within days
  of the decision. Even in cases when writing the complete appeal text
  may take some time, a "notice of intention to appeal" is often given
  immediately. The "fast track" process is also limited to documents
  that go through IETF Last Call, and people who appeal the IESG
  decision read and comment the documents already during the last
  call.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two-month period has not been observed rigidly
  recently.  While the average RFC queue delay ensures that plenty of
  time is left for appeals, in 2005 five RFCs were published less than
  two months from their approval.  (We would be interested in knowing
  how this was possible, so we could try to get our documents to this
  "fast track" -- the record processing time was only five days!
  :-).
</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case of standards track and BCP RFCs, the IESG
  can always reverse its decision after the RFC has been published by
  downgrading the document to "Historic".
</p>
<p>For this experiment, we suggest that documents known to be 
  controversial should not be selected for the fast track process.
  Since more than 99% of documents are not appealed, this is unlikely
  to affect the number of documents in the experiment. In addition, it
  is suggested that for the documents selected for the fast track, the
  approval notices include a request to make the intent to appeal
  known within two weeks.
