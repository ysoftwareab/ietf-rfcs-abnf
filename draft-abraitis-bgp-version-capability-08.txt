                draft-abraitis-bgp-version-capability-08

Abstract

   In this document, we introduce a new BGP capability that allows the
   advertisement of a BGP speaker's routing daemon version.

   This BGP capability is an optional advertisement.  Implementations
   are not required to advertise the version nor to process received
   advertisements.

1.  Introduction

   In modern data center designs, we tend to have conventional routers
   participating in the routing process.  And the fleet of routers has
   different versions of routing daemon.  This means that knowing which
   versions of the routing daemons are running the various routers in
   the network can be a crucial factor in quickly identifying the root
   cause of any protocol or network problems.

   This BGP capability is an optional advertisement.  Implementations
   are not required to advertise the version nor to process received
   advertisements.

   Information about the version of the routing daemon could also be
   exchanged in protocols such as LLDP and CDP.  However, in
   containerized environments, it is very hard and not recommended to
   exchange this information between background processes.  Therefore,
   and to help minimize operational costs, it is helpful to exchange the
   routing daemon information between BGP peers directly.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Software Version Capability

   Although this document is not an IETF Standards Track document, it
   makes use of the terminology from BCP 14 in order to clearly state
   the implementation behaviors.

   Capabilities advertisements with BGP are defined in [RFC5492].  They
   utilize the BGP Capabilities Optional Parameter that contains one or
   more triples <Capability Code, Capability Length, Capability Value>.
   This document defines a new BGP capability, the Software Version
   Capability, with Capability Code TBD and Capability Length and
   Capability Value as described below.

   The inclusion of the Software Version Capability is OPTIONAL.  If an
   implementation supports the inclusion of the capability, the
   implementation MUST include a configuration switch to enable or
   disable its use, and that switch MUST be off by default.

   The Software Version Capability is intended for environments where
   more visibility is needed for troubleshooting purposes.  It is NOT
   RECOMMENDED for use outside a single Autonomous System, or a set of
   Autonomous Systems under a common administration.

   An implementation that does not recognize or support the Software
   Version Capability but receives one must ignore it, as described in
   [RFC5492].

   The triple for the Software Version Capability is as follows:

   Capability Code

      TBD by IANA

   Capability Length

      The Capability Length for the Software Version Capability MUST be
      greater than zero.  A value of zero SHALL be treated as an
      encoding error and the Capability MUST be ignored.

      The Capability Length SHOULD be no greater than 64.  This is the
      limit to allow other capabilities as much space as they require.

      Capability Length is a one-octet unsigned binary integer that
      contains the length of the Capability Value field in octets.

   Capability Value

Internet-Draft     Software Version Capability for BGP       August 2020


      The Capability Value field is encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  It is
      unstructured data and can be formatted in any way that the
      implementor decides.

                   +--------------------------------+
                   |    Version Length (1 octet)    |
                   +--------------------------------+
                   |      Version (variable)        |
                   +--------------------------------+

                                 Figure 1

   Version Length:

      The number of characters in the Version

   Version:

      The Version field MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  A receiving BGP
      speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8 sequences.

3.1.  Capabilities Length Overflow

   As defined in [RFC5492] the total length of capabilities that can be
   carried by the BGP Capabilities Optional Parameter is 255 bytes.  If
   an implementation is constructing a BGP Capabilities Optional
   Parameter and its length exceeds 255 bytes, it is REQUIRED to exclude
   the Software Version Capability.  An implementation may optimally
   achieve this by making the Software Version Capability the last
   capability triple to add to the Parameter, and only adding it if
   there is sufficient space to do so.

   A rogue node can prevent the proper operation of a BGP session, or
   the advertisement of other Capabilities, by not excluding the
   Software Version Capability as required in Section 3.1.  This risk is
   equivalent to a rogue node simply not advertising a specific
   Capability and is not new to BGP.

4.  Operation

   The Software Version Capability MUST only be used for displaying the
   version of a BGP speaker's router daemon to make troubleshooting
   easier.

   Consider a group of routers each with a number of upstream nodes, and
   suppose that each router has a different operating system and
   different routing daemon at a different version installed.  Assuming
   that a specific feature is not working or that there is a bug which

   has not been fixed in a particular version of the code, knowledge of
   the routing daemon versions would allow an operator to quickly
   identify the pattern of which versions are affected.

   Enabling (i.e., turning on) this capability requires bouncing all
   existing BGP sessions and the feature MUST be explicitly configured
   before an implementation advertizes the Software Version Capability.

4.1.  Example Usage

   Below is an example from the [FRRouting] implementation showing both
   the received and advertised Software Version Capability:

     :~# vtysh -c 'show ip bgp summary failed'
     ...
     Neighbor EstdCnt DropCnt ResetTime Reason
     ens192         3       3  00:00:35 Waiting for peer OPEN (n/a)
     ens224         3       3  00:01:12 Waiting for NHT (FRRouting 7.2)
     eth0           3       3  00:00:14 Neighbor deleted (FRRouting 7.3)
     ...

                                 Figure 2

     :~# vtysh -c 'show ip bgp neighbors 198.51.100.1 json' \
     > | jq '."198.51.100.1".neighborCapabilities.versions'
     {
       "advertisedVersion": "FRRouting 7.2-dev-MyOwnFRRVersion",
       "receivedVersion": "FRRouting 7.2-dev-MyOwnFRRVersion-gc68bb14"
     }

                                 Figure 3

5.  IANA Considerations

   The Capability Codes registry is a standalone registry.  IANA is
   requested to assign a capability number from the First Come First
   Served range for the Software Version Capability in this document as
   follows:

           +-------+-----------------------------+------------+
           | Value |         Description         | Reference  |
           +-------+-----------------------------+------------+
           |  TBD  | Software Version Capability | [This.I-D] |
           +-------+-----------------------------+------------+

                   Table 1: Software Version Capability

6.  Security Considerations

   The Software Version Capability should be treated as sensitive
   information: it could be easier for an attacker to exploit the system
   if they know the specific software version and manufacturer of a BGP
   speaker.  This information could be gathered by inspecting BGP OPEN
   messages that carry the Software Version Capability defined in this
   document.  Furthermore, this knowledge may facilitate a number of
   social-engineering attacks.

   Modifying the information advertised by a router might lead to
   attacks including bogus software upgrades and also might mask the
   causes of faults in the network.

   Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a transport that
   provides integrity is used for the BGP session in question, the
   Software Version Capability can be forged.  Unless a transport that
   provides confidentiality is used, the Version Capability could be
   snooped by an attacker.  These issues are common to any BGP message
   but may be of greater interest in the context of this extension as
   explained above.  Refer to the related considerations in [RFC4271]
   and [RFC4272].

   Users of this mechanism should consider applying data minimization
   practices as outlined in Section 6.1 of [RFC6973], as appropriate
   within the deployment context.

   Sensitive information leaks can be minimized by using the [RFC5082]
   mechanism or firewalls to filter out TCP 179 port from untrusted
   networks.  This capability can be disabled per neighbor, thus the
   sensitive information can't be disclosed to untrusted neighbors.
