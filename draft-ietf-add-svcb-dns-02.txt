                Service Binding Mapping for DNS Servers
                       draft-ietf-add-svcb-dns-02

Abstract

   The SVCB DNS record type expresses a bound collection of endpoint
   metadata, for use when establishing a connection to a named service.
   DNS itself can be such a service, when the server is identified by a
   domain name.  This document provides the SVCB mapping for named DNS
   servers, allowing them to indicate support for new transport
   protocols.

Internet-Draft                SVCB for DNS                 February 2022


1.  Introduction

   The SVCB record type [SVCB] provides clients with information about
   how to reach alternative endpoints for a service, which may have
   improved performance or privacy properties.  The service is
   identified by a "scheme" indicating the service type, a hostname, and
   optionally other information such as a port number.  A DNS server is
   often identified only by its IP address (e.g. in DHCP), but in some
   contexts it can also be identified by a hostname (e.g.  "NS" records,
   manual resolver configuration) and sometimes also a non-default port
   number.

   Use of the SVCB record type requires a mapping document for each
   service type, indicating how a client for that service can interpret
   the contents of the SVCB SvcParams.  This document provides the
   mapping for the "dns" service type, allowing DNS servers to offer
   alternative endpoints and transports, including encrypted transports
   like DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Identities and Names

   SVCB record names (i.e.  QNAMEs) are formed using Port-Prefix Naming
   (Section 2.3 of [SVCB]), with a scheme of "dns".  For example, SVCB
   records for a DNS service identified as "dns1.example.com" would be
   queried at "_dns.dns1.example.com".

   In some use cases, the name used for retrieving these DNS records is
   different from the server identity used to authenticate the secure
   transport.  To distinguish them, we use the following terms:

   *  Binding authority - The service name (Section 1.4 of [SVCB]) and
      optional port number used as input to Port-Prefix Naming.

   *  Authentication name - The name used for secure transport
      authentication.  It must be a DNS hostname or a literal IP
      address.  Unless otherwise specified, it is the service name from
      the binding authority.

3.1.  Special case: non-default ports

   Normally, a DNS service is identified by an IP address or a domain
   name.  When connecting to the service using unencrypted DNS over UDP
   or TCP, clients use the default port number for DNS (53).  However,
   in rare cases, a DNS service might be identified by both a name and a
   port number.  For example, the dns: URI scheme [DNSURI] optionally
   includes an authority, comprised of a host and a port number (with a
   default of 53).  DNS URIs normally omit the authority, or specify an
   IP address, but a hostname and non-default port number are allowed.

   When the binding authority specifies a non-default port number, Port-
   Prefix Naming places the port number in an additional a prefix on the
   name.  For example, if the binding authority is
   "dns1.example.com:9953", the client would query for SVCB records at
   "_9953._dns.dns1.example.com".  If two DNS services operating on
   different port numbers provide different behaviors, this arrangement
   allows them to preserve the distinction when specifying alternative
   endpoints.

4.  Applicable existing SvcParamKeys

4.1.  alpn

   This key indicates the set of supported protocols (Section 6.1 of
   [SVCB]).  There is no default protocol, so the no-default-alpn key
   does not apply, and the alpn key MUST be present.

   If the protocol set contains any HTTP versions (e.g. "h2", "h3"),
   then the record indicates support for DNS over HTTPS [DOH], and the
   "dohpath" key MUST be present (Section 5.1).  All keys specified for
   use with the HTTPS record are also permissible, and apply to the
   resulting HTTP connection.

   If the protocol set contains protocols with different default ports,
   and no port key is specified, then protocols are contacted separately
   on their default ports.  Note that in this configuration, ALPN
   negotiation does not defend against cross-protocol downgrade attacks.

4.2.  port

   This key is used to indicate the target port for connection
   (Section 6.2 of [SVCB]).  If omitted, the client SHALL use the
   default port for each transport protocol (853 for DNS over TLS [DOT],
   443 for DNS over HTTPS).

   This key is automatically mandatory if present.  (See Section 7 of
   [SVCB] for the definition of "automatically mandatory".)

4.3.  Other applicable SvcParamKeys

   These SvcParamKeys from [SVCB] apply to the "dns" scheme without
   modification:

   *  ech

   *  ipv4hint

   *  ipv6hint

   Future SvcParamKeys may also be applicable.

5.  New SvcParamKeys

5.1.  dohpath

   "dohpath" is a single-valued SvcParamKey whose value (both in
   presentation and wire format) MUST be a URI Template [RFC6570]
   encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  If the "alpn" SvcParamKey indicates
   support for HTTP, "dohpath" MUST be present, and clients MAY
   construct a DNS over HTTPS URI Template as follows:

   1.  Let $HOST be the authentication name encoded as a "host" value
       (Section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986]).

   2.  Let $PORT be the port from the "port" key if present, otherwise
       443.  (The binding authority's port number MUST NOT be used.)

   3.  Let $DOHPATH be the "dohpath" value, decoded from UTF-8.

   4.  The DNS over HTTPS URI Template is "https://$HOST:$PORT$DOHPATH".

   The "dohpath" value MUST be chosen such that the resulting URI
   Template is valid for use with DNS over HTTPS.  For example, DNS over
   HTTPS servers are required to support requests using GET and POST
   methods.  The GET method relies on the "dns" URI Template parameter,
   and the POST method does not use it.  Therefore, the URI Template is
   required to make use of a "dns" variable, and result in a valid URI
   whether or not "dns" is defined.

   Clients SHOULD NOT query for any "HTTPS" RRs when using the
   constructed URI Template.  Instead, the SvcParams and address records
   associated with this SVCB record SHOULD be used for the HTTPS
   connection, with the same semantics as an HTTPS RR.  However, for
   consistency, service operators SHOULD publish an equivalent HTTPS RR,
   especially if clients might learn this URI Template through a
   different channel.

6.  Limitations

   This document is concerned exclusively with the DNS transport, and
   does not affect or inform the construction or interpretation of DNS
   messages.  For example, nothing in this document indicates whether
   the service is intended for use as a recursive or authoritative DNS
   server.  Clients must know the intended use in their context.

7.  Examples

   *  A resolver at "simple.example" that supports DNS over TLS on port
      853 (implicitly, as this is its default port):

      _dns.simple.example. 7200 IN SVCB 1 simple.example. alpn=dot

   *  A resolver at "doh.example" that supports only DNS over HTTPS (DNS
      over TLS is not supported):

      _dns.doh.example. 7200 IN SVCB 1 doh.example. (
            alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} )

   *  A resolver at "resolver.example" that supports:

      -  DNS over TLS on "resolver.example" ports 853 (implicit in
         record 1) and 8530 (explicit in record 2), with
         "resolver.example" as the Authentication Domain Name,

      -  DNS over HTTPS at https://resolver.example/dns-query{?dns}
         (record 1), and

      -  an experimental protocol on fooexp.resolver.example:5353
         (record 3):

         _dns.resolver.example.  7200 IN SVCB 1 resolver.example. (
             alpn=dot,h2,h3 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} )
         _dns.resolver.example.  7200 IN SVCB 2 resolver.example. (
             alpn=dot port=8530 )
         _dns.resolver.example.  7200 IN SVCB 3 fooexp (
               port=5353 alpn=foo foo-info=... )

   *  A nameserver at "ns.example" whose service configuration is
      published on a different domain:

      _dns.ns.example. 7200 IN SVCB 0 _dns.ns.nic.example.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Adversary on the query path

   This section considers an adversary who can add or remove responses
   to the SVCB query.

   During secure transport establishment, clients MUST authenticate the
   server to its authentication name, which is not influenced by the
   SVCB record contents.  Accordingly, this draft does not mandate the
   use of DNSSEC.  This draft also does not specify how clients
   authenticate the name (e.g. selection of roots of trust), which might
   vary according to the context.

8.1.1.  Downgrade attacks

   This attacker cannot impersonate the secure endpoint, but it can
   forge a response indicating that the requested SVCB records do not
   exist.  For a SVCB-reliant client ([SVCB], Section 3) this only
   results in a denial of service.  However, SVCB-optional clients will
   generally fall back to insecure DNS in this case, exposing all DNS
   traffic to attacks.

8.1.2.  Redirection attacks

   SVCB-reliant clients always enforce the authentication domain name,
   but they are still subject to attacks using the transport, port
   number, and "dohpath" value, which are controlled by this adversary.
   By changing these values in the SVCB answers, the adversary can
   direct DNS queries for $HOSTNAME to any port on $HOSTNAME, and any
   path on "https://$HOSTNAME".  If the DNS client uses shared TLS or
   HTTP state, the client could be correctly authenticated (e.g. using a
   TLS client certificate or HTTP cookie).

   This behavior creates a number of possible attacks for certain server
   configurations.  For example, if "https://$HOSTNAME/upload" accepts
   any POST request as a public file upload, the adversary could forge a
   SVCB record containing dohpath=/upload.  This would cause the client
   to upload and publish every query, resulting in unexpected storage
   costs for the server and privacy loss for the client.  Similarly, if
   two DoH endpoints are available on the same origin, and the service
   has designated one of them for use with this specification, this
   adversary can cause clients to use the other endpoint instead.

   To mitigate redirection attacks, a client of this SVCB mapping MUST
   NOT provide client authentication for DNS queries, except to servers
   that it specifically knows are not vulnerable to such attacks.  If an
   endpoint sends an invalid response to a DNS query, the client SHOULD

Internet-Draft                SVCB for DNS                 February 2022


   NOT send more queries to that endpoint.  DNS services that are
   identified by a hostname (Section 3) MUST ensure that all
   unauthenticated DNS requests to that name receive any promised
   privacy and security guarantees, regardless of transport, port
   number, or HTTP path.

8.2.  Adversary on the transport path

   This section considers an adversary who can modify network traffic
   between the client and the alternative service (identified by the
   TargetName).

   For a SVCB-reliant client, this adversary can only cause a denial of
   service.  However, because DNS is unencrypted by default, this
   adversary can execute a downgrade attack against SVCB-optional
   clients.  Accordingly, when use of this specification is optional,
   clients SHOULD switch to SVCB-reliant behavior if SVCB resolution
   succeeds.  Specifications making using of this mapping MAY adjust
   this fallback behavior to suit their requirements.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Per [SVCB] IANA is directed to add the following entry to the SVCB
   Service Parameters registry.

   +========+=========+==============================+=================+
   | Number | Name    | Meaning                      | Reference       |
