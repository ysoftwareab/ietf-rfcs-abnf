1. Introduction

   It is often desirable to send adjunct information from the LAC to the
   LNS during call setup.  Some such information can be circuit
   oriented, describing the attributes of the circuit interface.  Other
   information could describe the peer itself.  In either case, the
   information is typically used for for logging or debugging.  L2TP
   [RFC2661] already has a Physical Channel ID AVP that provides a
   limited logging capability during call setup.  It is limited in that
   its length is only 4 octets.  This draft defines extensions whereby
   human-readable ASCII strings are sent during call setup.  The strings
   are typed, but uninterpreted by L2TP.  Their sole purposes are to
   enhance logging and debugging capabilities in L2TP.

1.1 Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. L2TP AVPs

   All of the AVPs share the following attributes:

      The AVPs are not mandatory (the M bit MUST be set to 0).  The AVP
      SHOULD NOT be hidden (the H-bit SHOULD be set to 0).

      The information strings themselves MUST be human readable, they
      SHOULD contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279] characters using the
      Default Language [BCP18].

      The strings are not null-terminated.  Valid lengths are between 1
      and 253 octets, so it can fit on a RADIUS attribute.

      The format of the information strings are purposely not defined.
      The contents of the string MUST NOT be parsed nor interpreted by
      the receiving L2TP endpoint.

      As mentioned previously, possible uses of the strings are output
      to a console or logging to a server.  If the strings were to be
      used in RADIUS accounting or authentication requests, it SHOULD be
      mapped into corresponding RADIUS attributes defined in section 3.

      If a session that contains these AVPs goes through a L2TP tunnel
      switch, the AVPs MUST be "sent through" unchanged.  That is, the
      original AVPs MUST be included on the new call established from
      the tunnel switch to the next peer.

      For incoming calls, the AVPs are valid either on ICRQ or ICCN.  If
      sent on both, the ICCN AVPs override the ICRQ values.  For
      outgoing calls, the AVPs are valid on OCRP and OCCN, with similar
      override behavior.

2a Call-Information AVP

   The Call Information AVP, Attribute type TBD, allows a UTF-8 string
   to be sent with a human readable description of the call.  The AVP
   has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   string to be sent with a human readable description of the software
   running on the platform.  The AVP has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

3. RADIUS attributes

3a. Call-Information RADIUS attribute

   Description
      This Attribute indicates text which MAY be supplied to the RADIUS
      [RFC2865] server during authentication (Access-Request),

      accounting (Accounting-Request) or tunnel-link accounting
      [RFC2867] for the purposes of logging only.  The message MUST NOT
      be parsed and as such termination action MUST NOT be based on the
      contents of this attribute.

      In contrast to RADIUS Connect-Info [RFC2869], Call-Information
      indicates where a call terminated, not what it terminated as. For
      example, Call-Information MAY be used to report NAS module, slot,
      port in a vendor specific format. Connect-Info MAY be used to
      specify negotiated compression, connection protocol etc...

      Multiple Call-Information's MAY be included and if any are
      displayed, they MUST be displayed in the same order as they appear
      in the packet.

      A summary of the Call-Information Attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

          0                   1                   2

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   Type

      TBD for Call-Information.

   Length

      >= 3

   Text

      The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
      implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable,
      and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended
      that the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279] characters
      using the Default Language [BCP18].  The string is not null-
      terminated.

   For L2TP calls, this attribute SHOULD be used to log information
   obtained via Call-Information AVPs. See section 2.

3b. Platform-Information RADIUS attribute

   For L2TP tunnels, this attribute MUST be used to log information
   obtained via Platform-Information AVPs. See section 2. To cater for
   L2TP multihop environments, if no Platform-Information is available,
   then this attribute MUST be used with L=2. Such attributes indicate
   that no Platform-Information was available for a particular node
   within the L2TP tunnel path. The sequence of RADIUS Platform-
   Information attributes MUST follow that of any L2TP Platform-
   Information AVPS received.

4. Security Considerations

   This document describes mechanisms where arbitrary, human-readable
   information can be sent between L2TP peers.  User of these AVPs
   should have the understanding that any information sent is completely
   insecure.  If the information sent could be used for malicious
   purposes, the use of the features described in this document
   increases the possibility of that information being compromised.  In
   particular, since the text message AVP SHOULD NOT be hidden, even
   that security feature cannot be employed.
