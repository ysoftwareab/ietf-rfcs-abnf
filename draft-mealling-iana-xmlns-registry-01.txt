Abstract

   This documenet describes an IANA maintained registry for IETF
   standards which use XML related items such as Namespaces, DTD,
   Schemas, and RDF Schemas.

1. Introduction

   Over the past few years XML [2] has become a widely used method for
   data markup.  There have already been several IETF Working Groups
   that have produced standards that define XML DTDs, XML Namespaces [3]
   and XML Schemas [4].  Each one of these technologies uses URIs [1] to
   identify their respective versions.  For example, a given XML
   document defines its DTD using the DOCTYPE element.  This element,

   like SGML, has a PUBLIC and a SYSTEM identifier.  It is standard
   practice within W3C standards to forego the use of the PUBLIC
   identifier in favor of 'well known' SYSTEM identifiers.  There have
   been several IETF standards that have simply created non-existent
   URIs in order to simply identify but not resolve the SYSTEM
   identifier for some given XML document.

   This document seeks to standardize this practice by creating an IANA
   maintained registry of XML elements so that document authors and
   implementors have a well maintained and authoritative location for
   their XML elements.  As part of this standard, the IANA will both
   house the public representation of the document and assign it a
   Uniform Resource Name that can be used as the URI in any URI based
   identification components of XML.

2. Registerable Documents

2.1 The Assigned URIs

   All elements in this registry will have a URN of the form:

   	urn:iana:xml:<class>:<id>


    where <class> is the type of the document being registered (see
   below).  <id> is a unique id generated by the IANA based on any means
   the IANA deems necessary to maintain uniqueness and persistence.

   The IANA will also maintain a file server available via at least HTTP
   that contains all of the registered elements in some publicly
   accessible file space (in the same way that all of the IANAs
   registered elements are available via
   http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/).

2.2 Document Types

   The list of types of XML documents that can be registered with the
   IANA are:

   dtd -- An XML document that contains a DOCTYPE element can identify
      its DTD via both a PUBLIC identifier and a SYSTEM identifier.  The
      URN assigned by the IANA can be used as the value of the SYSTEM
      identifier.

   ns -- XML Namespaces [3] are named by a URI.  They have no real,
      machine-parseable representation other than the specifications
      that define them.  Thus the element registered will be the
      specification (or a pointer to it).  The URN assigned by the IANA

      will be the XML Namespace's name.

   schema -- XML Schemas [4] are also identified by a URI but their
      contents are machine parseable.  The IANA registered document will
      be the XML Schema file.  The URN the IANA assigns can be used as
      the URI for the schema.

   rdfschema -- The Resource Description  Format (RDF) [5] is an XML
      serialization of a connected graph based data model used for
      metadata expression.  RDF makes use of schemas for RDF that
      express grammars about relationships between URIs.  These grammars
      are identified by URIs.  The URN assigned by the IANA can be used
      as the identifying URI.


3. Registration Procedures

   Until such time as the IANA requests or implements an automated
   process for the registration of these elements, any specifications
   wishing to do so must make that request part of the IANA
   considerations section of their respective documents.

4. IANA Considerations

   This documents seeks to create a rather large registry for which the
   IANA (at the direction of the IESG) will primarily be responsible.
   The amount of effort required to maintain this registry is not
   insignificant and the policies and procedures surrounding any
   approval process are non-trivial.
