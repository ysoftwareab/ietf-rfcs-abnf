Internet Draft    SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


Abstract

    This Internet Draft defines a Dedicated Management Connection 
    between Upper Layer Management entity and Stream Control 
    Transmission Protocol (SCTP)[1] on any Network Element using SCTP.
    The Dedicated Management Connection provides an interface for upper
    Layer Management entity to obtain different types of events 
    pertaining to all SCTP associations that exist from host network 
    element to peer network elements. It also provides a mechanism for 
    tuning stack specific parameters,dynamic IP address addition[2] and      
    collecting debug,status,trace and diagnostic informations.

Internet Draft    SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


1. Introduction

1.1 Scope 

    SCTP is used as the transport protocol for various PSTN and other 
    Signaling information transfer over IP. In most applications the 
    resources allocated by the upper layer are tied to the SCTP associ-
    ations. So it is required to monitor those associations by an upper
    layer entity.For e.g. if the association breaks the network element
    may have to deallocate the corresponding resources and try to do 
    some recovery actions for that association. Also using a Local 
    Maintenance Terminal(LMT) the operator would be interested in 
    performing some query or carry out some maintenance activities
    (like shutting down an association) on the associations.

    There is a need for a dedicated connection which serves as an 
    interface between SCTP stack and upper layer management entity. The
    Upper Layer Management entity can receive SCTP events,status,debug,    
    diagnostic information etc., through this dedicated management 
    connection (DMC).This draft talks about the Dedicated Management 
    Connection which can act as an interface between a Management 
    application (a.k.a ULME) and the SCTP stack.This interface provides 
    a means for an Upper Layer Management application to carry out 
    OAM&P activities.

    In the absence of this DMC, it is the responsibility of each upper 
    Layer entity to report the SCTP events to a management entity. This 
    means each SCTP event from SCTP stack, corresponding to an Upper 
    Layer entity, will have two hops before reaching the management 
    entity.Whereas in case of DMC an SCTP event is transferred directly
    to the management entity. Moreover the applications need to 
    implement some kind of interprocess communicatio n and some sort of 
    protocol,which will complicate the architecture.

    In addition to this, DMC provides an interface for the Upper Layer
    management entity to tune certain SCTP Stack specific parameters 
    for e.g., number of Associations, IP Address List etc. DMC can also
    be used for Dynamic IP address addition and deletion[2].

    The Dedicated Management Connection can

     * Support management of all SCTP transport associations.

     * Support asynchronous reporting of status changes to management.
  
* Support subscription and un-subscription to any or all 
  SCTP events.
    
     * Support Status Query for any or all associations

     * Support for a tearing down a particular or all associations.

Internet    Draft SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000



     * Support trace of communication over any SCTP association.
 
     * Support diagnostic information transfer.

     * Support of tuning SCTP stack specific parameters.

     * Support of dynamic IP address addition and deletion[2].



1.2 Terminology

        Some of the Key Terminologies used in SCTP[1] and/or in this 
        document have been provided here.


   SCTP End Point (SEP): The logical sender/receiver of SCTP packets.On 
      a multi-homed host, an SCTP endpoint is represented to its peers 
      as a combination of a set of eligible destination transport 
      addresses to which SCTP packets can be sent and a set of eligible 
      source transport addresses from which SCTP packets can be 
      received. All transport addresses used by an SCTP endpoint must 
      use the same port number, but can use multiple IP addresses.
      A transport address used by an SCTP endpoint must not be used by 
      another SCTP endpoint.  In other words, a transport address is 
      unique to an SCTP endpoint[1].


   SCTP user application (SCTP user): The logical higher-layer
      application entity which uses the services of SCTP, also called
      the Upper-layer Protocol (ULP)[1].

   Transport address:  A Transport Address is traditionally defined
      by Network Layer address, Transport Layer protocol and Transport
      Layer port number.  In the case of SCTP running over IP, a
      transport address is defined by the combination of an IP address
      and an SCTP port number(where SCTP is the Transport protocol)[1].

	
   Association : An association refers to a SCTP association [1]. The
	association provides the transport for ULP[1].

   Upper Layer Management Entity(ULME): The logical higher-layer 
      application entity that manages all SCTP associations on the
      host Network Element or node.

   Stream: A stream refers to a SCTP stream [1].  

   SCTP packet (or packet):  The unit of data delivery across the
      interface between SCTP and the connectionless packet network

Internet    Draft SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


      (e.g., IP).  An SCTP packet includes the common SCTP header,
      possible SCTP control chunks, and user data encapsulated within
      SCTP DATA chunks [1].

    Chunk: A unit of information within an SCTP packet, consisting of
      a chunk header and chunk-specific content[1].

Internet Draft    SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


     Fig(1) gives a schematic representation of Dedicated Management 
     Connection(DMC) to SCTP.  SCTP Transport indicates SCTP protocol 
     instance. SCTP User represents an Upper Layer application. ULME is
     another upper layer application that monitors all SCTP associations
     of a specific SCTP User or all SCTP Users. ULME can be a part of 
     each SCTP user or there can be a centralized ULME for all SCTP 
     users on that network element/node. This is implementation 
     dependent. 

     Section 2 of this document details the services and functions 
     supported by the DMC and Section 3 of this document 
     sketches an API that should exist for a DMC between ULME and SCTP.

     NOTE: DMC exist between SCTP stack and ULME on the local node
          and DMC is NOT visible to peer nodes. 


2. Dedicated Management Connection

     The type of interface between the SCTP stack and the ULME is 
     dependent upon the implementation. There could be zero or more 
     such interface. The interface could be implemented in such a way 
     that only privileged user applications can open such an interface.
     For e.g. in Unix systems, only applications which run as root(i.e.
     with UID / EUID equal to 0) could open such an interface. The 
     advantage of this is to restrict unauthorized application from 
     changing the stack parameters. 

     The SCTP could reserve a port for the DMC. In that case this port
     could not be used for communication with the peer nodes. The 
     implementation could choose a different method also to 
     differentiate between a normal connection and a Dedicated 
     Management Connection. For e.g. in TLI/XTI kind of interface, two
     different device files (/dev/sctp & /dev/sctp_dmc) could be used 
     to differentiate a normal connection and a DMC. 

2.1 Management of SCTP Associations

     The management of SCTP associations includes monitoring the list 
     of active associations, tearing down a particular or all 
     associations,status query for all or for a particular association.   
     Monitoring an association requires subscribing for asynchronous
     events like COMMUNICATION UP , COMMUNICATION LOST , COMMUNICATION
     ERROR , RESTART [1] notifications from the SCTP stack for selected 
     or for all the associations. 

2.1.1 Registration/Deregistration of SCTP Events

     The ULME shall send a REGISTER_ASSOCIATION_EVENTS (Refer Section 
     3.1 for details) command to the SCTP stack to  Register/Deregister
     for the asynchronous SCTP events. The REGISTER_ASSOCIATION_EVENTS 

Selva & Prasanna                                               [Page 7]

Internet Draft    SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


     Command can optionally carry the association id if the 
     subscription/unsubscription is needed for a particular association.
     If no association id is sent then the events for all the 
     associations will be subscribed/unsubscribed. Also the   
     REGISTER_ASSOCIATION_EVENTS command can optionally carry the list 
     of events(e.g. COMMUNICATION UP) to be subscribed/unsubscribed. If
     no events are specified then all asynchronous events will be    
     subscribed/unsubscribed. The stack shall send    
     REGISTER_ASSOCIATION_EVEENTS_ACK / ERROR based on the success or 
     failure of the subscription/unsubscription.

2.1.2 Tearing down associations

     The ULME can tear down a particular association or all the associ-
     ations. The ULME shall either send a SHUTDOWN[1] or SHUTDOWN_ALL
     (Refer to Section 3.1) to the SCTP stack to do a graceful 
     termination of a particular or all associations respectively. 
     Similarly ULME shall either send a ABORT[1] or ABORT_ALL (Refer 
     section 3.1) to SCTP Stack to do an ungraceful termination of a 
     particular or all associations respectively. 

     The ULME can use this command if it wants to perform some 
     maintenance on the network element. 

2.1.3 Status Query

     The ULME can perform a status query to get the details about 
     existing SCTP associations. The ULME shall either send a STATUS[1]
     or STATUS_ALL(Refer Section 3.1) command to SCTP to get this 
     information for a particular association or all associations 
     respectively. 

     The ULME can present this information to the operator or can 
     perform some actions based on the values received.

2.2 Trace
          
     The ULME could perform a trace of the packets transmitted or 
     received.  The trace information can contain the actual packet 
     transmitted/received, transport address of the local and that of
     the peer used for transmission/reception etc.The trace information
     could be collected by the stack and sent over periodic intervals.
     The ULME shall send a CHANGE_TRACE command (Refer to Section 3.1)
     to the SCTP stack to enable or disable the trace option. This 
     command can optionally carry the association id if the trace is 
     requested for a particular association. If association id is not 
     present the trace information shall be enabled or disabled for all
     the associations.

Internet Draft    SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


2.3 Diagnostics

     The ULME could register or deregister for the diagnostic 
     information such as total number of chunks transmitted/received,
     timeouts,checksum error etc. These diagnostic information could be   
     collected by the stack and updated at periodic intervals. The ULME 
     shall send a REGISTER_DIAGNOSTICS command(Refer to section 3.1) to
     the stack to register or deregister for the diagnostic information.
     The command could optionally carry the association id if the 
     diagnostic information is requested for a particular association.
     If the association id is not present then the diagnostic 
     information for all the associations will be considered.


2.4 SCTP Stack Parameters tuning

    The ULME could change the value of certain parameters used by the 
    SCTP. Some of these parameters include SCTP timer values, 
    maximum number of associations, maximum number of inbound/outbound
    streams, buffer sizes, etc. The SCTP shall send
    a TUNE_PARAMETER (Refer Section 3.1) command to the stack to change 
    the value of a particular parameter. The command shall carry the 
    parameter that is to be changed and the new value.  

        Note : These are parameters that are common to all associations 
               i.e. these are stack specific parameters.

   
2.5 Changing the Debug level

    The ULME could turn on and change the debug levels at runtime. The 
    SCTP stack could implement different debug levels (for e.g. level0
    - no debug, level1 - all SCTP messages exchanged between the peers,
    level 2 - messages exchanged between ULP and SCTP and the 
    corresponding functions called and attributes passed, level3 - 
    internal buffers sizes, etc) for different kinds of debug 
    information. The ULME would send a CHANGE_DEBUG_LEVEL command(Refer
    to Section 3.1) with the debug level and the option to turn ON or 
    turn OFF the debug to the SCTP stack. The stack would respond back
    with a success or a failure. 

2.6 Dynamic IP address Addition/deletion

    The ULME could perform the dynamic IP address addition/deletion [2] 
    through the DMC. The ULME would send  ADD_IP_ADDRESS or 
    DELETE_IP_ADDRESS command (Refer to Section 3.1) to the SCTP stack.
    The command would carry the IPV4 or IPV6 address that has to be 
    added or deleted. The SCTP stack shall send a success or failure
    message to the ULME upon completion of the addition / deletion.

Internet Draft    SCTP Dedicated Management Connection    December 2000


3. DMC Interface

    The Upper Layer Management Entity(ULME) shall register for services
    by passing Registration primitives over DMC to SCTP. ULME shall 
    receive asynchronous and synchronous notifications from SCTP. 
    Synchronous notifications are sent in response to requests and 
    queries made by ULME.   


3.1 ULME-to-SCTP

    This section defines ULME to SCTP interface for various 
    applications. The primitives described below help in 
    inter-process communication between DLME and SCTP. In addition to
    the primitives described in this section, ULME uses many of the 
    primitives described by [1].

  A) Status of All Associations

    Format: STATUS_ALL(local SCTP instance name) 
    -> Associations Data

    This primitive allows ULME to request SCTP to provide him with 
    details of all existing associations for the specified SCTP 
    instance.

    This can be the first primitive ULME sends to SCTP after ULME 
    is initialized or ULME can use this any time to get the latest 
    information on all existing SCTP association for this SCTP instance 
    to update its database. For e.g., there can be mismatch between 
    ULME and SCTP databases for various reasons.

    This primitive should return blocks of data containing the 
    following information for each SCTP association in this SCTP 
    instance:
    
     association id
     association connection state,
     destination transport address list,
     destination transport address reachability states,
     current receiver window size,
     current congestion window sizes,
     number of  unacknowledged DATA chunks,
     number of DATA chunks pending receipt,
     primary path,
     most recent SRTT on primary path,
     RTO on primary path,
     SRTT and RTO on other destination addresses, etc.

   Mandatory attributes:    

   * local SCTP instance name - Obtained from INITIALISE operation[1].
 
   Optional Attributes:
   
   None.



 B) Register for Association Events

    Format: REGISTER_ASSOCIATION_EVENTS (local SCTP instance,
    [association id],[event names], new value)
    -> result

    This primitive allows ULME to register with SCTP stack for a 
    specific SCTP event or all SCTP events for a specific association
    or all associations of an SCTP instance.

    SCTP shall respond with a result code which may indicate a 
    Successful or unsuccessful registration.
   
   
   Mandatory attributes:
 
  * local SCTP instance name - Obtained from INITIALISE operation[1].
     This indicates that SCTP shall provide DLME with asynchronous 
     events specified by [event names] for the association of this 
     SCTP instance specified by [association id].
  
  * new value - This attribute indicates SCTP to either REGISTER or 
    DE-REGISTER for events with SCTP.
  

   Optional attributes:

   The following types of attributes may be passed along with the
   primitive:    
   

   * association id - local handle to a specific SCTP association [1]. 
     This attribute not present implies all associations of
     an SCTP instance.
 
* event names - one or more of the asynchronous events defined by the 
  SCTP-to-ULME  primitives . This attribute not present implies all 
  asynchronous events for an SCTP association. Asynchronous events 
  include

 ULME can use one or more of the following ULP-to-SCTP primitives 
 described in [1] for providing services explained in Section 2 of
 this document: 

      Change Heartbeat [1]
      Request HeartBeat [1]
      Set Protocol Parameters [1],
      Set Failure Threshold [1],
      Status [1],
      Shutdown [1],
      Abort[1],
      Destroy SCTP instance [1]


3.2 SCTP-to-ULME

    SCTP-to-ULME communication requires support from application 
    environment or Operating System to provide methods to interface 
    with ULME for sending SCTP events.     


    ULME uses one or more of the following SCTP-to-ULP primitives 
    described in [1] for providing services explained in Section 2 of 
    this document:

      NETWORK STATUS CHANGE notification[1],
      COMMUNICATION UP notification[1],
      COMMUNICATION LOST notification [1],
      COMMUNICATION ERROR notification[1],
      RESTART notification[1],
      SHUTDOWN COMPLETE notification[1]


    In addition to this, SCTP-to-ULME communication includes passing 
    complete SCTP Association information as requested by 
    STATUS_ALL and STATUS primitives mentioned in Section 3.1. 

    It also involves passing TRACE, DIAGNOSTIC and DEBUG information
    as requested by REGISTER_DIAGNOSTICS, CHANGE_TRACE and

    CHANGE_DEBUG_LEVEL primitives. But TRACE,DIAGNOSTICS and DEBUG 
    information can be passed either as primitives or by logging into 
    a file, which is implementation dependent.
