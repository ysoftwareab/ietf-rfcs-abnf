     1. Introduction 

     The SatLabs Group [SATLABS] is an international non-profit EEIG 
     (European Economic Interest Grouping) committed to large-scale adoption 
     and deployment of the Digital Video Broadcasting Return Channel via 
     Satellite (DVB-RCS) standard [ETSI-RCS]. SatLabs members are service 
     providers, satellite operators, system integrators, terminal 
     manufacturers and technology providers with an interest in DVB-RCS. 
      
     Since its creation in 2001, the main goal of the SatLabs Group has been 
     to achieve interoperability between DVB-RCS terminals and systems. 
     Therefore, the Group has defined the SatLabs Qualification Program that 
     provides an independent certification process for DVB-RCS Terminals 
     based on System Recommendations defined by SatLabs. To enhance products 
     interoperability, beyond the physical and MAC layer mechanisms defined 
     in the DVB-RCS standard, SatLabs has expanded its Recommendations in the 
     field of DVB-RCS terminal management [SATLABS]. As a part of this 
     effort, SatLabs has specified a common SNMP Management Information Base 
     (MIB) for DVB-RCS terminals, which is defined in this document. 
      
     A DVB-RCS terminal is denoted as a Return Channel Satellite Terminal 
     (RCST) in the remainder of this document. This consists of an Indoor 
     Unit (IDU) and an Outdoor Unit (ODU) connected through an Inter Facility 
     Link (IFL), usually a coaxial L-band interface. On the user side, the

     IDU is connected to the user network through a Local Area Network (LAN) 
     interface (usually Ethernet). On the network side, the ODU is connected 
     via a satellite link (the Air Interface). 
      
     The DVB-RCS MIB is implemented in the IDU of an RCST. RCST management 
     can be performed either through the LAN interface (Local management) or 
     through the Air Interface (Remote management from the Network Control 
     Center, NCC). RCST and NCC elements are shown in Figure 1.

     2.2. Glossary 

        The terms in this document are derived either from DVB-RCS standard 
        specifications [ETSI-RCS] or from SatLabs System Recommendations 
        [SATLABS]. 

     2.2.1. Star DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a hub-and-spoke configuration where all communications 
        pass through a central hub, that usually also includes the NCC. Peer-
        to-peer communication between RCSTs is possible, but through a double 
        satellite hop (this traffic has to pass through the hub). 

     2.2.2. Mesh DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a mesh configuration that supports peer-to-peer 
        communications in a single satellite hop directly between RCSTs. 

     2.2.3. Transparent DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a network using transparent satellite transponders. Star 
        or mesh network configurations can be supported. In the case of a 
        mesh configuration, RCSTs need to incorporate a TDMA receiver in 
        addition to the TDM receiver.

     2.2.4. Regenerative DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a network using regenerative satellite transponders, 
        i.e. including some On-Board Processing functionality allowing 
        demodulation and decoding of the uplink TDMA signals and re-multiplex 
        the traffic on the downlink. Star or mesh network configurations can 
        be supported. 

     2.2.5. DVB-RCS MAC layer 

        The DVB-RCS MAC Layer represents the air interface of an RCST, as 
        defined in the DVB-RCS standard. The interface supports star and mesh 
        networks and is bi-directional. 

     2.2.6. DVB-RCS Downlink 

        The downlink is a DVB-RCS physical link based on TDM. It corresponds 
        to the forward link of a DVB-RCS transparent system or the downlink 
        of a DVB-RCS regenerative system. It is based on either the DVB-S or 
        DVB-S2 standard. In the DVB-RCS context, this interface is bi-
        directional. 

     2.2.7. DVB-RCS Uplink 

        The DVB-RCS Uplink is based on TDMA. It corresponds to the return or 
        mesh link of a RCS transparent system or the uplink of a RCS 
        regenerative system. It is based on the DVB-RCS standard. 

        In the context of star transparent and mesh regenerative DVB-RCS 
        systems, this interface is uni-directional. 

        In the context of mesh transparent DVB-RCS systems, this interface is 
        bi-directional. 

     2.2.8. IDU 

        This is the indoor part of the RCST (including at least the power 
        supply, and usually also the modem and networking functions). 

     2.2.9. ODU 

        This is the outdoor part of the RCST (including at least the aerial, 
        and usually also the LNB and BUC).

     2.2.10. RCST 

        This is the Satellite Terminal, installed on the customer premises. 
        It is composed of the IDU and ODU. 

     2.2.11. NCC 

        The NCC provides Control and Monitoring Functions. It generates 
        control and timing signals for the operation of the DVB-RCS Network. 

     2.2.12. Configuration file 

        The configuration file is XML formatted file, storing configuration 
        parameters for the RCST and their values. 

     2.2.13. Logfile 

        The logfile is stored at the RCST. This is used to log particular 
        events that occurr on RCST side. 

     2.2.14. InstallLogfile 

        The Installlogfile is stored at the RCST. This logs particular events 
        that occur on RCST side, related to RCST installation phase. 

     2.2.15. Antenna alignment 

        This is the process to align the RCST antenna, part of the ODU, in 
        order to enable bi-directional communication (uplink, downlink) with 
        the satellite network. 

     2.2.16. CW frequency 

        The CW frequency is the frequency of a Continuous Wave signal. It is 
        a narrowband carrier transmitted for the duration of measurements 
        during the installation of a RCST. 

     2.2.17. Request Class 

        A Request Class (RC) is a representation of a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) 
        at the MAC layer. It defines a behavior of the MAC layer for a given 
        aggregation of traffic. This behavior includes a combination of 
        Capacity Categories associated to the RC and a Priority with respect 
        to the other RCs supported by a RCST.

     Internet-Draft               DVB-RCS MIB                      July 2008 
         

     2.2.18. Channel ID 

        Each Request Class is identified by a unique Channel_ID in the 
        communication between the RCST and the NCC. 

     2.2.19. ATM profile 

        The ATM profile is one of the two profiles for traffic burst format 
        on a DVB-RCS uplink. It is based on one or more concatenated ATM 
        cells, each of length 53 bytes, plus an optional prefix. 

     2.2.20. MPEG profile 

        The MPEG profile is one of the two profiles for traffic burst format 
        on the DVB-RCS uplink. It is based on a number of concatenated MPEG2-
        TS packets, each of length 188 bytes. 

     2.2.21. PID pool 

        For the MPEG profile several RCs may be mapped within a pool of 
        several PIDs to allow cross-RC Section Packing [RFC4259]. Section 
        packing can be used on all PIDs and higher priority traffic can 
        always pre-empt lower priority streams. This reduces the need for 
        padding. 

     2.2.22. Capacity Categories 

        The TDMA timeslot allocation process for the DVB-RCS uplink supports 
        several capacity categories. 

        The Capacity Categories CRA, RBDC and A/VBDC, when authorized for a 
        RC, have to be configured from the NCC. These configuration 
        parameters are used to inform the RCST of the configuration of each 
        Category at the NCC side and thus help in Capacity Requests 
        computation. 

        The configuration of these parameters is performed for each RC. A 
        SatLabs option is defined that allows their configuration at the RCST 
        level in addition to configuration per RC. This option is denoted 
        RCST_PARA. 

     2.2.22.1. Continuous Rate Assignment (CRA) 

        CRA is a rate capacity that is provided in full in a continuous 
        manner to the RCST while required.

     2.2.22.2. Rate-Based Dynamic Capacity (RBDC) 

        RBDC is rate capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST. RBDC 
        capacity is provided in response to explicit requests from the RCST 
        to the NCC, such requests being absolute (i.e. corresponding to the 
        full rate currently being requested). Each request overrides all 
        previous RBDC requests from the same RCST, and is subject to a 
        maximum rate limit. 

     2.2.22.3. Volume-Based Dynamic Capacity (VBDC) 

        VBDC is volume capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST. 
        VBDC capacity is provided in response to explicit requests from the 
        RCST to the NCC, such requests being cumulative (i.e. each request 
        adds to all previous requests from the same RCST). 

     2.2.22.4. Absolute Volume-Based Dynamic Capacity (AVBDC) 

        AVBDC is volume capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST. 
        This capacity is provided in response to explicit requests from the 
        RCST to the NCC, such requests being absolute (i.e. this request 
        replaces the previous ones from the same RCST). 

        The combination of AVBDC and VBDC is seen as a single Capacity 
        Category, denoted A/VBDC. 

        A SatLabs Option is defined which allows AVBDC requests to be sent 
        periodically, as defined by the AVBDCrepTime parameter. This option 
        is denoted AVBDC_REP. 

     2.2.22.5. Population ID 

        This defines a group of RCSTs within a Network. 

     2.2.23. Start transponder 

        This is the satellite transponder on which the communication is 
        initiated from a RCST point-of-view when in the installation mode. 
        The parameters corresponding to this transponder (satellite orbital 
        position, frequency, etc.) are stored at the RCST as power-up 
        configuration data. 

     2.2.24. DVB-S 

        DVB-S is the Digital Video Broadcast over Satellite [ETSI-DVBS]. It 
        is a framework and set of associated standards published by ETSI for

        the transmission of video, audio, and data, using the ISO MPEG-2 
        Standard [ISO-MPEG], over satellite links. 

     2.2.25. DVB-S2 and CCM/VCM/ACM 

        DVB-S2 is the Second Generation of the Digital Video Broadcast for 
        Satellite applications standard [ETSI-DVBS2]. It is a framework and 
        set of associated standards published by ETSI for the transmission of 
        video, audio and data. 

        BBFRAME: The main framing unit of the DVB-S2 protocol stack. 

        CCM: In CCM transmission mode, the forward link uses a constant set 
        of transmission parameters (FEC coding rate and modulation scheme) 
        for all receivers. 

        VCM: In VCM transmission mode, the forward link uses transmission 
        parameters which are variable on a BBFRAME-by-BBFRAME, but fixed on a 
        Receiver basis, according to fixed link and propagation conditions 
        for each Receiver. 

        ACM: In ACM transmission mode, the forward link uses transmission 
        parameters which are dynamically adjusted on a BBFRAME-by-BBFRAME and 
        Receiver-per-Receiver basis, according to actual link and propagation 
        conditions.  In order to implement ACM, feedback from each Receiver 
        has to be provided by DVB-RCS return channel. 

     2.2.26. Interactive Network 

        This is another name for a DVB-RCS based satellite network. 

     3. MIB Module 

        This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management 
        of SatLabs-compliant RCST.  The specification is derived from the 
        parameters and protocols described in [SATLABS]. 
         
         
        The MIB module in this document uses the following OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
        values as already assigned by IANA under the smi-numbers registry 
        [IANA]: 
      
                         +------------+---------------------------+

     Internet-Draft               DVB-RCS MIB                      July 2008 
         

         
                     Table 1: Object Identifiers for the MIB 
         
        These values have been assigned for this MIB under the 'mib-
        2.transmission' subtree. 
      
     3.1. Textual Conventions 

      
        This MIB module defines new textual conventions for RCST indications 
        of capabilities defined by SatLabs, including profiles, options and 
        optional features. 
         
        systemSatLabsProfileMap represents the SatLabs profiles supported as 
        defined in [SATLABS]. 
         
        systemSatLabsOptionMap represents the SatLabs options supported as 
        defined in [SATLABS]. These are options that are used for the 
        certification of SatLabs terminals. They represent important 
        functionality, with impact on interoperability, and their support is 
        advertised with the RCST certification level. 
         
        systemSatLabsFeatureMap represents the SatLabs optional features 
        supported as defined in [SATLABS]. These represent minor features, 
        not necessary for interoperability. They are not used for the 
        certification of SatLabs terminals. 
      
     3.2. Structure of the MIB 
      
        This MIB module is structured into two top-level groups: 
         
        o The dvbrcsMIBobjects group includes all the managed objects of the 
        DVB-RCS MIB. 
         
        o The dvbrcsConformance group includes the compliance statements for 
        DVB-RCS terminals that are compliant with [SATLABS]. The managed 
        objects are grouped into formal object groups (i.e. units of 
        conformance) according to the relation to specific SatLabs options or 
        features. The conformance statements (MODULE-COMPLIANCE 
        specification) are described within the rcstCompliance group while 
        the units of conformance are described within the rcstGroups group. 
        The dvbrcsMIBobjects group is further structured into three groups:  
         
        o rcst 
        o fwdLink 
        o rtnLink.

     Internet-Draft               DVB-RCS MIB                      July 2008 
         

         
        The rcst group covers management related to the RCST equipment. It is 
        structured into six groups: 
         
        o rcstSystem 
        o rcstNetwork 
        o rcstInstall 
        o rcstQos 
        o rcstControl 
        o rcstState 
        The fwdLink group covers management information related to the RCST 
        forward link. It is structured into two groups: 
        o fwdConfig 
        o fwdStatus 
        The rtnLink group covers management information related to the RCST 
        return link. It is structured into two groups: 
        o rtnConfig 
        o rtnStatus 
         
        Tables within each of these groups cover different functions like 
        return link traffic management (packet classes, Request Classes, PID 
        pools) and forward links configuration and status.   
        Rows created automatically (e.g., by the device according to the 
        hardware configuration) may and generally will have a mixture of 
        configuration and status objects within them.  Rows that are meant to 
        be created by the management station are generally restricted to 
        configuration (read-create) objects. 
        The MIB module finally includes a conformance section including 
        conformance groups and compliance statements. 
         
         
         
     3.3. Relationship to the Interfaces MIB Module 
      
        This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to the 
        Interfaces MIB [RFC2863]. Several areas of correlation are addressed 
        in the following subsections. The implementer is referred to the 
        Interfaces MIB document to understand the general intent of these 
        areas. 
         
        IANA has assigned three ifType labels for DVB-RCS. Each RCST MUST 
        support at least the three following interfaces: 
          
        o dvbRcsMacLayer (239), -- DVB-RCS MAC Layer 
        DVB-RCS MAC Layer represents the air interface of a RCST, as defined 
        in [ETSI-RCS]. This interface supports star and mesh networks and is

        bi-directional. Only star networks are considered by the present MIB 
        module. 
        o dvbTdm (240), -- DVB Satellite TDM 
        DVB-RCS Physical link based on Time Division Multiplexing. It 
        corresponds to the forward link of a RCS transparent system or the 
        downlink of a RCS regenerative system. It is based on either DVB-S or 
        DVB-S2 standard. Only transparent systems are considered by the 
        present MIB module. 
        In the DVB-RCS context, this interface is uni-directional (i.e. 
        forward link, or downstream). 
        o dvbRcsTdma (241), -- DVB-RCS TDMA 
        DVB-RCS Physical link based on Time Division Multiple Access. It 
        corresponds to the return or mesh link of a RCS transparent system or 
        the uplink of a RCS regenerative system. It is based on the DVB-RCS 
        standard. 
        In the context of star transparent and mesh regenerative DVB-RCS 
        systems, this interface is uni-directional. 
        In the context of mesh transparent DVB-RCS systems, this interface is 
        bi-directional. 
        Only star transparent systems are considered by the present MIB 
        module (i.e. return link, or upstream). 
        The protocol stack (as reflected in ifStackTable) will be as follows: 
        +--------------------------+ 
        +                IP        +

                               FIGURE 2: RCST protocol stack 
         
        GS (Generic Stream) is defined in [ETSI-DVBS2]. The additional 
        Ethernet interface is used on the LAN side of the RCST. An instance 
        of ifEntry exists for each DvbTdm interface, for each DvbRcsTdma 
        (normally only one), and for each DvbRcsMac layer (normally only 
        one). 
         
        The interface counters relate to: 
         
        o dvbRcsMacLayer: DVB-RCS two-way MAC that counts aggregate DVB-RCS 
        SDU traffic (IP layer) 
        o dvbTdm: DVB-RCS TDM that counts either Generic Stream Encapsulation 
        (GSE) or Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) traffic, as applicable 
        for the specific configuration 
        * GSE is defined in [ETSI-GSE]

     Internet-Draft               DVB-RCS MIB                      July 2008 
         

        * MPE is defined in [ETSI-DAT] 
        o dvbRcsTdma: DVB-RCS TDMA that counts either ATM Adaptation Layer 5 
        (AAL5) or MPE traffic, as applicable for the specific configuration 
        The ifStackTable [RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify the 
        relationships among sub-interfaces. 
         
        The following example considers an DVB-RCS star network with DVB-S 
        and DVB-RCS. As illustrated on Figure 3, it shows a DVB-RCS MAC 
        interface with one downstream and one upstream interfaces. In this 
        network, ATM encapsulation is used in the DVB-RCS uplink. Two ATM 
        Logical Ports are shown. DVB-S2 or DVB-S can be used in the downlink. 
        MPEG can be used as well instead of ATM Logical Ports.

        As can be seen from this example, the dvbRcsMacLayer interface is 
        layered on top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and the 
        upstream interface is layered on top of upstream ATM logical links. 
        In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows: 
         
              ifIndex       ifType                     Description

     3.4.1.  rcstSystem 
      
        The MIB objects in this group gather some basic information that 
        would allow anyone to trace the history - the life - of the RCST as 
        well as to get a complete description of its constitution on the 
        component point of view, including the SatLabs options/features 
        support statement. Many of the parameters will be defined at 
        installation.  
         
         
        This group contains description parameters related to the RCST type 
        (ODU type) and location. These parameters are believed to stay 
        unchanged once it has been defined during installation. Modification 
        of hardware equipment, maintenance operations and geographical re-
        location may require an update of those MIB objects. They are. Note 
        that rcstSystem.systemLocation object gives the location of the ODU 
        antenna, which is needed for network operation, while the 
        system.sysLocation (MIB-II SNMP OID) provides the location of the IDU 
        unit, which can not be used for the same purpose. 
         
         
     3.4.2.  rcstNetwork 
      
        This group contains all the MIB objects related to network 
        parameters.

        In this subgroup, two objects have been defined in order to 
        differentiate between control and user traffic and associate them 
        with a physical interface. Both rcstNetwork.networkLanIpAddress 
        (Traffic) and rcstNetwork.networkOamIpAddress (OAM) provide the value 
        of the IP address of, respectively, the user traffic and the control 
        and management traffic. 
      
     3.4.3.  rcstInstall 
      
        This group contains all the information related to the RCST 
        installation and commissioning. Many parameters are believed to stay 
        unchanged once it has been defined during installation. Modification 
        of hardware equipment, maintenance operations and geographical re-
        location may require an update of those MIB objects. 
      
     3.4.4.  rcstQos 
      
        This group contains objects to configure the Quality of Service (QoS) 
        of the RCST by the NCC.  
         
        The pktClass table defines the packet classification for IP layer 3 
        classifications. Each pktClass entry is mapped to a phbEntry in the 
        phbMappingTable. 
      
        The phbMappingTable makes the relation between a packet 
        classification entry, a Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) identifier and a 
        Request class entry. 
         
         
        The requestClassTable defines all the layer 2 DVB-RCS QoS parameters. 
      
     3.4.5.  rcstControl 
      
        This MIB group contains objects a network manager can use to invoke 
        actions and tests supported by the RCST agent and to retrieve the 
        action/test results. 
      
     3.4.6.  rcstState 
      
        This MIB group describes the fault state, software versions and 
        configuration file versions of the RCST. 
      
     3.4.7.  fwdLink (fwdConfig and fwdStatus groups)

     Internet-Draft               DVB-RCS MIB                      July 2008 
         

        This MIB group contains parameters that enable the NCC to have access 
        to data about the forward link. 
         
        Configuration information is kept into the fwdLink.fwdConfig 
        subgroup. Status information is kept into the fwdLink.fwdStatus 
        subgroup. 
         
         
        The information of the fwdLink.fwdConfig.fwdStartTable are used for 
        the first time the RCST tries to acquire the forward link. All these 
        objects values are aligned with the Satellite Delivery System 
        Descriptor in the Network Information Table (NIT) table [ETSI-SI]. 
        The objects in the fwdLink.fwdConfig.fwdStatusTable are aligned with 
        the satellite forward path descriptor form the RCS Map Table (RMT) 
        [ETSI-RCS] and with the Physical Layer (PL) Header [ETSI-DVBS2], 
        which specified the MODCOD (modulation and FEC rate) and the Type 
        (frame length short of long and the presence/absence of pilots). 
         
         
     3.4.8.  rtnLink (rtnConfig and rtnStatus groups) 
      
        This MIB group contains parameters that enable the NCC to have access 
        to data about the return link. 
         
        Configuration information is kept into the rtnLink.rtnConfig 
        subgroup. Status information is kept into the rtnLink.rtnStatus 
        subgroup. 
        The RCST is only able to deal with one return link at a time. Hence, 
        there is no need to define a table to collect the different SNMP 
        objects, as it is done for the forward.

     5. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a 
        MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
        vulnerable in some network environments.  
         
         
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even 
        if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even 
        then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
        to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this 
        MIB module. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
        provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
        including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
        authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

        instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
        the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
        rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
