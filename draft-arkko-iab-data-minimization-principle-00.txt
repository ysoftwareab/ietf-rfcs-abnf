Abstract

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.
   This memo suggests that this is no longer alone sufficient to cater
   for the security and privacy issues seen on the Internet today.  For
   instance, it is often also necessary to protect against endpoints
   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not
   align with the interests of users.  While such protection is
   difficult, there are some measures that can be taken.  It is
   particularly important that new technology and new deployments
   consider the role of data passed to various parties -- including the
   primary protocol participants -- and balance the information given to
   them considering their roles and possible compromise of the
   information.

1.  Introduction

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements on the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.

   This has been exemplified in many aspects of IETF efforts, in the
   threat models [RFC3552], concerns about surveillance [RFC7258], and
   the introduction of encryption in many protocols [RFC9000],
   [RFC7858], [RFC8484].

   This memo suggests that current security and privacy issues on the
   Internet require even further action.  For instance, it is often also
   necessary to protect against endpoints that are compromised,
   malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests
   of users.

   While such protection is difficult, there are some measures that can
   be taken.  It is particularly important that new technology and new
   deployments consider the role of data passed to various parties --
   including the primary protocol participants -- and balance the
   information given to them considering their roles and possible
   compromise of the information.

2.  Background

   The primary reason for having to go beyond communications security is
   success.  Advances in protecting most of our communications with
   strong cryptographic has resulted in much improved security, but also
   highlight the need for addressing other, remaining issues.
   Particularly when adversaries have increased their pressure against
   other avenues of attack.  New adversaries and risks have arisen,
   e.g., due to increasing amount of information stored in various
   Internet services, or with the services whose interests are not
   aligned with their users.

   In short, attacks are migrating towards the currently easier targets,
   which no longer necessarily include direct attacks on traffic flows.
   These have been discussed at length in, for instance, [RFC8980],
   [I-D.farrell-etm] [I-D.arkko-arch-internet-threat-model-guidance],
   [I-D.lazanski-smart-users-internet], and others.

   It is important that when it comes to basic Internet infrastructure,
   our technology addresses non-communications threats to the extent
   possible.  It is particularly important to ensure that non-
   communications security related threats are properly understood for
   any new Internet technology.

   The sole consideration of communications security aspects in
   designing Internet protocols may lead to accidental or increased
   impact of security issues elsewhere.  For instance, allowing a
   participant to unnecessarily collect or receive information may lead
   to a similar effect as described in [RFC8546] for protocols: over
   time, unnecessary information will get used with all the associated
   downsides, regardless of what deployment expectations there were
   during protocol design.

3.  Related work

   Hardie [RFC8558] discusses path signals, i.e., messages to or from
   on-path elements to endpoints.  In the past, path signals were often
   implicit, e.g., network nodes interpreting in a particular way
   transport protocol headers originally intended for end-to-end
   consumption.  The document recommends a principle that implicit
   signals should be avoided and that explicit signals be used instead,
   and only when the signal's originator intends that it be used by the
   network elements on the path.

   Arkko, Kuhlewind, Pauly, and Hardie
   [I-D.arkko-iab-path-signals-collaboration] discuss the same topic,
   and extend the RFC 8558 principles with recommendations to ensure
   minimum set of parties, minimum information, and consent.

Internet-Draft Data Minimization in Internet Architecture   October 2021


   Thomson [I-D.thomson-tmi] discusses the role intermediaries in the
   Internet architecture, at different layers of the stack.  For
   instance, a router is an intermediary, some parts of DNS
   infrastructure can be intermediaries, messaging gateways are
   intermediaries.  Thomson discusses when intermediaries are or are not
   an appropriate tool, and presents a number of principles relating to
   the use of intermediaries, e.g., deliberate selection of protocol
   participants or limiting the capabilities or information exposure
   related to the intermediaries.

   Trammel and Kuehlewind [RFC8546] discuss the concept of a "wire
   image" of a protocol.  This is an abstraction of the information
   available to an on-path non-participant in a networking protocol.  It
   relates to the topic of non-participants interpreting information
   that is available to them in the "wire image" (or associated timing
   and other indirect information).  The issues are largely the same
   even for participants.  Even proper protocol participants may start
   to use information available to them, regardless of whether it was
   intended to that participant or simply relayed through them.

4.  Principles

   This memo approaches the topic from the point of disclosing
   information to another participant in a protocol exchange.

4.1.  Scope of protocol exchanges

   This memo does not limit what types of protocol exchanges can lead to
   information disclosure.  The protocol exchanges may relate to:

   *  The interaction of an endpoint with the network, e.g., information
      they provide in any network attachment process or the wire images
      of the packets sent via the network.

   *  The interaction of an endpoint with intermediaries, in the meaning
      discussed by Thomson.

   *  The interaction of an endpoint with a service, such as a website
      or social networking function.

   *  End-to-end interactions between users, represented by applications
      running on their computers.

   It is also important to observe that information disclosure can
   appear in several ways:

   *  Explicitly carried information, e.g., a data item in a message
      sent to a protocol participant.  Note that the carried information



Arkko                     Expires 28 April 2022                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft Data Minimization in Internet Architecture   October 2021


      may appear at multiple layers in the protocol stack.  For
      instance, both protocol participants and non-participants may
      observe lower layer information, such as topological network
      addresses.  Such information can be collected, used, and perhaps
      misused or leaked.

   *  Indirectly inferred information, such as message arrival times or
      patterns in the traffic flow.  Information may also be obtained
      from fingerprinting the protocol participants, in an effort to
      identify unique endpoints or users.

   *  Information gathered from a collaboration among several parties,
      e.g., websites and social media systems collaborating to identify
      visiting users [WP2021].

4.2.  Principle: Transmission is publication

   PRINCIPLE: Consider information passed to another party as a
   publication.  Avoid passing information that should not be published.

   This principle applies even if the communications that carry that
   information are encrypted, as the party that received the
   communications and can decrypt them may use the information, e.g.,
   because it has become or will later become compromised.

4.3.  Principle: Build for eventual compromise

   PRINCIPLE: Build defenses to protect information, even when some
   component in a system is or becomes compromised.

   For instance, at the service side encryption of data at rest may
   assist in protecting information if an attacker gains access to the
   servers.  Similarly, protecting data in use can prevent leakage in
   some cases, and regular purging of old information can limit the
   amount of leaked information.

   Protocols can ensure that perfect forward secrecy is provided, so
   that the damage resulting from a compromise of keying material has
   limited impact.

   On the client side, the client may trust that another party handles
   information appropriately, but take steps to ensure or verify that
   this is the case.  For instance, as discussed above, the client can
   encrypt a message only to the actual final recipient, even if the
   server holds our message before it is delivered.  In some case the
   client may also verify correct behavior, e.g., through confidential
   computing attestations.

4.4.  Principle: Data and recipient minimization

   PRINCIPLE: Information should not be disclosed, stored, or routed in
   cleartext through services that do not absolutely need to have that
   information for the function they perform.

   This the "need to know" principle.  Note that this principle applies
   at multiple layers in the stack.  It is not just about intermediaries
   in the network and transport layers, but also intermediaries and
   services on the application layer.

   Information should only be passed between the "real ends" of a
   conversation, unless the information is necessary for a useful
   function in a service.

   For instance, a transport connection between two components of a
   system is not an end-to-end connection even if it encompasses all the
   protocol layers up to the application layer.  It is not end-to-end,
   if the information or control function it carries extends beyond
   those components.  For instance, just because an e-mail server can
   read the contents of an e-mail message do not make it a legitimate
   recipient of the e-mail.

   Typically, information can be classified in different categories,
   such as information needed for the function provided by a service
   (e.g., addressing information such as e-mail headers needed to find
   targeted destination) and information that should only be revealed to
   the targeted destination (such as e-mail message contents).

4.4.1.  Protocol design implications

   An obvious implication of the above is that it is necessary to have
   mechanisms that allow secure communication and data object
   protection, that is not tied to a particular IP packet source and
   destination or a transport layer connection.

   These mechanisms also require associated key distribution and
   agreement facilities.

4.4.2.  Fingerprinting avoidance

   Fingerprinting warrants a separate discussion.  Internet technology
   has tended to move towards richer and more power mechanisms over
   time.  For instance, full-functionality web and transport layer
   security stacks are now used for almost all purposes across the
   network.

Internet-Draft Data Minimization in Internet Architecture   October 2021


   This is of course good, and the performance, expressive power, and
   security improvements that came through these are much needed.

   Nevertheless, all protocol mechanisms come with some fingerprinting
   opportunities, and this tends to be easier the higher in the stack we
   are, given the wealth of options and algorithms in use.
   [Fingerprinting] and [AmIUnique] provide a good starting point for
   some of the issues, along with measurements about the accuracy of
   fingerprinting mechanisms and defenses against them.

   The general topic of ensuring that protocol mechanisms stays
   evolvable and workable is covered in [I-D.iab-use-it-or-lose-it].
   But the associated methods for reducing fingerprinting possibilities
   probably deserve further study.
   [I-D.wood-pearg-website-fingerprinting] discusses one aspect of this.
