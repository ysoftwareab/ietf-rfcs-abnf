            IPv6 Prefix Length Recommendation for Forwarding
              draft-boucadair-6man-prefix-routing-reco-02

Abstract

   The length of IP prefixes is an information used by forwarding and
   routing processes is policy-based.  As such, no maximum length must
   be assumed by design.

   Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing revealed a need
   for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used by forwarding
   decision-making processes.  This document sketches a recommendation
   to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the
   prefix length.  The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding
   designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.

1.  Introduction

   Recent discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing
   ([I-D.ietf-6man-why64]) revealed a need for a clear recommendation on
   which bits must be used by forwarding decision-making processes.

   A detailed analysis of the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing, and
   the implication for end-site prefix assignment, is documented in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-why64].  No recommendation is included in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-why64].

   It is fundamental to not link routing and forwarding to the IPv6
   prefix/address semantics [RFC4291].  This document includes a
   recommendation for that aim.

   Forwarding decisions made by routers primarily rely upon a longest
   prefix-match algorithm.  Like in IPv4, the IPv6 prefix-match
   algorithms involve one critical operation which is the comparison of
   a destination address with a prefix present in a routing table (e.g.,
   compare the 2001:db8::1 address with the 2001:db8::/64 prefix).  The

   recommendation of this document is to be followed by that critical
   operation.

   It is important that the compare operation be a bit-wise comparison,
   and not a byte-wise comparison.

2.  Recommendation

   Forwarding decision-making processes MUST NOT restrict by design the
   length of IPv6 prefixes.  In particular, forwarding processes MUST be
   designed to process prefixes of any length up to /128, by increments
   of 1.

   Obviously, policies can be enforced to restrict the length of IP
   prefixes advertised within a given domain or in a given
   interconnection link.  These policies are deployment-specific and/or
   driven by administrative (interconnection) considerations.

   This recommendation does not conflict with the 64-bit boundary for
   IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862].

   Some lookup algorithm implementations (find the prefix matching a
   given destination address) may be affected by this recommendation,
   even more so for IPv6 than IPv4.  The performance of some
   implementations may be degraded when prefix lengths are longer than
   /64.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues in addition to what
   is discussed in [RFC4291].
