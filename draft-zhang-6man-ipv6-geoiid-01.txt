                  based on geographic location coding
                    draft-zhang-6man-ipv6-geoiid-01


Abstract

   This document describes how to generate a stateless IPv6 host
   interface identifier based on host geographic location information.
   This method can guarantee the uniqueness and stability of the address
   generated within a certain geographical range. The method is similar
   to mechanism introduced in RFC 7217, but remains stable within an
   adjustable geographical area.

INTERNET DRAFT                IPv6 geoiid                 September 2019


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC8200], "stable" addresses would not change in the same
   network defined by a network prefix advertised by a local router.
   There are various IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID) generating schemes
   like  EUI-64 [RFC4291], Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs)
   [RFC3972] and Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers [RFC7217].
   [RFC8064] recommends using the mechanism specified in RFC 7217 to
   generate stable IPv6 Interface Identifier.

   In some situations, it is desirable to generate stable IID in a
   specific geographical area, which is usually larger than a network
   defined by one network prefix. For example, multihomed site may
   configure the same IID with different prefixes to simplify network
   management. An organization may also hope clients have the same IID
   within a specific geographical area even if network prefix is
   different.


   This document specifies a method to generate Interface Identifiers
   that are stable for each network interface within a specific
   geographical area, while still remain semantically opaque: like
   scheme proposed in RFC 7217, it is infeasible to extract geographical
   information from IIDs generated by this scheme.


2.  Algorithm Specification

   The generation scheme is similar to that proposed in RFC 7217, the
   random (but stable) identifier is generated with the expression: RID
   = F(Geo_Prefix, Net_Iface, Network_ID, DAD_Counter, secret_key).

   Geo_Prefix: Geo_Prefix is the geographic identifier of the specific
   area, it can be formed from several possible approaches:

   1)Latitude, longitude encoded prefix string. The basic mechanism is
   to interleave the WGS-84 latitude and longitude. Interleaving is a
   common technique to encode a geographic location. The number of bits
   is configured by the administrator to represent different area.

   For longitude, the first bit is the sign bit. And the left side of
   the decimal point is directly converted to 8-bit binary code. The
   right side of the decimal point is generated according to the
   ANSI/IEEE Std 754-1985 standard. Then the binary corresponding to
   integer part and the decimal part are joined from upper bit to lower
   bit. The sign bit, the binary representation of the integer bit, and
   the binary representation of the decimal place are joined to form the

   longitude code.

   For latitude, the first bit is the sign bit. The left side of the
   decimal point is directly converted to a seven-bit binary code. And
   the right side of the decimal point is generated with the same step.
   Then the binary corresponding to integer part and the decimal part
   are joined from upper bit to lower bit. The sign bit, the binary
   representation of the integer bit, and the binary representation of
   the decimal place are joined to form the latitude code.

   Latitude and longitude binary codes are interleaved to form the final
   2n-bit position code. The longitude code is placed in odd digits and
   the latitude code is placed in even digits. Or the longitude code is
   placed in even digits and the latitude code is placed in odd digits.
   n is an adjustable parameter.  Different n represents different
   accuracy to cover different geographic ranges.

   In addition to longitude and latitude, it is also feasible to add
   height information together for encoding. For height, the encoding
   method is the same as the latitude and longitude encoding method. In
   the end, the binary codes of latitude, longitude and altitude are
   interleaved to form the final position code.

   2)Geographical area specific text. The geographical area specific
   text identifies the geographical area in which the organization
   network is located. This name is consistent across this geographic
   area, and the organization guarantees that different geographic
   regions have different names.A geographical area specific text may be
   a lexical name of this geographical area, or just an alias. The
   geographical area specific text can be configured by the organization
   administrator.

   The other processes of this scenario are essentially the same as
   those defined in RFC 7217. In this way, it is possible to implement
   the same interface identifiers on hosts with multiple interfaces or
   in an organization, even if the prefixes are different.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies an algorithm for generating Interface
   Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC), The scheme is similar to scheme defined in RFC 7217. While
   there may be concerns about geographic location tracking among
   multiple network, there is nothing inherent in this address format
   that would raise any more security considerations than any other
   global addressing format. If geographic location privacy were an
   issue, it would be wise to avoid this mechanism in favor of
   geographic location independent mechanisms.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include an IANA request.
