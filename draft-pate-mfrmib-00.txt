1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580
        [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the

Internet Draft         MIB For FRF.16 UNI/NNI MFR           October 1999


   MIB.


2.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for
   monitoring and controlling a UNI/NNI Multilink Frame Relay function.
   The agreement on which this MIB is based was defined and documented
   by the Frame Relay Forum in the Frame Relay Forum Document FRF.16
   [FRF.16].

2.1.  Multilink Frame Relay Background

   Multilink Frame Relay (MFR) for the User-to-Network Interface (UNI)
   and the Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) provides physical
   interface emulation for frame relay devices.  The emulated physical
   interface consists of one or more physical links, called "bundle
   links", aggregated together into a single "bundle" of bandwidth.
   This service provides a frame-based inverse multiplexing function,
   sometimes referred to as an "IMUX".

   The bundle provides the same order-preserving service as a physical
   layer for frames sent on a data link connection.  In addition, the
   bundle provides support for all Frame Relay services based on UNI and
   NNI standards.


2.1.1.  Terminology

Physical Link --    A single physical interface that interconnects two
                    devices in a frame relay network (e.g. DS1, DS0,
                    Bearer channel, refer to FRF.14).

Bundle --           A grouping of one or more physical links using the
                    formats and procedures of multilink frame relay.
                    The bundle operates as a logical interface function
                    that emulates a single physical interface to the
                    Q.922 data link layer.

Bundle Link --      A MFR sub-component that controls operation of one
                    of the bundle's physical links.

2.2.  Structure of the MIB

   The UNI/NNI MFR managed objects consist of three tables and two
   scalars.

2.2.1.  bundleMaxNumBundles

   This scalar is used to inform the manager of the maximum number of
   bundles supported by this device.

2.2.2.  bundleNextIndex

   This scalar is used to assist the manager in selecting a value for
   bundleIndex during row creation.  It can also be used to avoid race
   conditions with multiple managers trying to create rows in the table
   (see RFC 2494 [RFC2494] for one such alogrithm).

2.2.3.  bundleTable

   This table provides a means to configure and monitor bundles.  It is
   indexed by bundleIndex and contains these columns:

       - bundleIndex                    InterfaceIndex
       - bundleIfIndex                  InterfaceIndex
       - bundleRowStatus                RowStatus
       - bundleNearEndName              SnmpAdminString
       - bundleFragmentation            INTEGER

       - bundleActivationClass          INTEGER
       - bundleThreshold                Integer32
       - bundleMaxDiffDelay             Integer32
       - bundleSeqNumSize               Integer32
       - bundleFarEndName               SnmpAdminString
       - bundleResequencingErrors       Integer32

2.2.4.  Bundle-to-ifIndex Mapping Table

   This table provides a means to take a bundleIndex and find the
   corresponding ifIndex in the ifTable [RFC1573].  It is indexed by
   bundleIndex and contains these columns:

       - bundleIfIndexMapping                 InterfaceIndex

       - bundleLinkFarEndBundleName     SnmpAdminString
       - bundleLinkDelay                Integer32
       - bundleLinkFramesControlTx      Counter32

Internet Draft         MIB For FRF.16 UNI/NNI MFR           October 1999


2.3.1.  Relationship With Interface Table

2.3.1.1.  Bundle Links

   Each bundle link will appear as an interface in the ifTable.  The
   ifIndex that appears in the ifTable is used for indexing the bundle
   link tables in the UNI-NNI MFR MIB.

2.3.1.2.  Bundles

   Each bundle will appear as an interface in the ifTable.  There will
   be corresponding bundleIndex which may be different than the ifIndex
   of the bundle.

   The reason is best summarized in RFC 2494 [RFC2494], which describes
   frame relay bundle of DS0.  It says:

        This table is not indexed by ifIndex because the manager has to
        choose the index in a createable row and the agent must be
        allowed to select ifIndex values.

   The rows in the ifEntry table are not creatable as they do not have
   row status.  RFC 2233 [RFC2233] suggests that the ifIndex should be
   chosen by the agent.  Here is its statement regarding row creation
   and deletion:

        While some interfaces, for example, most physical interfaces,
        cannot be created via network management, other interfaces such
        as logical interfaces sometimes can be.  The ifTable contains
        only generic information about an interface.  Almost all
        'create-able' interfaces have other, media-specific, information
        through which configuration parameters may be supplied prior to
        creating such an interface.  Thus, the ifTable does not itself
        support the creation or deletion of an interface (specifically,
        it has no RowStatus column).  Rather, if a particular interface
        type supports the dynamic creation and/or deletion of an
        interface of that type, then that media-specific MIB should
        include an appropriate RowStatus object (see the ATM LAN-
        Emulation Client MIB [ATMLANE] for an example of a MIB which
        does this).  Typically, when such a RowStatus object is
        created/deleted, then the conceptual row in the ifTable
        appears/disappears as a by-product, and an ifIndex value (chosen
        by the agent) is stored in an appropriate object in the media-
        specific MIB.

   The ATM LAN-Emulation Client MIB [ATMLANE] uses different indices and
   so does the IMA MIB.  Looking at the examples we have, and the
   statements from RFC, it seems better to have two indices.  This gives
   the SNMP agent implementor the freedom to manage their ifIndex in the

   way they like.

2.3.1.3.  Mapping Between ifIndex and bundleIndex

   The bundleIfIndexMappingTable is indexed by ifIndex and provides the
   means to map a given ifIndex into the corresponding bundleIndex.  The
   bundleIfIndexMapping object in the bundleConfigTable (indexed by
   bundleIndex) provides the reverse mapping of a bundleIndex to the
   corresponding ifIndex in the ifTable.

2.3.1.4.  ifTable Objects

   The table below summarizes the objects in the ifTable [RFC1573] and
   how they relate to bundles and bundle links.

2.3.2.  Relationship With Interface Stack Table

   The bundles and bundle links will appear in the ifStackTable defined
   in RFC 2233 [RFC2233].  Each bundle link will appear a lower layer to
   its owner bundle.  The bundle will appear as a higher layer to the
   bundle links and as a lower layer to a frame relay service or UNI.

2.3.3.  Relationship With Frame Relay DTE MIB

   The bundle will have a one-to-one correspondence with a DLCMI or UNI
   that appear in the DTE MIB tables [RFC2115].

2.3.4.  Relationship With Frame Relay Service MIB

   There is a one-to-one relationship between the MFR bundle and the
   frame relay service defined in RFC1604 [RFC1604].  There is no other
   relationship between these MIBs.

2.3.5.  Example

   Figure three shows an example of how the various tables are related.
   This example shows two bundles composed of 2 T1s each.  The bundles
   have a bundleIndex of 10 and 20 respectively.

2.4.  Creation Of Bundles and Bundle Links

2.4.1.  Creation Of Bundles

   A bundle is created using the bundleConfigRowStatus RowStatus object.
   There is no minimum set of objects required in order to create a new
   bundle i.e. all of the parameters can assume default values.

2.4.2.  Creation Of Bundle Links

   A bundle link is created using the bundleLinkConfigRowStatus
   RowStatus object.  It must be created as a part of an existing
   bundle.  There is no minimum set of objects required in order to
   create a new bundle link i.e. all of the parameters can assume
   default values.  The only requirement is that the owner bundle
   (specified by bundleIndex) be in existence.

2.5.  Notifications

   The linkUp and linkDown traps are defined in RFC 1573 [RFC1573].

2.5.1.  Bundle

   The following SNMP traps are defined for MFR bundles.

2.5.1.1.  linkUp

   This trap is sent when the ifOperStatus of a bundle transitions from
   down to up.  This occurs when a sufficient number of links
   (determined by bundleActivationClass and bundleThreshold) are in the
   operationally up state.

2.5.1.2.  linkDown

   This trap is sent when the ifOperStatus of a bundle transitions from
   up to down.  This occurs when a insufficient number of links
   (determined by bundleActivationClass and bundleThreshold) are in the
   operationally up state.

2.5.2.  Bundle Link

   The following SNMP traps are defined for MFR bundle links.

2.5.2.1.  linkUp

   This trap is sent when a bundle link transitions into the up state.

2.5.2.2.  linkDown

   This trap is sent when a bundle link transitions from the up state.

2.5.2.3.  mfrMibTrapBundleLinkMismatch

   This trap indicates that a bundle link mismatch has been detected.
   The following objects are reported:

      - bundleNearEndName:          configured name of near end bundle
      - bundleFarEndName:           previously reported name of far
                                    end bundle
      - bundleLinkNearEndName:      configured name of near end bundle
      - bundleLinkFarEndName:       reported name of far end bundle
      - bundleLinkFarEndBundleName: currently reported name of far
                                    end bundle

   Note that the configured items may have been configured
   automatically.  Note also that the bundleLinkMismatch counter is
   incremented when the trap is sent.

3.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
