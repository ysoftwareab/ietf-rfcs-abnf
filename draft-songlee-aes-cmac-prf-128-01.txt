Abstract
   
   Some implementations of IP Security (IPsec) may want to use a
   pseudo-random function derived from the Advanced Encryption Standard
   (AES).  This memo describes such an algorithm, called AES-CMAC-
   PRF-128.

1. Introduction

   [AES-CMAC] describes a method to use the Advanced Encryption 
   Standard (AES) as a message authentication code (MAC) whose output
   is 128 bits long.  128 bits output is useful as a long-lived pseudo-
   random function (PRF) in either IKE version 1 or version 2.  This 
   document specifies PRF that support fixed and variable key sizes for
   IKEv2 [IKEv2] Key Derivation Function (KDF) and authentication.

2. Basic definitions

  Key (K)           Variable length key for AES-CMAC-PRF-128, Denoted
                    by K.

  truncate(K,16)    Truncate K(key) in msb-first order with 16 bytes.

  Padding (K,16)    Padding 0 in lsb-first order with 16 bytes.
                  

3. The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 Algorithm

   The AES-CMAC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to AES-CMAC defined 
   in [AES-CMAC] except that the 128 bits key length restriction is
   removed.

   IKEv2 [IKEv2] uses PRFs for multiple purposes, most notably for
   generating keying material and authentication of the the IKE_SA. 
   The IKEv2 specification differentiates between PRFs with fixed key
   sizes and those with variable key sizes

   When using the PRF described in this document with IKEv2, the PRF is
   considered to be fixed-length for generating keying material but
   variable-length for authentication.


   The key for AES-CMAC-PRF-128 is created as follows:

   - If the key is exactly 128 bits long, use is as-is

   - If the key has fewer than  128 bits, lengthen it to exactly 128 
     bits by padding it on the right with zero bits.

   - If the key is 129 bits or longer, shorten it to exactly 128 bits
     by truncating msb-first order with 128 bits.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security provided by AES-CMAC-PRF-128 is based upon the strength
   of AES.  At the time of this writing, there are no known practical
   cryptographic attacks against AES or AES-CMAC-PRF-128.

   As is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its strength
   lies in the security of the key management mechanism, the strength of
   the associated secret key, and upon the correctness of the
   implementations in all of the participating systems.   


6. IANA Consideration

   IPsec IKEv2 algorithms needs to be updated to refer this document
   when it is published.
