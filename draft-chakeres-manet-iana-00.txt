1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates a port and several scoped multicast address
   assignments for MANET protocols.  It is meant to aid and stimulate
   discussion on this topic.


2.  UDP Port for MANET Routing Protocols

   To aggregate MANET routing protocol traffic it must be sent to the
   same IP destination address and the same port.  Therefore, all
   interoperable MANET routing protocol traffic should be sent to the
   same UDP port.  The proposed title for this port is "MANET".  In
   order to be interoperable, all packets sent to this port MUST conform
   to the packetbb specification [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

                            UDP Port Assignment

                             +-------+-------+
                             |  Name | Value |
                             +-------+-------+
                             | MANET |  TBD1 |
                             +-------+-------+

                                  Table 1


3.  Link-local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET protocols need a link-local multicast address [RFC4291] to
   disseminate information.  This section proposes and names this link-
   local multicast address.

   The name of the multicast address to reach all link-local (LL) MANET
   routers is "LL MANET Routers".  MANET routers subscribe to this
   scoped multicast address and use it for link-local transmissions of
   routing protocol packets.

   For IPv4, a statically assigned, link-local scope multicast address
   is used.  The address for LL MANET Routers is 224.0.0.TBD2 to appear
   in the [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   For IPv6, a statically assigned, link-local scope multicast address
   is used.  The address for LL MANET Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3
   to appear in the [IANAv6Multicast] registry.

                  Link-local multicast address assignment

        +------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
        |       Name       |     IPv4     |          IPv6         |
        +------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
        | LL MANET Routers | 224.0.0.TBD2 | FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3 |
        +------------------+--------------+-----------------------+

                                  Table 2


4.  Scoped Multicast Groups for MANET Routers

   MANET protocols may need several scoped multicast addresses [RFC4291]
   to disseminate information more widely.  This section names the
   multicast addresses, defines their scope, and clarifies router
   behavior.

   The name of the multicast address to reach the MANET routers is
   "Scoped MANET Routers".  MANET routers subscribe to these scoped
   multicast addresses.

   MANET routers must handle forwarding of these scoped multicast
   addresses using the additional criteria as specified in [RFC2365] and
   [RFC4007].

4.1.  Scoped Multicast Groups for IPv4

   For IPv4, statically assigned, scope-relative multicast addresses (as
   defined by [RFC2365], Section 9) are used.  The offset for the scope
   relative address for Scoped MANET Routers is TBD4 to appear in
   [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   Different scopes are defined by [RFC2365].  The IPv4 Local Scope
   (239.255.0.0/16) is the minimal enclosing scope for administratively
   scoped multicast and not further divisible -- its exact extent is
   site dependent.

   For the IPv4 Local Scope, applying the rules of [RFC2365] and using
   the assigned offset of TDB4, the multicast address is therefore
   239.255.255.(255-TBD4).

   For the IPv4 Organization Local Scope, applying the rules of
   [RFC2365] and using the assigned offset of TDB5, the multicast
   address is therefore 239.192.255.(255-TBD5).

4.2.  Scoped Multicast Groups for IPv6

   IPv6 has different address ranges for different multicast scopes that
   are implemented as a set of address prefixes for the different
   address ranges ([RFC2373]).  A permanently assigned multicast address
   will be used for Scoped MANET Routers multicast communication, i.e.,
   an address that is independent of the scope value and that can be
   used for all scopes.  These addresses begin with FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:
   where X indicates the scope.  Implementations for IPv6 MUST use the
   scope-independent address and the appropriate prefix for the selected
   scope.  For example, for link-local MANET communication the IPv6
   link-local scope prefix (FF02) MUST be used.  See [RFC4291] and the
   [IANAv6Multicast] registry for IPv6 multicast assignments.

   The permanent IPv6 multicast address for All MANET Routers/IPv6 is
   FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD6.


5.  Multicast Groups for MANET Nodes

   The term nodes refers to all devices that implement IP [RFC2460].
   There may exist a need to address messages (using several different
   scopes) to nodes within a MANET.  We name this address Scoped MANET
   Nodes.  All nodes within a MANET should subscribe to these scoped
   addresses.

   MANET routers must handle forwarding of these scoped multicast
   addresses using the additional criteria as specified in [RFC2365] and
   [RFC4007].


6.  IANA Considerations

   A summary of the decided IANA assignments will appear here.


7.  Security Considerations

   Using multicast groups with scopes larger than link-local (LL) may
   increase the ability of devices to abuse the network by creating
   excessive messaging.  Certain precautions should be followed, TBD.
