1. Abstract

   This document describes the goals for Internet Voice Mail (IVM) and
   establishes a baseline of desired functionality against which
   proposed MIME profiles for Internet Voice Messaging can be judged.
   IVM is an extension of VPIM version 2 [VPIM2] designed to support
   interoperability with desktop clients. Other goals for this version
   of VPIM include expanded interoperability with unified messaging
   systems, conformance to Internet standards, and backward
   compatibility with voice messaging systems currently running in a
   VPIM enabled environment. This document does not include goals that
   were met fully by VPIM version 2 [VPIM2].

3. Introduction

   Until recently, voice mail and call answering services were
   implemented as stand-alone proprietary systems. Today, standards
   such as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) enable
   interoperability between such systems over the Internet. VPIM
   version 1 [VPIM1] was experimental and was a first attempt at a
   Voice Profile for Internet Mail, but is now classified as
   Historical. VPIM Version 2 [VPIM2] is an improvement on VPIM version
   1 that was originally intended to provide interoperability between
   voice messaging systems only. It describes a messaging profile that
   standardizes the exchange of voice mail over an IP messaging network
   using ESMTP [ESMTP] and MIME [MIME1].

   Because the number of desktop boxes is growing rapidly and will soon
   approach the number of desktop telephones, it is essential to
   consider the requirements of desktop email client applications
   (including, but not limited to, MIME-compliant email clients).  With
   the trend toward integration of voice mail and email through unified
   messaging (UM), it is now necessary to define a new version of VPIM
   that supports the needs of desktop applications and unified
   messaging systems (including Internet Facsimile [EXFAX]). This
   version of VPIM is being referred to as Internet Voice Mail (IVM).

   This document defines the goals for Internet Voice Mail. This
   standard will support the interchange of voice messages between
   voice mail systems, unified messaging systems, email servers, and
   desktop client applications. The desktop client application is of
   particular and important interest to IVM. This document will also
   expand the offerings of service providers by facilitating access to
   voice mail from a web client.


4. Goals for Internet Voice Mail


4.1 Interoperability

   Enhanced interoperability is the primary goal of IVM. The profile
   MUST facilitate interoperability between voice mail systems, unified
   messaging systems, Internet email servers, and desktop client
   applications. Such interoperability MUST support systems which
   combine multiple media types in a single message, as well as legacy
   voice mail and email systems. It MUST allow the ability to

                    Goals for Internet Voice Mail       February 2001


   accommodate varying capabilities of the voice mail, unified
   messaging and email systems. Furthermore, IVM MUST be compatible
   with Internet Fax (extended mode) proposed standards and VPIM
   messages that contain fax body parts.

   To have "interoperability" means that an IVM compliant sender
   attempting to send to a recipient will not fail because of
   incompatibility. IVM MUST support interoperability amongst the
   systems listed below:
        - Desktop Email client applications
        - IVM-capable Voice Mail systems
        - IVM-capable unified messaging systems
        - Traditional email servers
   And SHOULD support interoperabilty with VPIM version 2 Voice Mail
   Systems.

   IVM MUST include new functionality to facilitate access to voice
   mail messages from desktop applications.

   Overall interoperability requires interoperability for all message
   elements: body parts deemed essential for message validity MUST be
   preserved, essential information MUST be provided in a form that is
   accessible by the users, status codes [CODES] MUST be understood,
   and operations that are standard for each system SHOULD be
   supported.

4.1.1   Interoperability with Desktop Email Client Applications

   Desktop email applications are typically text based. The ability to
   listen to, reply to, forward, and generate voice mail messages from
   a traditional desktop environment is a relatively new development.
   To accommodate current use and future developments in this area, IVM
   MUST provide features to support access to voice mail messages from
   the desktop and other email-reading devices. Also, web access to
   voicemail SHOULD be supported from the desktop.

   IVM SHOULD NOT require desktop email applications to possess a large
   amount of processing power, and a base level implementation MUST
   interoperate, even if it does not offer complex processing. In order
   to support interoperability, a mandatory codec MUST be defined.  The
   mandatory codec SHOULD be widely available on desktops.  For
   interoperability with VPIM version 2 systems, IVM applications
   SHOULD also support the VPIM v2 mandatory codec [ADPCM and G726].

   Any codecs included in the IVM specification SHOULD meet the
   following criteria:
        - Availability on desktops: Codecs SHOULD be available on most
        platforms
        - Source code availability: Source code SHOULD be readily
        accessible
        - Decoding complexity: All codecs MUST be low complexity to
        decode

                    Goals for Internet Voice Mail       February 2001


        - Encoding complexity: Some of the codecs MUST be low  
        complexity to encode.
        - Bit rate: IVM MUST specify a codec with low bit rate for
        devices (i.e., wireless) that do not have much space/bandwidth.
        - Voice Over IP support: IVM SHOULD specify a codec that
        supports Voice over IP implementations.

   Most desktop email applications and web clients are not capable of
   playing raw audio. To support "out-of-the-box" playing of voice mail
   content, IVM MUST support wav encapsulation of audio. To enable
   future support of other formats, IVM SHOULD provide identification
   of the codec used without requiring interpretation of an audio
   format. IVM MAY allow audio encodings and formats that are not
   identified in the IVM specification to support environments in which
   the sender is aware of the optimal encoding and format for the
   recipient.

   To address performance and bandwidth issues, IVM MAY support
   streaming of IVM audio to the desktop.  IVM MAY explicitly support
   formats other than raw audio and wav to facilitate streaming.

   Because most email readers are text/html based and because many
   devices are not capable of recording audio content, IVM MUST allow
   inclusion of text body parts in a voice message. IVM SHOULD NOT
   explicitly prohibit other media types as long as critical content is
   identified and minimal discard rules are specified.

   To support devices that have applications dedicated to specific
   media types or that are not capable of handling specific content,
   IVM SHOULD define a way to describe the content of the message,
   indicating how the content can be accessed.

   Desktop implementation of IVM MUST support attachments of any media
   type.


4.1.2   Interoperability with IVM-capable Voice Messaging Systems

   Voice messaging systems are generally implemented as special-purpose
   machines that interface to a telephone switch and provide call
   answering and voice messaging services. VPIM version 2 was designed
   to support interoperability between such systems and remains the
   best messaging profile for this purpose.

   To support interoperability between IVM voice messaging systems and
   other compliant systems, IVM SHOULD have a minimum set of required
   features that will guarantee interoperability, and also provision
   for additional functionality that may be supported by more complex
   systems. IVM MUST define a mechanism for identifying essential
   content and status codes [CODES] indicating that a message could not
   be delivered due to capability differences.

                    Goals for Internet Voice Mail       February 2001


   NOTE: IVM SHOULD provide some level of interoperability with VPIM
   version 2 voice messaging systems. In order to support mimimal
   interoperability between IVM and VPIM version 2, IVM systems MUST be
   able to receive the VPIM version 2 32KADPCM codec [ADPCM and G726],
   and MUST gracefully handle the case where a legacy receiving system
   does not support the IVM codecs.


4.1.3   Interoperability with IVM-capable Unified Messaging Systems

   Unified messaging solutions typically leverage common store,
   directory, and transport layers to provide greater interoperability
   and accessibility to a variety of media content. They support
   creation of and access to voicemail, email, and fax messages from a
   single user interface.

   To accommodate the common functionality of unified messaging
   systems, IVM MUST support the inclusion of body parts containing
   different media types. It MUST also handle messages that contain
   VPIM messages as attachments to messages of another type (such as
   multipart/mixed), and VPIM messages that contain attachments of
   another type.

   To provide interoperability with systems that cannot handle a
   particular content type, IVM MUST provide a mechanism for
   identifying critical content and MAY define media specific status
   codes and strings to handle non-delivery of these body parts.


4.1.4   Interoperability with Traditional Email Servers

   Traditional email servers are those that support only textual media
   as inline content. IVM MUST interoperate consistently with the
   current Internet mail environment. If an IVM message arrives in
   users' mailboxes, IVM MUST provide a mechanism to interoperate with
   common user practices for mail messages: storing them in databases,
   retransmission, forwarding, creation of mail digests, and replying
   to messages using non-audio equipment.


4.2  Conformance to Existing Standards

   It is the goal of IVM to conform as closely as possible to existing
   standards while meeting the other goals defined in this document.

   - Restrictions: The profile SHOULD impose as few restrictions as
   possible to existing Internet mail standards. In particular, it MUST
   support all elements of RFC 822 [RFC822] except those that prevent
   the profile from meeting other IVM goals.

   - Additions: The profile SHOULD make as few additions as
   possible to existing internet mail standards. It SHOULD adhere to
   existing desktop conventions in desktop-related areas such as file

   extensions. If it is necessary to define new MIME types or sub-
   types, the IVM work group SHOULD propose terms that are already
   standard or in common use in the desktop environment.


4.3 Backward Compatibility

   This profile SHOULD provide backward compatibility with VPIM version
   2 to an extent where the functionality required to meet the goals of
   this profile is not compromised.  Where backward compatibility is
   not possible, IVM SHOULD provide and define a minimal set of rules
   and status codes for handling non-delivery of IVM messages resulting
   from interoperability with VPIM version 2 systems and other legacy
   systems.

4.4  Robustness

   IVM MUST be usable in an environment in which there exist legacy
   gateways that do not understand MIME. Core features and critical
   data MUST not be lost when messages pass through AMIS gateways
   [AMIS-A and AMIS-D]. IVM SHOULD allow interoperability with
   recipient devices and gateways that have limited buffering
   capabilities and cannot buffer all header information.
