INTERNET DRAFT                 urn "jaif"                     2017-05-10


1.  Introduction

   The Joint Automotive Industry Forum consists of the automotive
   industry associations AIAG (USA), JAMA and JAPIA (Japan) and Odette
   Europe). It provides a collaboration platform for the development of
   global guidelines for logistics processes, data exchange and best
   practices in the automotive supply chain. 

   The JAIF wishes to use a unique URN to qualify information attributes
   used in various data exchange scenarios, specifically in the exchange
   of event information captured by auto-ID technologies such as
   barcodes or Radio Frequency Identifiers (RFID). 

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Completed Namespace Specification Template
3.1. Namespace ID: 

   "jaif" 

3.2. Registration information: 

   Registration version number: 1 

   Registration Date:  2017-05-10 

3.3 Declared registrant of the namespace: 

   Organisation: Odette International 

   Address:  71 Great Peter Street           London           SW1P 2BN  
           United Kingdom 

   Email:    jwalther@odette.org 

3.4 Declaration of syntactic structure: 

   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs assigned by the JAIF
   will have the following hierarchical structure: 

          urn:jaif:{category}:{string} 

   where the "category" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to URN syntax

   requirements , and "{string}" is a string that conforms to URN syntax
   requirements . 

3.5. Relevant ancillary documentation: 

   The JAIF provides information on registration for each URN. The
   specifications and registration information are publishedat
   https://www.odette.org.  

3.6. Identifier uniqueness considerations: 

   The JAIF will manage resources using the "jaif" NID and will be the
   authority for managing the "jaif-urn" strings.  In the associated
   procedures, JAIF will ensure the uniqueness of the strings themselves
   or MAY permit secondary responsibility for management of well-defined
   sub-trees. 

3.7. Identifier persistence considerations: 

   The JAIF is committed to maintaining the accessibility and
   persistence of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by the
   member organizations.  

   JAIF will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of the
   "jaif" NID.  This will be structured such that each "jaif-urn", if
   needed, will have a separate description and registration table. 

   The registration tables and information will be published and
   maintained by JAIF in appropriate documents and published on its
   members' web sites. 

3.8. Process of identifier assignment: 

   All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled and managed
   by the JAIF. 

3.9. Process of identifier resolution: 

   The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant. 

3.10. Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 

   The "{category}" is case-insensitive.  Thus, the portion of the URN: 

                urn:jaif:{category}: 

   is case-insensitive for matches. The remainder of the identifier
   shall be considered case-sensitive. Consequently, URNsare only

   lexically equivalent if they are also lexically identical in the
   remaining {string} field. 

3.11. Conformance with URN Syntax: 

   No special considerations. 

3.12. Validation mechanism: 

   None specified. URN assignment will be handled by procedures
   supported and maintained by the JAIF. 

3.13. Scope: 

   Global.

4. Examples 

   The following examples are not guaranteed to be real.  They are  
   provided for pedagogical reasons only. 

        urn:jaif:rfid:eventID 

        urn:jaif:edi:codelist:JAI016 

        urn:jaif:rti:type:2467 

5. Namespace Considerations 

   The JAIF is developing a variety of B2B recommendations.  Some of
   these require information entities to be fully qualified. For proper
   operation, descriptions of the exchanged information must exist and
   be available in a unique, reliable, and persistent manner. 

   As JAIF recommendations and specifications cover many technical
   areas, the possibility of using various other namespace repositories
   has been deemed impractical.  Each object or description, as defined
   in the JAIF, could possibly be related to multiple different other
   namespaces. The JAIF wishes to avoid any potential conflict with
   other namespaces by maintaining its own namespace hierarchy for those
   objects.

6. Community Considerations 

   The objects and descriptions produced by the JAIF and necessary for
   compliant implementation or system development are generally
   available to its membership and to other organizations.

7. Security Considerations 

   There are no security considerations other than those normally  
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   IANA registers a new URN NID with the registration information
   provided in Section 2. 

   "jaif" strings are managed by the JAIF.  Thus, creating a new urn
   within the "jaif" namespace does not require any IANA action.

             Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.
