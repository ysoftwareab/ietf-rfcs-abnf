y = F(X)  an element-to-scalar mapping function.  For an elliptic
       curve group, it takes a point on the curve and returns the
       x-coordinate; for a finite field element it is the identity
       function, just returning the element itself.
Z = DH(x,Y)
       for an elliptic curve DH(x,Y) is the multiplication of point Y by
       the scalar value x creating a point on the curve Z; for finite
       field cryptography DH(x,Y) is expontiation of element Y to the
       power of x (implied modulo a field defining prime, p) resulting
       in an element Z.

a = len(b)
       indicates the length in bits of the string b.

z = F(DH(x, Y))
