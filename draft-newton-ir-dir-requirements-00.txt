Internet-Draft           ir-dir-requirements-00            February 2002


1. Background

   The expansion and growth of the Internet has seen the registry
   function of a traditionally centralized and managed Network
   Information Center become the responsibility of various autonomous,
   functionally disparate, and globally distributed Internet
   registries. With the broadening number of Internet registries, the
   uses of their administrative directory services have expanded from
   the original and traditional use of the whois[4] protocol to include
   the use of whois outside the scope of its specification, formal and
   informal definitions of syntax, undocumented security mechanisms,
   the use of other protocols, such as rwhois[3], to fulfill other
   needs, and proposals for the use of other technologies such as
   LDAP[1] and XML.

   The scope of the requirements captured in this document relate to
   the directory services of the specified Internet registries (Section
   2.1) and their related communities (Section 2.2,Section 2.3, and
   Section 2.4). The requirements are of both the current use of these
   directory services and the desired functionality based on input from
   relevant forums (Appendix B.1). These requirements are not specific
   to any protocol.

   The requirements captured in this document are for the purpose of
   designing technical specifications. The words used in this document
   for compliance with RFC2119[8] do not reference or specify policy
   and speak only to the capabilities in the derived technology. The
   scope of the requirements in this document are also restricted to
   access of data from Internet registries. Requirements for
   modification, addition, or provisioning of data in Internet
   registries are out of scope.

2. Internet Registry Communities

   The Internet registries are composed of various communities which
   provide scope for the requirements in this document. These
   communities can be generalized into the following categories:
   registries, implementers, end-users, and other actors.

2.1 Registries

2.1.1 Regional Internet Registries

   Regional Internet Registries (RIR's) administer the allocation of IP
   address space and autonomous system numbers. Each RIR serves a
   specific geographic region, and collectively they service the entire
   Internet. Each RIR is a membership-based, non-profit organization
   that facilitates and implements global addressing policy based on
   the direction of their regional community. 

2.1.2 Local Internet Registries

   Local Internet Registries (LIR's) and National Internet Registries
   (NIR's) are sub-registries of RIR's and coordinate the same
   functions of the RIR's for smaller, more specific geographic
   regions, sovereign nations, and localities.

2.1.3 Internet Routing Registries

   Internet Routing Registries are routing policy databases. Their
   purpose is to provide information helpful in administering Internet
   routers. Frequently, the syntax and contents are defined by RPSL[5]. 

   IRR's are operated by academic, commercial, governmental, and other
   types of organizations, including several of the RIR's. The contents
   of the databases vary and reflect the needs of the users directly
   served (e.g. an ISP may look up route entries added by their
   customers to decide whether to accept specific route advertisements
   they receive). 

   Unlike RIR and domain registry data, IRR data is often duplicated
   between separate organizations. The IRR data has the unique
   characteristics of being largely available through other sources
   (i.e. it is advertised by the Internet routing protocols) and most
   often having a common data format, RPSL. 

2.1.4 Domain Registries

   Domain registries are responsible for the registration of domains
   for use with DNS[2] and forward lookups (i.e. does not include the
   IN-ADDR.ARPA or IP6.ARPA domains). These registries have typically


Newton & Kerr            Expires August 8, 2002                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           ir-dir-requirements-00            February 2002


   served two main domain functions: as the registry for a gTLD or as a
   registry for a ccTLD. In many instances, one entity will operate
   multiple TLD's, both of the gTLD and ccTLD type. A gTLD or ccTLD
   domain registry operator may be a governmental entity,
   non-governmental, non-commercial entity, or a commercial entity.

   Some ccTLD's have second-level domain registrations similar in
   nature to gTLD's or have distinctly separate entities operating
   second-level domain registries similar in nature to gTLD's within
   the ccTLD.

   Domain registries usually follow one of two models for conducting
   registrations of domains. The "thick" model is the more traditional
   model. In a "thick" domain registry, the registry contains both the
   operational data for the domain and the contact or social data for
   the domain. In this model, the registry is typically the interface
   to the domain registrant but may also interface with the domain
   registrant through domain registrars. The "thin" model domain
   registry contains only operational data for domains. In the "thin"
   model, contact or social data for the domain are maintained by a
   domain registrar.

   Domain registries not described in this section are not the subject
   of this document and may have requirements that are out of scope for
   this subject matter.

2.1.5 Domain Registrars

   Domain registrars accept domain registrations from registrants on
   behalf of domain registries, both "thick" and "thin". In a "thin"
   model registry/registrar system, a domain registrar maintains the
   contact and social data of a domain while the registry maintains the
   operational data of a domain. In a "thick" model registry/registrar
   system, a domain registrar passes both the operational data and
   contact data to the registry. Domain registrars may register a
   domain on behalf of a registrant in more than one domain registry.

2.2 Implementers

   Implementers of client software are often either affiliated with
   large network operators, registry operators, or commercial entities
   offering value-added services, or are general citizens of the
   Internet. Much of the client software for use with the directory
   services of Internet registries is either freely available, open
   source, or both, or available as a service. Implementers of server
   software are often affiliated with operators or commercial entities
   specializing in the out-sourcing of development for Internet
   registries.

Internet-Draft           ir-dir-requirements-00            February 2002


2.3 End Users

2.3.1 Service Providers and Network Operators

   Service providers and network operators provide connectivity,
   routing, and naming services to many other entities, some commercial
   and some non-commercial, both large and small. Their operational and
   administrative staff often interact with Internet registries on
   behalf of other end-users. Service providers and network operators
   interact with all of the Internet registry operators outlined in
   this document on a frequent and consistent basis.

2.3.2 Intellectual Property Holders

   Intellectual Property Holders have legal rights to domain names
   based on copyright and trademark laws of various governments. They
   use the directory services of Internet registries, mostly domain
   registries and registrars, for purposes of maintaining and defending
   claims to domain names consistent with applicable laws and
   regulations.

2.3.3 Law Enforcement

   Law enforcement agencies use the directory services of Internet
   registries in the enforcement of laws within their jurisdictions.

2.3.4 Certificate Authorities

   Certificate authorities use the directory services of Internet
   registries as part of their verification process when issuing
   certificates for Internet named hosts.

2.4 Other Actors

   Requirements must also consider the influence and regulations placed
   on the use of Internet registry directory services by other actors.
   These actors include governments, non-governmental policy-setting
   bodies, and other non-governmental organizations.

3. Functional Requirements

   Functional requirements describe an overall need or process for
   which the directory service is used by an Internet registry to
   fulfill its obligations to provide access to its respective
   customers, members, or other constituents. This section makes
   reference to terms and definitions declared in Appendix A. This
   section makes use of the term "service" to denote the protocol or
   protocols derived from these requirements.

3.1 Common Functions

3.1.1 Mining Prevention

   The service MUST have a mechanism to limit the amount of data that
   may be accessed. The service MAY have different limits for different
   types of data, as well as authenticated and non-authenticated
   entities.

3.1.2 Minimal Technical Reinvention

   The service MUST NOT employ unique technology solutions for all
   aspects and layers above the network and transport layers of the
   total service solution and SHOULD make use of existing technology
   standards where applicable. The service MUST employ the use of
   network and transport layer standards as defined by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.

3.1.3 Standard and Extensible Schemas

   The service MUST define standard schemas for the exchange of data
   needed to implement the functionality in this document. In addition,
   there MUST be a means to allow for the use of schemas not defined by
   the needs of this document. Both types of schemas MUST use the same
   schema language.

3.1.4 Level of Access

   The service MUST be capable of authenticating priviledged entities
   and MUST be capable of restricting access of priviledged data to
   only priviledged entities. In addition, the service MUST be capable
   of serving both priviledged data and non-priviledged data and MUST
   allow for the classification of data, be it social or operational
   data, as priviledged data or non-priviledged data for the purpose of
   restricting its access.

3.1.5 Client Processing

   The service MUST be capable of allowing machine parsable requests

   There MUST be a mechanism for an entity contained within a server to
   be referenced uniquely by an entry in another server.

3.1.7 Contact Lookup

   The service SHOULD allow access to social data of contact entities
   given a unique reference to the contact entity.

3.1.8 Nameserver Lookup

   The service SHOULD allow access to operational and social data given
   the fully-qualified host name or IP address of a nameserver.

3.1.9 Decentralization

   The service MUST be decentralized in design and principle and MUST
   NOT require the aggregation of data to a central repository, server,
   or entity. The service MAY allow for the optional aggregation of
   data indexes or hints. The service MUST NOT require aggregation of
   data indexes or hints.

3.2 RIR Functions

3.2.1 Network Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data of a
   network given an IP address contained within the network. The
   service SHOULD provide access to address-to-name mapping information
   (IN-ADDR.ARPA or IP6.ARPA) of a network given an IP address
   contained within the network.

3.2.2 Autonomous System Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data of a
   network given the Autonomous System Number of a network.

3.2.3 DNS Referencing

   The service MUST use DNS[2] to determine the authoritative source of
   information about address-to-name mapping (IN-ADDR.ARPA or
   IP6.ARPA). The service SHOULD use DNSSEC[7] when available for this
   purpose.

Internet-Draft           ir-dir-requirements-00            February 2002


3.2.4 Network Search by Contact

   The service SHOULD provide access to a list of networks given a
   contact name or a subset of a contact name associated with the
   networks.

3.3 IRR Functions

3.3.1 Mirroring

   The service SHOULD provide near real-time mirroring of operational
   routing data. The service MAY provide this capability via a
   mechanism separate from that which the service provides for other
   data access means.

3.3.2 Router Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data of an
   Internet router given the fully-qualified domain name of the
   Internet router.

3.3.3 Route Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data of a
   network route given the network number of a route.

3.3.4 Route set Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data of a
   network route set given the name of the network route set.

3.4 Domain Functions

3.4.1 Domain Status Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to the status of a domain given the
   domain's fully qualified name. This status MUST indicate the
   activation status of the domain. The activation status is the same
   as would be available in Section 3.4.3.

3.4.2 Domain Registrant Search

   The service MUST provide the capability of searching for registrants
   by name or a reasonable name subset. The service MUST provide a
   mechanism to distribute this search across all applicable domain
   registries and registrars. The service SHOULD have a means to narrow
   the scope of a search to a specific TLD.

Internet-Draft           ir-dir-requirements-00            February 2002


3.4.3 Domain Information Lookup

   The service MUST provide access to operational and social data
   specific to a domain given the domain's fully qualified name (FQDN).
   This information SHOULD include the activation status, registrant
   name and contact data, hosting nameservers, and the technical,
   billing, or other entity types associated with the domain and their
   relevant contact data.

3.4.4 Nameserver Search

   The service MAY allow the ability to list all domains hosted by a
   specific nameserver given the fully-qualified host name or IP
   address, if applicable, of the nameserver. The service MAY provide a
   mechanism to distribute this search across all applicable domain
   registries and registrars.

3.4.5 Escrow Support

   The service MUST provide a means to escrow data of domain registrars
   to an escrow entity using a common schema. This escrow capability
   SHOULD be "off-line" and "out-of-band" from the normal operations of
   the service.

3.4.6 Authentication Distribution

   The service MUST be capable of allowing a centralized authority
   entity the means to distribute authentication information of
   entities accessing the service. The service MUST not require all
   Internet registries to participate in distributed authentication and
   SHOULD allow the participation by an Internet registry in
   distributed authentication by many centralized authority entities.

3.4.7 Domain Name Search

   The service MUST allow searching for domains given a reasonable
   subset of a domain name. The service MUST provide a mechanism to
   distribute this search across all applicable domain registries and
   registrars. There should be a means to narrow this search based on a
   TLD. The search mechanism SHOULD provide for differences in domain
   names between the native representation and the canonical form
   existing in the registry.

3.4.8 DNS Referencing

   The service MUST use DNS[2] to determine the authoritative source of
   information about domain names. The service SHOULD use DNSSEC[7]
   when available for this purpose.

   schema language.

4.6 Defined Schemas

   To provide for machine consumption as well as human consumption, the
   service MUST define schemas for use the structured queries and
   responses.

4.7 Serialization Definition

   To provide for data escrow and allow for minimal technological
   reinvention, the service MUST employ a pre-existing serialization
   specification.

7. Security Considerations

   This document contains requirements for the validation of
   authenticated entities and the access of authenticated entities
   compared with the access of non-authenticated entities. This
   document does not define the mechanism for validation of
   authenticated entities. Requirements defined in this document MUST
   allow for the implementation of this mechanism according best common
   practices.

   In addition, this document contains requirements for referrals and
   entity references. Client implementations based on these
   requirements SHOULD take proper care in the safe-guarding of
   credential information when resolving referrals or entity references
   according to best common practices.
