 Requirements for P4 Program Splitting for Heterogeneous Network Nodes
                   draft-hsingh-coinrg-reqs-p4comp-00

Abstract

   The P4 research community has published a paper to show how to split
   a P4 program into sub-programs which run on heterogeneous network
   nodes in a network.  Examples for nodes are a network switch, a
   smartNIC, or a host machine.  The paper has developed artifacts to
   split program based on latency, data rate, cost, etc.  However, the
   paper does not mention any requirements.  To provide guidance, this
   document covers requirements for splitting P4 programs for
   heterogeneous network nodes.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   The research paper [FLY] covers splitting a P4 program into sub-
   programs to run the sub-programs on heterogeneous network nodes.  The
   requirements are:

   1.  If the heterogeneous network includes a switch, the ARP [RFC0826]
       and IPv6 ND [RFC4861] data plane P4 code cannot be split.  This
       code replicates packets on switch ports to issue broadcast ARP or
       IPv6 ND multicast messages.  If this code moves outside the
       switch, then another node has to send each packet to the switch
       to issue broadcast or multicast messages, causing delay with
       address resolution.

   2.  Likewise ARP or IPv6 ND Proxy data plane code cannot be split to
       run outside the switch.

   3.  BGP table cannot move outside the switch to another node.
       Distributed BGP is a research topic.

   4.  A switch likely includes TCAM (ternary content-addressable
       memory) and thus the P4 program may use P4 ternary table match
       kind.  If such a table is moved to another node due to program
       split, the node the code moves to is important.  A FPGA (field-
       programmable gate array) does not use TCAM and a host machine may

       not either.  The FPGA and host use hash-based table lookup.
       Depending on the table key size, an appropriate hash is required.
       Either the splitting tool prompts the user for what hash to use
       or deduces what hash - user input is desirable.  For example, for
       a 6-tuple IPv4 key, a 128 bit key is used and for the same
       6-tuple, the IPv6 key uses 320 bits.  Appropriate hashes are
       required for such keys.

   5.  Splitting algorithms should not develop High Availability.
       Network deployments already use dual switches, or CLOS (leaf and
       spine switch redundant network) topology for redundancy.  BFD
       [RFC5880] is recommended for use with liveliness detection.

3.  Discussion

   The two largest public cloud operators are Amazon AWS and Microsft
   Azure [NIC].  Both operators run Software Defined Networking (SDN) in
   the smartNIC (smart Network Interface Card).  The reason is running
   SDN stack in software on the host requires additional CPU cycles.
   Burning CPUs for SDN services takes away from the processing power
   available to customer VMs, and increases the overall cost of
   providing cloud services.  Azure uses a FPGA on smartNIC and programs
   the FPGA in Verilog, not P4.  Amazon uses multi-core npu (Graviton
   uses 64 cores) on smartNIC and does not program Graviton in P4.  Both
   these operators do not use host cpu or network switch for SDN
   operations.  In future, even if both operators program smartNIC in
   P4, the operators do not have heterogeneous nodes running SDN.

4.  Security Considerations

   Use IPSec [RFC4301] to secure any control plane communications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.
