              Application-aware Networking (APN) Framework
                       draft-li-apn-framework-03

Abstract

   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet
   loss, etc.  Some new emerging applications have very demanding
   performance requirements.  However, in current networks, the network
   and applications are decoupled, that is, the network is not aware of
   the applications' requirements in a fine granularity.  Therefore, it
   is difficult to provide truly fine-granularity traffic operations for
   the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.

   This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware
   Networking (APN), where application-aware information (i.e.  APN
   attribute) including APN identification (ID) and/or APN parameters
   (e.g. network performance requirements) is encapsulated at network
   edge devices and carried in packets traversing an APN domain in order
   to facilitate service provisioning, perform fine-granularity traffic
   steering and network resource adjustment.

1.  Introduction

   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet
   loss, etc.  Some applications such as online gaming and live video
   streaming have very demanding network requirements and therefore
   require special treatment in the network.  However, in current
   networks, the network and applications are decoupled, that is, the
   network is not aware of the applications' requirements in a fine
   granularity.  Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-
   granularity traffic operations for the applications and guarantee
   their SLA requirements accordingly.
   [I-D.li-apn-problem-statement-usecases] describes the challenges of
   traditional differentiated service provisioning methods, such as five
   tuples used for ACL/PBR causing coarse granularity as well as
   orchestration and SDN-based solution causing long control loops.

   This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware
   Networking (APN), where application-aware information (APN attribute)
   including application-aware identification (APN ID) and application-
   aware parameters (APN Parameters), is encapsulated at network edge
   devices and carried along with the encapsulation of the tunnel that
   is used by the packet to traverse the APN domain.  The APN attribute
   will facilitate service provisioning and provide fine-granularity
   services in the APN domain.

   The APN attribute is acquired based on the existing information in
   the packet header such as 5-tuple and QinQ (S-VLAN and C-VLAN) at the
   edge devices of the APN domain, added to the data packets along with
   the tunnel encapsulation, delivered within the network, and removed
   when the packets leave the domain together with the tunnel
   encapsulation.

   APN aims to apply various policies in different nodes along a network
   path onto a traffic flow altogether, for example, at the headend to
   steer into corresponding path, at the midpoint to collect
   corresponding performance measurement data, and at the service
   function to execute particular policies.

   APN works within a limited trusted domain.  Typically, an APN domain
   is defined as a Network Operator controlled limited domain (see
   Figure 1), in which MPLS, VXLAN, SR/SRv6 and other tunnel
   technologies are adopted to provide network services.

   Packets carry application characteristic information (i.e.  APN
   attribute) which includes the following information:

   o  Application-aware identification (APN ID): identifies the set of
      attributes, indicating that all packets belonging to the same flow
      will be given the same treatment by the network. ;

   o  Application-aware parameters (APN parameters): The typical
      application-aware parameters are the network performance
      requirement parameters including bandwidth, delay, delay
      variation, packet loss ratio, etc.

                  Figure 1: Framework and Key Components

   The key components are introduced as follows.

   o  App-aware Edge Device (APN-Edge): this network device receives
      packets from applications and obtains the APN attribute based on
      the configuration on this device according to the existing
      information in the packet header, such as 5-tuple, VLAN or double
      VLAN tagging (C-VLAN and S-VLAN).  The APN-Edge device adds the
      APN attribute in the tunnel encapsulation.  The packets carrying
      the APN attribute will be sent to the APN-Head, and the APN
      attribute will be used to apply various policies in different
      nodes along the network path onto the traffic flow, e.g., at the
      headend to steer into corresponding path satisfying SLAs, at the
      midpoint to collect corresponding performance measurement data, at
      the service function to execute particular policies.  When the
      packets leave the APN domain, the APN attribute will be removed
      together with the tunnel encapsulation.

   o  App-aware-process Head-End (APN-Head): This network device
      receives packets from the APN-Edge, obtains the APN attribute, and
      initiates the corresponding process.  Generally, in order to
      satisfy different SLA requirements, a set of paths, tunnels or SR
      policies, are set up between the APN-Head and the APN-Endpoint.

Internet-Draft                APN Framework                     May 2021


      These multiple parallel paths have different SLA guarantees.  The
      APN-Head maintains the matching relationship between the APN
      attribute and the paths between the APN-Head and the APN-Endpoint.
      The APN-Head determines the path between the APN-Head and the APN-
      Endpoint according to the APN attribute carried in the packets and
      the matching relationship with it, which satisfies the service
      requirements of the applications.  The APN-Head forwards the
      packets along the path.  The APN attribute conveyed by the packet
      received from the APN-Edge can also be copied or be mapped to the
      outgoing packet header.

   o  App-aware-process Mid-Point (APN-Midpoint): the APN-Midpoint
      provides the path service and enforces various policies according
      to the APN attribute carried in the packets.  The APN-Midpoint may
      also adjust the resource locally to guarantee the service
      requirements depending on a specific policy and the APN attribute
      conveyed by the packet.  Policy definitions and mechanisms are out
      of the scope of this document.

   o  App-aware-process End-Point (APN-Endpoint): the process of the
      specific service path will end at the APN-Endpoint.  If the outer
      tunnel header for the path between the APN-Head and the APN-
      Endpoint exists, it will be removed by the APN-Endpoint.  If the
      APN attribute is copied or mapped to the outer tunnel header by
      the APN-Head, it will also be removed along with the outer tunnel
      header.

   Note that in the actual implementation, the APN-Edge can co-exist
   with the APN-Head or APN-Endpoint, that is, one network device can
   implement the functionalities of both APN-Edge and the APN-Head/APN-
   Endpoint.

5.  APN Requirements

   This section specifies the requirements for supporting the APN
   framework, including the requirements for conveying and handling the
   APN attribute.

5.1.  APN Attribute Conveying Requirements

   The APN attribute consists of APN ID and APN parameters.

   APN ID includes the following identifiers (IDs),

   o  Application Group ID: identifies an application group of the
      traffic.

   o  User Group ID: identifies the user group of the traffic.



Li, et al.              Expires November 26, 2021               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                APN Framework                     May 2021


   APN ID can be acquired through different ways.  In the APN work it
   MUST be acquired according to the existing available information in
   the packet header without inspection into the payload.

   The different combinations of the IDs can be used to provide
   different granularity of the service provisioning and SLA guarantee
   for the traffic.

   The APN parameters are the network performance requirement
   parameters.  The network service requirement can include the
   following parameters:

   o  Bandwidth: the bandwidth requirement

   o  Latency: the latency requirement

   o  Packet loss ratio: the packet loss ratio requirement

   o  Jitter: the jitter requirement

   The different combinations of the parameters are for further
   expressing the more detailed service requirements, conveyed together
   with the APN ID, which can be used to match to appropriate tunnels/SR
   Policies and queues that can satisfy these service requirements.

   APN attribute MUST be encapsulated within tunnels in the network
   layer.  The tunnels include but not limit to MPLS, VxLAN, SR-MPLS,
   and SRv6.  It can be extended according to requirements in the
   future.

   [REQ 1a].  APN ID SHOULD include Application Group ID to indicate the
   application group that the packet belongs to.

   [REQ 1b].  APN ID SHOULD include User Group ID to indicate the user
   group that the packet belongs to.

   [REQ 1c].  APN ID MUST include either Application Group ID or User
   Group ID.

   [REQ 1d].  APN ID MUST be acquired from the existing available
   information of the packet header without interference into the
   payload.

   [REQ 1e].  APN parameters is OPTIONAL.

   [REQ 1f].  APN attribute MUST be carried by the outer tunnel
   encapsulation.

Internet-Draft                APN Framework                     May 2021


   [REQ 1g].  All the nodes along the path SHOULD be able to process the
   APN attribute if needed.

   [REQ 1h].  The APN attribute is generated by the APN-Edge though
   local policy.

   [REQ 1i].  The APN attribute SHOULD be kept intact when directly
   copied at the APN-Head and carried in the tunnel encapsulation.

   [REQ 1j].  The APN attribute MUST be removed along with the tunnel
   encapsulation by the APN-Edge when the packets leave the APN domain.

5.1.1.  Protocol Extensions Requirements

   The APN attribute is conveyed with the tunnel encapsulation.  There
   are two typical types of tunnels:

   o  MPLS-based tunnel: LDP tunnel, RSVP-TE tunnel, SR-MPLS tunnel or
      policy, etc.

   o  IPv6-based tunnel: IPv6-based VxLAN tunnel, IPv6-based UDP tunnel,
      IPv6-based GRE tunnel, SRv6 tunnel or policy, etc.

   In order to support encapsulation of APN attribute, the MPLS data
   plane and IPv6 data plane need to be extended.

   In order to support acquiring the APN attribute according to the
   existing available information in the packet header, YANG models
   should be defined to configure the mapping between the application/
   user group ID and the existing information in the packet header and
   configure the corresponding APN attribute for the application/user
   group.  It can also be implemented with protocol extensions such as
   BGP and PCEP which can advertise the information from the central
   controller to the APN-Edge.

   In addition, in the APN domain, the above-mentioned mapping and
   applying APN parameters may also be advertised from the APN-Edge/APN-
   Head to other devices or from the network devices to the central
   controller in the APN domain.  IGP extensions or BGP-LS extensions
   should be introduced to achieve the purposes.

   [REQ 1-1a] MPLS encapsulation SHOULD be extended to be able to carry
   the APN attribute for MPLS-based tunnels.

   [REQ 1-1b] IPv6 encapsulation SHOULD be extended to be able to carry
   the APN attribute for IPv6-based tunnels.

Internet-Draft                APN Framework                     May 2021


   [REQ 1-1c] YANG models SHOULD be defined to implement the mapping
   between the application/user group ID and the existing available
   information in the packet header and configure the corresponding APN
   parameters.

   [REQ 1-1d] BGP extensions SHOULD be defined to advertise the mapping
   between the application/user group ID and the existing available
   information in the packet header and the corresponding APN parameters
   from the central controller to the APN-Edge in the APN domain.

   [REQ 1-1e] PCEP extensions SHOULD be defined to advertise the mapping
   between the application/user group ID and the existing available
   information in the packet header and the corresponding APN parameters
   from the central controller to the APN-Edge in the APN domain.

   [REQ 1-1f] IGP extensions SHOULD be defined to advertise the mapping
   between the application/user group ID and the existing available
   information in the packet header and the corresponding APN parameters
   from the APN-Edge to the network devices in the APN domain.

   [REQ 1-1g] BGP-LS extensions SHOULD be defined to advertise the
   mapping between the application/user group ID and the existing
   available information in the packet header and the corresponding APN
   parameters from the network devices to the central controller in the
   APN domain.

5.2.  APN attribute Handling Requirements

   The APN Head and APN-Midpoint perform matching operation against the
   APN attribute, that is, to match IDs and/or service requirements to
   the corresponding network resources such as tunnels/SR policies and
   queues.

5.2.1.  App-aware SLA Guarantee

   In order to achieve better Quality of Experience (QoE) of end users
   and engage customers, the network needs to be able to provide fine-
   granularity SLA guarantee [I-D.li-apn-problem-statement-usecases].

   [REQ 2-1a].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head SHOULD be able to
   steer the traffic to the tunnel/SR policy that satisfies the matching
   operation.

   [REQ 2-1b].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head SHOULD be able to
   trigger the setup of the tunnel/SR policy that satisfies the matching
   operation.

   [REQ 2-1c].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head and APN-Midpoint
   SHOULD be able to steer the traffic to the queue that satisfies the
   matching operation.

   [REQ 2-1d].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head and APN-Midpoint
   SHOULD be able to trigger the configuration of the queue that
   satisfies the matching operation.

   [REQ 2-1e].  If the tunnels are used to satisfy the performance
   requirements, the APN-Head SHOULD be able to copy or map the APN
   attribute conveyed by the packet received from the APN-Edge to the
   outer tunnel header.

   [REQ 2-1f].  If the tunnels are used to satisfy the performance
   requirements and the APN attribute are conveyed along with the outer
   tunnel, the APN-Endpoint MUST remove the APN attribute along with the
   outer tunnel.

5.2.2.  App-aware network slicing

   Network slicing provides ways to partition the network infrastructure
   in either control plane or data plane into multiple network slices
   that are running in parallel.  The resources on each node need to be
   associated to corresponding slices.

   [REQ 2-2a].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head SHOULD be able to
   steer the traffic to the slice that satisfies the matching operation.

   [REQ 2-2b].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Midpoint SHOULD be able
   to associate the traffic to the resources in the slice that satisfies
   the matching operation.

5.2.3.  App-aware deterministic networking

   Along the path each node needs to provide guaranteed bandwidth,
   bounded latency, and other properties relevant to the transport of
   time-sensitive data for the Detnet flows that coexist with the best-
   effort traffic.

   [REQ 2-3a].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head SHOULD be able to
   steer the traffic to the appropriate path that satisfies the matching
   operation.

   [REQ 2-3b].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Head SHOULD be able to
   trigger the setup of the appropriate path that satisfies the matching
   operation for the Detnet flows.

   [REQ 2-3c].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Midpoint SHOULD be able
   to associate the traffic to the resources along the path that
   satisfies the performance guarantee.

   [REQ 2-3d].  With the APN attribute, the APN-Midpoint SHOULD be able
   to reserve the resources for the Detnet flows along the path that
   satisfies the performance guarantee.

5.2.4.  App-aware service function chaining

   The end-to-end service delivery often needs to go through various
   service functions, including traditional network service functions
   such as firewalls, LB as well as new application-specific functions,
   both physical and virtual.  SFC is applicable to both fixed and
   mobile networks as well as data center networks.

   [REQ 2-4a].  With the APN attribute, the App-aware-process devices
   SHOULD be able to steer the traffic to the appropriate service
   function.

   [REQ 2-4b].  The App-aware-process devices including VAS SHOULD be
   able to process the APN attribute carried in the packets.

5.2.5.  App-aware network measurement

   Network measurement can be used for verifying whether the network
   performance requirements have been satisfied, as well as locating
   silent failure and predicting QoE satisfaction, which enables real-
   time SLA awareness/proactive OAM and potential resource adjustments.

   [REQ 2-5a].  The App-aware-process devices SHOULD be able to perform
   IOAM based on the APN attribute.

   [REQ 2-5b].  The network measurement results can be reported based on
   the APN attribute and verify whether the performance requirements are
   satisfied.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include an IANA request.

7.  Security Considerations

   In the APN work, in order to reduce the privacy and security issues,
   the following specifications are defined:

   [S1].  The APN attribute MUST be conveyed along with the tunnel
   information in the APN domain.  The APN attribute is encapsulated and
   removed at the APN-Edge.

   [S2].  The APN ID (including the Application Group ID and the User
   Group ID) MUST be acquired from the existing available information in
   the packet header without interference into the payload.

   According to the above specifications, the APN attribute is only
   produced and used locally within the APN domain without the
   involvement of the host/application side.

   In order to prevent the malicious attack through the APN attribute,
   the following policies can be configured at the network devices of
   the APN domain:

   [P1].  If the APN attribute is conveyed without the tunnel
   information, the packet MUST be dropped.

   [P2].  If the APN attribute is not known to the APN domain, it should
   trigger the alarm information.  The packet can be forwarded without
   being processed or dropped depending on the local policy.

   [P3].  If the network service requirements exceed the specification
   for the specific Application Group ID and/or User Group ID, it should
   trigger the alarm information.  The packet should be discarded to
   prevent abusing of the resources.

   [P4].  There should be rate-limiting policy at the APN-Edge to
   prevent the traffic belonging to a specific Application Group ID and/
   or User Group ID from exceeding the preset limit.
