         Autonomic IP Address To Access Control Groups Mapping
           draft-yizhou-anima-ip-to-access-control-groups-00

Abstract

   This document defines the autonomic technical objectives for IP
   address/prefix to access control groups mapping.  The objectives
   defined can be used in Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP)
   to make the policy enforcement point receive IP address and its tied
   access control groups information directly from the access
   authentication points and then execute the group based policies.

1.  Introduction

   Ubiquitous group based policy management makes sure that the users
   can obtain the same network access permission and QoS assurance
   wherever they access the campus network.  That is, the permission and
   QoS assurance are tied to user role, rather than access points and/or
   IP address assigned.

   Group means a number of endpoints connecting to the network that
   share common network policies.  It facilitates the easy design and
   provision of policy.  A user's role is usually a group indicated by a
   group ID.  Group based policy management has been replacing the
   traditional IP address and/or port number based policy widely.

   The policy enforcement point (PEP) requires the IP address/prefix and
   access control group mapping information of user in order to execute
   the group based policy.  This mapping information is usually first
   available at the access authentication point (AAP) during the
   procedures of user access and authentication/authorization.  However
   PEP may not be the access authentication point.  Therefore IP and
   group mappings has to be passed to PEP.

Internet-Draft      Auto IP and Access Group Mapping           June 2021


   This document defines the autonomic technical objectives for IP
   address/prefix and access control group mapping.  In this document,
   group is also used for short to refer to the access control group.
   The Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) [RFC8990] can make
   use of these technical objectives as the basic building blocks of a
   ubiquitous group based policy management solution, especially for a
   campus network.

   Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) is designed to provide the
   elementary functions and services to be further integrated and used
   by Autonomic Service Agents (ASA) on nodes.  The campus policy
   management ASA can integrate the function introduced in this document
   when necessary.

2.  Terminologies

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC7575].

   PEP:  Policy Enforcement Point.  A logical entity that enforces
      policy decisions [RFC3198].  The policy decisions are group based
      policies in this document.

   AAP:  Access Authentication Point.  A logical entity that obtains the
      information of the attaching clients' assigned IP address/prefix
      and their access control groups.  AAP may get the information from
      one or different resources, for example, DHCP [RFC2131] [RFC8415]
      server and/or RADIUS [RFC3198] server.

3.  Problems

   The traditional policy in a campus network is normally presented as
   IP prefix/address based, for example, "Deny the traffic from IP
   prefix X to IP prefix Y".  Each of the access port of the switches is
   assigned a subnet prefix and each subnet implies a group.  It works
   well when the end hosts are static.  With the increasing deployment
   of wireless accessed users and more complicated and dynamic
   requirements of campus network policy, such an assumption no longer
   hold.  For instance, a user from the engineering department may bring
   the laptop to access the campus network via a WiFi access point.
   Then it will be assigned an IP address from a different subnet prefix
   from the other fixed end hosts in the same engineering department.
   It is hard and tedious to provision the consistent policy with the
   other hosts in the same group for this specific IP address.  Another
   example is a user can belong to more than one group, say group of
   department A and also VIP group.  Group assignment is much more
   flexible than subnet defined IP address assignment.

   Therefore group based policy is used in such cases.  No matter what
   IP address is assigned to the user, its belonging access control
   groups have no change and the group based policies has no change too.
   For example, the policy can be "Allow the traffic from group
   engineering to group testing, and assign the traffic destined to VIP
   group the highest priority".  In order to make group based policy
   work, the IP address and its group mapping information has to be
   stored on PEP so that IP addresses carried in data packet can be
   mapped to the group ID first and then the policy can be enforced.

   IP and group mapping information is usually first available at the
   access authentication point (AAP).  Figure 1 show a typical campus
   network.  The policy enforcement point (PEP) can be core switches,
   while the access authentication point (AAP) is the access switch in
   the figure.  AAP serves as the DHCP relay which remembers the IP
   address assigned to the client and/or at the same time it talks to
   AAA server to get the client's group information based on client's
   identity.

   A more complex campus network is shown in Figure 2.  There are 4 PEPs
   are deployed at the key positions for different types of traffic.
   The AAPs obtaining a user's IP and group ID mapping information are
   access switches (not fully shown in the figure) which are the access
   nodes for the attaching clients.

   The problem to be solved by Autonomic Networking here is how to make
   IP address/prefix and access control group mapping information
   available at PEP from AAP.

   Some deployment uses a centralized controller to solve this problem.
   Every single AAP reports its IP and group ID mapping information to
   the controller.  When a PEP receives a data packet, it queries the
   controller for the group IDs of the source and/or destination IP
   addresses and then enforce the group based policy.  This approach
   requires an explicit controller able to talk to each and every AAP
   and PEP.  In the deployment where the headquarter and branch campus
   networks are far apart, it will require controllers for each site to
   exchange information or have another super-controller to help
   exchange the information among sites.  It introduces the complexity
   and interoperability issues.

   Autonomic Networking (AN) puts the intelligence at the node level, to
   minimize dependency on human administrators and central management
   such as a controller.  The Autonomic Networking approach discussed in
   this document is based on the assumption that there is a generic
   discovery and negotiation protocol that enables direct negotiation
   between the routers or switches.  GRASP [RFC8990] is intended to be
   such a protocol which can make use of the technical objectives
   defined in the following sections as the basic building blocks of a
   ubiquitous group based policy management solution, especially for a
   campus network.  The ultimate goal is self-management of campus
   networks which can expand over multiple sites and share the same set
   of policies, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-
   healing and self-protection (sometimes collectively called self-X).

4.  Autonomic IP Address to Access Control Groups Mapping Procedures

   An Autonomic Service Agent (ASA) participates in IP address/prefix to
   access control groups mapping is called
   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups ASA in this document.  The procedures
   carried out by IPAddressToAccessControlGroups ASA is illustrated
   below.

4.1.  Behaviours of IP Address to Access Control Groups Mapping
      Requesting Nodes

   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups requesting node is usually a PEP in a
   domain which executes the group based policy.  So it needs to map an
   IP address/prefix to one or more group IDs first.  Such mapping
   information will be stored locally until either timeout or withdrawn.

   The request can be triggered by a data packet.  Group based policy
   requires both the source and destination group IDs which are normally
   mapped from source and destination IP addresses.  If any of such
   mapping is not locally available, the requesting node needs to ask
   for it.  In some implementation, data packet encapsulation includes
   the source group ID directly such as in the reserved field in VXLAN

Internet-Draft      Auto IP and Access Group Mapping           June 2021


   [RFC7348].  Therefore it is up to the requesting node to determine if
   both source and destination groups or only one of them to be queried.
   In some cases that the requesting node is a tunnel endpoint, it
   should be noted that usually the inner rather than outer IP addresses
   are to be used to query for the corresponding group id.

   The request can also be sent periodically or voluntarily.  It can
   happen when a newly booted requesting node wants to get the whole
   batch of IP address and access control group mapping information or
   when a requesting node would like have an explicit refreshment on the
   information.

   The IPAddressToAccessControlGroups ASA should send out a GRASP
   Discovery message that contains a IPAddressToAccessControlGroups
   Objective option in order to discover peers supporting this option.
   The requesting ASA acts as a GRASP synchronization initiator by
   sending a GRASP Request message with a IPAddressToAccessControlGroups
   Objective option.  The ASA indicates an IP prefix or address in this
   option.  This starts a GRASP synchronization process.

4.2.  Behaviours of IP Address to Access Control Groups Mapping
      Providing Nodes

   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups providing node is usually an AAP of a
   user in a domain.  It obtains the mapping of IP address and group IDs
   of an endpoint in various ways.  For instance, use RADIUS [RFC2865]
   or CAPWAP [RFC5415] to get the user's access control group IDs during
   authentication phase and/or use DHCP snooping to get the user's
   assigned IP address.  Sometimes such mapping information can be
   statically provisioned based on port or VLAN.  The mapping
   information is stored locally on AAP.

   A device that receives a Discovery message with a
   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups Objective option should respond with a
   GRASP Response message if it contains a
   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups ASA.  When this ASA receives a
   subsequent Request message, it should reply with a GRASP
   Synchronization messages.  The Synchronization messages carry a
   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups Objective option, which will indicate
   the mappings between the IP address/prefix and group IDs.  Optionally
   the expiration time can be tied to each mapping.

   The IP address to access control groups mapping providing node can
   send the Flood Synchronization message if it has any update or
   withdraw regarding its providing mapping information.

   The providing nodes of address to access control groups mapping
   information are usually at the edges and can be added or replaced

   with the expansion of the network.  The requesting nodes are normally
   aggregation or core nodes with more storage and capability to enforce
   the policy.  Therefore the number of mapping information providing
   nodes is usually more than the number of requesting nodes.  The
   providing node can be the one initiating the GRASP Discovery message
   as well and/or send the unsolicited Synchronization message
   [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-distribution].

5.  Autonomic IP Address to Access Control Groups Objectives

   This section defines the GRASP technical objective options that are
   used to support autonomic IP address/prefix to access control groups
   mapping.

5.1.  IPAddressToAccessControlGroups Objective Option

   The IPAddressToAccessControlGroups Objective option is a GRASP
   objective option conforming to [RFC8990].  The name of this option is
   "IPAddressToAccessControlGroups".  It carries the IP prefix/address
   and its mapping access control group id.  The format of
   IPAddressToAccessControlGroups Objective option in CBOR (Concise
   Binary Object Representation [RFC8949]) is show in Concise data
   definition language (CDDL) [RFC8610] as follows.  Tags for general
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and prefixes defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-network-addresses] are used.

   objective = ["IPAddressToAccessControlGroups",
                objective-flags, loop-count,
                [ip-address-or-prefix, *group-id]]

   group-id = uint

   ; copied from draft-ietf-cbor-network-addresses, RFC YYYY TBD:

   ip-address-or-prefix = ipv6-address-or-prefix/ipv4-address-or-prefix

   ipv6-address-or-prefix = #6.54(ipv6-address / ipv6-prefix)
   ipv4-address-or-prefix = #6.52(ipv4-address / ipv4-prefix)

   ipv6-prefix = [ipv6-prefix-length, ipv6-prefix-bytes]
   ipv4-prefix = [ipv4-prefix-length, ipv4-prefix-bytes]

   ipv6-prefix-length = 0..128
   ipv4-prefix-length = 0..32

   ipv6-prefix-bytes = bytes .size (uint .le 16)
   ipv4-prefix-bytes = bytes .size (uint .le 4)

   ipv6-address = bytes .size 16
   ipv4-address = bytes .size 4

   ; copied from the GRASP specification, RFC 8990:

      objective-flags = uint .bits objective-flag

      objective-flag = &(
        F_DISC: 0    ; valid for discovery
        F_NEG: 1     ; valid for negotiation
        F_SYNCH: 2   ; valid for synchronization
        F_NEG_DRY: 3 ; negotiation is a dry run
      )
      loop-count = 0..255


   A common practice currently usually uses 16 bits to present a group
   ID.  But the representation does not limit that.  Zero group ID would
   be used for full retraction of a prefix or address.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security consideration for GRASP [RFC8990] applies in this document.
   The preferred security model is that devices are trusted following
