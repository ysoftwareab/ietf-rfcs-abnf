                draft-tgraf-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-06

Abstract

   This document introduces additional code points in the
   mplsTopLabelType Information Element for IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3 and
   BGP MPLS Segment Routing (SR) extensions to enable Segment Routing
   label protocol type information in IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX).

1.  Introduction

   Besides BGP-4 [RFC8277], LDP [RFC5036] and BGP VPN [RFC4364], four
   new routing-protocols, OSPFv2 Extensions [RFC8665], OSPFv3 Extensions
   [RFC8666], IS-IS Extensions [RFC8667] and BGP Prefix-SID [RFC8669]
   have been added to the list of routing-protocols able to propagate
   Segment Routing labels for the MPLS data plane [RFC8660].

   Traffic Accounting in Segment Routing Networks
   [I-D.ali-spring-sr-traffic-accounting] describes how IPFIX can be
   leveraged to account traffic to MPLS Segment Routing label dimensions
   within a Segment Routing domain.

   In the Information Model for IP Flow Information Export IPFIX
   [RFC7012], the information element mplsTopLabelType(46) describes
   which MPLS control plane protocol allocated the top-of-stack label in
   the MPLS label stack.  RFC 7012 section 7.2 [RFC7012] describes the
   "IPFIX MPLS label type (Value 46)" sub-registry [IANA-IPFIX-IE46]
   where new code points should be added.

2.  MPLS Segment Routing Top Label Type

   By introducing four new code points to information element
   mplsTopLabelType(46) for IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3 and BGP Prefix-SID,
   when Segment Routing with one of these four routing protocols is
   deployed, we get insight into which traffic is being forwarded based
   on which MPLS control plane protocol.

   A typical use case scenario is to monitor MPLS control plane
   migrations from LDP to IS-IS or OSPF Segment Routing.  Such a
   migration can be done node by node as described in RFC8661 [RFC8661]

   Another use case is the monitoring of a migration to a Seamless MPLS
   SR [I-D.hegde-spring-mpls-seamless-sr] architecture.  Where prefixes
   are propagated with dynamic BGP labels according to RFC8277

   [RFC8277], BGP Prefix-SID according to RFC8669 [RFC8669] and used for
   the forwarding between IGP domains.  Adding an additional layer into
   the MPLS data plane to above discribed use case.

   Both use cases can be verified by looking at mplsTopLabelType(46),
   mplsTopLabelIPv4Address(47), mplsTopLabelStackSection(70) and
   forwardingStatus(89) dimensions.  Giving insights into the MPLS data
   plane for which MPLS provider edge loopback address, which label
   protocol has been used and how many packets are forwarded or dropped
   and when dropped why they have been dropped.

   By looking at the MPLS label value itself, it is not always clear as
   to which label protocol it belongs, since they could potentially
   share the same label allocation range.  This is the case for IGP-
   Adjacency SID's, LDP and dynamic BGP labels as an example.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies four additional code points for IS-IS,
   OSPFv2, OSPFv3 and BGP Prefix-SID Segment Routing extension in the
   existing sub-registry "IPFIX MPLS label type (Value 46)" of the
   "IPFIX Information Elements" and one new "IPFIX Information Element"
   with a new sub-registry in the "IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
   Entities" name space.

4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the IPFIX Protocol
   RFC7012 [RFC7012].
