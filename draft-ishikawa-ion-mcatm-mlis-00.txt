Abstract


      This memo describes the specification for IP multicast over ATM
      MLIS using ATM multicast routers. This memo specifies the protocol
      for providing the functions of IGMP [1] over the ATM networks.
      This is the simplest approach among various proposals for IP
      multicast over the ATM networks including MARS [2], and it is easy
      to implement this specification compared with other proposals.

1. Introduction

   This memo describes the specification for IP multicast over ATM MLIS
   (Multicast Logical IP Subnetwork) using ATM multicast routers. The
   requirements for this specification for IP multicasting over ATM
   MLIS are as follows:

   - To interwork with the MBONE (an experimental multicasting network on
     the Internet), the specification should be compatible with the basic
     specifications for IP multicasting such as RFC 1112 [1] and the
     multicast routing protocols such as RFC 1075 [3]. It should also
     interwork with routers and hosts in which such specifications are
     implemented.

   - To be compatible with RFC 1112 on the service interface level with
     upper-layer protocol modules so that the existing multicast
     applications can operate over ATM networks.

   - To accomplish IP multicasting over ATM networks efficiently, the
     specification should be able to effectively use the point-to-
     multipoint connection that ATM networks provide.

   - It should be compatible with the specifications for IP over ATM
     networks such as RFC 1577 [4] and RFC1755 [5] and be able to use
     these protocols when necessary.

   As a mechanism to satisfy above requirements, this memo describes the
   specification for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS using ATM multicast
   routers.

   This memo assumes that "The ATM Forum UNI Specification, V 3.0/3.1" is
   used as the interface with ATM networks.

2. Model

   A model for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS using ATM multicast routers
   is described below.

   A sending host sends multicast IP datagrams to an ATM multicast
   router, using an ATM point-to-point connection. An ATM multicast
   router distributes received multicast IP datagrams toward multiple
   receiving hosts, using an ATM point-to-multipoint connection.
   A receiving host receives multicast IP datagrams from an ATM
   multicast router. An ATM multicast router may send received multicast
   IP datagrams to existing IP multicast networks such as MBone, if it
   has an existing router function (e.g. by implementing RFC 1075).
   When an ATM multicast router with the existing router functions has
   interfaces with both ATM networks and the existing LANs such as
   Ethernet, the IP multicast communication between those networks
   becomes possible.

3. Overview of IP Multicasting

   The overview of IP multicasting specified in RFC 1112 is described
   below.

   The purpose of IP multicasting is to transfer IP datagrams to host
   groups (0 or more  hosts identified by a single IP destination
   address). Multicast IP datagrams are transferred to all hosts in the
   host group. The membership of a host group is dynamic; that is, hosts
   may join or leave groups at any time. A multicast IP datagram is
   transferred to other networks by a multicast router in the same way
   as regular IP datagrams.

   There are three levels in the implementation of IP multicasting in
   hosts.

   (1) Level 0: no support for IP multicasting.

       There is obviously no requirement regarding the support. Level 0
       hosts discard  multicast IP datagrams with class D destination
       addresses.

   (2) Level 1: support for sending multicast IP datagrams only.

       Implementations of Level 1 hosts are relatively easy.

   (3) Level 2: full support for IP multicasting.

       Level 2 hosts can join or leave host groups. Implementation of
       the IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) is required.

   Host groups are identified by class D IP addresses, i.e., those
   starting with 110 Class D IP addresses range from 224.0.0.0
   to 239.255.255.255. The address of 224.0.0.0, however, is not
   assigned to any group. The address of 224.0.0.1 is always assigned
   to a group that includes all hosts in the subnetwork.

4. Overview of Point-to-Multipoint Connection of ATM Networks

   The overview of the point-to-multipoint connection specified in the
   ATM Forum UNI 3.0/3.1 is described below.

   The following restrictions apply in the point-to-multipoint
   connection specified in the ATM Forum UNI 3.0/3.1.

   - Only a root can set up a point-to-multipoint connection and add
     a leaf.

   - ATM cells are transferred from the root to the leaves only.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


   The specification for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS should be designed
   based on the above restrictions.

   NOTE: These restrictions may be relaxed in future versions of the
         ATM Forum UNI.

   The setup and release procedures of the point-to-multipoint connection
   are as follows.

   (1) The first connection from the root to the leaf is set using a SET
       UP/CONNECT message as in the point-to-point connection.

   (2) After that, the root can add new leaves at any time using an ADD
       PARTY/ADD PARTY RESPONSE message.

   (3) The root or leaf can delete new leaves at any time using a DROP
       PARTY/DROP PARTY RESPONSE message.

5. Implementation Model

   The implementation model of the IP multicasting over ATM MLIS on a
   host and an ATM multicast router is shown below. This model is for
   expository purpose only, and should not be construed as
   constrainind an actual implementation.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


   The IGMP-ATM is a protocol for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS, based on
   IGMP. RFC 1577 is used to resolve IP addresses to ATM addresses. The
   LLC encapsulation specified in RFC 1483 is used for IP encapsulation
   over ATM networks.

   Level 1 hosts must be implemented with the transmission of multicast
   IP datagrams. In addition, Level 2 hosts and ATM multicast routers
   must be implemented with the reception of multicast IP datagrams.

   The transmission and reception procedures of multicast IP datagrams
   are described below.

6. Transmission Procedures of Multicast IP Datagrams

   The transmission procedures of multicast IP datagrams are the same
   as in unicast IP datagrams from the point of view of the upper-layer
   protocol module. When transmitting a multicast IP datagram, upper-
   layer protocol modules designate a class D IP address identifying
   a host group as a destination address.

   The IP module of the sending host that has received a request to
   transmit a multicast IP datagram sends a multicast IP datagram in the
   following procedure:

   (1) The ATM address is resolved from the IP address of an ATM
       multicast router in the following procedure:

       (a) The ATM address is resolved from the IP address by accessing
           to the ATMARP server according to RFC 1577.

   (2) When a VCC for data transfer has not been set with an ATM
       multicast router, a VCC for data transfer will be set
       between the sending host and the ATM multicast router using
       the  ATM address of the ATM multicast router.

   (3) A multicast IP datagram is sent using the VCC for data transfer.

   If the sending host is also an ATM multicast router, it omits the above
   procedure and executes the following:

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


   The operation of the IP module of the ATM multicast router that has
   received a multicast IP datagram from a sending host or a request
   to transmit a multicast IP datagram from an upper-layer protocol
   module is as follows:

   (1) The IP module retrieves the conversion table of the destination
       address of the multicast IP datagram (that is, the class D address
       that identifies the host group) and the VCC for data transfer,
       in order to check whether the VCC for data transfer that transfer
       the received multicast IP datagram has been set up.

   (2)  If the VCC for data transfer has been set up, the multicast IP
        datagram will be sent by using the VCC. If the VCC for data
        transfer has not been set up, the multicast IP datagram will be
        discarded.

        NOTE: When there are more than one VCCs for the transfer of the
              multicast IP datagram, the multicast IP datagram will be
              sent to each of them.

   The multicast IP datagram will be locally looped back only when the
   sending host is an ATM multicast router and a receiving host at the
   same time.

   NOTE: When the sending host is also a receiving host but not an ATM
         multicast router, the multicast IP datagram will not be
         locally looped back. Instead, the transmitted multicast IP
         datagram is received from the ATM multicast router.

   In addition, when the ATM multicast router also has an existing
   multicast router function (e.g. by implementing RFC 1075), it may
   send a multicast IP datagram to existing IP multicast networks,
   according to the specification for routing of multicast IP
   datagrams (e.g. RFC 1075).

   NOTE: The specification of interworking with existing IP multicast
         networks is out of the scope of this memo.

7. Reception Procedures of Multicast IP Datagrams

   The reception procedures of multicast IP datagrams are the same as
   in unicast IP datagrams from the point of view of the upper-layer
   protocol module. Selection of the upper layer protocol is based on
   the protocol field in the IP header, regardless of the IP destination
   address. However, before any multicast IP datagrams are received,
   an upper-layer protocol must notify the IP module that it will join
   the host group. Thus, the IP service interface must be extended to
   provide two operations:

   - JoinHostGroup (group-address, ATM interface)
   - LeaveHostGroup (group-address, ATM interface)


Ishikawa                     Expires January 1998               [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


   The JoinHostGroup operation requests that this host becomes a member
   of the host group identified by the group-address on the ATM
   interface. More than one high layer protocols may request to become
   members of the same host group. The LeaveHostGroup operation requests
   that this host give up its membership in the host group identified by
   the group-address on the ATM interface.

   Both operations should return immediately (i.e., they are non-blocking
   operations), indicating success or failure. They may fail due to an
   invalid group-address or ATM interface. The JoinHostGroup operation
   may fail due to lack of local or remote resources. The LeaveHostGroup
   operation fails when the receiving host does not belong to the host
   group identified by the given group-address on the ATM interface.

   The IP module of the receiving host should keep the list of host groups
   on each ATM interface to support the reception of multicast IP
   datagrams. When a received multicast IP datagram has a destination
   address that is not registered in the list of host groups, it will be
   discarded. When a eceived multicast IP datagram has a class D IP
   address identifies the host group as the source IP address, it will be
   discarded. In this case, an ICMP error message will not be generated
   as a response.

   The list of host groups is updated in response to JoinHostGroup and
   LeaveHostGroup requests from upper-layer protocol modules. Each host
   group has a counter mechanism to handle multiple requests to join and
   leave the same group. The value of the counter increases by one when
   a JoinHostGroup request is received and decreases by one when a
   LeaveHostGroup request is received. When the value of the counter
   becomes zero, the host group will be deleted from the list.

   The operation of the IP module that has received a JoinHostGroup
   request is as follows:

   (1) The IP module will increase the value of the counter by one and
       end the operation if the host group that is identified by the
       group-address already exists in the list.

   (2) The operation in the case where the host group that is identified
       by the group-address does not exist in the list is as follows:

   (3) When a VCC for control is not set up with the ATM multicast
       router, the IP module will set up a VCC for control between the
       receiving host and the ATM multicast router  by using the ATM
       address of the ATM multicast router.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


       NOTE: The resolution procedure of the IP address of the ATM
             multicast router into its ATM address is the same as the
             the procedure specified in section 6.

   (4) The IP module sends a Join message of the IGMP-ATM specified in
       section 8 using the VCC for control.

   (5) The IP module adds the host group that is identified by the
       group-address to the list and sets the value of the counter to 1.

   The operation of the IP module that has received a LeaveHostGroup
   request is as follows:

   (1) The IP module decreases the value of the counter of the host
       group that is identified by the group-address by one. If the value
       of the counter is one or larger, the operation ends here.

   (2) The operation in the case where the value of the counter becomes 0
       is as follows:

   (3) The IP module sends a Host Membership Leave message of the
       IGMP-ATM specified in section 8 using the VCC for control.

   (4) It deletes the host group that is identified by the group-address
       from the list.

   (5) When the number of members included in the list becomes zero, the
       VCC for control may be released.

       NOTE: Whether the VCC for control should be released or not shall
             be locally determined by the receiving host.

   The ATM multicast router manages the list of the IP addresses of the
   hosts joined in the host group for each host group.

   The operation of the ATM multicast router that has received a Join
   message of the IGMP-ATM is as follows:

   (1) The ATM multicast router retrieves the conversion table of the
       group-address (i.e. the class D IP address that identifies the
       host group) and the VCC for data transfer, in order to check
       whether the VCC for data transfer corresponding to the received
       group-address exists

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


   (2)  If the VCC for data transfer exists, the ATM multicast router
        adds the receiving host as a leaf of the VCC for data transfer
        by using the ADD PARTY/ADD PARTY ACK procedure. It also adds
        the IP address of the receiving host to the list of the IP
        addresses of the hosts that have joined the host group identified
        by the received group address.

        NOTE: It may set up a new VCC for data transfer for such reasons
              as the QOS control.

   (3) If the VCC for data transfer does not exist, the ATM multicast
       router sets up a VCC for data transfer between the ATM multicast
       router and the receiving host by using the ATM address of the
       receiving host.

       NOTE: The VCC shall be a point-to-multipoint connection.

   (4) If the setup of the VCC for data transfer succeeds, the ATM
       multicast router sends a Join Ack message of the IGMP-ATM to the
       receiving host and adds the relation of the group address with
       the VCC for data transfer to the conversion table. It creates a
       list of the IP addresses of the hosts that have joined the host
       group and adds the IP address of the receiving host to it.

   (5)  If the setup of the VCC for data transfer fails due to some
        reason (e.g. lack of resources etc.), the ATM multicast router
        sends a Join Nak message of the IGMP-ATM to the receiving host.

   The operation of the ATM multicast router that has received a Host
   Membership Leave message of the IGMP-ATM is as follows:

   (1) The ATM multicast router deletes the leaf to the receiving host
       from the VCC for data transfer that is set up for the received
       group address, by using the DROP PARTY/DROP PARTY ACK
       procedure.

   (2) The ATM multicast router deletes the IP address of the
       receiving host from the list of the IP addresses of the hosts
       that have joined the host group identified by the received
       group-address.

   (3) If the number of members in the list becomes zero as a result,
       the ATM multicast router deletes the list and releases the VCC
       for data transfer. It also deletes the the relation of the
       group-address with the VCC for data transfer from the conversion
       table.

       NOTE: The above is the operation in the case where all leaves are
             deleted from the VCC for data transfer.

8. Protocol Specification (IGMP-ATM)

   The protocol (IGMP-ATM) used for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS using
   the ATM multicast router is described below.  IGMP-ATM is a protocol
   for IP multicasting over ATM MLIS, based on IGMP specified in RFC
   1112 and hence compatible with IGMP.

   IGMP-ATM is used between receiving hosts and ATM multicast routers.
   Therefore, Level 2 hosts and ATM multicast routers must implement
   IGMP-ATM. IGMP-ATM messages are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with an
   IP protocol number of 2 as in IGMP.

8.1 Format of IGMP-ATM Messages

   The format of IGMP-ATM messages is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Version| Type  |  Unused       |     Checksum                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Group    Address                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Reason       |              Unused                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   (1) Version

       The version of this specification shall be ?.

   (2) Type

       The types of IGMP-ATM messages are as follows:

       2= Host Membership Join
       3= Join Ack
       4= Join Nak
       5= Host Membership Leave

       NOTE: The Host Membership Join (2) is called the Host Membership
             Report (2) in IGMP specified in RFC 1112.

   (3) Unused

       Unused field, zeroed when sent, ignored when received.

   (4) Checksum

       The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's
       complement sum of the IGMP-ATM message. For computing
       the checksum, the checksum field is zeroed.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IP Multicast over ATM using MRouters         July, 1997


   (5) Group Address

       In the case of Host Membership Join (2), the address of the host
       group requesting the receiving host to join will be set. In the
       case of Join Ack (3) and Join Nak (4), the address of the host
       group requested to join by the receiving host will be set. In the
       case of Host Membership Leave (5), the address of the host group
       requesting the receiving host to leave will be set.

   (6) Reason

       The reason why joining a host group has failed. This field
       (including unused) exists in the case of Join Nak (4) only.

       1= Not specified
       2= Lack of resources at the ATM multicast router
       3= Data of this group-address not received at the ATM multicast
          router
       4= Authentication of the receiving host has failed.

       NOTE: Other values may be defined in future.

   (7) Options

       The following optional parameters may be set following the
       fixed parameters described above. The format of the optional
       parameters is as follows:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Option1  |  Option2  |  ...                    | Padding |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Thus, padding is added in the end, in order to complete them
       in 32-bit boundary. The value of padding is zero.

       The format of each optional parameter is as follows:

       The following optional parameters are specified in this memo.

       (a) Authentication

           This parameter is used to authenticate receiving hosts
           and users on them. This parameter can only be used in
           the case of Host Membership Join (2).

           Option Type: 1

           The format of the option data is as follows:

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |  Authentication Type  |  Authentication Data          |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           Authentication Type:  An 8-bit identifier of the type of
                                 authentication
           Authentication Data:  Data specific to each authentication
                                 type with variable length

           NOTE:  The definition of specific authentication types
                  is for further study.

8.2 Operation of the Protocol

   The IP module of the receiving host that has received a
   JoinHostGroup request transmits a Join message to the ATM multicast
   router. The IP address of the ATM multicast router is set in the IP
   destination address. The address of the host group which the
   receiving host requests to join is set in the Group Address
   field of the Join message.

   The ATM multicast router that has received a Join message sends a
   Join Ack message to the receiving host that has transmitted the
   Join message, if it succeeds to set up a VCC for data transfer.
   It sends a Join Nak message to the receiving host, if it  fails to
   set up a VCC for data transfer. The IP address of the receiving
   host that has transmitted the Join message is set in the IP
   destination address field. The same value as that of the Group
   Address field in the received Join message is set in the Group
   Address field of the Join Ack/Join Nak message. The reason why the
   setting of the VCC for data transfer has failed is set in the
   Reason field of the Join Nak message.

   The ATM multicast router fails to set up a VCC for data transfer
   in the following cases:

   - The ATM multicast router could not get enough resources necessary
     to set up a VCC for data transfer
   - The ATM multicast router could not receive the data toward the
     designated group address.
   - Authentication of the receiving host failed.
     etc

   The IP module of the receiving host that has received a
   LeaveHostGroup request sends a Host Membership Leave message to the
   ATM multicast router. The IP address of the ATM multicast router is
   set in its IP destination address field. The address of the host group
   which the receiving host requests to leave is set in the Group Address
   field of the Host Membership Leave message.

   When invalid IGMP-ATM messages as shown below are received, they will
   be discarded:

   - IGMP-ATM messages with invalid fields
   - IGMP-ATM messages received in invalid conditions

9. Security Considerations

   The authentication parameter is added to the Host Membership Join
   message, so that unauthorized receiving hosts can not join the host
   group.

   However, the definition of the format of the authentication
   parameter for the specific authentication mechanism is for
   further study.

Appendix 1: Differences between IGMP and IGMP-ATM

   This appendix describes major differences between IGMP and IGMP-ATM.

   (1) Sending and receiving of IP multicast datagrams via an ATM
       multicast router

       Since IGMP is designed assuming that shared media LANs such as
       Ethernet is usually used, a receiving host receives IP multicast
       datagrams directly from a sending host on the same local network.

       A sending host sends IP multicast datagrams to receiving hosts
       via an ATM multicast router in IGMP-ATM, even if receiving hosts
       reside on the same MLIS as the sending host. IGMP-ATM does not
       support the multicast VC mesh, because the multicast VC mesh
       lacks the scalability.

   (2) Hard state approach vs Soft state approach

       Since IGMP adopts the soft state approach, a multicast router
       sends Host Membership Query messages periodically using the
       all-hosts group (address 224.0.0.1), to discover which host
       groups have members on its  attached local network.

       Since ATM is a connection oriented network, IGMP-ATM adopts the
       hard state approach. IGMP-ATM does not send Host Membership
       Query messages. Instead, IGMP-ATM manages receiving hosts on
       the attached ATM network, based on the reception of Host
       Membership Join messages and Host Membership Leave messages
       from receiving hosts.

   (3) Authentication of receiving hosts

       IGMP does not provide any security functions. IGMP-ATM defines
       the authentication parameter as an option parameter of the
       Host Membership Join message, so that unauthorized receiving
       hosts can not join the host group.
