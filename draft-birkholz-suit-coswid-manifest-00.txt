       A SUIT Manifest Extension for Concise Software Identifiers
                 draft-birkholz-suit-coswid-manifest-00

Abstract

   This document defines a resource extension for Concise Software
   Identifiers (CoSWID) that represents a SUIT firmware manifest.  This
   extension combines the information elements of the SUIT information
   model with the semantic expressiveness of Software Identifiers.  In
   consequence, this composite enables the integration of Firmware
   Updates for the Internet of Things (SUIT) in existing work-flows for
   updates of software components in general.

1.  Introduction

   Firmware updates are quite similar to software update of applications
   - composites of software components - for example, servers or user-
   devices.  Attributes and semantic dependencies as defined by Concise
   Software Identifies [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] are equivalent.  In
   contrast, location and target definitions as well as the
   characteristics that are specific to an update campaign of a SUIT
   require a specific set of addiction information elements.  The
   semantics regarding SUIT specific information elements are defined by
   the SUIT Information Model [I-D.ietf-suit-information-model].
   Correspondingly, the CoSWID extension defined in this document uses
   CDDL extension points to add SUIT information elements to the
   standard Concise Software Identifiers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  SUIT Manifest Extension

   The following CDDL data definition is intended to be used as an
   extension to the CoSWID CDDL data definition.  Corresponding terms,
   such as Resources, Processors and Targets of input nodes and output
   nodes are covered by the SUIT Information Model and Architecture
   [I-D.ietf-suit-architecture].

3.  SUIT Manifest Resource Data Definition

4.  Future Updates

   This draft is intended to incorporate the extension registry that
   will be defined by Concise Software Identifiers.  Until then, a
   consecutive numbering system in alignment to the labels used in
   Concise Software Identifiers is applied.
