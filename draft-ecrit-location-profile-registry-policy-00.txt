           Changing the LoST Location Profile Registry Policy
            draft-ecrit-location-profile-registry-policy-00

Abstract

   This document changes the policy of the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) Location Profile registry established by RFC5222
   from Standards Action to Specification Required.  This allows
   standards development organizations (SDOs) other than the IETF to add
   new values.

1.  Document Scope

   This document changes the policy of the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) Location Profile registry [reg] established by
   [RFC5222] from Standards Action to Specification Required (as defined
   in [RFC5226]).  This allows standards development organizations
   (SDOs) other than the IETF to add new values.

2.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol, LoST [RFC5222] uses a
   location profile when conveying location (e.g., in a mapping request
   and a service boundary result).  [RFC5222] established an IANA
   registry of location profiles [reg], with a registry policy of
   Standards Action.  This requires a standards-track RFC for any new
   registry values.  The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) is
   an SDO that makes significant use of LoST in its emergency call
   specifications (e.g., [NENA-i3]) and has identified a need for
   additional location profiles.  This document changes the registry
   policy to Specification Required, allowing other SDOs such as NENA to
   add values.

3.  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are identified by this change in
   registry policy.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the policy of the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) Location Profile Registry (established by
   [RFC5222]) to Specification Required.  The expert reviewer is Brian
   Rosen or a successor designated by the Applications and Real-Time

   and unambiguous definition for any new value.
