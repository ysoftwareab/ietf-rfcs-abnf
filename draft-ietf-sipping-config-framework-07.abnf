Profile-type   = "profile-type" EQUAL profile-value
profile-value  = profile-types / token
profile-types  = "device" / "user" / "application" / "local-network"

      The "device", "user", "application" or "local-network" token in
      the profile-type parameter may represent a class or set of profile
      properties.  As standards are defined for specific profile
      contents related to the user, device or local network, it may be
      desirable to define additional tokens for the profile-type
      parameter.  Also additional content types may be defined along
      with the profile formats that can be used in the Accept header of
      the SUBSCRIBE to filter or indicate what data sets of the profile
      are desired.
