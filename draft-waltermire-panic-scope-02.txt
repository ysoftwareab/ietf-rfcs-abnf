1.  Introduction

   Network operators need to know what is connected to their
   organization's networks so that they can properly manage those
   network elements.  Managing these network elements, consisting of
   physical and virtual network infrastructure devices, requires access
   to information pertaining to these endpoint devices, including
   endpoint identity, the identity of software installed on the
   endpoint, and the configuration settings for the installed software.
   This information can be collected from different classes of endpoints
   over different protocols and using different data models.  PANIC will
   identify a standardized solution to collect posture information for
   network devices, and allow that information to be shared with
   authorized users and devices on the network supporting security
   automation.  PANIC aims to reuse available standards for posture
   assessment where possible.  In particular, PANIC will leverage
   NETCONF [RFC6241]", extending the YANG [RFC6020] data model as
   necessary to meet PANIC requirements.  The PANIC effort will avoid
   redefining information exchange technologies for use cases that have
   already been defined.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Components

   The solution will consist of the following components:

   Network Device:  Endpoints such as routers, switches, firewalls.
      Virtualized network functions are currently considered in scope.

   Posture Server:  Collects information from the network device.
      Receives information via pushes, and requests information via
      pulls.

   Data Repository:  Stores the information collected by the posture
      server from the network device.

4.  PANIC Solution Requirements

   The solution will meet the following requirements:

   Information Requirements for Network Device Management:  PANIC will
      identify a minimal set of information necessary to manage network
      devices and to support network security functions including
      configuration and vulnerability management.  Additional
      information may also be used through extension mechanisms
      identified by PANIC.

   Authorized Posture Server Discovery:  Network devices will be able to
      identify the posture servers with which they are authorized to
      communicate.  PANIC will identify requirements in support of a
      Posture Server discovery capability.

   Data Push Functionality:  Network devices will push information to an
      authorized Posture Server.  Data pushes will be event driven.
      PANIC will identify what data should be pushed from the network
      device, and what events will trigger a push.  Data pushes from
      Posture Server to Network Device (for example, pushing new
      configurations to a network device) are out of scope for PANIC.

   Data Pull Functionality:  A Posture Server will pull information from
      a network device.  Data pulls will be driven by requests to the
      server.  PANIC will identify what data should be pulled from the

      network device, and how requests for the server to pull will be
      made.

   Secure Transport of Data:  Data between the network device and the
      Posture Server will be protected in transit by a protocol that
      provides authorization and authentication.  PANIC will identify
      the protocols that can be used for transport of posture
      information.

   Secure Storage of Data:  Network device data reported to a posture
      server will be stored in a data repository.  This data can be used
      to support numerous security functions on the network; therefore,
      this repository should be accessible by (and only by) authorized
      users and devices.  PANIC will identify requirements for a
      centralized data repository, including requirements for a secure
      interface between between a Posture Server and a Data Repository.

   Standardized Data Model:  Network device data will be expressed in a
      standardized data model that enables use and reuse of the data.
      PANIC will identify available data models for the expression of
      required information and the models used for a given exchange of
      posture.

   Note: Use of [RFC2119] text is omitted at this point.  More
   discussion is needed around these requirements.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   The solution described by this document provides a mechanism to
   gather network device posture into a centralized datastore.
   Discussion is needed here about:

      The need to protect such an information collection from
      unauthorized access or disclosure

      Privacy considerations around how the endpoint devices is
      identified when posture is gathered

      The threat introduced to the network elements by the posture
      information collection.  There should be protections implemented
      to prevent the element from being vulnerable to DoS attacks by
      frequent polling or pushing of posture data.
